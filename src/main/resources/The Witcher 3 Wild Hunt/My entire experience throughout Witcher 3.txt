[[My entire experience throughout Witcher 3]]





Spamming the button to loot their stuff and accidentally lighting/extinguishing a candle 5 times
    I just started my first playthrough. Man, fuck them candles.
        if you're going to use one button to do multiple things... then don't put candles near a fast travel point lol. Yeah no, I just got off Roach, walked over to this fast travel point so I could extinguish the candle... that is what I wanted.

edit: also worth noting for anyone's first play through, there is a known bug for in the Last Wish quest were if you don't turn off "enemy upscaling" it is impossible (like you do no damage to the enemy impossible).  Hopefully this was fixed with the new update, but if not that is how you kill the Djinn lol.
            And the candles right in front of innkeeps. Ugh.
            Oh snap that djinn is where one of my saves was stuck. Tried everything thrice lol. Thanks fam
                I spent so much time trying to defeat it, only to eventually just google how to kill it and realized it was a glitch.  It is kind of mind boggling how a game breaking glitch like that could go so long without a patch lol.
                    Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
                        Easy work around. Don't die.
                            Easier said than done.
            No way.

That was a glitch? I'm pissed. I stopped my first playthrough because of that enemy.

I'm on my second playthrough now and I'm enjoying it much more. I've been paying attention to lore much more. Setting the combat to highest difficulty made it better too.
                Highest difficulty is for sure the best. I had played this game up to the werewolf quest on normal, stopped. Picked it up a year later started over on deathmarch and felt like a real Witcher. 

You have to know your enemy, prepare oils and bombs specifically for the enemy or you will probably lose. Where as the other difficulties you can just swing your sword to victory, which is fine I won't talk down to anyone who enjoys a single player game their own way effecting noone but themselves. But I just didn't feel like a Witcher, I could've been any generic action hero.
                    man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
                I spent like over an hour trying to kill it, once i turned off enemy upscaling it was dead in like 2 seconds lol.
            Same thing with rat enemies in the game. If you set enemy upscaling on, enemies like rats and wolves will do big damage and have a lot of health
            The game is designed to be played at a slower pace, doing things with intention and consideration.  Hunts take thought and preparation more than raw combat.  The joy is in the immersion. 

We all get caught spamming through occasionally but it's not a design flaw to coerce you to be more deliberate
        My semi OCD brain forcing me to light every candle I find in the game.
            It's also a nice way of keeping track of where you've been.

Candles are lit.  Oh, been this way already.

                Exactly how not to get lost in Minecraft too. Just make 500 torches and leave a trail! (Mostly underground)

                        I do the same, but on the left going in. Then I follow the "right way out."
                    I put all my torches on the right side so I know im making my way back if they're on my left.
                    Until you branch to often and you go in circles trying to get out.
                Just started my first play-through (now that the next gen patch is out) - are all candles by default unlit in the world? That's the only way that would make sense as a means of progress tracking
                    I don't remember all candles being unlit but within the kinds of places you explore I could see that being the case
                >Candles are lit.

Little Gondor calls for aid!
        There is a mod that it's already updated to the last version that only allows you to interact with candles when you have igni selected.
        Do they actually serve a purpose *anywhere* in the whole damn game?  I don't recall it ever being a useful ability.
        Oh buddy you've only begun to extinguish candles.
    I just started replaying, haven't played in a couple years. I was assuming I remembered wrong and there was no penalty for stealing because everywhere I went in White Orchard no one reacted when I looted their homes, but then I got to the Nilfgaard fort and got swarmed instantly because I was spamming the loot button.
    PC with looting mod was the best thing ever created. I literally want to loot everything, but all that clicking around was crazy, never got anywhere without wasting a ton of time.
    Trying to pick up anything in a Cyberpunk 2077 bathroom is even worse.
"All our town could scrape together were these 12 coins. I hope it's sufficient."

"No, no. You keep it. You clearly need it more than I do."

*Casually pokes through cupboards*

*Its filled with bags full of emerald, ruby, and diamond dust*

"The fuck?"

"..."
    It's all the coins they had, they have other trade goods but no coin.
        Liquid assets vs net worth
            "I'd pay you more but it's tied up in stocks"
                Tied up in rocks*
                    Tied up in glocks.

Bang, bang, bang, bang!
                *NFTs
            Are gemstones not considered liquid?
                No I think they're solids.
                    Everything is liquid on a sufficiently large timescale!

Well, fluid, but most people can't call you out on the difference off the top of their head.
                        Of course! Liquid is cash and fluid are the regulations governing wall street... Who doesn't know that?
            Lemmie... Liquidize these here assets for you
        Yeah, who uses cash today?
    *Casually proceeds haggling for 2 extra coins from the farmer in white orchard whos daughter is dying.
        Correct me if I’m wrong but I think you can only ever get one extra coin out of him. I just find it funny that I even bother haggling when I end up telling him to keep it for her dowry anyway
            Can get at least 2. First time playing, I countered his 20 with 24, he rebuffed and then accepted a second offer of 22 

And in retrospect I have no problem exploiting the farmer given his frugality when his daughter’s literal life is at stake
    Being dishonest like that, they *deserve* a good looting
    Was Gaetan justified or nah?
        For killing those that attempted to murder him? Yes.

For killing everyone else? No, but I let him go anyway.

I remember there was a ghost in the well contract in white orchard that you normally do in the beginning, iirc if you refuse to take the coin(which was around 20 crowns I think) after doing the contract the guy will give you an amethyst which you can hold on and then sell it later in other areas for a much higher price.
    This is one of the worst tropes. "turn down reward to get even bigger reward"
        I know it's different, but have to point out this trope directly effects the end of the game
            Wait what?  I don't remember this?
                Turning down the money from Emhyr when you bring back Ciri affects Ciri's outcome.
                    It wasn't even a lot of money either
                        It was like 1000 crowns.
                            Bruh that grandmaster armor won't pay for itself.
                                Bitch, you could spend 15 minutes in skellige farming swords for more than this.

                                    I cleared every single Smuggler Cache in Skelliger. Coin for days. Took a long damn time though.
                    I was so mad when I learned this after my first playthrough. When I reached that part I didn't want to take the money but I was super short on coin. I wish there was a "take the money and call him an ass" option
                        Personally, I played it as a Witcher always gets paid. I'm not going to fleece you but this is dangerous shit. 

Why else would i still do it if there was no gain? Not like you people are so nice and accepting to me. 

So it hurt when that's held against me. I was like witchers must always take payment circi! You know the code!
                            That was my first run, a true Witcher, fuck around with me and you die. Pay what's due. I'll look the other way if you hand over coin.

This new run I'm trying to be more human, still very humiliating letting people spit on me and not doing something. 🥲
                                You first paragraph doesn't really describe Geralt to me, at all. Have you read the books?
                                    Geralt is my favorite Witcher but tbf he isn't standard. The rest of them feel a lot closer to OP's playthrough.
                Doesn't directly change the ending but accepting coin from Emhyr is part of deciding what ending you get.
        Changes the way ciri dealt with late game lmfaooo
        A related, but better, trope is when you get more abstract rewards, such as a small boost to reputation/karma. Alternatively, perhaps if you abstain from taking a reward from a shopkeeper, his shop grows better and he gives a slight discount down the line with a better selection. 

Then again, I could see a game that uses a "good" playthrough as a voluntary hardmode.
        yeah lol, I'm not sure if there are others but that's the one I noticed immediately while selling some extra gems.
    Idk if he gives it to you I think it's just in his house and you can take it
That's how I decided to kill the old cannibal couple.  There was so much valuable stuff just lying around their village that they obviously weren't so broke and desperate that they needed to eat a halfling.
    Wait where is the cannibal couple? I don’t think I’ve found that quest in 2 playthroughs
        I'm pretty sure it's added with the Hearts of Stone DLC, maybe you don't have it.
            I played that one the least, I love blood and wine though
                The Hearts of Stone story was amazing and I would highly recommend finishing it if you ever get the time to.
                    It does take a bit of persistence though. I remember thinking “Ugh, Oxenfurt? Again?” 


Obviously by the end I was fully engrossed in the story but at the beginning I was unimpressed
                        I was only like that during the wedding portion where Geralt is possessed. That felt like it was taking forever for me.
                            But, but that whole wedding portion was so great and memorable..

                        Could you imagine if Zelda was a girl? Totally unladylike to walk into strangers homes and break their pots.
                            Zelda… is a girl?
                                Nah they are talking about the MC from legend of zelda. cause you caan break pots etc in most games.  its known as "doing a zelda" usually
                    I never did Hearts of Stone quests just because every time you go there big stuff pops up on your screen saying you’re in the DLC area (don’t remember the wording it’s been years), and that broke my immersion enough that it just wasn’t worth going there. Only DLC I did was collecting the extra gwent cards because I’m an addict 😂
                The halfing herbalist northeast of Oxenfurt gives it to you although I think you have to finish the second wish in Hearts of Stone first.

I think Hearts of Stone had the better story of the DLC's, I think it's the best 10 or so hours of story in the game. Blood and Wine is better overall though, it still has a good story but adds so much more content.
                    Touissant as a whole took the game to new heights. So much content and such a beautiful place.
                        I think part of it is how unique it is. Hearts of Stone had a great story and arguably the best villain in the game but it took place in a new area of an existing map so it didn't feel that unique. Toussaint is very different from everywhere else in the game and it's a nice change.
                            I don't know, the three witches of the wood and their whole questline is amazing
                                It is an amazing quest but Hearts of Stone and Gaunter O'Dimm are better to me.
                                The witches of the wood are just so creepy.  Gave me shivers on my first play though, not just because they were scary monsters but the narrative.
                                    It started out great and ended really silly when you actually fight them. In their bio it says they are ancient beings that existed before the conjunction of spheres and they were Godlike during their quest. But when you actually have to fight them they run around and try to slap you. And they are subservient to the Wild Hunt leaders when they're just elves from another dimension. I always thought the 3 witches shouldn't appear again after the initial quest.
                                I liked them both but I love stories involving the three crones/fates or Gaunter O'Dimm/ the devil.
                            Its basicly the witcher in france.
                Dude I saw Blood&Wine play at the House of Blues, he's dope
        You need to have the Hearts of Stone expansion. You can get the quest from a contract off of Brunwich's notice board
    Sometimes it isn't about money, its about pleasure. Have you ever tried Halfling flesh? It is remarkably delicious... But no they were truly starving. In the quest if you spared the couple and lied to Otto, you'll see the husband grieving for his wife who died of hunger.

                Sir, you haven't seen me on death march looting all the food and liquor.
        What about their legs? They don't need those. Just a bit off the flank.

A) what a menu is

B) what a menu is in the context of food

C) that some items may be temporarily unavailable due to shortages


This can only mean one thing. Orc Restaurants. Orc restaurants with a varied menu.
                    More like they weren't speaking english, and Black Speach has a word that basically means "things that are available for us to eat," which we translate to menu... but I'll go be fun at parties somewhere else.
                        Except that the only reference that we have to the conversation would have been told to Frodo by Merry and Pippin, even in the MCU (Middlearth Cinematic Universe [TIHI]) so it must have been in a language the breakfast club could understand.

        That obviously means that once you've tried Halfling flesh, you'd rather starve to death than consume lesser foods.

            Hard disagree 
Geralt always wanted to be a Hero, him taking jobs from people only to turn down payment when he realizes they are literally eating tree bark to avoid starvation is on brand.
Like the guy at Crows Perch who sends you to hunt the shrieker, who takes in the young son of the hunter who got torn to shreds, I think that was the first time I used the refuse payment option. 
Just like it's also on brand for him to demand extra from nobles and merchants getting rich of the war, since he's the one killing all the damn necrophages.
                Yeah, this is how I played Geralt. I would bargain for the most coin. Then refuse payment at the end of the quest. It’s not about the gold. It’s about the principle. You respect my profession so you’ll pay me all that you have. But I will refuse it based on my principles. I have enough gold from looting all the dead and the living rich.
            I disagree. I like that they’re there, and I like that they have either no or nearly no actual gameplay impact. It’s just a choice I make for myself as I’m going through the world. Even if I never exercise the choice, I can’t make any choice unless a choice is there to be made.
                [deleted]
                    To be fair, Geralt did that once and then spent a very long time avoiding the actual "payment".
            Are you saying that because you always keep it or never keep it?
    Are you implying that if there were financial justification for eating a halfling, you'd be ok with it? Lol
        Well, I don't think their village qualifies for Food Stamps.

And I read that book about that plane that crashed in the Andes.  Sometimes, you just gotta do what you gotta do to survive.

I did this in Red Dead Redemption 2..

Just wanted the treasure. Father of the house tried to shoot me so I killed him. Kid was in the house too and wasn't gonna leave him to fend for himself fatherless and treasureless so I unalived him too.
    I forget the name of the game, but there was a post-apocalyptic indie game set in an American city for the 360. Somebody helps patch you up, and you have the option to - of course - loot their home. If you do, they say something along the lines of, "I gave you everything I could afford to spare to help you, and you're taking the rest? You're a monster." It genuinely made me feel really guilty about it, and it changed the way I play RPGs.

Edit: I think it was I Am Alive.

    I loot all the bodies before I advance the missions. This leads to the npcs yelling at me constantly.
        Which is so fucking obnoxious by the way
            **C'MON ARTHUR**
                Every 5 seconds

"OVER HERE ARTHUR." "WE GOTTA GO ARTHUR" "WHY ARE YOU WAITING ARTHUR LETS GO"
        I honestly just gave up looting the bodies. You get so much money just by doing the missions it wasn't worth the time
            You're right because I'm not even that far in and have thousands. Yet I have a hard time stopping maybe its because Dutch keeps telling me "we just need more money!"
                Half the problem is so many people rush you and there are times where you will literally fail missions by trying to loop bodies instead of continuing on to the mission.
            It's only recently I've been able to play an RPG without looting everything. Of course it helped that I made a melee build so taking four sniper rifles was even less pointless.
        One NPC is Skyrim yells at you if you loot her body.
            Thought it was just the armor. Don't think she objects to you taking stuff if you don't strip the corpse. But she's hard to hear sometimes so im not sure.
    I killed that father then came back the next day.

Dude had bandages on his head and was screaming about "its you, why'd you come back?!" like shit man... I didn't think you would remember me blasting your skull into pieces with my sawed off... My b. I left them alone that time.
        The courier always remembers.
            The game was rigged from the start
    If you left the son alive, he will still be living there in the epilogue with John.  Just like his dad, he will drinking his life away.
        So really it was a kindness.. right?
            Right
    Duuude this house messed with me. I did the same exact thing but only shot the father and the kid just sits there crying next to his dad's headless body. I mean, I was *trying* to play as a somewhat decent outlaw.

Sorry kid
But I need 50lbs of old rope.
Take their children's dolls, tear them apart into scrap cloth and wood.

*It's about sending a message*
    In Fallout 3, I'd make special trips out to the Republic of Dave to leave toys and books for the kids.
"Keep the reward" options were the dumbest thing in the game tbh.

Everyone who has read Witcher knows that it's out-of-character
    On a similar note, I enjoyed the negotiation mechanic because *that* felt like something Geralt would actually do.
        Absolutely, that one was great
        Is there a trick to finding a good starting point for negotiations or is it random?
            I don't think it's random but it's a set amount for each encounter. I tend to go about 3/4 of the way up and go from there
            Go ham if they are Rich/noble, go 3/4 to start if they aren’t.
                That's what I usually do, but I've met some stingy noblemen.
        The idea of it is sound but it was implemented absolutely horrendously.
    Is it really? I haven't read very far but Geralt killed the kikimora in The Last Wish before even knowing if there was a contract (there was not). 

Geralt refuses payment from Calanthe and Pavetta/ Duny, only claiming the law of surprise when they insist. 

I don't think it's too far fetched for Geralt to decline payment, especially if he's in a position that he doesn't really *need* it. 

The books and games make it very clear Geralt is not like other Witchers and bends or outright breaks his code when it suits him. He puts up this front of being this cold, calculated killer but he's still human with emotions like everyone else.
        He killed the kikimora because he assumed people were disappearing there, and he demanded payment from the village elder who told him there's no payment because nobody has even thought it's there, despite people disappearing there. Then he tried to sell the cadaver to a wizard. He certainly didn't do it as a goodwill gesture.

I don't want so spoil you but there's no Witcher code and all witchers have emotions, it's just stuff they say to preserve a professional facade
            Yeah that was kind of my point, Geralt's code is made up so there's nothing obligating him to take payment. He hides behind it when it's convenient. 

I also saw something about him saving some merchant or something on a bridge in time or contempt and nearly dying himself, without being paid to do so? 

I'm sure there are other examples if I read them all but that's all I know of at this time. There's also the simple fact that the games are different writers so it's natural his characterization might be a little different. You can just chalk that up to time and maybe his amnesia changing his views or if simply being a different universe entirely. ¯⁠\⁠\_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

Either way I don't think it's too far fetched to see Geralt, as we know him in Witcher 3, to decline payment.
        In the books he often struggles to find food.
        Tldr: chaotic neutral (by the 2nd ed.).
            Honestly I'd argue chaotic good. Geralt acts according to his own sense of morality, killing evil monsters and sparing good ones. He hides behind stereotypes and a made up code to not be taken advantage of in a world that despises non-humans, including mutants like Witchers. 

He fancied himself a hero when he first set out on the Path and tried to save someone only for her to scream in fear of him over the bloodshed. Even his most popular nickname, the Butcher of Blaviken, was the result of him refusing to stay neutral and getting involved without pay - or even in spite of pay. Stregebor offered to pay him for help with Renfri and he refused, if I remember correctly. 

He also turns down contracts to kill sentient, peaceful creatures like Dudu. 

I don't think Geralt would usually turn down pay when offered by those who can clearly afford it but the times it comes up in game are when people are in desperate need themselves. I don't know if there's a situation in the books where he takes pay knowing it would leave someone unable to feed themselves, so it's hard to say defectively, but I think there's certainly an argument both ways. Enough to justify including it.
    It's a game.
That choice was given to us, not because it was canon, because they figured the players would want that choice.
        The game starts with explaining that it’s like the Witcher code or something to always require payment
            It's also not the Witcher code to cold-blood murder Whoreson Junior just for being a piece of shit but I'm still glad they gave me that option.

            I am the Neravarine and I need these bowls to save the world!
                *the threads of fate have been severed* (I can’t remember if that’s the message you get when being too bad but it is at least similar!)
                    Back in the day when there was no such thing as an essential npc and you could doom them world.
                        If you wanna stock up on health potions and fortifying strength drinks and kill Vivec (an actual god), more power to you. It'll ruin the entire main story arc but you can do it, damnit.
        Yep, it's a game, not a movie.
        See, the games try very hard to portray the world as faithfully as possible, only to allow the player to do the exact opposite?
            yes.
                I guess you would be fine if they also allowed the player to run around with a lightsaber? Maybe Ciri brought one from another realm as a gift
                    Apples and oranges.
                        It's not, Geralt is an established character, not a random Witcher or a nameless Dragonborn
                            It must be a joy in and of itself to watch you froth at the mouth about any alternate history world in a videogame.
                            Ok ok cool. BUT it’s my play through and I want to make decisions based on what I want to do, just call me a really fucking good Doppler or something possessing Geralt idc. Doesn’t mean I don’t find the canonical story or Geralt interesting, just means that the second the player is given control the story is no longer focused on being canon. We’d basically have to avoid a huge amount of the game’s content if we just wanted to *be Geralt*
                            Geralt doesn't press the X button either, he doesn't even have a controller.
                            I agree. They should remove *all* of the choices from the game, almost every single one of them had an un-character like option.

                                I was upset about the show but not because of non-white actors.

First season was okay-ish, second was complete shitshow
                    You know what an adaptation is, yes?
                    Are you kidding?

I’d pay at least $5 for lightsaber DLC.
            Book Geralt never loses a 1v1 swordfight*, do you think the game should always let you win in duels regardless of how you play?

*Except..
            Geralt is on a quest to find his kidnapped daughter but spends like 90% of the game doing other things. By making the game open world instead of linear, the character becomes “out-of-character” by default unless you speed run the game
                Also, you start off as a bit of a bitch and have to progress in the story to be on par with canon geralt's skill in combat, magic, and knowledge of monsters.
            The thing about games is that generally entertainment is gained through player agency, especially in the likes of RPGS where it is the main element next to the world you're role playing in. Yes some of them have established characters that is the player character but then you'd leave those games from being RPGs to being action adventure games. Like Commander Shepherd isn't a vindictive asshole, Geralt isn't a bloodthirsty kleptomanic, the Lone Wanderer isn't able to distance themselves from just freaking out about having their child stolen and their spouse getting murdered... but you're given the absolute choice in what you want to do and how to achieve that
    I haven't read any books, just played witcher 3 and didn't take any rewards when anyone seemed desperate
        Thing is, just about everyone is desperate in Witcher universe.

Especially Geralt. Games make you feel like you're filthy rich, but in the books Witchers are often hungry and regularly in debt. It's a shitty job where people are more willing to stab him in the gut and rob him than to pay for a contract.
            It's easy to turn down money in game when you already have more money than you could ever spend from loot. Geralt was never in that situation in the books, like you said.
                At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.
                    This is a bot, stolen two comments just in this thread.

https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zlula7/my_entire_experience_throughout_witcher_3/j077ufm
                        There’s another one too.
                    Did you know that Zelder is a boy?
                    2 different 12 day old accounts posting this verbatim simultaneously?
            Yeah I remember the quest where I think the dude from cat school was stabbed with a pitchfork because the villagers couldn't pay him, still I may be playing as Geralt but I make decisions based on what I would do, any choice based game I play I shape the story on my choices instead of "what the main character would do" it was the same in witcher 3, in walking dead and even rdr2 i went the honorary route
                I was sympathetic to him until I learned that this isn't the first time he did this. Later I learned that this is a pretty typical trait of Cat school Witchers since they're less stable mutations process. Really can't spare the guy.
                    Yeah, unpaid bills =/= mass murder. Dude had to go.
            he actually gets quite a bit of money at one point in the books, funnily.
                And is known to have *excellent* credit. I love that Sapkowski, with a financial background before he started writing, took time in the books to explain how credit works in his universe.
            Are you actually complaining about the games for giving players the choice?

Jesus.
        That's not the Witcher way BOI
        Witchers don't work for free. Don't feel bad for the humans. You have more in common with monsters than you do them.
    It’s a role-playing-game people can make whatever decisions they please regardless of lore
    I haven't read the books, but do you mean that Geralt is an altruist who doesn't take any reward for what he does?
        No. He is adamant about taking money when being on contract, even if there are moral reasons not to take them. 

It's for several reasons such as:

* people are begging him to help but after he turns his back they spit on him, rob him or try to kill him
* he's dislikes religious/knightly orders because they kill monsters for free, which is very bad for business as people aren't willing to pay anymore. Also because they're amateurs
* the economy in books is really not in Geralt's favour, he has a lot of debts and he's basically a hobo who does job for supper most of the time
            Got it, i misread what you'd said earlier. That makes a lot more sense
        Part of the Witcher code is not offering your services for free.

I think Vesimir even brings it up fairly early in W3
            There is no actual Witcher code. In the books Geralt explicitly says he just uses the 'code' as an excuse when he doesn't feel like arguing or explaining something.
                Didn't know that, basically all my exposure to the Witcher comes from the games.
                    I'd recommend checking out the books if you are interested, they are a good read.
                    LPT:  Anyone that says "that's against regulations" is more or less doing the same thing.  Giving you a cheap excuse.
            Code doesn't exist but it's generally agreed upon. It kinda makes sense because that way the Witchers would just die out because hunger got em
            Ah okay, i misread what he said then.
    So far there are 3 comments that read exactly: "Keep the reward" options were the dumbest thing in the game tbh. 

This is any of: Bots, a person with multiple accounts, a line from someone popular on the internet that said exactly this and everyone stopped thinking for themselves, or just super lazy internet people who stopped thinking for themselves.

Either way it has lost all meaning.
        How dare people share the same opinion about a game deviating from an established character from a book series!  The must be bots!  There is no way nerd fanboys would nitpick details like this!
        it's bots. there was one popular comment with that line and then a couple bots repeated it in an effort to get karma. just report and move on.
Congrats, you have 3 broken ladders
Pay your witcher and pay them well, if you can't afford your witcher then your witcher will help himself. A witcher is a service, a job, one that is not only self employed but also has a high mortality rate. If you can't afford your witcher then you better pray your backwards king and his knights can help you.

Smh, you don't borrow money from the mob then get to complain when its time to pay. Go to the banks if you don't like it.
    I started reading this as a song and then got tongue tripped.
    The mob was actually pretty lenient, their whole deal was they wanted you to keep paying… forever, but still wanted you to be able to make your payments.

The trope of mob lenders breaking knees and whatnot is a myth because then their creditors couldn’t work. One mob enforcer said that if they had to do something physical a long cut on the fingers of the non dominant hand was one of the best options. Painful yes, uncomfortable for a while yes, but you could still go to work.
    Well, I don’t like this because the mobs and banks are both exploitative, and banks will say no to desperate people while the mob will exploit them. Banks are also racist
        Username checks out
            No idea what that means, or why my comment was downvoted.

Why the fuck is Reddit supporting the mob and banks now?
                Definitely what that means. The reddit hive mind has decided it likes the mob and banks. No other possibilities
Couldn't really loot an entire house. Always just a few items per location.  Skyrim, however,  that's where you could truly f them over. I hope elder scrolls 6 let's you steal furniture.
    It's a blast to do it in Kingdom Come : Deliverance, just clean out shops after hours.  Get caught? It's murdering time!
        Jesus Christ be praised
    Yea weird to use the Witcher for this meme. Most houses had absolute rubbish, the same old crap, nothing worth taking.
        Because the Witcher just got updated and is a hot topic
        Really? Most of the houses I looted had magic crafting materials at the very least. I frequently found that rainbow coloured rock in shacks that looked like a strong fart would knock them down.
    ... I'd be really happy if I could have a big house, then hire NPCs to help me cart some random person's couch to my big house.  

I want the mechanic of shock when the NPCs get arrested for breaking and entering.
    I loved the pic on the Skyrim sub of the guy who was collecting every wheel of cheese in the game and putting it in one house.
Let’s be honest here if the quest reward was good enough we wouldn’t loot their house
    Mmmh... nah we still would
    Probably my only complaint with what is basically a perfect game.

It's so fucking stingy with rewards and money.
        It's honestly better than the opposite, makes crafting worthwhile and finding good gear matter but I do get you. I just hate when games give me infinite money (ahem Skyrim) and it becomes meaningless before too long. I enjoy being a destitute scrub as well as a super badass I guess.
This was me when i first played Morrowind....probably 5th grade. Every house. Every house from Syda Need to Balmora....forks, pillows, plates, all of it 😈
    In the first Fable game, you can do one better and murder everyone in a town, buy up the houses for cheap and become the landlord for the next people who move in, giving you a steady income for the rest of the game.
        I totally forgot about doing that. I owned whole towns!
    Wait so you're telling me there are people who don't rob all the npcs blind.
    Yeah, this is just how you build up alchemy materials. 

Expeditions through nature to gather materials from specific regions? Yeah sure maybe

Repeated trips to all the alchemy shops close to fast travel points? Lol yeah of course

This makes me want an RPG where the NPCs actually have bills to pay and dynamic lives where you can absolutely destroy someone's life by stealing all their shit. 

There have been plenty of games that actually have been capable of this, like Ultima 7, the NPCs would adapt to you moving doors or use furniture you built, and they would go about their day doing different things. I don't think it would be that hard to have people actually lose their house and job and then slowly starve to death in the street or turn to crime to feed themselves. 

It would be very interesting to have that type of effect, but to actually expand it to a world, it would be a pretty processing intensive game, because the world would have to continue in places you weren't. And the economy would have to be modeled in real time. Like if you robbed all the gold out of an entire town, people would start bartering for food, and the value of gold locally would skyrocket. Crime would be crazy high.

Could be really cool.
    Perhaps someday we'll have an action RPG modeled on top of r/dwarffortress
Anyone else hate it when games just let you steal right in front of people? Really breaks immersion.
    Counterpoint, in Witcher 3 if you loot in front of soldiers they will attack you, but regular people don’t even say anything so yeah it’s a bit sad
        Yeah, like I'm gonna tell the huge guy with 2 swords on his back and the head of the monster that's been terrorising our whole town for generations strapped to his horse to stop.
            Playing unmodded skyrim would bug me. Like I'm the mother fucking dragon born, you were there when I saved the city. I found your long lost son. I'm sorry I touched your sweet roll instead of talking to you. Are you REALLY going to attack me over this?
                You don't just go barging into a Nord lady's house and grabbing their sweet rolls, what the heck is wrong with you!?
    You saying that if you hire a buff murderer and they come to collect, you would try and *stop them* if they try to take a bit more than agreed upon?

Like nah you aren't lol. Just be glad they don't throw you in the goodie sack too, never to be seen again.
        Not Witcher specific. For instance I was playing Dishonored 2 yesterday (which I love to death) and walked into a pub and started picking up coins off the counter and no one said a thing. 

I've seen some games where NPC's will make a comment about their hopelessness to stop you, which I think is even better. (not that I enjoy being reminded of my awful thievery)
    Meanwhile I'm hit with NPCS who want to kill me because I took a fork; this after I saved them all from being horribly murdered.
    You could just, not

This is short YouTube skit on this topic I saw awhile back. I think it’s pretty funny

https://youtu.be/AzXm1hQ1c8g
    loved this, hope they do more witcher stuff in the future.
        They have like 4 others on their channel, and some just general video game humor stuff. Maybe with the next gen update people will be making more Witcher related things
            Yes i know i watch almost all of there stuff, i'm sorry i wasnt explicit, I meant more seasons of witcher content.
                Oh gotcha and ya that’d be sweet
    Short skit, witcher, must be the playtech boys from Auckland.

Oh what do you know!
I always feel bad when I loot houses. But yet I still do it...
Meanwhile, Link is just a high key pottery terrorist.
I feel like it's part of the witcher code: refuse whatever paltry sum a villager has raised for you and instead loot their home. That's why they never bring it up.
When you think about it, it's weird that you can take whatever you want in front of its owners if you're inside a house. Yet hell will break loose if you even peruse at something in the presence of a guard.
WHERE'S ME FUCKIN RAKES
It'd it's not marked as "owned" then it's really marked as "mine"
i learned a new word today. destitute. good.
Just watch out for the tax man 🤣
Yet even the "poorest" peasent had random dimeritium ore lying around or whatever. I think they'll be fine.
Real gamer challenge: play through an RPG as a good guy, and actually don't do anything bad.
    *laughs in Fallout morality*
I would never, my guild forbids it! I have a diploma stating "Taxpayer in Good Standing" to prove it!
"I couldn't possibly accept.  But if you could just leave it on the table over there..."
Witchers don’t work for free
I received a contract to kill some stuff to save a really poor man's daughter and i requested the highest amount of money while looting their whole house for water and foods. Even if their daughter is not sick, their whole family will starve
This is what was brilliant about Fable. You could be as good or evil as you wanted but there were actual consequences to it. The world around you knew you were a colossal piece of shit.
Npcs reward like 15 \[currency\] for travelling across the world and delivering the \[important plot device\] to the \[actual villain of the story\]
God, I'd be so broke if the inhabitants reacted negatively to the looting.  It's fun fighting against the guards that take exception though.
I have this headcannon that the rest of the world hates having a monster in the area, not because of the danger of the monster...

But because they have to call that damn sticky-fingered witcher. 

Yeah, he kills the monster, but he leaves you with nothing afterwards.
r/vivaladirtleague lol
    Came here to link them as well. Their Witcher series is spot on
At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.
Top 5 game of all time imo.
    Ive tried to get into it probably 4 times since it was released and never really enjoyed it, despite liking similar games.  I'm going to give it another shot now that it has the next gen update.
        I think it is different from similar games because there is an existing world and story you are walking into (if you haven't played the earlier two). However, it does a good job of being independent.

Personally, I just found the world so refreshing compared to other fantasy rpgs. The music, the environment, and the monsters all felt so unique and had so much personality. Something like skyrim, which I really enjoyed, feels dry by comparison.
        Same here. First time I played I kept running around the starting area, thinking it would progress the story or I'd find something interesting. 10 hours in I did I think everything on the map and nothing really notable had happened besides the fun griffin fight. By then I was already sick of the stale combat (shield sign, sidestep, mash quick attack), I was already sick of the game. Doesn't help I like a challenge in games so I wasn't playing on normal difficulty, making combat longer.

Would like to come back to it with the next-gen update and just try to run thru it on normal difficulty and ignore a lot of the side content and excessive mobs, cause it's clearly the weak point in the game, and maybe play a sign-based build cause I found the melee pretty boring.
    Yeah, if you've played like 10 games total
        Well we're all entitled to our opinions, so thanks for sharing yours
            +1 for a very diplomatic response
        +1
        It's washed down uninspired piece of rushed dribble.  Astroturfing is in full force since its "update" otherwise it would be returned to the sea of mediocrity from whence it came.
Wait so you're telling me there are people who don't rob all the npcs blind? 

I thought that was like....a requirement.
And then, the cherry on top: after the looting, you play Gwent with them and take their most valuable cards.
I always feel bad looting everything in someones house after I just haggled for a higher bounty payout

Witcher 3 taught me that I could care less about the reward for the quest as long as the quest was engaging.
It’s fine until you’re over encumbered
Get a better silver sword and upgrade some oils OR use a silver butter knife dodge and role using quen signs trying to defeat an enemy that can 1 shot you and dying to said enemy. And trying again knowing damn well you can defeat him
Listen if you can't live without your box of bread, plates, silverware, candles, fruit, booze, and broken tools idk what to tell you other then get your game up
I haven't played that much yet (barely out of White Orchard tbh) but I deliberately do not loot stuff from occupied houses. I understand that the consequences are probably minor if they even exist at all, and I'm financially crippling myself, but damn it Geralt just isn't that kind of guy.
Without a cent of restitution?
Yet another reason why the world design in The Witcher 3 is among the worst I've ever seen.  There's no reason to not just steal everything.  Entire game just felt half-baked.
"No please, keep the 20 crowns for your daughters dowry. I already found your runestone and sapphire dust."
I swear RPGs insert this now as an homage to JRPGS.
That's so funny.
First the good Geralt then my greedy self all are satisfied
I remember when I played Skyrim for the first time (also my first Elder Scrolls in general) there was in Riverwood this father of a dude who escaped with you and said that you can get some stuff from his home to start your journey, but not all of it (if I remember correctly).

I hesitantly took a few things, but not very much and would always turn the camera towards him to make sure he would not get mad if i took too much.
Begrudgingly agree to help out a poor farmer's monster problem for pennies.

So how good is the new graphical update? Is it also harder to run? (I would assume so.) Can it be "turned off" to allow the game to run on older systems?
    Seems like it’s a mess on PC. Poorly optimized. I have a 3080 and I just turned off raytracing and went with ultra+ and it sort of looks how it did before in 4K honestly. Some of the textures look better but it’s no appreciable for the most part. Trying to get it running with any sort of ray tracing is a nightmare and will require lowering the settings quite a bit just to get smooth frame rates
Its the only way to find enough meteorite ore. Every villager has a stash somewhere.
Can we start using this version instead of the Drake one? Actually, anything would be better than Drake.
WITCHER  3 is BOARING why does anyone have to be held back by a dumb level cap why can't you just play the game and go explore.And by the way this is done on purpose by developers to keep you busy grinding so that you don't beat the game in one day,this is what I call vain gaming.
Yep
I find it difficult to play Geralt out of character like that.
Link 🙏 Geralt
I won't lie about this but I do this in every game I play
It was weird the first time I realized I stole a broken broom.
Autoloot everything within 30 yards every 2 seconds, except stealing things. I love this mod
Kingdom come : Deliverance is brutal where you can even steal an apple
Probably one of the top worst games of this generation. I’ve played it, so don’t say I’m just a hater
There is almost nothing to take in the houses. Did we play the same game?
Wait what? Is that the guy from fortnite?? How’d people draw him so fast?? Fortnite only made him a few days ago
So Skyrim ?
    Rpgs in general. Baldurs gate, elder scrolls 3 and 4, Kotor, final fantasy, it doesn't matter.   If I can go inside and look for stuff, I'm gonna.

        How did you figure? Because it's a copy of an earlier comment?

It hasn't denied your claim, so I assume you are right.
Meanwhile us Skyrim players looted their entire house and their corpse inside of it...
Witcher 3 
Uh!!!
Thanks for broadening my vocabulary buddy.
Why not both?!
if geralt wasn’t in the meme I’d have mistaken this for a skyrim meme
If they didn't want me to steal all their stuff, they should have offered a better reward.
They're usually destitute anyways, they won't mind
Skyrim's bucket enters the chat.
Up for a round of cards?
Someone wrote that they were complaining they didn't have enough room for all the junk they took from people's houses(brooms and other crap) and one response(may have been dev) said that in this RPG you are Roleplaying AS the Witcher, you don't HAVE to loot literally everything you see and steal from all the people, it is part of the RP. Now tbf if the randos didn't have literally super rare gems needed for upgrading stuff I wouldn't be searching through all their junk. Also tbf by the time you actually NEED those gems they are a dime a dozen. It just feels like you have literally 0 money starting out, but it isn't like you need money THAT badly. Playing on upgraded enemies(they level with you) makes the infinite respawns drop expensive stuff sooner.
The first quest giver for the lady of the well. Gives you a meager 20 gold which is his daughters dowry.

Why not both?
Best way to play
40 hours later you learn you can no longer progress the story further. So your game becomes acumulating more things and becoming the only character on the map.
How many broken fishing poles does one steal before a family goes bankrupt?
"Keep the reward" options were the dumbest thing in the game tbh.
I'll take their reward, and sell it at the merchant later.
Any game with a looting mechanic for me, if your quest item is shit better hope you’ve got your doors locked.
Ah yes the law of ~~surprise~~ loot everything that isn't nailed down.
I always end up so rich at the end that looting everything in sight feels unnecessary.
Law of Surprise.
Skyrim 🤜 🤛 witcher 3
Only rewards worth going after we're Gwent cards anyway
I bought Witcher 3 during some sale before Xmas \*last year\* and still have not played it lol fml
I loved the witcher 3. Great atmosphere and story. Loads of content. 

My experience with combat was that there was a particular spell which made it so easy I had to ban myself from using it so I could Still enjoy the combat. Igni I think it was. I'd just burn everyone and sort of dodge around while they all burnt to death.
A silver candlebaum that I’ll only get 20 crowns for? Sure, why not.
Can't remember what game it was, I think Dragon Age Inquisition? Or maybe it was Witcher 3. 

It was one specific area im thinking about. If you looted their house, they would know and got so mad at you for stealing their shit lol. It surprised me because everywhere else in the game they don't care.
Seriously, I kind of wish the game stopped you from doing that somehow.  I mean, I rob them blind.. but I do feel bad afterwards.
I just didn’t loot things that were clearly owned by someone, unless they were dicks or something was too good to pass up and made no sense for them to have. 

It’s just a mechanic that serves the player and nothing else. And there really is no point in looting a bunch of junk anyway. Why spend time looting if 90% of the time it’s just fishing nets and broken oars?
An interesting secret boss would be a citizen that has some overpowered item in their house but instantly blows the head off the player with a shotgun until the player gets geared and leveled enough to take them on. Only for the item to be useless or break once obtained.

Someone needs to do a video of a witcher acting like a tweaker rummaging through someone's house.
Most of the rewards sucked anyways compared to the Witcher gear you could make
Classic
You mean you're not a taxpayer in good standing??
That one Hosea mission in RDR2
In all honesty, you don't even need to steal. I always got more than enough gold from selling junk gear and other drops that I didn't need.

Huh, my experience with loot was more that every single weapon felt the same.
This was actually a big complaint of mine. I like to rp in my head when I play video games and key items would only be obtainable if you robbed those that helped you. It just felt very unnatural.
Did anyone else not loot in witcher 3, felt wrong to me?
Tgen selling it for probably less than the reward
Don’t forget challenging merchants with no money to buy 147 ashes from you with a game of Gwent
Creative problem solving. We need a game with a legal sandbox instead of a psychotic one. ☝️
All I wanted was gwent cards
I relized early on that there were absolutely no in game consequences for tobbing every house blind so I made sure to not take anything that Geralt wouldn't actually be willing to steal.
If devs didn't want us to do that make the npcs care about stolen things
*insert the little girl shrugging while saying "why not both" meme here*
I love witcher 3 as it let me to choose to get paid or do it for free. I always thought it would've been so honourable to do those jobs free but hell, those ppl are often pricks to Geralt and being in his boots I wouldn't be so kind to help everyone. Therefore unless a person I directly met there was in life-threatening trouble I would always ask for a reward. Fuck being the good guy. You wouldn't be if it was the real life. You'd put your life in a threat of death. I think I'm not an asshole with this attitude but what do you guys think? Those NPCs often hated witchers.
My entire experience throughout any game that will give me the option to steal.
I just can't do it. I have thousands of coins I don't spend and they're living in their own filth and offer me like 20 to make their life a little less miserable. Come on game
i was playing skyrim the other day and there is a npc offering heavy armor training well i paid him for heavy training 5 times and i robbed him bc training was expensive lol
I'm glad I play it the right way.

 This. is. the. way.
My fav part of the game robbing those good people blind 😂
There should be a trophy because I’d be double Platinum by now.
I will take your.....broken rake
I was actually pretty disappointed with Cyberpunk 2077 as far as looting went. You could just loot absolutely everyone and everything in broad daylight, no one gave a crap. You actually had to be careful in The Witcher 3, it was much more fun that way.
Same for me but with Skyrim
Same for me but with Skyrim
They can have their gold, I just want their salt.
Trying to talk to an NPC, but they move as you click the mouse, so you end up accidentally stealing a sweet roll and now the City Guard is trying to kill you.
The law of surprise?
One of the Fallout 4 NPCs, in a move that was super weird for so many reasons, gave me their household's most powerful melee weapon. 

Fortunately I was able to give it right back. In one instance, he ran out of his farm to smash up an evil robot.

Also I may or may not have downloaded a mod that makes everyone so very angry all the time.
Used the law of surprise: the first thing he saw was their house.
The generic loot is overwhelmingly underwhelming
I still find it a bit of anticlimactic that the NPC's don't get mad when they see you. Like yeah, if they're outside, it should be a no-brainer, but not even a comment about it? Meh.
I wish games would stop trying to put this clumsy dichotomy in where you get more XP if you refuse a monetary reward. I value XP more and it tends to be the more precious commodity in most games. Money, on the other hands, is often easier to come by and you're more likely to run out of things to buy. Obviously games will differ in their specifics, but it's not a real choice nor does it have any moral component. I'm just being asked what I need/want more. In some games it might also be down to whether my reputation matters with this person/group and how I'm prioritizing short term vs. long term gains, and long term is almost always more valuable.
I remember when I was a kid I would play oblivion, and the first thing I would do after leaving the sewers would be to go to that guy in the Hut who has you fight the fish, do his quest, get the very useful water breathing ring and now that this NPC has done the one thing I need them to do, murder them and sleep in their bed to join the Dark Brotherhood

It was very very rude of me
Skyrim: *picks up bucket*
My experience:

https://youtu.be/E3GGKF6CsjY
A game with the level of programming detail where you could actually steal  as much or as little from somebody's house as you wanted with the consequences for each thing stolen being felt by those video game puppets... until they eventually starve to death, or cannibalize their family... or have to become theives themselves.... or hell, while we are in make believe world, you could gift them money and watch them prosper, 

but that level of programming would be either the best or worst game of all time. Like, congratulations you made a sadism/Holodomer simulator, and Pathologic already did that...
Wait you can do that?
My favorite was when I was struggling with food. I then found this place where like… I could just kill two guards and then run back and forth killing the live stock for a lot of food!
Y’all going hard on who truly knows this fictional character best😭
If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? Do NPCs go hungry if they're not in rendering distance? These are the questions
Me but fallout 4
In Skyrim I would always walk outside, put the timer to 3 AM, then sneak in and take everything.
I lost my shit after completing a side mission and getting 1 Experience Point. Fuck off.
Nah this Skyrim in a nutshell
Didn't know my roommate had reddit. He just started playing for the first time and yeah he steals just about everything. No alcohol though that's about the only thing he doesn't take.
Yeah I'm sure they'll miss this apple, water, and broken rake.
That’s George Carlin
Challenging the NPC to Gwent so you can have another card.
Switch the pictures and that's me
Me on second playthrough: Ignore everything but Gwent.
I do the same thing in Minecraft
I do not like to trade with villagers
Congratulations gamers.

Now you understand why humanity tolerates, even activity support, oligarchs. Everyone wants to be the guy who cleans out the poor; not the guy who earns his honest keep.

And that's true whether you're bleeding them dry raising prices from your monopoly owned business on things humans have to have to live or low wages that all businesses have agreed to pay.

Seriously, what's the difference between that and breaking into their house and taking their shit
This is why I like Skyrim/elder scrolls online, you can’t just steal everything in someone’s house while they’re walking around lmao they actually are aware and will fight you / call the guards
I never really got this in most games, you just walk into someone's home, they either welcome you or say something random, you then steal everything in sight and walk away.

Somehow you are still a hero.
when you havent saved in the pasr 30 mins and accidentaly get caught stealing in a village u like
Lack of crime mechanics: it's a feature not a bug
Ahh, yes, doing the Link thing where you barge into their house, destroy all their pots and take all their rupees... which only amounts to the equivalent of the spare change underneath the couch cushions.
"We are so poor we are eating tree bark to survive"....*Has two dimeritian ingots in a chest*
a great game I cant play because I hate the movement system so much.
Skyrim
I’m pretty sure that’s most of not all RPGs
"Plz find my lost daughter"

"i need to inspect their rooms first"

"proceeds to loot all the riches contained herein"

ok i know where to go now thanks.
You know- that’s an interesting mechanic… like in Moon, where the baker actively stops you if you try to loot the bakery
*Looks at inventory overflowing with items I haven't used*
You know, I should really loot this guys house to see if he has anything I need.
My entire experience in pretty much every RPG ever.
This is spot on lol. I remember when I first went into someone's house and started to steal their belongings and kept waiting for someone to attack me but it never happened! Lol
why not do both of those? do the quest then steal everything they own
Had a very similar side quest like this in AC valhalla where you, at their request, smash up their house, burn it, and rob them
Fortnite guy
Hahaha is real , confirmo si me pasa todo el tiempo
I just started my first playthrough. Man, fuck them candles.
    if you're going to use one button to do multiple things... then don't put candles near a fast travel point lol. Yeah no, I just got off Roach, walked over to this fast travel point so I could extinguish the candle... that is what I wanted.

edit: also worth noting for anyone's first play through, there is a known bug for in the Last Wish quest were if you don't turn off "enemy upscaling" it is impossible (like you do no damage to the enemy impossible).  Hopefully this was fixed with the new update, but if not that is how you kill the Djinn lol.
        And the candles right in front of innkeeps. Ugh.
        Oh snap that djinn is where one of my saves was stuck. Tried everything thrice lol. Thanks fam
            I spent so much time trying to defeat it, only to eventually just google how to kill it and realized it was a glitch.  It is kind of mind boggling how a game breaking glitch like that could go so long without a patch lol.
                Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
                    Easy work around. Don't die.
                        Easier said than done.
        No way.

That was a glitch? I'm pissed. I stopped my first playthrough because of that enemy.

I'm on my second playthrough now and I'm enjoying it much more. I've been paying attention to lore much more. Setting the combat to highest difficulty made it better too.
            Highest difficulty is for sure the best. I had played this game up to the werewolf quest on normal, stopped. Picked it up a year later started over on deathmarch and felt like a real Witcher. 

You have to know your enemy, prepare oils and bombs specifically for the enemy or you will probably lose. Where as the other difficulties you can just swing your sword to victory, which is fine I won't talk down to anyone who enjoys a single player game their own way effecting noone but themselves. But I just didn't feel like a Witcher, I could've been any generic action hero.
                man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
            I spent like over an hour trying to kill it, once i turned off enemy upscaling it was dead in like 2 seconds lol.
        Same thing with rat enemies in the game. If you set enemy upscaling on, enemies like rats and wolves will do big damage and have a lot of health
        The game is designed to be played at a slower pace, doing things with intention and consideration.  Hunts take thought and preparation more than raw combat.  The joy is in the immersion. 

We all get caught spamming through occasionally but it's not a design flaw to coerce you to be more deliberate
    My semi OCD brain forcing me to light every candle I find in the game.
        It's also a nice way of keeping track of where you've been.

Candles are lit.  Oh, been this way already.

            Exactly how not to get lost in Minecraft too. Just make 500 torches and leave a trail! (Mostly underground)

                I put all my torches on the right side so I know im making my way back if they're on my left.
                Until you branch to often and you go in circles trying to get out.
            Just started my first play-through (now that the next gen patch is out) - are all candles by default unlit in the world? That's the only way that would make sense as a means of progress tracking
                I don't remember all candles being unlit but within the kinds of places you explore I could see that being the case
            >Candles are lit.

Little Gondor calls for aid!
    There is a mod that it's already updated to the last version that only allows you to interact with candles when you have igni selected.
    Do they actually serve a purpose *anywhere* in the whole damn game?  I don't recall it ever being a useful ability.
    Oh buddy you've only begun to extinguish candles.
I just started replaying, haven't played in a couple years. I was assuming I remembered wrong and there was no penalty for stealing because everywhere I went in White Orchard no one reacted when I looted their homes, but then I got to the Nilfgaard fort and got swarmed instantly because I was spamming the loot button.
PC with looting mod was the best thing ever created. I literally want to loot everything, but all that clicking around was crazy, never got anywhere without wasting a ton of time.
Trying to pick up anything in a Cyberpunk 2077 bathroom is even worse.
It's all the coins they had, they have other trade goods but no coin.

Well, fluid, but most people can't call you out on the difference off the top of their head.
                    Of course! Liquid is cash and fluid are the regulations governing wall street... Who doesn't know that?

*Casually proceeds haggling for 2 extra coins from the farmer in white orchard whos daughter is dying.
    Correct me if I’m wrong but I think you can only ever get one extra coin out of him. I just find it funny that I even bother haggling when I end up telling him to keep it for her dowry anyway
        Can get at least 2. First time playing, I countered his 20 with 24, he rebuffed and then accepted a second offer of 22 

And in retrospect I have no problem exploiting the farmer given his frugality when his daughter’s literal life is at stake
Being dishonest like that, they *deserve* a good looting

For killing everyone else? No, but I let him go anyway.

This is one of the worst tropes. "turn down reward to get even bigger reward"
    I know it's different, but have to point out this trope directly effects the end of the game
        Wait what?  I don't remember this?
            Turning down the money from Emhyr when you bring back Ciri affects Ciri's outcome.
                It wasn't even a lot of money either
                    It was like 1000 crowns.
                        Bruh that grandmaster armor won't pay for itself.
                            Bitch, you could spend 15 minutes in skellige farming swords for more than this.

                                I cleared every single Smuggler Cache in Skelliger. Coin for days. Took a long damn time though.
                I was so mad when I learned this after my first playthrough. When I reached that part I didn't want to take the money but I was super short on coin. I wish there was a "take the money and call him an ass" option
                    Personally, I played it as a Witcher always gets paid. I'm not going to fleece you but this is dangerous shit. 

Why else would i still do it if there was no gain? Not like you people are so nice and accepting to me. 

So it hurt when that's held against me. I was like witchers must always take payment circi! You know the code!
                        That was my first run, a true Witcher, fuck around with me and you die. Pay what's due. I'll look the other way if you hand over coin.

This new run I'm trying to be more human, still very humiliating letting people spit on me and not doing something. 🥲
                            You first paragraph doesn't really describe Geralt to me, at all. Have you read the books?
                                Geralt is my favorite Witcher but tbf he isn't standard. The rest of them feel a lot closer to OP's playthrough.
            Doesn't directly change the ending but accepting coin from Emhyr is part of deciding what ending you get.
    Changes the way ciri dealt with late game lmfaooo
    A related, but better, trope is when you get more abstract rewards, such as a small boost to reputation/karma. Alternatively, perhaps if you abstain from taking a reward from a shopkeeper, his shop grows better and he gives a slight discount down the line with a better selection. 

Then again, I could see a game that uses a "good" playthrough as a voluntary hardmode.
    yeah lol, I'm not sure if there are others but that's the one I noticed immediately while selling some extra gems.
Idk if he gives it to you I think it's just in his house and you can take it
Wait where is the cannibal couple? I don’t think I’ve found that quest in 2 playthroughs
    I'm pretty sure it's added with the Hearts of Stone DLC, maybe you don't have it.
        I played that one the least, I love blood and wine though
            The Hearts of Stone story was amazing and I would highly recommend finishing it if you ever get the time to.
                It does take a bit of persistence though. I remember thinking “Ugh, Oxenfurt? Again?” 


Obviously by the end I was fully engrossed in the story but at the beginning I was unimpressed
                    I was only like that during the wedding portion where Geralt is possessed. That felt like it was taking forever for me.
                        But, but that whole wedding portion was so great and memorable..

                    Could you imagine if Zelda was a girl? Totally unladylike to walk into strangers homes and break their pots.
                        Zelda… is a girl?
                            Nah they are talking about the MC from legend of zelda. cause you caan break pots etc in most games.  its known as "doing a zelda" usually
                I never did Hearts of Stone quests just because every time you go there big stuff pops up on your screen saying you’re in the DLC area (don’t remember the wording it’s been years), and that broke my immersion enough that it just wasn’t worth going there. Only DLC I did was collecting the extra gwent cards because I’m an addict 😂
            The halfing herbalist northeast of Oxenfurt gives it to you although I think you have to finish the second wish in Hearts of Stone first.

I think Hearts of Stone had the better story of the DLC's, I think it's the best 10 or so hours of story in the game. Blood and Wine is better overall though, it still has a good story but adds so much more content.
                Touissant as a whole took the game to new heights. So much content and such a beautiful place.
                    I think part of it is how unique it is. Hearts of Stone had a great story and arguably the best villain in the game but it took place in a new area of an existing map so it didn't feel that unique. Toussaint is very different from everywhere else in the game and it's a nice change.
                        I don't know, the three witches of the wood and their whole questline is amazing
                            It is an amazing quest but Hearts of Stone and Gaunter O'Dimm are better to me.
                            The witches of the wood are just so creepy.  Gave me shivers on my first play though, not just because they were scary monsters but the narrative.
                                It started out great and ended really silly when you actually fight them. In their bio it says they are ancient beings that existed before the conjunction of spheres and they were Godlike during their quest. But when you actually have to fight them they run around and try to slap you. And they are subservient to the Wild Hunt leaders when they're just elves from another dimension. I always thought the 3 witches shouldn't appear again after the initial quest.
                            I liked them both but I love stories involving the three crones/fates or Gaunter O'Dimm/ the devil.
                        Its basicly the witcher in france.
            Dude I saw Blood&Wine play at the House of Blues, he's dope
    You need to have the Hearts of Stone expansion. You can get the quest from a contract off of Brunwich's notice board
Sometimes it isn't about money, its about pleasure. Have you ever tried Halfling flesh? It is remarkably delicious... But no they were truly starving. In the quest if you spared the couple and lied to Otto, you'll see the husband grieving for his wife who died of hunger.
    “Have you ever tried Halfling flash”

B) what a menu is in the context of food

C) that some items may be temporarily unavailable due to shortages


This can only mean one thing. Orc Restaurants. Orc restaurants with a varied menu.

        Hard disagree 
Geralt always wanted to be a Hero, him taking jobs from people only to turn down payment when he realizes they are literally eating tree bark to avoid starvation is on brand.
Like the guy at Crows Perch who sends you to hunt the shrieker, who takes in the young son of the hunter who got torn to shreds, I think that was the first time I used the refuse payment option. 
Just like it's also on brand for him to demand extra from nobles and merchants getting rich of the war, since he's the one killing all the damn necrophages.
            Yeah, this is how I played Geralt. I would bargain for the most coin. Then refuse payment at the end of the quest. It’s not about the gold. It’s about the principle. You respect my profession so you’ll pay me all that you have. But I will refuse it based on my principles. I have enough gold from looting all the dead and the living rich.
        I disagree. I like that they’re there, and I like that they have either no or nearly no actual gameplay impact. It’s just a choice I make for myself as I’m going through the world. Even if I never exercise the choice, I can’t make any choice unless a choice is there to be made.

                To be fair, Geralt did that once and then spent a very long time avoiding the actual "payment".
        Are you saying that because you always keep it or never keep it?
Are you implying that if there were financial justification for eating a halfling, you'd be ok with it? Lol
    Well, I don't think their village qualifies for Food Stamps.

I forget the name of the game, but there was a post-apocalyptic indie game set in an American city for the 360. Somebody helps patch you up, and you have the option to - of course - loot their home. If you do, they say something along the lines of, "I gave you everything I could afford to spare to help you, and you're taking the rest? You're a monster." It genuinely made me feel really guilty about it, and it changed the way I play RPGs.

Edit: I think it was I Am Alive.

        Edit: Fuck your API changes, Reddit.
I loot all the bodies before I advance the missions. This leads to the npcs yelling at me constantly.
    Which is so fucking obnoxious by the way
        **C'MON ARTHUR**
            Every 5 seconds

"OVER HERE ARTHUR." "WE GOTTA GO ARTHUR" "WHY ARE YOU WAITING ARTHUR LETS GO"
    I honestly just gave up looting the bodies. You get so much money just by doing the missions it wasn't worth the time
        You're right because I'm not even that far in and have thousands. Yet I have a hard time stopping maybe its because Dutch keeps telling me "we just need more money!"
            Half the problem is so many people rush you and there are times where you will literally fail missions by trying to loop bodies instead of continuing on to the mission.
        It's only recently I've been able to play an RPG without looting everything. Of course it helped that I made a melee build so taking four sniper rifles was even less pointless.
    One NPC is Skyrim yells at you if you loot her body.
        Thought it was just the armor. Don't think she objects to you taking stuff if you don't strip the corpse. But she's hard to hear sometimes so im not sure.
I killed that father then came back the next day.

Dude had bandages on his head and was screaming about "its you, why'd you come back?!" like shit man... I didn't think you would remember me blasting your skull into pieces with my sawed off... My b. I left them alone that time.
    The courier always remembers.
        The game was rigged from the start
If you left the son alive, he will still be living there in the epilogue with John.  Just like his dad, he will drinking his life away.
    So really it was a kindness.. right?
        Right
Duuude this house messed with me. I did the same exact thing but only shot the father and the kid just sits there crying next to his dad's headless body. I mean, I was *trying* to play as a somewhat decent outlaw.

Sorry kid
In Fallout 3, I'd make special trips out to the Republic of Dave to leave toys and books for the kids.
On a similar note, I enjoyed the negotiation mechanic because *that* felt like something Geralt would actually do.
    Absolutely, that one was great
    Is there a trick to finding a good starting point for negotiations or is it random?
        I don't think it's random but it's a set amount for each encounter. I tend to go about 3/4 of the way up and go from there
        Go ham if they are Rich/noble, go 3/4 to start if they aren’t.
            That's what I usually do, but I've met some stingy noblemen.
    The idea of it is sound but it was implemented absolutely horrendously.
Is it really? I haven't read very far but Geralt killed the kikimora in The Last Wish before even knowing if there was a contract (there was not). 

Geralt refuses payment from Calanthe and Pavetta/ Duny, only claiming the law of surprise when they insist. 

I don't think it's too far fetched for Geralt to decline payment, especially if he's in a position that he doesn't really *need* it. 

The books and games make it very clear Geralt is not like other Witchers and bends or outright breaks his code when it suits him. He puts up this front of being this cold, calculated killer but he's still human with emotions like everyone else.
    He killed the kikimora because he assumed people were disappearing there, and he demanded payment from the village elder who told him there's no payment because nobody has even thought it's there, despite people disappearing there. Then he tried to sell the cadaver to a wizard. He certainly didn't do it as a goodwill gesture.

I don't want so spoil you but there's no Witcher code and all witchers have emotions, it's just stuff they say to preserve a professional facade
        Yeah that was kind of my point, Geralt's code is made up so there's nothing obligating him to take payment. He hides behind it when it's convenient. 

I also saw something about him saving some merchant or something on a bridge in time or contempt and nearly dying himself, without being paid to do so? 

I'm sure there are other examples if I read them all but that's all I know of at this time. There's also the simple fact that the games are different writers so it's natural his characterization might be a little different. You can just chalk that up to time and maybe his amnesia changing his views or if simply being a different universe entirely. ¯⁠\⁠\_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

Either way I don't think it's too far fetched to see Geralt, as we know him in Witcher 3, to decline payment.
    In the books he often struggles to find food.
    Tldr: chaotic neutral (by the 2nd ed.).
        Honestly I'd argue chaotic good. Geralt acts according to his own sense of morality, killing evil monsters and sparing good ones. He hides behind stereotypes and a made up code to not be taken advantage of in a world that despises non-humans, including mutants like Witchers. 

He fancied himself a hero when he first set out on the Path and tried to save someone only for her to scream in fear of him over the bloodshed. Even his most popular nickname, the Butcher of Blaviken, was the result of him refusing to stay neutral and getting involved without pay - or even in spite of pay. Stregebor offered to pay him for help with Renfri and he refused, if I remember correctly. 

He also turns down contracts to kill sentient, peaceful creatures like Dudu. 

I don't think Geralt would usually turn down pay when offered by those who can clearly afford it but the times it comes up in game are when people are in desperate need themselves. I don't know if there's a situation in the books where he takes pay knowing it would leave someone unable to feed themselves, so it's hard to say defectively, but I think there's certainly an argument both ways. Enough to justify including it.
It's a game.
That choice was given to us, not because it was canon, because they figured the players would want that choice.
    The game starts with explaining that it’s like the Witcher code or something to always require payment
        It's also not the Witcher code to cold-blood murder Whoreson Junior just for being a piece of shit but I'm still glad they gave me that option.

                    If you wanna stock up on health potions and fortifying strength drinks and kill Vivec (an actual god), more power to you. It'll ruin the entire main story arc but you can do it, damnit.
    Yep, it's a game, not a movie.
    See, the games try very hard to portray the world as faithfully as possible, only to allow the player to do the exact opposite?
        yes.
            I guess you would be fine if they also allowed the player to run around with a lightsaber? Maybe Ciri brought one from another realm as a gift
                Apples and oranges.
                    It's not, Geralt is an established character, not a random Witcher or a nameless Dragonborn
                        It must be a joy in and of itself to watch you froth at the mouth about any alternate history world in a videogame.
                        Ok ok cool. BUT it’s my play through and I want to make decisions based on what I want to do, just call me a really fucking good Doppler or something possessing Geralt idc. Doesn’t mean I don’t find the canonical story or Geralt interesting, just means that the second the player is given control the story is no longer focused on being canon. We’d basically have to avoid a huge amount of the game’s content if we just wanted to *be Geralt*
                        Geralt doesn't press the X button either, he doesn't even have a controller.
                        I agree. They should remove *all* of the choices from the game, almost every single one of them had an un-character like option.

                            I was upset about the show but not because of non-white actors.

First season was okay-ish, second was complete shitshow
                You know what an adaptation is, yes?
                Are you kidding?

I’d pay at least $5 for lightsaber DLC.
        Book Geralt never loses a 1v1 swordfight*, do you think the game should always let you win in duels regardless of how you play?

*Except..
        Geralt is on a quest to find his kidnapped daughter but spends like 90% of the game doing other things. By making the game open world instead of linear, the character becomes “out-of-character” by default unless you speed run the game
            Also, you start off as a bit of a bitch and have to progress in the story to be on par with canon geralt's skill in combat, magic, and knowledge of monsters.
        The thing about games is that generally entertainment is gained through player agency, especially in the likes of RPGS where it is the main element next to the world you're role playing in. Yes some of them have established characters that is the player character but then you'd leave those games from being RPGs to being action adventure games. Like Commander Shepherd isn't a vindictive asshole, Geralt isn't a bloodthirsty kleptomanic, the Lone Wanderer isn't able to distance themselves from just freaking out about having their child stolen and their spouse getting murdered... but you're given the absolute choice in what you want to do and how to achieve that
I haven't read any books, just played witcher 3 and didn't take any rewards when anyone seemed desperate
    Thing is, just about everyone is desperate in Witcher universe.

Especially Geralt. Games make you feel like you're filthy rich, but in the books Witchers are often hungry and regularly in debt. It's a shitty job where people are more willing to stab him in the gut and rob him than to pay for a contract.
        It's easy to turn down money in game when you already have more money than you could ever spend from loot. Geralt was never in that situation in the books, like you said.
            At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.
                This is a bot, stolen two comments just in this thread.

                    There’s another one too.
                Did you know that Zelder is a boy?
                2 different 12 day old accounts posting this verbatim simultaneously?
        Yeah I remember the quest where I think the dude from cat school was stabbed with a pitchfork because the villagers couldn't pay him, still I may be playing as Geralt but I make decisions based on what I would do, any choice based game I play I shape the story on my choices instead of "what the main character would do" it was the same in witcher 3, in walking dead and even rdr2 i went the honorary route
            I was sympathetic to him until I learned that this isn't the first time he did this. Later I learned that this is a pretty typical trait of Cat school Witchers since they're less stable mutations process. Really can't spare the guy.
                Yeah, unpaid bills =/= mass murder. Dude had to go.
        he actually gets quite a bit of money at one point in the books, funnily.
            And is known to have *excellent* credit. I love that Sapkowski, with a financial background before he started writing, took time in the books to explain how credit works in his universe.
        Are you actually complaining about the games for giving players the choice?

Jesus.
    That's not the Witcher way BOI
    Witchers don't work for free. Don't feel bad for the humans. You have more in common with monsters than you do them.
It’s a role-playing-game people can make whatever decisions they please regardless of lore
I haven't read the books, but do you mean that Geralt is an altruist who doesn't take any reward for what he does?
    No. He is adamant about taking money when being on contract, even if there are moral reasons not to take them. 

It's for several reasons such as:

* people are begging him to help but after he turns his back they spit on him, rob him or try to kill him
* he's dislikes religious/knightly orders because they kill monsters for free, which is very bad for business as people aren't willing to pay anymore. Also because they're amateurs
* the economy in books is really not in Geralt's favour, he has a lot of debts and he's basically a hobo who does job for supper most of the time
        Got it, i misread what you'd said earlier. That makes a lot more sense
    Part of the Witcher code is not offering your services for free.

I think Vesimir even brings it up fairly early in W3
        There is no actual Witcher code. In the books Geralt explicitly says he just uses the 'code' as an excuse when he doesn't feel like arguing or explaining something.
            Didn't know that, basically all my exposure to the Witcher comes from the games.
                I'd recommend checking out the books if you are interested, they are a good read.
                LPT:  Anyone that says "that's against regulations" is more or less doing the same thing.  Giving you a cheap excuse.
        Code doesn't exist but it's generally agreed upon. It kinda makes sense because that way the Witchers would just die out because hunger got em
        Ah okay, i misread what he said then.
So far there are 3 comments that read exactly: "Keep the reward" options were the dumbest thing in the game tbh. 

This is any of: Bots, a person with multiple accounts, a line from someone popular on the internet that said exactly this and everyone stopped thinking for themselves, or just super lazy internet people who stopped thinking for themselves.

Either way it has lost all meaning.
    How dare people share the same opinion about a game deviating from an established character from a book series!  The must be bots!  There is no way nerd fanboys would nitpick details like this!
    it's bots. there was one popular comment with that line and then a couple bots repeated it in an effort to get karma. just report and move on.
I started reading this as a song and then got tongue tripped.
The mob was actually pretty lenient, their whole deal was they wanted you to keep paying… forever, but still wanted you to be able to make your payments.

The trope of mob lenders breaking knees and whatnot is a myth because then their creditors couldn’t work. One mob enforcer said that if they had to do something physical a long cut on the fingers of the non dominant hand was one of the best options. Painful yes, uncomfortable for a while yes, but you could still go to work.
Well, I don’t like this because the mobs and banks are both exploitative, and banks will say no to desperate people while the mob will exploit them. Banks are also racist
    Username checks out
        No idea what that means, or why my comment was downvoted.

Why the fuck is Reddit supporting the mob and banks now?
            Definitely what that means. The reddit hive mind has decided it likes the mob and banks. No other possibilities
It's a blast to do it in Kingdom Come : Deliverance, just clean out shops after hours.  Get caught? It's murdering time!

Yea weird to use the Witcher for this meme. Most houses had absolute rubbish, the same old crap, nothing worth taking.
    Because the Witcher just got updated and is a hot topic
    Really? Most of the houses I looted had magic crafting materials at the very least. I frequently found that rainbow coloured rock in shacks that looked like a strong fart would knock them down.
... I'd be really happy if I could have a big house, then hire NPCs to help me cart some random person's couch to my big house.  

I want the mechanic of shock when the NPCs get arrested for breaking and entering.
I loved the pic on the Skyrim sub of the guy who was collecting every wheel of cheese in the game and putting it in one house.
Mmmh... nah we still would
Probably my only complaint with what is basically a perfect game.

It's so fucking stingy with rewards and money.
    It's honestly better than the opposite, makes crafting worthwhile and finding good gear matter but I do get you. I just hate when games give me infinite money (ahem Skyrim) and it becomes meaningless before too long. I enjoy being a destitute scrub as well as a super badass I guess.
In the first Fable game, you can do one better and murder everyone in a town, buy up the houses for cheap and become the landlord for the next people who move in, giving you a steady income for the rest of the game.
    I totally forgot about doing that. I owned whole towns!
Wait so you're telling me there are people who don't rob all the npcs blind.
Yeah, this is just how you build up alchemy materials. 

Expeditions through nature to gather materials from specific regions? Yeah sure maybe

Repeated trips to all the alchemy shops close to fast travel points? Lol yeah of course

Counterpoint, in Witcher 3 if you loot in front of soldiers they will attack you, but regular people don’t even say anything so yeah it’s a bit sad
    Yeah, like I'm gonna tell the huge guy with 2 swords on his back and the head of the monster that's been terrorising our whole town for generations strapped to his horse to stop.
        Playing unmodded skyrim would bug me. Like I'm the mother fucking dragon born, you were there when I saved the city. I found your long lost son. I'm sorry I touched your sweet roll instead of talking to you. Are you REALLY going to attack me over this?
            You don't just go barging into a Nord lady's house and grabbing their sweet rolls, what the heck is wrong with you!?
You saying that if you hire a buff murderer and they come to collect, you would try and *stop them* if they try to take a bit more than agreed upon?

Like nah you aren't lol. Just be glad they don't throw you in the goodie sack too, never to be seen again.
    Not Witcher specific. For instance I was playing Dishonored 2 yesterday (which I love to death) and walked into a pub and started picking up coins off the counter and no one said a thing. 

I've seen some games where NPC's will make a comment about their hopelessness to stop you, which I think is even better. (not that I enjoy being reminded of my awful thievery)
Meanwhile I'm hit with NPCS who want to kill me because I took a fork; this after I saved them all from being horribly murdered.
You could just, not
loved this, hope they do more witcher stuff in the future.
    They have like 4 others on their channel, and some just general video game humor stuff. Maybe with the next gen update people will be making more Witcher related things
        Yes i know i watch almost all of there stuff, i'm sorry i wasnt explicit, I meant more seasons of witcher content.

Came here to link them as well. Their Witcher series is spot on
Ive tried to get into it probably 4 times since it was released and never really enjoyed it, despite liking similar games.  I'm going to give it another shot now that it has the next gen update.
    I think it is different from similar games because there is an existing world and story you are walking into (if you haven't played the earlier two). However, it does a good job of being independent.

Personally, I just found the world so refreshing compared to other fantasy rpgs. The music, the environment, and the monsters all felt so unique and had so much personality. Something like skyrim, which I really enjoyed, feels dry by comparison.
    Same here. First time I played I kept running around the starting area, thinking it would progress the story or I'd find something interesting. 10 hours in I did I think everything on the map and nothing really notable had happened besides the fun griffin fight. By then I was already sick of the stale combat (shield sign, sidestep, mash quick attack), I was already sick of the game. Doesn't help I like a challenge in games so I wasn't playing on normal difficulty, making combat longer.

Would like to come back to it with the next-gen update and just try to run thru it on normal difficulty and ignore a lot of the side content and excessive mobs, cause it's clearly the weak point in the game, and maybe play a sign-based build cause I found the melee pretty boring.
Yeah, if you've played like 10 games total

    It's washed down uninspired piece of rushed dribble.  Astroturfing is in full force since its "update" otherwise it would be returned to the sea of mediocrity from whence it came.
Seems like it’s a mess on PC. Poorly optimized. I have a 3080 and I just turned off raytracing and went with ultra+ and it sort of looks how it did before in 4K honestly. Some of the textures look better but it’s no appreciable for the most part. Trying to get it running with any sort of ray tracing is a nightmare and will require lowering the settings quite a bit just to get smooth frame rates
Rpgs in general. Baldurs gate, elder scrolls 3 and 4, Kotor, final fantasy, it doesn't matter.   If I can go inside and look for stuff, I'm gonna.

    How did you figure? Because it's a copy of an earlier comment?

It hasn't denied your claim, so I assume you are right.
if you're going to use one button to do multiple things... then don't put candles near a fast travel point lol. Yeah no, I just got off Roach, walked over to this fast travel point so I could extinguish the candle... that is what I wanted.

edit: also worth noting for anyone's first play through, there is a known bug for in the Last Wish quest were if you don't turn off "enemy upscaling" it is impossible (like you do no damage to the enemy impossible).  Hopefully this was fixed with the new update, but if not that is how you kill the Djinn lol.
    And the candles right in front of innkeeps. Ugh.
    Oh snap that djinn is where one of my saves was stuck. Tried everything thrice lol. Thanks fam
        I spent so much time trying to defeat it, only to eventually just google how to kill it and realized it was a glitch.  It is kind of mind boggling how a game breaking glitch like that could go so long without a patch lol.
            Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
                Easy work around. Don't die.
                    Easier said than done.
    No way.

That was a glitch? I'm pissed. I stopped my first playthrough because of that enemy.

I'm on my second playthrough now and I'm enjoying it much more. I've been paying attention to lore much more. Setting the combat to highest difficulty made it better too.
        Highest difficulty is for sure the best. I had played this game up to the werewolf quest on normal, stopped. Picked it up a year later started over on deathmarch and felt like a real Witcher. 

You have to know your enemy, prepare oils and bombs specifically for the enemy or you will probably lose. Where as the other difficulties you can just swing your sword to victory, which is fine I won't talk down to anyone who enjoys a single player game their own way effecting noone but themselves. But I just didn't feel like a Witcher, I could've been any generic action hero.
            man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
        I spent like over an hour trying to kill it, once i turned off enemy upscaling it was dead in like 2 seconds lol.
    Same thing with rat enemies in the game. If you set enemy upscaling on, enemies like rats and wolves will do big damage and have a lot of health
    The game is designed to be played at a slower pace, doing things with intention and consideration.  Hunts take thought and preparation more than raw combat.  The joy is in the immersion. 

We all get caught spamming through occasionally but it's not a design flaw to coerce you to be more deliberate

            Until you branch to often and you go in circles trying to get out.
        Just started my first play-through (now that the next gen patch is out) - are all candles by default unlit in the world? That's the only way that would make sense as a means of progress tracking
            I don't remember all candles being unlit but within the kinds of places you explore I could see that being the case
        >Candles are lit.

Little Gondor calls for aid!
There is a mod that it's already updated to the last version that only allows you to interact with candles when you have igni selected.
Do they actually serve a purpose *anywhere* in the whole damn game?  I don't recall it ever being a useful ability.
Oh buddy you've only begun to extinguish candles.

For killing everyone else? No, but I let him go anyway.
I know it's different, but have to point out this trope directly effects the end of the game
    Wait what?  I don't remember this?
        Turning down the money from Emhyr when you bring back Ciri affects Ciri's outcome.
            It wasn't even a lot of money either
                It was like 1000 crowns.
                    Bruh that grandmaster armor won't pay for itself.
                        Bitch, you could spend 15 minutes in skellige farming swords for more than this.

                            I cleared every single Smuggler Cache in Skelliger. Coin for days. Took a long damn time though.
            I was so mad when I learned this after my first playthrough. When I reached that part I didn't want to take the money but I was super short on coin. I wish there was a "take the money and call him an ass" option
                Personally, I played it as a Witcher always gets paid. I'm not going to fleece you but this is dangerous shit. 

Why else would i still do it if there was no gain? Not like you people are so nice and accepting to me. 

So it hurt when that's held against me. I was like witchers must always take payment circi! You know the code!
                    That was my first run, a true Witcher, fuck around with me and you die. Pay what's due. I'll look the other way if you hand over coin.

This new run I'm trying to be more human, still very humiliating letting people spit on me and not doing something. 🥲
                        You first paragraph doesn't really describe Geralt to me, at all. Have you read the books?
                            Geralt is my favorite Witcher but tbf he isn't standard. The rest of them feel a lot closer to OP's playthrough.
        Doesn't directly change the ending but accepting coin from Emhyr is part of deciding what ending you get.
Changes the way ciri dealt with late game lmfaooo
A related, but better, trope is when you get more abstract rewards, such as a small boost to reputation/karma. Alternatively, perhaps if you abstain from taking a reward from a shopkeeper, his shop grows better and he gives a slight discount down the line with a better selection. 

Then again, I could see a game that uses a "good" playthrough as a voluntary hardmode.
yeah lol, I'm not sure if there are others but that's the one I noticed immediately while selling some extra gems.
I'm pretty sure it's added with the Hearts of Stone DLC, maybe you don't have it.
    I played that one the least, I love blood and wine though
        The Hearts of Stone story was amazing and I would highly recommend finishing it if you ever get the time to.
            It does take a bit of persistence though. I remember thinking “Ugh, Oxenfurt? Again?” 


Obviously by the end I was fully engrossed in the story but at the beginning I was unimpressed
                I was only like that during the wedding portion where Geralt is possessed. That felt like it was taking forever for me.
                    But, but that whole wedding portion was so great and memorable..

                Could you imagine if Zelda was a girl? Totally unladylike to walk into strangers homes and break their pots.
                    Zelda… is a girl?
                        Nah they are talking about the MC from legend of zelda. cause you caan break pots etc in most games.  its known as "doing a zelda" usually
            I never did Hearts of Stone quests just because every time you go there big stuff pops up on your screen saying you’re in the DLC area (don’t remember the wording it’s been years), and that broke my immersion enough that it just wasn’t worth going there. Only DLC I did was collecting the extra gwent cards because I’m an addict 😂
        The halfing herbalist northeast of Oxenfurt gives it to you although I think you have to finish the second wish in Hearts of Stone first.

I think Hearts of Stone had the better story of the DLC's, I think it's the best 10 or so hours of story in the game. Blood and Wine is better overall though, it still has a good story but adds so much more content.
            Touissant as a whole took the game to new heights. So much content and such a beautiful place.
                I think part of it is how unique it is. Hearts of Stone had a great story and arguably the best villain in the game but it took place in a new area of an existing map so it didn't feel that unique. Toussaint is very different from everywhere else in the game and it's a nice change.
                    I don't know, the three witches of the wood and their whole questline is amazing
                        It is an amazing quest but Hearts of Stone and Gaunter O'Dimm are better to me.
                        The witches of the wood are just so creepy.  Gave me shivers on my first play though, not just because they were scary monsters but the narrative.
                            It started out great and ended really silly when you actually fight them. In their bio it says they are ancient beings that existed before the conjunction of spheres and they were Godlike during their quest. But when you actually have to fight them they run around and try to slap you. And they are subservient to the Wild Hunt leaders when they're just elves from another dimension. I always thought the 3 witches shouldn't appear again after the initial quest.
                        I liked them both but I love stories involving the three crones/fates or Gaunter O'Dimm/ the devil.
                    Its basicly the witcher in france.
        Dude I saw Blood&Wine play at the House of Blues, he's dope
You need to have the Hearts of Stone expansion. You can get the quest from a contract off of Brunwich's notice board

        I've always loved that line, it suggests that this new to the world urukhai knows
 


A) what a menu is

B) what a menu is in the context of food

C) that some items may be temporarily unavailable due to shortages


This can only mean one thing. Orc Restaurants. Orc restaurants with a varied menu.
            More like they weren't speaking english, and Black Speach has a word that basically means "things that are available for us to eat," which we translate to menu... but I'll go be fun at parties somewhere else.
                Except that the only reference that we have to the conversation would have been told to Frodo by Merry and Pippin, even in the MCU (Middlearth Cinematic Universe [TIHI]) so it must have been in a language the breakfast club could understand.

    Hard disagree 
Geralt always wanted to be a Hero, him taking jobs from people only to turn down payment when he realizes they are literally eating tree bark to avoid starvation is on brand.
Like the guy at Crows Perch who sends you to hunt the shrieker, who takes in the young son of the hunter who got torn to shreds, I think that was the first time I used the refuse payment option. 
Just like it's also on brand for him to demand extra from nobles and merchants getting rich of the war, since he's the one killing all the damn necrophages.
        Yeah, this is how I played Geralt. I would bargain for the most coin. Then refuse payment at the end of the quest. It’s not about the gold. It’s about the principle. You respect my profession so you’ll pay me all that you have. But I will refuse it based on my principles. I have enough gold from looting all the dead and the living rich.
    I disagree. I like that they’re there, and I like that they have either no or nearly no actual gameplay impact. It’s just a choice I make for myself as I’m going through the world. Even if I never exercise the choice, I can’t make any choice unless a choice is there to be made.
        [deleted]
            To be fair, Geralt did that once and then spent a very long time avoiding the actual "payment".
    Are you saying that because you always keep it or never keep it?
Well, I don't think their village qualifies for Food Stamps.

I honestly just gave up looting the bodies. You get so much money just by doing the missions it wasn't worth the time
    You're right because I'm not even that far in and have thousands. Yet I have a hard time stopping maybe its because Dutch keeps telling me "we just need more money!"
        Half the problem is so many people rush you and there are times where you will literally fail missions by trying to loop bodies instead of continuing on to the mission.
    It's only recently I've been able to play an RPG without looting everything. Of course it helped that I made a melee build so taking four sniper rifles was even less pointless.
One NPC is Skyrim yells at you if you loot her body.
    Thought it was just the armor. Don't think she objects to you taking stuff if you don't strip the corpse. But she's hard to hear sometimes so im not sure.
The courier always remembers.
    The game was rigged from the start
So really it was a kindness.. right?
    Right
Absolutely, that one was great
Is there a trick to finding a good starting point for negotiations or is it random?
    I don't think it's random but it's a set amount for each encounter. I tend to go about 3/4 of the way up and go from there
    Go ham if they are Rich/noble, go 3/4 to start if they aren’t.
        That's what I usually do, but I've met some stingy noblemen.
The idea of it is sound but it was implemented absolutely horrendously.
He killed the kikimora because he assumed people were disappearing there, and he demanded payment from the village elder who told him there's no payment because nobody has even thought it's there, despite people disappearing there. Then he tried to sell the cadaver to a wizard. He certainly didn't do it as a goodwill gesture.

I don't want so spoil you but there's no Witcher code and all witchers have emotions, it's just stuff they say to preserve a professional facade
    Yeah that was kind of my point, Geralt's code is made up so there's nothing obligating him to take payment. He hides behind it when it's convenient. 

I also saw something about him saving some merchant or something on a bridge in time or contempt and nearly dying himself, without being paid to do so? 

I'm sure there are other examples if I read them all but that's all I know of at this time. There's also the simple fact that the games are different writers so it's natural his characterization might be a little different. You can just chalk that up to time and maybe his amnesia changing his views or if simply being a different universe entirely. ¯⁠\⁠\_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

Either way I don't think it's too far fetched to see Geralt, as we know him in Witcher 3, to decline payment.
In the books he often struggles to find food.
Tldr: chaotic neutral (by the 2nd ed.).
    Honestly I'd argue chaotic good. Geralt acts according to his own sense of morality, killing evil monsters and sparing good ones. He hides behind stereotypes and a made up code to not be taken advantage of in a world that despises non-humans, including mutants like Witchers. 

He fancied himself a hero when he first set out on the Path and tried to save someone only for her to scream in fear of him over the bloodshed. Even his most popular nickname, the Butcher of Blaviken, was the result of him refusing to stay neutral and getting involved without pay - or even in spite of pay. Stregebor offered to pay him for help with Renfri and he refused, if I remember correctly. 

He also turns down contracts to kill sentient, peaceful creatures like Dudu. 

I don't think Geralt would usually turn down pay when offered by those who can clearly afford it but the times it comes up in game are when people are in desperate need themselves. I don't know if there's a situation in the books where he takes pay knowing it would leave someone unable to feed themselves, so it's hard to say defectively, but I think there's certainly an argument both ways. Enough to justify including it.
The game starts with explaining that it’s like the Witcher code or something to always require payment
    It's also not the Witcher code to cold-blood murder Whoreson Junior just for being a piece of shit but I'm still glad they gave me that option.

Yep, it's a game, not a movie.
See, the games try very hard to portray the world as faithfully as possible, only to allow the player to do the exact opposite?
    yes.
        I guess you would be fine if they also allowed the player to run around with a lightsaber? Maybe Ciri brought one from another realm as a gift
            Apples and oranges.
                It's not, Geralt is an established character, not a random Witcher or a nameless Dragonborn
                    It must be a joy in and of itself to watch you froth at the mouth about any alternate history world in a videogame.
                    Ok ok cool. BUT it’s my play through and I want to make decisions based on what I want to do, just call me a really fucking good Doppler or something possessing Geralt idc. Doesn’t mean I don’t find the canonical story or Geralt interesting, just means that the second the player is given control the story is no longer focused on being canon. We’d basically have to avoid a huge amount of the game’s content if we just wanted to *be Geralt*
                    Geralt doesn't press the X button either, he doesn't even have a controller.
                    I agree. They should remove *all* of the choices from the game, almost every single one of them had an un-character like option.

            You know what an adaptation is, yes?
            Are you kidding?

I’d pay at least $5 for lightsaber DLC.
    Book Geralt never loses a 1v1 swordfight*, do you think the game should always let you win in duels regardless of how you play?

*Except..
    Geralt is on a quest to find his kidnapped daughter but spends like 90% of the game doing other things. By making the game open world instead of linear, the character becomes “out-of-character” by default unless you speed run the game
        Also, you start off as a bit of a bitch and have to progress in the story to be on par with canon geralt's skill in combat, magic, and knowledge of monsters.
    The thing about games is that generally entertainment is gained through player agency, especially in the likes of RPGS where it is the main element next to the world you're role playing in. Yes some of them have established characters that is the player character but then you'd leave those games from being RPGs to being action adventure games. Like Commander Shepherd isn't a vindictive asshole, Geralt isn't a bloodthirsty kleptomanic, the Lone Wanderer isn't able to distance themselves from just freaking out about having their child stolen and their spouse getting murdered... but you're given the absolute choice in what you want to do and how to achieve that
Thing is, just about everyone is desperate in Witcher universe.

Especially Geralt. Games make you feel like you're filthy rich, but in the books Witchers are often hungry and regularly in debt. It's a shitty job where people are more willing to stab him in the gut and rob him than to pay for a contract.
    It's easy to turn down money in game when you already have more money than you could ever spend from loot. Geralt was never in that situation in the books, like you said.
        At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.

            2 different 12 day old accounts posting this verbatim simultaneously?
    Yeah I remember the quest where I think the dude from cat school was stabbed with a pitchfork because the villagers couldn't pay him, still I may be playing as Geralt but I make decisions based on what I would do, any choice based game I play I shape the story on my choices instead of "what the main character would do" it was the same in witcher 3, in walking dead and even rdr2 i went the honorary route
        I was sympathetic to him until I learned that this isn't the first time he did this. Later I learned that this is a pretty typical trait of Cat school Witchers since they're less stable mutations process. Really can't spare the guy.
            Yeah, unpaid bills =/= mass murder. Dude had to go.
    he actually gets quite a bit of money at one point in the books, funnily.
        And is known to have *excellent* credit. I love that Sapkowski, with a financial background before he started writing, took time in the books to explain how credit works in his universe.
    Are you actually complaining about the games for giving players the choice?

Jesus.
That's not the Witcher way BOI
Witchers don't work for free. Don't feel bad for the humans. You have more in common with monsters than you do them.
No. He is adamant about taking money when being on contract, even if there are moral reasons not to take them. 

It's for several reasons such as:

* people are begging him to help but after he turns his back they spit on him, rob him or try to kill him
* he's dislikes religious/knightly orders because they kill monsters for free, which is very bad for business as people aren't willing to pay anymore. Also because they're amateurs
* the economy in books is really not in Geralt's favour, he has a lot of debts and he's basically a hobo who does job for supper most of the time
    Got it, i misread what you'd said earlier. That makes a lot more sense
Part of the Witcher code is not offering your services for free.

I think Vesimir even brings it up fairly early in W3
    There is no actual Witcher code. In the books Geralt explicitly says he just uses the 'code' as an excuse when he doesn't feel like arguing or explaining something.
        Didn't know that, basically all my exposure to the Witcher comes from the games.
            I'd recommend checking out the books if you are interested, they are a good read.
            LPT:  Anyone that says "that's against regulations" is more or less doing the same thing.  Giving you a cheap excuse.
    Code doesn't exist but it's generally agreed upon. It kinda makes sense because that way the Witchers would just die out because hunger got em
    Ah okay, i misread what he said then.

Really? Most of the houses I looted had magic crafting materials at the very least. I frequently found that rainbow coloured rock in shacks that looked like a strong fart would knock them down.
It's honestly better than the opposite, makes crafting worthwhile and finding good gear matter but I do get you. I just hate when games give me infinite money (ahem Skyrim) and it becomes meaningless before too long. I enjoy being a destitute scrub as well as a super badass I guess.

        You don't just go barging into a Nord lady's house and grabbing their sweet rolls, what the heck is wrong with you!?
Not Witcher specific. For instance I was playing Dishonored 2 yesterday (which I love to death) and walked into a pub and started picking up coins off the counter and no one said a thing. 

I've seen some games where NPC's will make a comment about their hopelessness to stop you, which I think is even better. (not that I enjoy being reminded of my awful thievery)
They have like 4 others on their channel, and some just general video game humor stuff. Maybe with the next gen update people will be making more Witcher related things
    Yes i know i watch almost all of there stuff, i'm sorry i wasnt explicit, I meant more seasons of witcher content.
        Oh gotcha and ya that’d be sweet
I think it is different from similar games because there is an existing world and story you are walking into (if you haven't played the earlier two). However, it does a good job of being independent.

Personally, I just found the world so refreshing compared to other fantasy rpgs. The music, the environment, and the monsters all felt so unique and had so much personality. Something like skyrim, which I really enjoyed, feels dry by comparison.
Same here. First time I played I kept running around the starting area, thinking it would progress the story or I'd find something interesting. 10 hours in I did I think everything on the map and nothing really notable had happened besides the fun griffin fight. By then I was already sick of the stale combat (shield sign, sidestep, mash quick attack), I was already sick of the game. Doesn't help I like a challenge in games so I wasn't playing on normal difficulty, making combat longer.

Would like to come back to it with the next-gen update and just try to run thru it on normal difficulty and ignore a lot of the side content and excessive mobs, cause it's clearly the weak point in the game, and maybe play a sign-based build cause I found the melee pretty boring.

    I spent so much time trying to defeat it, only to eventually just google how to kill it and realized it was a glitch.  It is kind of mind boggling how a game breaking glitch like that could go so long without a patch lol.
        Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
            Easy work around. Don't die.
                Easier said than done.
No way.

That was a glitch? I'm pissed. I stopped my first playthrough because of that enemy.

I'm on my second playthrough now and I'm enjoying it much more. I've been paying attention to lore much more. Setting the combat to highest difficulty made it better too.
    Highest difficulty is for sure the best. I had played this game up to the werewolf quest on normal, stopped. Picked it up a year later started over on deathmarch and felt like a real Witcher. 

You have to know your enemy, prepare oils and bombs specifically for the enemy or you will probably lose. Where as the other difficulties you can just swing your sword to victory, which is fine I won't talk down to anyone who enjoys a single player game their own way effecting noone but themselves. But I just didn't feel like a Witcher, I could've been any generic action hero.
        man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
    I spent like over an hour trying to kill it, once i turned off enemy upscaling it was dead in like 2 seconds lol.
Same thing with rat enemies in the game. If you set enemy upscaling on, enemies like rats and wolves will do big damage and have a lot of health
The game is designed to be played at a slower pace, doing things with intention and consideration.  Hunts take thought and preparation more than raw combat.  The joy is in the immersion. 

We all get caught spamming through occasionally but it's not a design flaw to coerce you to be more deliberate
It's also a nice way of keeping track of where you've been.

Candles are lit.  Oh, been this way already.

Can get at least 2. First time playing, I countered his 20 with 24, he rebuffed and then accepted a second offer of 22

                        I cleared every single Smuggler Cache in Skelliger. Coin for days. Took a long damn time though.
        I was so mad when I learned this after my first playthrough. When I reached that part I didn't want to take the money but I was super short on coin. I wish there was a "take the money and call him an ass" option
            Personally, I played it as a Witcher always gets paid. I'm not going to fleece you but this is dangerous shit. 

Why else would i still do it if there was no gain? Not like you people are so nice and accepting to me. 

So it hurt when that's held against me. I was like witchers must always take payment circi! You know the code!
                That was my first run, a true Witcher, fuck around with me and you die. Pay what's due. I'll look the other way if you hand over coin.

This new run I'm trying to be more human, still very humiliating letting people spit on me and not doing something. 🥲
                    You first paragraph doesn't really describe Geralt to me, at all. Have you read the books?

    Doesn't directly change the ending but accepting coin from Emhyr is part of deciding what ending you get.
I played that one the least, I love blood and wine though
    The Hearts of Stone story was amazing and I would highly recommend finishing it if you ever get the time to.
        It does take a bit of persistence though. I remember thinking “Ugh, Oxenfurt? Again?” 


Obviously by the end I was fully engrossed in the story but at the beginning I was unimpressed
            I was only like that during the wedding portion where Geralt is possessed. That felt like it was taking forever for me.
                But, but that whole wedding portion was so great and memorable..

        I never did Hearts of Stone quests just because every time you go there big stuff pops up on your screen saying you’re in the DLC area (don’t remember the wording it’s been years), and that broke my immersion enough that it just wasn’t worth going there. Only DLC I did was collecting the extra gwent cards because I’m an addict 😂
    The halfing herbalist northeast of Oxenfurt gives it to you although I think you have to finish the second wish in Hearts of Stone first.

I think Hearts of Stone had the better story of the DLC's, I think it's the best 10 or so hours of story in the game. Blood and Wine is better overall though, it still has a good story but adds so much more content.
        Touissant as a whole took the game to new heights. So much content and such a beautiful place.
            I think part of it is how unique it is. Hearts of Stone had a great story and arguably the best villain in the game but it took place in a new area of an existing map so it didn't feel that unique. Toussaint is very different from everywhere else in the game and it's a nice change.
                I don't know, the three witches of the wood and their whole questline is amazing
                    It is an amazing quest but Hearts of Stone and Gaunter O'Dimm are better to me.
                    The witches of the wood are just so creepy.  Gave me shivers on my first play though, not just because they were scary monsters but the narrative.
                        It started out great and ended really silly when you actually fight them. In their bio it says they are ancient beings that existed before the conjunction of spheres and they were Godlike during their quest. But when you actually have to fight them they run around and try to slap you. And they are subservient to the Wild Hunt leaders when they're just elves from another dimension. I always thought the 3 witches shouldn't appear again after the initial quest.
                    I liked them both but I love stories involving the three crones/fates or Gaunter O'Dimm/ the devil.

Toss a coin in fact
    This guy menus.
Hard disagree 
Geralt always wanted to be a Hero, him taking jobs from people only to turn down payment when he realizes they are literally eating tree bark to avoid starvation is on brand.
Like the guy at Crows Perch who sends you to hunt the shrieker, who takes in the young son of the hunter who got torn to shreds, I think that was the first time I used the refuse payment option. 
Just like it's also on brand for him to demand extra from nobles and merchants getting rich of the war, since he's the one killing all the damn necrophages.
    Yeah, this is how I played Geralt. I would bargain for the most coin. Then refuse payment at the end of the quest. It’s not about the gold. It’s about the principle. You respect my profession so you’ll pay me all that you have. But I will refuse it based on my principles. I have enough gold from looting all the dead and the living rich.
I disagree. I like that they’re there, and I like that they have either no or nearly no actual gameplay impact. It’s just a choice I make for myself as I’m going through the world. Even if I never exercise the choice, I can’t make any choice unless a choice is there to be made.
    [deleted]
        To be fair, Geralt did that once and then spent a very long time avoiding the actual "payment".
Are you saying that because you always keep it or never keep it?

You're right because I'm not even that far in and have thousands. Yet I have a hard time stopping maybe its because Dutch keeps telling me "we just need more money!"
    Half the problem is so many people rush you and there are times where you will literally fail missions by trying to loop bodies instead of continuing on to the mission.
It's only recently I've been able to play an RPG without looting everything. Of course it helped that I made a melee build so taking four sniper rifles was even less pointless.
Thought it was just the armor. Don't think she objects to you taking stuff if you don't strip the corpse. But she's hard to hear sometimes so im not sure.
The game was rigged from the start
Right
I don't think it's random but it's a set amount for each encounter. I tend to go about 3/4 of the way up and go from there
Go ham if they are Rich/noble, go 3/4 to start if they aren’t.
    That's what I usually do, but I've met some stingy noblemen.
Yeah that was kind of my point, Geralt's code is made up so there's nothing obligating him to take payment. He hides behind it when it's convenient. 

I also saw something about him saving some merchant or something on a bridge in time or contempt and nearly dying himself, without being paid to do so? 

I'm sure there are other examples if I read them all but that's all I know of at this time. There's also the simple fact that the games are different writers so it's natural his characterization might be a little different. You can just chalk that up to time and maybe his amnesia changing his views or if simply being a different universe entirely. ¯⁠\⁠\_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

Either way I don't think it's too far fetched to see Geralt, as we know him in Witcher 3, to decline payment.
Honestly I'd argue chaotic good. Geralt acts according to his own sense of morality, killing evil monsters and sparing good ones. He hides behind stereotypes and a made up code to not be taken advantage of in a world that despises non-humans, including mutants like Witchers. 

He fancied himself a hero when he first set out on the Path and tried to save someone only for her to scream in fear of him over the bloodshed. Even his most popular nickname, the Butcher of Blaviken, was the result of him refusing to stay neutral and getting involved without pay - or even in spite of pay. Stregebor offered to pay him for help with Renfri and he refused, if I remember correctly. 

He also turns down contracts to kill sentient, peaceful creatures like Dudu. 

I don't think Geralt would usually turn down pay when offered by those who can clearly afford it but the times it comes up in game are when people are in desperate need themselves. I don't know if there's a situation in the books where he takes pay knowing it would leave someone unable to feed themselves, so it's hard to say defectively, but I think there's certainly an argument both ways. Enough to justify including it.
It's also not the Witcher code to cold-blood murder Whoreson Junior just for being a piece of shit but I'm still glad they gave me that option.
I am the Neravarine and I need these bowls to save the world!
    *the threads of fate have been severed* (I can’t remember if that’s the message you get when being too bad but it is at least similar!)
        Back in the day when there was no such thing as an essential npc and you could doom them world.
            If you wanna stock up on health potions and fortifying strength drinks and kill Vivec (an actual god), more power to you. It'll ruin the entire main story arc but you can do it, damnit.
yes.
    I guess you would be fine if they also allowed the player to run around with a lightsaber? Maybe Ciri brought one from another realm as a gift
        Apples and oranges.
            It's not, Geralt is an established character, not a random Witcher or a nameless Dragonborn
                It must be a joy in and of itself to watch you froth at the mouth about any alternate history world in a videogame.
                Ok ok cool. BUT it’s my play through and I want to make decisions based on what I want to do, just call me a really fucking good Doppler or something possessing Geralt idc. Doesn’t mean I don’t find the canonical story or Geralt interesting, just means that the second the player is given control the story is no longer focused on being canon. We’d basically have to avoid a huge amount of the game’s content if we just wanted to *be Geralt*
                Geralt doesn't press the X button either, he doesn't even have a controller.
                I agree. They should remove *all* of the choices from the game, almost every single one of them had an un-character like option.

                    I was upset about the show but not because of non-white actors.

First season was okay-ish, second was complete shitshow
        You know what an adaptation is, yes?
        Are you kidding?

I’d pay at least $5 for lightsaber DLC.
Book Geralt never loses a 1v1 swordfight*, do you think the game should always let you win in duels regardless of how you play?

*Except..
Geralt is on a quest to find his kidnapped daughter but spends like 90% of the game doing other things. By making the game open world instead of linear, the character becomes “out-of-character” by default unless you speed run the game
    Also, you start off as a bit of a bitch and have to progress in the story to be on par with canon geralt's skill in combat, magic, and knowledge of monsters.
The thing about games is that generally entertainment is gained through player agency, especially in the likes of RPGS where it is the main element next to the world you're role playing in. Yes some of them have established characters that is the player character but then you'd leave those games from being RPGs to being action adventure games. Like Commander Shepherd isn't a vindictive asshole, Geralt isn't a bloodthirsty kleptomanic, the Lone Wanderer isn't able to distance themselves from just freaking out about having their child stolen and their spouse getting murdered... but you're given the absolute choice in what you want to do and how to achieve that
It's easy to turn down money in game when you already have more money than you could ever spend from loot. Geralt was never in that situation in the books, like you said.
    At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.

            There’s another one too.
        Did you know that Zelder is a boy?
        2 different 12 day old accounts posting this verbatim simultaneously?
Yeah I remember the quest where I think the dude from cat school was stabbed with a pitchfork because the villagers couldn't pay him, still I may be playing as Geralt but I make decisions based on what I would do, any choice based game I play I shape the story on my choices instead of "what the main character would do" it was the same in witcher 3, in walking dead and even rdr2 i went the honorary route
    I was sympathetic to him until I learned that this isn't the first time he did this. Later I learned that this is a pretty typical trait of Cat school Witchers since they're less stable mutations process. Really can't spare the guy.
        Yeah, unpaid bills =/= mass murder. Dude had to go.
he actually gets quite a bit of money at one point in the books, funnily.
    And is known to have *excellent* credit. I love that Sapkowski, with a financial background before he started writing, took time in the books to explain how credit works in his universe.
Are you actually complaining about the games for giving players the choice?

Jesus.
Got it, i misread what you'd said earlier. That makes a lot more sense
There is no actual Witcher code. In the books Geralt explicitly says he just uses the 'code' as an excuse when he doesn't feel like arguing or explaining something.
    Didn't know that, basically all my exposure to the Witcher comes from the games.
        I'd recommend checking out the books if you are interested, they are a good read.
        LPT:  Anyone that says "that's against regulations" is more or less doing the same thing.  Giving you a cheap excuse.
Code doesn't exist but it's generally agreed upon. It kinda makes sense because that way the Witchers would just die out because hunger got em
Ah okay, i misread what he said then.
No idea what that means, or why my comment was downvoted.

Why the fuck is Reddit supporting the mob and banks now?
    Definitely what that means. The reddit hive mind has decided it likes the mob and banks. No other possibilities
Playing unmodded skyrim would bug me. Like I'm the mother fucking dragon born, you were there when I saved the city. I found your long lost son. I'm sorry I touched your sweet roll instead of talking to you. Are you REALLY going to attack me over this?
    You don't just go barging into a Nord lady's house and grabbing their sweet rolls, what the heck is wrong with you!?
Yes i know i watch almost all of there stuff, i'm sorry i wasnt explicit, I meant more seasons of witcher content.
    Oh gotcha and ya that’d be sweet
+1 for a very diplomatic response
I spent so much time trying to defeat it, only to eventually just google how to kill it and realized it was a glitch.  It is kind of mind boggling how a game breaking glitch like that could go so long without a patch lol.
    Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
        Easy work around. Don't die.
            Easier said than done.
Highest difficulty is for sure the best. I had played this game up to the werewolf quest on normal, stopped. Picked it up a year later started over on deathmarch and felt like a real Witcher. 

You have to know your enemy, prepare oils and bombs specifically for the enemy or you will probably lose. Where as the other difficulties you can just swing your sword to victory, which is fine I won't talk down to anyone who enjoys a single player game their own way effecting noone but themselves. But I just didn't feel like a Witcher, I could've been any generic action hero.
    man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
I spent like over an hour trying to kill it, once i turned off enemy upscaling it was dead in like 2 seconds lol.

Yeah, this is how I played Geralt. I would bargain for the most coin. Then refuse payment at the end of the quest. It’s not about the gold. It’s about the principle. You respect my profession so you’ll pay me all that you have. But I will refuse it based on my principles. I have enough gold from looting all the dead and the living rich.

    To be fair, Geralt did that once and then spent a very long time avoiding the actual "payment".
The other reindeers’ parties just never held up.
Every 5 seconds

"OVER HERE ARTHUR." "WE GOTTA GO ARTHUR" "WHY ARE YOU WAITING ARTHUR LETS GO"
Half the problem is so many people rush you and there are times where you will literally fail missions by trying to loop bodies instead of continuing on to the mission.
That's what I usually do, but I've met some stingy noblemen.
*the threads of fate have been severed* (I can’t remember if that’s the message you get when being too bad but it is at least similar!)
    Back in the day when there was no such thing as an essential npc and you could doom them world.
        If you wanna stock up on health potions and fortifying strength drinks and kill Vivec (an actual god), more power to you. It'll ruin the entire main story arc but you can do it, damnit.
I guess you would be fine if they also allowed the player to run around with a lightsaber? Maybe Ciri brought one from another realm as a gift
    Apples and oranges.
        It's not, Geralt is an established character, not a random Witcher or a nameless Dragonborn
            It must be a joy in and of itself to watch you froth at the mouth about any alternate history world in a videogame.
            Ok ok cool. BUT it’s my play through and I want to make decisions based on what I want to do, just call me a really fucking good Doppler or something possessing Geralt idc. Doesn’t mean I don’t find the canonical story or Geralt interesting, just means that the second the player is given control the story is no longer focused on being canon. We’d basically have to avoid a huge amount of the game’s content if we just wanted to *be Geralt*
            Geralt doesn't press the X button either, he doesn't even have a controller.
            I agree. They should remove *all* of the choices from the game, almost every single one of them had an un-character like option.

                I was upset about the show but not because of non-white actors.

First season was okay-ish, second was complete shitshow
    You know what an adaptation is, yes?
    Are you kidding?

I’d pay at least $5 for lightsaber DLC.
Also, you start off as a bit of a bitch and have to progress in the story to be on par with canon geralt's skill in combat, magic, and knowledge of monsters.
At least you don't break their shit like Zelda does.

        There’s another one too.
    Did you know that Zelder is a boy?
    2 different 12 day old accounts posting this verbatim simultaneously?
I was sympathetic to him until I learned that this isn't the first time he did this. Later I learned that this is a pretty typical trait of Cat school Witchers since they're less stable mutations process. Really can't spare the guy.
    Yeah, unpaid bills =/= mass murder. Dude had to go.
And is known to have *excellent* credit. I love that Sapkowski, with a financial background before he started writing, took time in the books to explain how credit works in his universe.
Didn't know that, basically all my exposure to the Witcher comes from the games.
    I'd recommend checking out the books if you are interested, they are a good read.
    LPT:  Anyone that says "that's against regulations" is more or less doing the same thing.  Giving you a cheap excuse.
Definitely what that means. The reddit hive mind has decided it likes the mob and banks. No other possibilities
You don't just go barging into a Nord lady's house and grabbing their sweet rolls, what the heck is wrong with you!?
Oh gotcha and ya that’d be sweet
Dude remnant from the ashes has a glitch in CO-OP where if you die in the snowy place the revive mechanic doesn't work.
    Easy work around. Don't die.
        Easier said than done.
man one of those wherewolf quests had me stumped for like an hour because I didn't realize you had to like equip and feed it it's own flesh. I somehow totally missed that, and couldn't understand why it kept respawning after I killed it.
Redstone is good for marking turns.

        I honestly thought that was just me doing that, I’m crushed

    I do the same, but on the left going in. Then I follow the "right way out."
I put all my torches on the right side so I know im making my way back if they're on my left.
Until you branch to often and you go in circles trying to get out.
I don't remember all candles being unlit but within the kinds of places you explore I could see that being the case
Tied up in glocks.

Bang, bang, bang, bang!
Everything is liquid on a sufficiently large timescale!

Well, fluid, but most people can't call you out on the difference off the top of their head.
    Of course! Liquid is cash and fluid are the regulations governing wall street... Who doesn't know that?
It wasn't even a lot of money either
    It was like 1000 crowns.
        Bruh that grandmaster armor won't pay for itself.
            Bitch, you could spend 15 minutes in skellige farming swords for more than this.
                ThAts sTIll 15 mInuTes tHO!
                I cleared every single Smuggler Cache in Skelliger. Coin for days. Took a long damn time though.
I was so mad when I learned this after my first playthrough. When I reached that part I didn't want to take the money but I was super short on coin. I wish there was a "take the money and call him an ass" option
    Personally, I played it as a Witcher always gets paid. I'm not going to fleece you but this is dangerous shit. 

Why else would i still do it if there was no gain? Not like you people are so nice and accepting to me. 

So it hurt when that's held against me. I was like witchers must always take payment circi! You know the code!
        That was my first run, a true Witcher, fuck around with me and you die. Pay what's due. I'll look the other way if you hand over coin.

This new run I'm trying to be more human, still very humiliating letting people spit on me and not doing something. 🥲
            You first paragraph doesn't really describe Geralt to me, at all. Have you read the books?
                Geralt is my favorite Witcher but tbf he isn't standard. The rest of them feel a lot closer to OP's playthrough.
It does take a bit of persistence though. I remember thinking “Ugh, Oxenfurt? Again?” 


Obviously by the end I was fully engrossed in the story but at the beginning I was unimpressed
    I was only like that during the wedding portion where Geralt is possessed. That felt like it was taking forever for me.
        But, but that whole wedding portion was so great and memorable..

    Could you imagine if Zelda was a girl? Totally unladylike to walk into strangers homes and break their pots.
        Zelda… is a girl?
            Nah they are talking about the MC from legend of zelda. cause you caan break pots etc in most games.  its known as "doing a zelda" usually
I never did Hearts of Stone quests just because every time you go there big stuff pops up on your screen saying you’re in the DLC area (don’t remember the wording it’s been years), and that broke my immersion enough that it just wasn’t worth going there. Only DLC I did was collecting the extra gwent cards because I’m an addict 😂
Touissant as a whole took the game to new heights. So much content and such a beautiful place.
    I think part of it is how unique it is. Hearts of Stone had a great story and arguably the best villain in the game but it took place in a new area of an existing map so it didn't feel that unique. Toussaint is very different from everywhere else in the game and it's a nice change.
        I don't know, the three witches of the wood and their whole questline is amazing
            It is an amazing quest but Hearts of Stone and Gaunter O'Dimm are better to me.
            The witches of the wood are just so creepy.  Gave me shivers on my first play though, not just because they were scary monsters but the narrative.
                It started out great and ended really silly when you actually fight them. In their bio it says they are ancient beings that existed before the conjunction of spheres and they were Godlike during their quest. But when you actually have to fight them they run around and try to slap you. And they are subservient to the Wild Hunt leaders when they're just elves from another dimension. I always thought the 3 witches shouldn't appear again after the initial quest.
            I liked them both but I love stories involving the three crones/fates or Gaunter O'Dimm/ the devil.
        Its basicly the witcher in france.
More like they weren't speaking english, and Black Speach has a word that basically means "things that are available for us to eat," which we translate to menu... but I'll go be fun at parties somewhere else.
    Except that the only reference that we have to the conversation would have been told to Frodo by Merry and Pippin, even in the MCU (Middlearth Cinematic Universe [TIHI]) so it must have been in a language the breakfast club could understand.
