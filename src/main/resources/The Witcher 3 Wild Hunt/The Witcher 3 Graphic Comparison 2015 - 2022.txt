[[The Witcher 3 Graphic Comparison 2015 - 2022]]





Honestly the biggest improvement here is that you can now easily tell that the zigzag patterned wall is actually in the background because of proper shadowing.  In the original picture, with out a sense of perspective from camera motion it looks flush with the overhang.
    That was the craziest thing I noticed too. It almost looks like an optical illusion in how much the lighting messes with depth perception yet this was obviously standard at the time.
        It certainly is crazy how lighting can really impact a video game's scene.
            I mean, everything we see in the real world is literally lighting, so it's not that crazy.
            I would say this day and age lighting has theb biggest impact.
    The lighting is way better in general.
    I hear the biggest improvement might actually be with the controls and camera. The Witcher 3 is still a pretty damn good looking game, even by today‚Äôs standards,but the controls were always clunky.
        You can tell it's not 2015/2016 anymore because you didn't get downvoted for saying that.
            I‚Äôm playing it for the first time now. Apparently there is was a a hot topic at one point. 

I just learned about the new movement setting 5 min ago.
    Thanks for pointing that out as I wasn't too impressed otherwise with the graphics update.
At least it's free upgrade unlike some other game companies.
    Skyrim aint gonna buy itself on every platform...
        To be fair Skyrim had a free update on Ps5 Xbox Series X/S unlike GTA V.
            They're letting any plans of an rdr2 update or remaster rot in a ditch iirc because of how poorly received the GTA remake was alongside how GTA online sells stupid dlc like hotcakes so why even bother updating rdr.
                it's insane to me, that they somehow believe it's due to lack of interest in remasters or remakes.. but in reality, the GTA trilogy was a fucking desaster. pressed on disc. it was doomed the moment someone decided it was okay to release it like that.


dude i am so in for red dead redemption 1 and an upgrade for 2 to next gen.
4k and 60 fps very needed for both.


the rdr1 remaster leaks looked very good to me. would buy it day 1 if it's not filled and a complete mess like the gta trilogy was.



edit: after some additional research to the rdr1 remaster topic; unfortunately it appears to have been a fan-mod of the xbox 360 version running in an emulator... at least that's what a few sources say. so the remaster of rdr1 wasn't real after all it seems.
                Man what I would give for a GTA 3D universe remake that's playable for someone born this millineum
                    Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
                Why would we need rdr2 update? That game still look gorgeous.
                    I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
                        And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
                            The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
                        All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
            Skyrim gets a lot of flack for the stream of re-release but at least they usually had some content differences involved. Regular, GOTY, Special, and Anniversary
        I'm waiting for skyrim to be part of windows
            Instead of Windows 12 it‚Äôll just be Windows Skyrim. In order to login you have to get through Helgen

                    That would be quite the surprise after updating windows

        Skyrim had a free update to sse and then ae (without the full cc package) if you owned it already
            Right? I bought Skyrim from GameStop midnight release. It was just a steam key. 11 years later I have gotten all of the updates (SSE AND NOW AE) for absolutely free. Fucking good value.
                As good a game the witcher is, it'll never outlive Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game. It's a game engine and modders' playground.
                    Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
                        Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
                            For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
                Same, and with all of the mods out there, at least on PC, the game still looks pretty badass even today imo.

                Tbf, if you bought it past 2013/2014, you'd most likely be buying the Legendary Edition, which had all the DLC. Usually was around $20. They delisted it when SE came out so you couldn't just buy the old one that way anymore, which is a little wack, but SE runs so much better and has all the DLC as well, so.
                I mean, it was 3 DLCs, and two of them were full on expansions and the other regularly hit rock bottom prices and was necessary for a fair number of good mods.

If you had any interest in skyrim and didn't own the DLC already you were doing yourself a massive disservice.
        I did get a free Skyrim upgrade years ago.
        If we're fair about Skyrim, it did get some engine upgrades that do technically make it a different game.
    [deleted]
        It started with shark cards and is now at paying for 60fps
        I got the 2020 edition ot gta 4 and it is a total joke man. No character audio at all. I contact them and they want me to get buy the newer version from their website
    I only own this on pc, can I buy a PS4 disc like other games and put it in PS5 to get the free upgrade?
        I'm pretty positive that is correct, yes.
        The pc version gets the free upgrade also fyi.
    Seriously, if even a company as money grubbing as Ubisoft can do free next gen updates, everyone should
It's funny, because the upgrade looks like what I remember it looking like when I played it a few years ago, which is obviously incorrect.

Still, pretty good for a free update.
    This is honestly how I remembered Goldeneye for N64. Then I went back and played it and my god were the graphics terrible. But in my mind that game blew me away at the time. Crazy how that works with stuff like this.

Edit: guys I get it. After 1k comments about CRT TV's I think everyone here knows they were better for old games. Thanks.
        I played half life 2 for the first time as a kid in probably 2010. I turned to my dad after getting through Route Kanal and said "this game looks just like real life!" He laughed.
            I wish I still had the eyes of a child. But they fell out of my pocket when I went for a walk the other day so I'll have to find some new ones.
                I had the eyes of a child at one time. Shortly after my parents divorce i realized they were going to buy my love so i did what any kid of the mid 90s would do, i made sure they bought me every video game and console i saw. One day after svhool i was playing my virtual boy. My dad bought this thing and my mom hated it, she was sure i was going to go blind. For the uninitiated, virtual boy was designed like the oculus and played 3d games on 32 bit. THIRTYTWO BIT. This was circa 96/97 because i didnt have my 64 or jaguar yet. So i strapped this thing on my head and decided to start playing warioland because it was new and i wanted to escape for several hours. Well noone told me the battery life on my new virtual boy was trash. Like 3 or 4 hours and the thing was dead so i took it off and then i realized all my mothers fears had come true. The batteries hadnt died. I had fucking gone blind. I couldnt see a fucking thing. I was panicking. The pure fear set in i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe. Little 7 year old me knew he couldnt live life without vision. So i did what any child would do. I cried. Not quietly, no, i sobbed loudly. My brother came into the room to tell me to shut the fuck up and thats when i realized, i hadnt gone blind. It had just gotten dark outside and i had no lights on. I was a dumb child. Im a pretty dumb adult.
                    Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
                        Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

                                Did the same. I've been had so many times I feel shame now when it happens.

                    If it makes you feel any better, one morning when I was around 16 or 17, I woke up after a solid night of drinking thinking that I had somehow had sight miraculously restored in one eye.   

I had just not taken out that contact lens the night before...

                    This reminds me of the time I was watching tmnt the movie(the proper 90s one) Ona crt is the room was bright I fell asleep and when I woke up the tape must of eneded and the tv switched off the room was pitch black I fucking panicked ‚Ä¶ I was like 20 but I was certain I‚Äôd woke up blind

                For a while after doing shrooms I had this. Once I was walking along the river in my city and actually stopped and was awed just by the way the sun was reflecting off the buildings.

I think we can train ourselves to have this view. Just gotta focus on the little details.

            Half Life 2's graphics have held up enormously well though. You can cherry pick some of the canal and still find photo-real scenes (which fall apart if you get close, yes).

NPC asset quality and facial animations are still 2nd to very very few. It also somehow avoid the "plastic shiny" feel a lot of hyper modern engines have.

The entire lighting system in that game was "pre-baked" and the pre-baker used a lot of raytracing for the "globally illuminated" look. Ahead of its time and hella efficient. Lots of games without dynamic time of day copied the method for the next two decades.
                Textures in HL2 have this inherent grittiness unique to it. It really does feel more real than most things released since. Like you mentioned, so many games feel almost *too* perfect and refined. Everything looks shiny, clean, and fake. HL2, partially because it was a post apocalyptic game, had this ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù to it that I haven‚Äôt seen replicated perfectly since. I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
                    g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
                        All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
                            Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
                                Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                                    If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
                    It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
                Going back and playing HL2 or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines it‚Äôs just insane how good the facial animations were, there‚Äôs games that come out 20+ years later that still somehow fuck it up.
                 the best water I've seen in any game
                    It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
                I played Portal raytraced and thought this is basically how I rememeber Portal looking when it came out.  It ran so badly however that I then ran the original Portal, and I finished it again it was so good. The game still holds up great, but the lighting, materials and textures look like something out of Quake 2.

It really make you appreciate how much accurate lighting, shadows and nice materials can change a game.
                The first engine I saw using pre-baked lighting that had path-trace (and surface-illumination) was in Quake 2 from 1997. Its resolution was quite crude compared to Half-Life 2, which resulted in some fairly chunky shadows. Generating these lightmaps back then was a *slow* process.

The Source engine has its roots in a branch of the original Quake's codebase, so it makes sense that bounced lighting could be easily implemented. Not sure if the original Half-Life games incorporated that...
                the way you describe how modern games look is exactly what i always felt looking at them but i couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. yeah, they look like plastic. it doesn‚Äôt look real. like for example bf5 looks much worse compared to bf1 because everything looks plasticy and featureless
            HL2 holds up *exceptionally* well. A lot of it is from the textures -- I don't know how to describe it, but there is a "coherence" among every texture that nothing looked particularly out of place. 

Compare it to say Black Mesa, BM might have much higher resolution textures, but a lot of them somehow looked "flat" and cartoonish, a bit like the "HD texture pack for minecraft" memes.
                A good art direction goes much further for making a visually stunning game than brute forcing it with higher res textures, models, and graphic tech.
                I just played through Portal with RTX and the whole time I thought, of all games, Portal doesn't need this. The original was done so well because the aesthetics were clean and the engine handled light and reflection pretty well to begin with.
                    Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
                        >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.
                https://youtu.be/mnxs6CR6Zrk

I'm not 100% sure but I think this video touches on why HL2 looks so good. Pretty interesting video regardless if you're into that kind of thing
            I think it has do with the fact we tie it to experiential memory. "I was going through this alley and a face hugger popped up, so I used my gravity gun to catch and release a barrel right in it's face!" It ties in all the emotional energy you may have had and whatever associations the images first game you all get linked like a custom circuit. (I am not a neruologist!)

Gaming is a live experience, and thus gets filed away differently.
                I think they're also a highly comparative medium. Graphics that are contemporaneously considered cutting edge tend to remain that way in ours heads because at the time we can't imagine anything looking better so our memories of them get updated as modern graphics improve. Plus the immersive nature of video games means the best of them make us feel like they're actually happening in a sense. 

I remember playing Spidey PS4 and thinking this is exactly how I remember Spider-man 2 on the PS2 looking. Even more recently when I first saw the Dead Space Remake gameplay I was almost disappointed at what I considered a lack of real improvement. I really thought I was looking at a remaster more than a ground up remake. Then they showed the comparison to the original side by side and my jaw dropped at just how dated the original looked. Memory is a funny thing.
                    Halo MCC has a toggle to switch between the remastered and original graphics. It's a trip to go back and forth between them.
                        Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
                            You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
                            For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
                Absolutely- similar to the way we remember stories in books which have no images at all (well, maybe illustrations)
                VR is a whole different ballgame with regards to immersion and memories. After I played HL Alyx I could think back to certain scenes or set pieces in the game and it really felt like an actual memory, like I'd really lived it. It was super weird.
            I remember getting a PS1 and Tomb Raider III for Christmas in the late nineties, then booting it up on my old big ass TV and being like "wow, it will never get any more realistic than this," polygon everything (boobs) and all.
            Honestly I think HL2 still looks great. Black Mesa has great assets and you can tell the difference when you look but while you're playing it's very easy to forget that the game came out 15 years ago.
            My uncle was playing Madden 2005 or something around that time
 My grandfather came into the room and said he couldn't tell if it was real football or a video game. We all agreed.
            I mean, half life two still looks pretty freaking good.
            The game still looks very good though.
            It was an amazing looking game for it's time. Shit, it still looks good.
            HL2 still holds up
            HL2 still looks good. It has aged better than most games. I plays it though like every other year. Last two times hs been in VR.
        That's how ES oblivion for me was, I was playing the NES games for a while so when I saw a friend play Oblivion I never saw a game look so realistic. Then I played it again years later a bit after Skyrim came out and the difference was insane.
            I remember looking at Oblivion when it was new and also thinking "games will never look better than this" 

I think part of it is that it was a new game for the 360, where as ps2/OGXbox games still had a pretty blocky look to them (although it was an improvement over PS1 games) so a game engine being able to convey roundness seemed like a graphical breakthrough. and oh man... were those faces [round](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/elderscrolls/Newheim_the_Portly.jpg)
                I said that once. "graphics will never be better than this!" That was for battle arena toshindan ü§£
                    Star Wars Battlefront II for me. I don‚Äôt even think they were that good but I remember being like ¬´¬†damn it feels like I‚Äôm on Kashyyk rn¬†¬ª
                Im playing oblivion at 4k 60 on my series x and I'm still impressed by the graphics. The textures on the walls and design of the environments are pretty impressive for 2006. Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad, but that wouldn't have been much of an issue at 720p.
                    >Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad

I actually think the opposite. Oblivion at a distance looks like a painting (even today), it's just when you get up close and see the character models and animations that it starts to show it's age.
                        Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
                            Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
                            The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
                        I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
                Stepping out of the sewers for the first time...god what an unforgettable feeling. Being in awe of the colors and the water and the Ayleid ruin across the lake.
        I guess our brains have built in anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion lol

It's funny how that works. I had the same experience with Ocarina of Time. When ZFG streams it it's beautifully upscaled and looks great, just how I remembered it. When I saw how it actually looked back on the N64 I was blown away.

Maybe any game memories that stick around that long get confused with "real" memories and our brains kinda make them fit more closely to real life.

                Very good point. I started thinking about that when I saw a recent frontpage post with comparisons of the same sprites on CRT vs modern monitors. CRT even seems to add the illusion of shadows, if the sprites are designed for it.
                I used to have a 21‚Äù Sun monitor that weighed over 70 damn pounds.  Amazing picture.  Probably would have kept it well into the flat-panel era if it just didn‚Äôt weigh so much.
            Our brains also have auto fps increase too, i remember first watching a 60fps video a decade+ ago and thought nothing could be better.

            Yea but even playing Goldeneye again after playing Halo or Splinter Cell on the og Xbox made it look rough.
                Splinter cell looked unbelievably good at the time
                    It really did look good. That 5 or so year period between N64 games and Xbox stuff was an insane jump compared to the difference in 5 year old games today.

The 3rd game, Chaos Theory, is still one of my all-time favorites. Man it is a bummer that Splinter Cell is basically dead as a franchise and we probably won't be getting a new Splinter Cell for a long, long time. Like, Ubisoft has Ghost Recon and Assassins Creed, combine the concepts into a modern open-world stealth/stealth action game, it would probably have a huge audience.
            Man, like a decade ago, someone left a late model crt outside to be picked up as trash. My friends and I grabbed it, hauled it into my buddies house, pulled out the old SNES and spent the next few days beating mega man X before putting the tv back out on the curb to be picked up with the trash.

SNES games looked stunning on it. It was a very late CRT, flat screen rather than curved like cheaper ones but thiiiic and extremely heavy.

Same friend bought a neo geo arcade unit a few years later with a crt screen. Definitely looks good.
            Its not so much that CRT display them batter, but that the pixels were never meant to be displayed sharply. Filters can replicate the look perfectly fine. The issue is more that a lot of people never played them back on CRT and don't realize how they should display.
        I remember seeing NFL 2k for Dreamcast in a Babbages and thinking it was a live NFL game on TV. I was convinced that was the peak of what games could look like.
            I remember buying that game,  and everybody who saw it thought it was real. Showed it to my boss who only played pc games,  and he went and picked up a dreamcast that day.
            To be fair visual concepts did an outstanding job.  No Madden can hold a candle to 2K5 and I‚Äôm still angry about it all.  Fuck EA.
        Honestly that is probably because you played it on a CRT and then went back and played it on an LED tv.
            No, this is a pretty common phenomenon. Our minds fill in detail that was never there.
                Both are true, old games really did look better‚Ä¶but only on CRTs. That ever so slight blur and image distortion helped. The sprites of 2D games and textures of 3D games often look like absolute ass on HD LEDs, way worse than they originally looked.
                    It‚Äôs not so much that the CRT blur inherently helped, it‚Äôs that it was quantifiable and things from that era were designed with it in mind. You take those unmodified inputs and put them in a different context and what had been carefully designed to blend in sticks out badly.
    >Still, pretty good for a free update.

Yeah, most other devs would've just sold the game again.

Yeah I'm talking about you Rockstar.
        *Bethesda enters the chat*
            If you had Skyrim LE, the SE game was completely free. If you have SE, you get the Anniversary Edition patches + 4 CC content for free.
                Just wait until you want to play in VR.
            Get out!
                Go on! Git!
                    Yeah git, ok another terrible vr port which you lean on modders to ‚ÄúFIX,‚Äù but after that yew GITONOUTAHERE
                        I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
                    Hey we have the same face!
                They can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs an object in the way of the door; you have to glitch yourself out until the community creates a patch to fix it!
            SE was free on PC (console wasn‚Äôt back compat at the time), and Anniversary was free on both (with option bundle of all Creation club content)
            Bethesda is actually doing this exact same thing with Fallout 4. Total next-gen face-lift for free, sometime in the spring.
        And Atlus. They have sold us P5 like 5 times already.
            P5 in name? Yeah. Actual just P5? 3 times. Vanilla p5, 1sr release of Royal, then the ports this year.
            They just released it for platforms that never had it to begin with???? Royal is different from the first and adds like 40 hours??? Strikers and the Rhythm game are just completely different games.
            And Bethesda, Skyrim on every electronic device...still waiting for our god Todd Howard to release it on some fucking smart toaster.
                The upgrade to SE, VR and AE were all free if you bought the original game. Don't be dishonest.
                    dishonestly is all these people know. Reddit hates Bethesda, so why tell the truth when you can lie and get infinite upvotes
                        It's the worst kind of lazy.
                            well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(
            It would be worth checking the data but I feel like the majority of remastered, repackaged games have been coming from Japanese devs. Not to say that Western devs haven‚Äôt put a lot of those too.
                Interesting point there, I haven't thought about it myself. If there's a good and kinda necessary remaster, I'm down for it. Otherwise is just reselling the same game.
                    To be fair, some of it is also due to the lack of backward compatibility and a lot of ports from handheld titles which were more popular in Japan than in the West.
        Maybe they realized they have some good will to buy back.
            Nah, CDPR has always done stuff like this. It's just nobody noticed until W3 because that was the first one to be popular
        Naughty Dog sold the last of us remaster even more expensive than the original lol
            The PS5 *remake* costs more than the original, which is fair. A ton of work was needed to complete it.
         Cries in Skyrim special legendary maximum super edition 5.
            All of Skyrims upgrades were free when they were able to give them for free.
    Your mind is the best gpu out there
        You make a wonderful argument in favor of books
            That's why it can be so disappointing to watch film adaptations of your favorite books. I usually have different images of characters in my mind than the movie version. But I guess that also makes it super satisfying when the two versions align.
                Preach, brother / sister. I read TLoTR annually until the Jackson films came out, then it was once a decade because I had *his* images in my head instead of my own.
                    I take it you dislike Peter Jackson's vision? Care to elaborate on the why?
                        [deleted]
                            This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.
            [deleted]
                Their hardware just didn't come with drivers okay
            Except I got integrated graphics when it comes to books
    Yeah. People just look more sweaty in the 2022 compared to my memories of the game
        That's climate change for ya.
        its raining in both pics, so yeah, I hope rain effects look better.
        Every year the NBA 2k trailer is just them showing the players with more sweat
    Not to be a buzzkill, but the right image is more or less what the current-gen version looks like right now on my PC. Granted, we didn't have 3070s in 2015, but still.
        Yeah these are screenshots from like 5 years ago, on a 1080ti
https://imgur.com/a/eCfNU
        I mean I'm playing with several HD and other graphical mods so ... My game *does* more or less look like the right side.
            On top of that, today they announced the update uses some the more popular texture mods. Aside from the lighting updates, if you use any of those mods, you‚Äôre not far off.
                Excellent. Why wouldn‚Äôt they use mods that offer a better experience? Other companies should take note.

If it wasn‚Äôt free.. different story but here we are.
                    If the quality is there, why do the work again? It must be cheaper too. n designers being paid x dollars for however many months of work vs. offering the mod‚Äôs creator a flat free for use in perpetuity. Any mod creator would probably be so thrilled at the idea of their work being used by the company who created the game they loved enough to mod that they‚Äôd take a few grand.
                    Please no. That will very quickly lead to buyable mods and the death of free mods
        Plus the left image looks like it was taken on a 720p or below screen. It's way more blurry and blocky than it needed to be when the Witcher 3 launched.

I'm sure the update looks great. Really bad comparison though.
    That‚Äôs what‚Äôs is sweet about keeping the original art style. So many games go ahead and push everything further down the technological line while also changing the art in the process, The Last of Us Part 1 for example. The Witcher 3 kept the same art style while putting in new assets and modern techniques. Looks great nothing ground breaking but the polish is free and helps it hold up.
    As someone who played it on PC, the next gen version looks like the PC ( with mods) version

Edit: This isn‚Äôt a dig at the next-gen version! I am excited and looking forward to playing it again !
        This. I took me a while to find this comment but this is exactly what it looks like on PC with mods. Just the common ones, nothing fancy.
    Kinda like Switch version on the left and PC version on the right.
    tbf this is for every game after several years, especially our childhood games, good god the graphics suck ass compared to now, but they always looke realistic as fuck back then
    Might not be so incorrect. PC or console? Graphic settings? It absolutely could look like the one on the right in 2015, if you weren't, say, playing on medium and no hairworks.
    I'm currently playing the PC version for the first time. Looks like it's the GOG version. No mods or hacks or anything. It looks **a lot** more like the picture on the right than then left.
        Of course it does. The picture on the left is probably off a PS4, compressed about 20 times and from one of the few moments the game shits the bed lighting wise.
    Gotta pick the fine, overlooked, details to pay attention to. I vividly remember being impressed by the 3D rock textures outside of Michael's house in GTAV on 360 just after launch, but just before the next-gen release, those rocks suddenly became a flat low-geometry blob. They deliberately downgraded the visuals so the next-gen release would look even better in comparison.
    Yeah whenever I see a new game trailer, I think to myself that graphics have kind of stagnated over the past 10 years, and that there are games from 10 years that look about as good as games today (Battlefield 3/4 and Crysis 3 are the first to come to mind). Then I go and actually play those games, and while some things haven‚Äôt improved all that much (foliage and textures), the difference is night and day.
    Funny, I was thinking the original looked pretty good for almost 9 years ago now
    Well I think on PC, especially with the mods, the upgrade is probably less of a leap - similair thing happened to Alan Wake Remastered, where the leap was even smaller.
    Low effort update in my opinion. Mainly just including mods modders made and recreating other mods. They didn't even bother updating the fire sprites because it would've required actual work.
    I just came to say the same thing, i ran it on my evga 970 and it looked like that, but when i went to the 1080 that was definitely when my mind was truly blown.
    Hell I've been playing it for the last couple or months and even right now and in my memory it already looks like the upgraded version
Random character models hardly capture the beauty of Witcher 3. The game was at its most striking in dusk and night scenes with tons of foliage and subtle movement or lighting
    or just wondering through the Skellige mainland, damn that was gorgeous
        They could've released Skellige or Blood & Wine as standalone games and I think it would've been a success,
            Blood & Wine is peak Witcher 3 for me. Such an absolutely gorgeous area and great epilogue for Geralt.

Look forward to seeing updated Toussaint.
                There's a part of me that hopes they don't bring back Geralt in the next game, at least not in a major way. Him settling down on his farm living a life of luxury is such a perfect end after all the shit he's been through.
                    It would be funny if the game took you to Geralt's farm and you get to see him mucking about, randomly lighting and snuffing out torches while cursing a nearby chest, yelling at Roach to get off the roof, and being chased across the yard by horny witches. Instead of killing monsters himself he sends you off on quests to kill them for him because he's so done with that life, and rewards you with one of his old swords.
                        He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
                            But he's all fucked up from fighting.
                        >and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
                        It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
                            Take notes CD project, take notes!
                    He needs to be the first Witcher to die in his bed.
                        who's gonna tell him
                    Didn‚Äôt they already announced he won‚Äôt? At least not as the main character. Or am I imagining things again?
                        Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
                    Very high chances Geralt won't come back, at least not in a major way. The Polish voice actor had serious health issues. The Reds brought him back for new quest in this update (new armor set) and were very lucky the actor could do this one quest for them, even though he sounds a bit different. At the moment I don't think he could do voiceover for entire game.
                        Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
                        The character is not the voice. See God of War.
                Please tell me the "filterless toussaint mod" gets a pass in next gen , toussaint is much better with that mod
                Peak Witcher is in either Hearts of Stone or Velen side quests. But that's for me. Blood and Wine was great and different but I prefer more grime side of Witcher
            If the game was just skellige I might have actually visited all the loot barrels there haha
                I did this in my first playthrough. Never again.
                    I kept thinking there was gonna be some cool Easter egg or hidden treasure on one of the dozens of tiny islands you stumble across surrounded by these treasures. Nothing. Not that I found anyway, though there were some unused assets for cut quests
                        IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
                            ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
                    Those whales scare you too? I'm scared rn
                I usually 100% games that I love but seriously fuck dealing with sailing and harpies for basically fuck all.
                    If they made water based combat less terrible I wouldn't mind

But when your only options are horribly weak crossbow or sword fighting on a tiny platform, im just going to avoid it wherever possible.
                    Yeah i hated Skellige tbh lol, such a pain in the ass to traverse
                Still don‚Äôt think I would have the extra 200 hours to invest in that endeavor.
                Fuck that quest! I get terrible OCD about completing *all the things*, and sailing around diving for all those stupid barrels was *the worst*.
            Toussaint was absolutely gorgeous, especially compared to walking around the bleak war torn areas of the map. I'm excited to see what it looks like.

Honestly that‚Äôs basically Irish mythology in a nutshell. Check out the Candlelit Tales podcast if you like stories where nothing good happens and everybody dies at the end.
    True the wedding quest in heart of stone is magical
        Hearts of Stone is just magical in general. That whole thing was just so well done.
            It's one of my favorite quest lines from any video game I've ever played.
            HoS gets my vote for best 10 hours of story in video game history.
    The Witcher 3 is definitely a game that needs to be played to appreciate it. Its beauty doesn't really translate to screenshots, or even videos, really.

It's best appreciated when playing it and taking in the whole package.

Must've been the wind.
    Well, just like most recent upgrades and remasters it looks like they did a lot of work on lighting so it should be even better.
    oh yeah, velen during the sunset?

^*magnificent*
    Amen. Nothing has ever felt more tactile in video games than the wind moving the grass, the setting sun, all of it.
    And foggggg
    Happy cake day dude
To be fair this update also contains tones of community mods that are all cited to their creators and somewhat altered with permission I hope by cd project. That's pretty cool there is a combat rebalance aswell. So the ai is different also overlay and mesh.
    A lot of QoL improvements as well like a new quick casting feature for controllers, a new behind the back camera angle like an Arkham game. UI improvements for immersion, a toggable less cluttered map etc.
        Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter, I highly recommend both. Inventory management is my least favorite feature in gaming in general.
            > Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter

Not lighting god damn candles when you're trying to loot is about 20 of those
                This guy loots
            Fast travel from anywhere is also great, especially for a replay. I can understand wanting exploration and immersion on a first play through, but damn it saves so much time not having to find a signpost anytime you want to go somewhere, especially when doing an armor quest or traveling around to craft something etc.
                Yeah definitely grab that one too.

As a compromise for explorers it would be cool if it were unlocked after discovering 100% of the map or something.
                    The thing is, fast travel anywhere can break a lot of quests that require you to be funneled towards a certain point. That's the issue with the mod and you never know which quest might break if you fast travel in the middle of it. 

Maybe they'll make it work in a patch since I don't see it in the list of included mods.
                Galloping in cities is an amazing mod too
                I always used the fast travel mod because the immersion was broken when you got to the signpost anyway, whether you fast travel from there or where you are it makes no difference, and I prefer exploring on my own terms rather than when the game makes me.
                    I just meant by having to walk more and seeing more of the map as opposed to just main areas
                also a big fan of map quest objectives. puts the quest markers on your map, and lets you highlight and mark them instead of selecting it from your quest list and then going to your map to see where it is.
                It's been years since I played this game but I remember using a fast travel mod and it breaking a couple quests that have triggers that can be unwittingly bypassed if you fast travel away.

Hopefully they fixed that but if not, be careful with when you fast travel
            That's why I love Horizon Forbidden West's inventory changes from the first game. They just send things to your stash and you can resupply there.
                That was excellent. It let them still design difficult fights that can‚Äôt be cheese by having 5000 healing potions, but doesn‚Äôt punish a player for collecting *everything, all the time*. 

It encouraged me to think about what variation of ammo I used when, what buffs I had going, etc. huge improvement over the first game.
                    Also: Looting from the mount. Holy hell.
                A welcome improvement. Now if they just took a page from BOTW and made looting instant...
                    There‚Äôs an option for that
                    They have an accessibility feature to auto pick shit. Turned it on and it was SO MUCH better.
            PREACH. 60 kilograms of swords, armor, daggers, all kinds of shit in your "backpack", but nah, can't fit _one more_ sword, that's just too much. I have never understood where weight limit came from, it's not like there's this "realism" factor to being able to only carry 50 swords where the player can't see them, but not 51 once you hit the limit.

I modded Witcher 3 to have no weight limit and it was infinitely more enjoyable.
                Same. I did this for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. I just don't see the point. Which means you can also ignore any potions and abilities that increase your weight limit, letting you focus on the more interesting parts of the game.
            Inventory limits in games like these litterally do only one thing, and that's make you waste your time going back and forth to sell items. The inventory is big enough that removing the weight limit basically has no real influence on gameplay or balance, only on time for people who like to pick up everything.
            Inventory management is tricky. You have to be really familiar with a game to do it well, know what to take and when and what to leave. It‚Äôs especially hard if you put down a game for a bit then go back and try to remember what you actually need to have. I have this problem with the Witcher but not with Fallout but I‚Äôve also put over ten times the hours into Fallout 3, NV, and 4.
            Auto-Oil will also reduce the amount of time you spend in the inventory.
            Dont ever touch Fallout 76 then, dont even need to mention the other major issues
            Interesting. I enjoy inventory management tbh
            Is no weight limit gonna be available in this update?
                I assume the current mods will work unless there are dramatic changes.
        Please tell me I no longer have to light up 20 candles every time I steal from the poorest family in the village.
        I think GoW 2018 has made the over-the-shoulder angle the most popular. It definitely helps the world feel more in-scale.
    Makes absolute sense since the modders of these games do ridiculous things. I hope they incorporate various fixes and tweaks that people have made, there were literally hundreds of tiny ones for skyrim that did all manner of minor things, like changing one texture or fixing one npc pathing bug etc
        Developers should really take advantage of modders more often. They're already fixing the game for free out of there own love for it why not partner with them in some way.
            Is that Saints Row 2 patch ever going to come out or is that just a myth now? They could have released it years ago and modders could have done the rest. Now it looks grim since Volition is now Gearbox.
        Mods for Skyrim and the 3D Fallout games were a *huge* factor in increasing their replayability. My 2nd playthrough of most of those games were with a lot of mods that made me savor the world and gameplay.

An inventory and UI mod for Skyrim was my go-to. The default was just not intuitive.
        If only Rockstar did this with manhunt red dead 2 bully edition.
    What?! Definitely excited to play it again
    Do we hav a list of all the QoL / mods that are included now!?
    I'm interested to see how much stuff they left in. Particularly hoping that the buffs to Bombs and Crossbows come across, and also that the flying monster knockdown fall damage is preserved, because it's hilarious lol.
    The updated graphics is literally just a community mod
    Unless I've read the list wrong it only has 6 mods included
    Is this update for PC too?
    What the fuck are you even trying to say here

Many different tones? It must be very musical.
Keep in mind that this is completely free to all of us who already own the last gen version
    Exactly!  People seem to have forgotten this very important detail.  This is an update for a game released in 2015.
        It's an *incredibly* easy detail to miss in the current world of greedy game developers and publishers
            wouldnt it be easier to miss if everyone did this? i feel like this is the key factor in it all because of expectation of greed
            Bruh this same company was totally dishonest and lied about their last release so badly PlayStation pulled it from their store, that was partly greed lol
                Sony pulled it from the store not because it was buggy, but because CDPR said that people should return the game and Sony threw a fit.
    Should also be noted if you don‚Äôt own it, it‚Äôs on sale for 10$ on GOG right now!
        Not bad for one of the best games of all time. Plus when you are done with it, there‚Äôs a whole entire mini game where you play as a witcher hunting monsters and tracking your daughter through deadly wilderness and locales.
            Its wild how they made an entire RPG as side content in a card game.
                You two just made this entire thread.
            On one hand, at least it's not a gatcha/microtransaction based, but on the other, I spent hundreds of hours grinding through the side games for more cards before I had a competitive deck.
                Just pay ng spies. Or nr spies. 

Or uh. Yeah that.
                Nah, its not hard to have a competitive deck in the default type. If u wanna play monster cards on the other hand....
            I heard you can even own your own vineyard. Amazing stuff for a card game
        Got it for like $3 during steam sale best purchase ever
        Goty edition is $3.80.
    Even if you bought it on sale digitally? It dont have to be a specific version purchased?


I bought Witcher 3 on PSN on sale for cheap, but never got around to playing more than the first hour. (I cant seem to stop doing that. I keep buying games on sale for $10-15 and ignoring them)

Lately I resolved to start working though my backlog of sale games. Im going throigh Death Stranding now and was planning on doing Ghost of Tsushima next, not sure about after that though.

I have Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Deathloop, Outer Worlds, and a few others I bought and never got around too.
        Yeah. You bought the game and now you get the free upgrade. It doesn't matter which version.
            If you also want the extra DLC for free, I think you need to have owned it before as well (or have the GOTY edition which includes them).
                The free DLC was basically two free games
                    Wasn't free if you bought them back when they came out, but they were well worth the twenty bucks or whatever I paid for them.
                As far I know the only edition of the game I have seen, at least on PC, is the ultimate edition which includes the paid expansions. But I have no clue for the console versions.
                    On Steam there's a standard version with no DLC, and a separate GOTY edition which costs a little more and includes all the DLC.
                        Same with xbox.
        Witcher 3 should be at the top of your list! Incredible game :)
        Have fun with Ghost of Tsushima. I loved that game
            Just finished it, this game is so beautiful and fun to play!
                Yeah, the gameplay variety can be kind of limited, but the beautiful world and art style combined with tight core mechanics and a moving story made it my favorite game of 2020
        I bought it on super sale on PC and Steam was telling me it was coming‚Ä¶ so I think yes.
        >Even if you bought it on sale digitally? It dont have to be a specific version purchased?

I specifically bought the GOTY version (or whatever it's called) months ago when it was $10 in anticipation of this update
        Witcher 3, cyberpunk and ghost's of Tsushima are probably in my top 5 games in the last decade. Amazing games. I hope you have a lot of free time on your hands lol.
            Damn, in the season‚Äôs sale I decided to only buy two games. I went for rdr2 and had to make a choice between cyberpunk and spider man remastered. I picked spider man but now I feel like I made a mistake lol
            Witcher 3, Cyberpunk and Breath of the Wild for me. Haven‚Äôt played Ghosts of Tsushima because I haven‚Äôt had a PlayStation before. A friend just gave me their PS4 when they got a PS5 so think I need to play that next!
        Bro Witcher 3 is like 200-300 hours long. Gaming is a serious hobby lol
            Are those completionist numbers? A typical full playthrough (including sidequests and DLCs) is closer to ~125 hours. Howlongtobeat says ~200 hours for completionists.
                I feel like I'm an outlier but I find every single howlongtobeat way too short for completionist run. It's like they timed how long it would be to speed though grabbing collectables with a guide instead of actually playing the game.
                Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot! I spent just over 300 hours without the DLC, for a near-ish completion run. I did all the side quests, collected all of the Gwent cards, fully upgraded at least 2 schools‚Äô gear sets and collected/partially upgraded the others, and completed the entire map in Velen/Novigrad and White Orchard but not Skellige. But this does also include time I spent doing shit like taking screenshots of the sunset and finding the longest paths to slide down the Skellige mountainsides, lol.
How does the Stuffed Unicorn look?
    Probably as godly as Yennefer thinks it looks
Geralt on the minoxidil
    Would like to see him after a month of not using it lol
    [deleted]
        >That's a patented name

I think minoxidil is the generic name of the drug. Rogaine is the patented name.
        My brand!
    I find it a tad misleading bc the last gen‚Äôs pic doesn‚Äôt use the hairworks setting even though it had it and the new one does.
Replaying the game is definitely going on my to-do list for next year.
    Same. I've been delaying replaying it until this update is released. Looking forward to it.
        You know what, I'm gonna play it again too... on my PS4, just to join you guys.
            I to will join, but not again as this will be my first time!
                I'd pay good money to play it again for the first time. Enjoy it!
                    Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha. 

If the download ever finishes... It's at 6.7GB out of 32.1GB and downloading at a speed of: \~30KB/s

; \]
        I played it again last summer but stopped after the main game to do the DLCs after this update. Now that I'm planning on upgrading from Series S to Series X, I might play through it all with raytracing from the beginning lol
        played it once so far when i got my SX, and for about 2 years now was waiting for this upgrade to do a death march playthrough. It already looked great when i played it back then so i cant wait
I can tell Nvidia hairworks is disabled on left and enabled on right, which has been around since launch. Not sure why'd they show it as a graphical improvement. Maybe it's no longer required to have an Nvidia card?
    Hairworks looks like ass too. I prefer the non-simmed hair. It was the same thing with Tomb Raider and her hair looking like it's made out of silk how it blows around constantly. Looked so unnatural but it's supposed to be better because it has physics! But they go too crazy with it and the hair ends up moving in an unnatural way.
        I personally think it just makes hair looks like strands of clay in Witcher 3. It never appealed to me at all, especially with the crazy performance impact even with a 1080ti which was top of the line back then. I didn't find it to be as bad in Tomb Raider but I still kept it off on those games too.
        I love it for monsters, on them it looks incredible. There‚Äôs a mod on pc that disables hair works on Geralt but leaves it on monsters.
    That was my thought too, and honestly it looks like mid graphics settings with the lack of lighting blend.  Not sure what level the new is on though. 

I was running a 1060 on PC when I picked up the original, so about 1 year after release.  And running on ultra with hairworks was notably cool, but if I wanted zero drops, I'd still turn it off.  Not worth looking at 10,000 separate hairs to miss a hit on a banshee.
    Probably because it was originally not enabled on consoles, but is in the new version.
    consoles
    >no longer required to have an Nvidia card?

Never was.
Would help if the image wasn‚Äôt 720p
Of all the games I always thought the Witcher 3 was the last that really needed a next gen upgrade. The game looked absolutely fucking fantastic from the start. The animations and voice acting was top notch. I was always baffled by it. It was like watching an interactive movie. Still, can't complain of them doing a next gen upgrade for free. Might make me play it through again.
    It's interesting that people say this. I bought it on PC when it released but never finished the game for whatever reason. 

Came back a year ago and tried but the animations, roach (and geralts) movement, and the lifeless NPCs seemed Soo janky and dated. 

I know it's an unfair comparison but I think games like rdr2 and even GTA 5 set the bar really high for me on PC. 

That said, I downloaded some mods and it totally changed things...I still think the game is a master piece even if I never finished it. Hoping to complete it with the remaster.
        I think it's a difference between visual detail and animation. Visually I would say Witcher 3 wins out (though not like GTA 5 is slacking), but as far as animation goes I agree that GTA 5 is just super impressive. There's been some serious advancement in the nuances in video games, so I can see a bit how that part might be the thing that makes Witcher 3 age, but at least personally I don't think it's aged out yet.
            I'd argue it's really just Rockstar that has incredible animation in their open world games.  Assassins Creed for example has extremely janky animation even in the latest releases.

A lot of what makes RDR2 and GTA 5's animation great is also why people find the controls sluggish feeling.  It takes a bit of time for the character to turn or speed up into a run because the game gives characters a sense of weight and momentum, and in turn this give the animation time to play out.  In many other games, for example, when a character turns they pop into the new direction with a little bit of settle, they don't shift their weight and turn their hips and take a step.  Animation in games will always be a push and pull with how responsive you want the controls to feel.
            When it comes to GTA games you can thank Euphoria for that.
            I think we‚Äôve just come through a period with some real genre defying games. I think withcher 3 belongs on that list, it just dropped before some real heavy hitters.
    First time i see someone says the witcher 3 animations were good, let alone "movie like". They were terrible. Super dated and janky. The graphics were gorgeous tho
I strongly recommend comparing games in motion and not through shitty compressed screenshots. I‚Äôm sure Digital Foundry will have a throroughly researched video coming any day, but until then this one is pretty decent (even if the music choice isn‚Äôt necessarily everybody‚Äôs cup of tea, but just mute the audio if you don‚Äôt): https://youtu.be/BWkktgDA7HA
    >shitty compressed screenshots

omg, right? Like I can see the difference in the OP photo, but it's full of .jpg compression artifacts. Makes fine detail very difficult to see. Very bad image tro use for a comparison.
Meanwhile Ubisoft: *Charges full price for what is essentially just a reshade and upscale which you could do for free with mods on pc*
Looks great, good upgrade if you ask me. Looking forward playing it again
The next-gen honestly looks like a combo of fan-mods and ray-tracing, and that‚Äôs not necessarily an bad thing.

Really looking forward to doing my first complete playthrough of this; been distracted with too many other games!
    And it‚Äôs not stuck at 30 fps on consoles anymore
Obvious improvement. But I wouldn't really notice anymore after an hour of gaming.
    Well... Duh. You get used to everything, but if you were to play the old version again you'd definitely notice a difference
        And the proceed to get used to it again within the hour.
            Yeah and I can get used to Banjo Kazooie visuals after an hour
            So, the solution is to play any game despite of what it looks
    > Obvious improvement.

Not in all details. I think the old hair texture looks better than the new one with physics, which just looks like strips of plastic.
    That's because it's not an obvious improvement at all.

Maybe the rest of the game is noticeably more attractive, but these screenies look like side by sides from the same year with bloom on and off. And the bloom is way overkill. Why are the faces shiny?
        Part of the problem is that it's a shitty, low resolution screen shot.  They improved the textures of a ton of stuff as well as adding extra draw distance and denser foliage, but a big part of the update are two types of ray-traced lighting and better HDR, none of which is in this screen shot.  All of that being said, it's still a 7 year old game.  It isn't like it suddenly looks like it came out this year, but if you want a better idea of the differences, Digital Foundry published a preview video last week.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if they also post an in-depth comparison once they're allowed to have it themselves.  The footage in this video is from a press event they were invited to.  

[YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/6Nzs-__nlTo)
        There's very little bloom on either screenshot. The right side has substantially better lighting, is that what you call bloom?

As for the faces, it's raining? You can see the guy's shirt is soaking wet on both screenshots, and there's a few droplets visible on both sides.
        As another guy said, this is a horrible representation of it. You need to fire up the game yourself to truly admire the differences. 

Viewing any kind of screenshot or video online is not going to give you an accurate representation. 

I remember thinking the TLOU Part 1 remake looked good, but once I actually played it - I realized it was stunning.
using 720p to show off the comparison
I see they installed the extra light/oily skin filter on stuff.
They all look like the toy santa from the Santa clause 2. Why the hell are they so shiny
Next-gen is how I remember playing on PC at launch.
    It‚Äôs not a true next gen game, it‚Äôs just an upgrade. It‚Äôs upgradable on the PC too which means the version you played was inferior
    Yeah exactly. I played it on pc for years and it looked exactly like the right lol.
How long before we stop saying ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù? Current generation has been out a few years now
    I thought it meant next gen relative to the release date of the game, which is 2015.
Is this a console comparison?
Woah, they opened the woman‚Äôs mouth!
    That's against the law!  *Grabs pitchfork*
Looks better?
    Looks whiter.
Now do pc lol
    [deleted]
        Oh I'm not saying there aren't I just want to see them I'll look them up in a bit. I'll just probably wait and install it on Wednesday
Can't really tell the difference because the image is compressed to shit.

People who make comparison shots of graphical fidelity need to learn to use lossless formats.  

How are we supposed to tell the image on the right looks better or if it just has slightly less artifacting than the image on the left because the compression algorithm favored the lighter colors?

Skewing the results uploading it here in 30% JPG quality preset.
I don't know what OP's intentions were. But based on the comments, these kinds of posts are pretty stupid. Using one or two still images to display visual enhancements of a patch? Yeah, not going to display them all that clearly.
Current gen*****

It's two years into the cycle, stop calling it next gen.
    It's a parasite therm pushed by "hypers", I bet they don't even realize what it actually means and calling every single "good" videocard/console as "nextgen". Technically, it should be rightfully applied only to *unexisting* things, which only in plans/development right now, and everything else already mass-released shouldn't even have "special" name as it's just "current" one... 

But I bet that doesn't bother anyone of those who uses this word mindlessly... As well as hundreds(you'll be surprised...) other words...
Ummm, it‚Äôs brighter? Lol.
    To be fair, cropping from a Youtube video with 720p resolution ain't gonna show any of the new graphic fidelity lmao!
    RT global illumination.
    That's all I'm seeing and don't really like it
    added shitty bloom effects r/gaming "woooah"
Back in the day, FIFA World Cup 98 on the N64 looked basically indistinguishable from a real soccer match on TV. At least to me it did.
I've spent all weekend with this new update for a review and I cannot get over just how amazing the game truly looks. The detail on armor and the way the light reflects off of Geralts swords not to mention just how fast things load compared to before. 

Also, casting signs is so much easier to do and I've noticed that it makes me want to use them even more than I did in my original playthrough back in 2015. The new armor is a bonus as well as the "My Rewards" which allows you to link your GOG account to unlock even more new armor and weapons. 

This is a hell of an update that I cannot believe everyone gets for free. Hope everyone enjoys it on Wednesday! I recommend a fresh playthrough to truly enjoy everything.
All these negative comments seem to be completely missing the point that CDPR did this FOR FREE to honor existing players and welcome in new players. Save the salt for unfinished games released annually by ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù studios. For me, this is the best $0 spent this year, and I can‚Äôt wait to play the update.
    God seriously. There‚Äôs so many people saying it doesn‚Äôt look any different based on 1 single screenshot. I‚Äôve seen a lot of comparisons it‚Äôs a big difference. But fuck even a 60fps patch for new consoles and DLSS/FSR support on pc would‚Äôve been worth a whole 0 dollars

Even if it wasn‚Äôt a big difference how can anyone possibly complain about getting something no matter how unnecessary it might be for free? I don‚Äôt get it.

They could‚Äôve done absolutely nothing and no one would‚Äôve said a thing

We should be praising CDPR for this in hopes that other devs and publishers get the idea and do it themselves. Complaining about it just makes it less likely for other companies to do this.
    I concur. I started Witcher 3 but never got very far. Might give it another go, eventually, with the shiny new upgrade.
I can only hope when the port from switch to PS5, Monster Hunter Rise will be that big of a jump
    [deleted]
    I doubt it. There were plenty of issues in the Switch version, such as half rate backround animations, that were already changed for the PC release on Steam, but they didn't completely redo the graphical style or game logic as it was always intended to be a handheld title that would be released on other platforms coincidentally. If you want a graphically impressive version I guess Monster Hunter: World, such as it is, is your choice.
Is everything just shinier? Not that impressed.
    The face of the woman next to Geralt looks pretty different

But everyone else, yeah just seems like lighting differences
    There's better shadow depth - esp the inside of the tent. But yes, the lighting looks worse in this. I'm very surprised people are fawning over it. Probably in aggregate it looks better, but not this screenie.
It's definitely better, but I'm not sure it needed improvement.
    Yeah these screenshots are incredibly similar. I'd even say the hair looks worse in the new version, it looks like a bad photoshop masking job. Did this game really need a visual update?
    It‚Äôs free so does it matter? I‚Äôd argue that Ray tracing, DLSS/FSR are in engine cutscenes and 60fps modes on consoles alone are a big enough improvement  alone to justify this. 

In engine cutscenes especially. That‚Äôs huge. I don‚Äôt know what the original ones were rendered at probably 1080p but playing at 4k on a large screen makes pre rendered ones look terrible. It also means smoother transitions from gameplay to cutscene while also having the cutscene look how the game does.
    True, the game was so well made, you can barely tell the difference between generations.
        The Ps4 version definitely looks worse than the new update, i played it on pc before ps4 and was startled by the drop in quality.
A completely free update, the equivalent of which other prominent games have actually charged for, and still people are bitching, and still Cyberpunk continues to live rent free in so many people‚Äôs heads.
    This comment is literally the first mention of cyberpunk I saw in this post
    I think people wonder why tf OP picked this screenshot. If I put them side by side, I'd assume that they came out simultaneously and the one on the right has bad HDR.
Now I'll finely buy cyberpunk
Are people really trying to look for comparisons in a 720p jpeg?
2015 lady: üòê

I wish I liked this game
Mustache guy was perfect all along
I don't know much about the Witcher. What are the satellite dishes on his armor used for?
    Wifi
They just look extra sweaty
‚ÄúNext gen‚Äù
Is the image on the left PC on higher settings? I never remember the game looking that bad. I feel like quality wise it more resembles Witcher 2.
Is you stare at it for like 20 seconds you can definitely tell the difference but like... Idk that this is that necessary, I hate to complain about new, good, free things but this does very little for me
Its not next gen if we've had it for 2 years
depending on which era of gaming you grew up in. this could either look very depressing or just something that's to be expected. I never grew up during the days when gaming was evolving rapidly during a single decade so I am not that surprised, to say the least.
Damn the old one looks better.
so remaster = spotlight?
    More like raytraced global illumination and raytraced ambient occlusion
I mean...it's "an" upgrade, nothing stellar about it
Add more paint colors and armor painting earlier to the game.
Meanwhile the switch version is stick figures.
his new hair seems kind of strange
r/gamingcirclejerk
Is Witcher 3 or RDR 2 good? I don't typically like games set in the past, rather prefer games like Cyberpunk, GTA, etc.
There's a next generation? Wtf no one told me. The newest consoles have been out for like 2 years.
You know they've done a next-gen update right when it's how you remember the game looking like, even though it's clearly been significantly upgraded.
I see it, I just don't think it's that big of a deal. It's not mind blowing.
Free upgrade? Might aswell buy this on PC and support this. Playing Witcher 3 on PS4 was great and the DLC was huge!
the higher res texture for the armor makes all the little imperfections more visible and it really adds to the depth to what use to look pretty flat.
Can we use the same save file or will it not work with the next gen update?  Is it basically the same game with only a graphical overhaul?

Only reason I ask is because I've been working on beating this game for quite a few years now and I'd rather not restart again
current gen*
Yasssified
Not much of a difference in seven years of tech. Shinier armor.
Ah he‚Äôs a distinguished gentleman.
Is it out yet? I‚Äôve honestly never played it before and am keen to get it with these new graphics on the series x!
Such a weird shot to do a graphical comparison on. I want to see a comparison in the water or the woods.
One of the biggest upgrades they should have done, if they didn‚Äôt already, is to give us more variants of npcs. There‚Äôs too many look alikes in the original game.
It‚Äôs actually current gen.
It's not next gen. It's current gen. We've had these consoles for years. We're not getting them next, we have them now. It's current gen and last gen. Idk what's so difficult to understand about this.
Have you all heard of the Witcher 3? It's an underrated indie gem starring Geraldo. I think it might win GOTY.
It‚Äôs the same picture Pam.
No real dif.
To be honest it's still bad you figure it would be cut scene quality but on right it looks choppy still
Brightness +2
GCJ went in the toilet since then, but screw it I'll say it for old times' sake:

Praise Geraldo!
Haven't played since 2015 on PC. It was so on sale for $10 on Xbox with all DLCs. Never played the DLCs. I'm pretty excited to play this again.
Of all the scene to choose from, OP choose this crap?
Not that big a difference, I think. Still cool that they've upgraded it, of course.
Ooh everybody‚Äôs faces got *shiny*
So what it looks like to me is the PC ultra settings are being ported to console. Because that is exactly what TW3 looks like on my PC. Nice.
I see no difference
I keep picking the game up and stopping partway through. Once I get my hands on this update I'll try to finally finish the damn thing.
Thanks for demonstrating this with a tiny image that's been compressed to shit
Doesn't really look that much better.
That looks but that 2015 still holds up pretty good.
just looks brighter.
That was the craziest thing I noticed too. It almost looks like an optical illusion in how much the lighting messes with depth perception yet this was obviously standard at the time.
    It certainly is crazy how lighting can really impact a video game's scene.
        I mean, everything we see in the real world is literally lighting, so it's not that crazy.
        I would say this day and age lighting has theb biggest impact.
The lighting is way better in general.
I hear the biggest improvement might actually be with the controls and camera. The Witcher 3 is still a pretty damn good looking game, even by today‚Äôs standards,but the controls were always clunky.
    You can tell it's not 2015/2016 anymore because you didn't get downvoted for saying that.
        I‚Äôm playing it for the first time now. Apparently there is was a a hot topic at one point. 

I just learned about the new movement setting 5 min ago.
Thanks for pointing that out as I wasn't too impressed otherwise with the graphics update.
Skyrim aint gonna buy itself on every platform...
    To be fair Skyrim had a free update on Ps5 Xbox Series X/S unlike GTA V.
        They're letting any plans of an rdr2 update or remaster rot in a ditch iirc because of how poorly received the GTA remake was alongside how GTA online sells stupid dlc like hotcakes so why even bother updating rdr.
            it's insane to me, that they somehow believe it's due to lack of interest in remasters or remakes.. but in reality, the GTA trilogy was a fucking desaster. pressed on disc. it was doomed the moment someone decided it was okay to release it like that.


dude i am so in for red dead redemption 1 and an upgrade for 2 to next gen.
4k and 60 fps very needed for both.


the rdr1 remaster leaks looked very good to me. would buy it day 1 if it's not filled and a complete mess like the gta trilogy was.



edit: after some additional research to the rdr1 remaster topic; unfortunately it appears to have been a fan-mod of the xbox 360 version running in an emulator... at least that's what a few sources say. so the remaster of rdr1 wasn't real after all it seems.
            Man what I would give for a GTA 3D universe remake that's playable for someone born this millineum
                Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
            Why would we need rdr2 update? That game still look gorgeous.
                I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
                    And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
                        The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
                    All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
        Skyrim gets a lot of flack for the stream of re-release but at least they usually had some content differences involved. Regular, GOTY, Special, and Anniversary

    Skyrim had a free update to sse and then ae (without the full cc package) if you owned it already
        Right? I bought Skyrim from GameStop midnight release. It was just a steam key. 11 years later I have gotten all of the updates (SSE AND NOW AE) for absolutely free. Fucking good value.
            As good a game the witcher is, it'll never outlive Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game. It's a game engine and modders' playground.
                Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
                    Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
                        For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
            Same, and with all of the mods out there, at least on PC, the game still looks pretty badass even today imo.

            Tbf, if you bought it past 2013/2014, you'd most likely be buying the Legendary Edition, which had all the DLC. Usually was around $20. They delisted it when SE came out so you couldn't just buy the old one that way anymore, which is a little wack, but SE runs so much better and has all the DLC as well, so.
            I mean, it was 3 DLCs, and two of them were full on expansions and the other regularly hit rock bottom prices and was necessary for a fair number of good mods.

If you had any interest in skyrim and didn't own the DLC already you were doing yourself a massive disservice.
    I did get a free Skyrim upgrade years ago.
    If we're fair about Skyrim, it did get some engine upgrades that do technically make it a different game.

    It started with shark cards and is now at paying for 60fps
    I got the 2020 edition ot gta 4 and it is a total joke man. No character audio at all. I contact them and they want me to get buy the newer version from their website
I only own this on pc, can I buy a PS4 disc like other games and put it in PS5 to get the free upgrade?
    I'm pretty positive that is correct, yes.
    The pc version gets the free upgrade also fyi.
Seriously, if even a company as money grubbing as Ubisoft can do free next gen updates, everyone should
This is honestly how I remembered Goldeneye for N64. Then I went back and played it and my god were the graphics terrible. But in my mind that game blew me away at the time. Crazy how that works with stuff like this.

Edit: guys I get it. After 1k comments about CRT TV's I think everyone here knows they were better for old games. Thanks.
    I played half life 2 for the first time as a kid in probably 2010. I turned to my dad after getting through Route Kanal and said "this game looks just like real life!" He laughed.
        I wish I still had the eyes of a child. But they fell out of my pocket when I went for a walk the other day so I'll have to find some new ones.
            I had the eyes of a child at one time. Shortly after my parents divorce i realized they were going to buy my love so i did what any kid of the mid 90s would do, i made sure they bought me every video game and console i saw. One day after svhool i was playing my virtual boy. My dad bought this thing and my mom hated it, she was sure i was going to go blind. For the uninitiated, virtual boy was designed like the oculus and played 3d games on 32 bit. THIRTYTWO BIT. This was circa 96/97 because i didnt have my 64 or jaguar yet. So i strapped this thing on my head and decided to start playing warioland because it was new and i wanted to escape for several hours. Well noone told me the battery life on my new virtual boy was trash. Like 3 or 4 hours and the thing was dead so i took it off and then i realized all my mothers fears had come true. The batteries hadnt died. I had fucking gone blind. I couldnt see a fucking thing. I was panicking. The pure fear set in i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe. Little 7 year old me knew he couldnt live life without vision. So i did what any child would do. I cried. Not quietly, no, i sobbed loudly. My brother came into the room to tell me to shut the fuck up and thats when i realized, i hadnt gone blind. It had just gotten dark outside and i had no lights on. I was a dumb child. Im a pretty dumb adult.
                Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
                    Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

        Half Life 2's graphics have held up enormously well though. You can cherry pick some of the canal and still find photo-real scenes (which fall apart if you get close, yes).

NPC asset quality and facial animations are still 2nd to very very few. It also somehow avoid the "plastic shiny" feel a lot of hyper modern engines have.

The entire lighting system in that game was "pre-baked" and the pre-baker used a lot of raytracing for the "globally illuminated" look. Ahead of its time and hella efficient. Lots of games without dynamic time of day copied the method for the next two decades.
            Textures in HL2 have this inherent grittiness unique to it. It really does feel more real than most things released since. Like you mentioned, so many games feel almost *too* perfect and refined. Everything looks shiny, clean, and fake. HL2, partially because it was a post apocalyptic game, had this ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù to it that I haven‚Äôt seen replicated perfectly since. I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
                g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
                    All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
                        Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
                            Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                                If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
                It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
            Going back and playing HL2 or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines it‚Äôs just insane how good the facial animations were, there‚Äôs games that come out 20+ years later that still somehow fuck it up.
             the best water I've seen in any game
                It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
            I played Portal raytraced and thought this is basically how I rememeber Portal looking when it came out.  It ran so badly however that I then ran the original Portal, and I finished it again it was so good. The game still holds up great, but the lighting, materials and textures look like something out of Quake 2.

It really make you appreciate how much accurate lighting, shadows and nice materials can change a game.
            The first engine I saw using pre-baked lighting that had path-trace (and surface-illumination) was in Quake 2 from 1997. Its resolution was quite crude compared to Half-Life 2, which resulted in some fairly chunky shadows. Generating these lightmaps back then was a *slow* process.

The Source engine has its roots in a branch of the original Quake's codebase, so it makes sense that bounced lighting could be easily implemented. Not sure if the original Half-Life games incorporated that...
            the way you describe how modern games look is exactly what i always felt looking at them but i couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. yeah, they look like plastic. it doesn‚Äôt look real. like for example bf5 looks much worse compared to bf1 because everything looks plasticy and featureless
        HL2 holds up *exceptionally* well. A lot of it is from the textures -- I don't know how to describe it, but there is a "coherence" among every texture that nothing looked particularly out of place. 

Compare it to say Black Mesa, BM might have much higher resolution textures, but a lot of them somehow looked "flat" and cartoonish, a bit like the "HD texture pack for minecraft" memes.
            A good art direction goes much further for making a visually stunning game than brute forcing it with higher res textures, models, and graphic tech.
            I just played through Portal with RTX and the whole time I thought, of all games, Portal doesn't need this. The original was done so well because the aesthetics were clean and the engine handled light and reflection pretty well to begin with.
                Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
                    >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.

I'm not 100% sure but I think this video touches on why HL2 looks so good. Pretty interesting video regardless if you're into that kind of thing
        I think it has do with the fact we tie it to experiential memory. "I was going through this alley and a face hugger popped up, so I used my gravity gun to catch and release a barrel right in it's face!" It ties in all the emotional energy you may have had and whatever associations the images first game you all get linked like a custom circuit. (I am not a neruologist!)

Gaming is a live experience, and thus gets filed away differently.
            I think they're also a highly comparative medium. Graphics that are contemporaneously considered cutting edge tend to remain that way in ours heads because at the time we can't imagine anything looking better so our memories of them get updated as modern graphics improve. Plus the immersive nature of video games means the best of them make us feel like they're actually happening in a sense. 

I remember playing Spidey PS4 and thinking this is exactly how I remember Spider-man 2 on the PS2 looking. Even more recently when I first saw the Dead Space Remake gameplay I was almost disappointed at what I considered a lack of real improvement. I really thought I was looking at a remaster more than a ground up remake. Then they showed the comparison to the original side by side and my jaw dropped at just how dated the original looked. Memory is a funny thing.
                Halo MCC has a toggle to switch between the remastered and original graphics. It's a trip to go back and forth between them.
                    Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
                        You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
                        For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
            Absolutely- similar to the way we remember stories in books which have no images at all (well, maybe illustrations)
            VR is a whole different ballgame with regards to immersion and memories. After I played HL Alyx I could think back to certain scenes or set pieces in the game and it really felt like an actual memory, like I'd really lived it. It was super weird.
        I remember getting a PS1 and Tomb Raider III for Christmas in the late nineties, then booting it up on my old big ass TV and being like "wow, it will never get any more realistic than this," polygon everything (boobs) and all.
        Honestly I think HL2 still looks great. Black Mesa has great assets and you can tell the difference when you look but while you're playing it's very easy to forget that the game came out 15 years ago.
        My uncle was playing Madden 2005 or something around that time
 My grandfather came into the room and said he couldn't tell if it was real football or a video game. We all agreed.
        I mean, half life two still looks pretty freaking good.
        The game still looks very good though.
        It was an amazing looking game for it's time. Shit, it still looks good.
        HL2 still holds up
        HL2 still looks good. It has aged better than most games. I plays it though like every other year. Last two times hs been in VR.
    That's how ES oblivion for me was, I was playing the NES games for a while so when I saw a friend play Oblivion I never saw a game look so realistic. Then I played it again years later a bit after Skyrim came out and the difference was insane.
        I remember looking at Oblivion when it was new and also thinking "games will never look better than this" 

I think part of it is that it was a new game for the 360, where as ps2/OGXbox games still had a pretty blocky look to them (although it was an improvement over PS1 games) so a game engine being able to convey roundness seemed like a graphical breakthrough. and oh man... were those faces [round](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/elderscrolls/Newheim_the_Portly.jpg)
            I said that once. "graphics will never be better than this!" That was for battle arena toshindan ü§£
                Star Wars Battlefront II for me. I don‚Äôt even think they were that good but I remember being like ¬´¬†damn it feels like I‚Äôm on Kashyyk rn¬†¬ª
            Im playing oblivion at 4k 60 on my series x and I'm still impressed by the graphics. The textures on the walls and design of the environments are pretty impressive for 2006. Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad, but that wouldn't have been much of an issue at 720p.
                >Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad

I actually think the opposite. Oblivion at a distance looks like a painting (even today), it's just when you get up close and see the character models and animations that it starts to show it's age.
                    Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
                        Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
                        The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
                    I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
            Stepping out of the sewers for the first time...god what an unforgettable feeling. Being in awe of the colors and the water and the Ayleid ruin across the lake.
    I guess our brains have built in anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion lol

It's funny how that works. I had the same experience with Ocarina of Time. When ZFG streams it it's beautifully upscaled and looks great, just how I remembered it. When I saw how it actually looked back on the N64 I was blown away.

Maybe any game memories that stick around that long get confused with "real" memories and our brains kinda make them fit more closely to real life.
        [deleted]
            Very good point. I started thinking about that when I saw a recent frontpage post with comparisons of the same sprites on CRT vs modern monitors. CRT even seems to add the illusion of shadows, if the sprites are designed for it.
            I used to have a 21‚Äù Sun monitor that weighed over 70 damn pounds.  Amazing picture.  Probably would have kept it well into the flat-panel era if it just didn‚Äôt weigh so much.
        Our brains also have auto fps increase too, i remember first watching a 60fps video a decade+ ago and thought nothing could be better.

        Yea but even playing Goldeneye again after playing Halo or Splinter Cell on the og Xbox made it look rough.
            Splinter cell looked unbelievably good at the time
                It really did look good. That 5 or so year period between N64 games and Xbox stuff was an insane jump compared to the difference in 5 year old games today.

The 3rd game, Chaos Theory, is still one of my all-time favorites. Man it is a bummer that Splinter Cell is basically dead as a franchise and we probably won't be getting a new Splinter Cell for a long, long time. Like, Ubisoft has Ghost Recon and Assassins Creed, combine the concepts into a modern open-world stealth/stealth action game, it would probably have a huge audience.
        Man, like a decade ago, someone left a late model crt outside to be picked up as trash. My friends and I grabbed it, hauled it into my buddies house, pulled out the old SNES and spent the next few days beating mega man X before putting the tv back out on the curb to be picked up with the trash.

SNES games looked stunning on it. It was a very late CRT, flat screen rather than curved like cheaper ones but thiiiic and extremely heavy.

Same friend bought a neo geo arcade unit a few years later with a crt screen. Definitely looks good.
        Its not so much that CRT display them batter, but that the pixels were never meant to be displayed sharply. Filters can replicate the look perfectly fine. The issue is more that a lot of people never played them back on CRT and don't realize how they should display.
    I remember seeing NFL 2k for Dreamcast in a Babbages and thinking it was a live NFL game on TV. I was convinced that was the peak of what games could look like.
        I remember buying that game,  and everybody who saw it thought it was real. Showed it to my boss who only played pc games,  and he went and picked up a dreamcast that day.
        To be fair visual concepts did an outstanding job.  No Madden can hold a candle to 2K5 and I‚Äôm still angry about it all.  Fuck EA.
    Honestly that is probably because you played it on a CRT and then went back and played it on an LED tv.
        No, this is a pretty common phenomenon. Our minds fill in detail that was never there.
            Both are true, old games really did look better‚Ä¶but only on CRTs. That ever so slight blur and image distortion helped. The sprites of 2D games and textures of 3D games often look like absolute ass on HD LEDs, way worse than they originally looked.
                It‚Äôs not so much that the CRT blur inherently helped, it‚Äôs that it was quantifiable and things from that era were designed with it in mind. You take those unmodified inputs and put them in a different context and what had been carefully designed to blend in sticks out badly.
>Still, pretty good for a free update.

Yeah, most other devs would've just sold the game again.

Yeah I'm talking about you Rockstar.
    *Bethesda enters the chat*
        If you had Skyrim LE, the SE game was completely free. If you have SE, you get the Anniversary Edition patches + 4 CC content for free.
            Just wait until you want to play in VR.
        Get out!
            Go on! Git!

                    I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
                Hey we have the same face!
            They can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs an object in the way of the door; you have to glitch yourself out until the community creates a patch to fix it!
        SE was free on PC (console wasn‚Äôt back compat at the time), and Anniversary was free on both (with option bundle of all Creation club content)
        Bethesda is actually doing this exact same thing with Fallout 4. Total next-gen face-lift for free, sometime in the spring.
    And Atlus. They have sold us P5 like 5 times already.
        P5 in name? Yeah. Actual just P5? 3 times. Vanilla p5, 1sr release of Royal, then the ports this year.
        They just released it for platforms that never had it to begin with???? Royal is different from the first and adds like 40 hours??? Strikers and the Rhythm game are just completely different games.
        And Bethesda, Skyrim on every electronic device...still waiting for our god Todd Howard to release it on some fucking smart toaster.
            The upgrade to SE, VR and AE were all free if you bought the original game. Don't be dishonest.
                dishonestly is all these people know. Reddit hates Bethesda, so why tell the truth when you can lie and get infinite upvotes
                    It's the worst kind of lazy.
                        well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(
        It would be worth checking the data but I feel like the majority of remastered, repackaged games have been coming from Japanese devs. Not to say that Western devs haven‚Äôt put a lot of those too.
            Interesting point there, I haven't thought about it myself. If there's a good and kinda necessary remaster, I'm down for it. Otherwise is just reselling the same game.
                To be fair, some of it is also due to the lack of backward compatibility and a lot of ports from handheld titles which were more popular in Japan than in the West.
    Maybe they realized they have some good will to buy back.
        Nah, CDPR has always done stuff like this. It's just nobody noticed until W3 because that was the first one to be popular
    Naughty Dog sold the last of us remaster even more expensive than the original lol
        The PS5 *remake* costs more than the original, which is fair. A ton of work was needed to complete it.
     Cries in Skyrim special legendary maximum super edition 5.
        All of Skyrims upgrades were free when they were able to give them for free.
Your mind is the best gpu out there
    You make a wonderful argument in favor of books
        That's why it can be so disappointing to watch film adaptations of your favorite books. I usually have different images of characters in my mind than the movie version. But I guess that also makes it super satisfying when the two versions align.
            Preach, brother / sister. I read TLoTR annually until the Jackson films came out, then it was once a decade because I had *his* images in my head instead of my own.
                I take it you dislike Peter Jackson's vision? Care to elaborate on the why?
                    [deleted]
                        This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.

            Their hardware just didn't come with drivers okay
        Except I got integrated graphics when it comes to books
Yeah. People just look more sweaty in the 2022 compared to my memories of the game
    That's climate change for ya.
    its raining in both pics, so yeah, I hope rain effects look better.
    Every year the NBA 2k trailer is just them showing the players with more sweat
Not to be a buzzkill, but the right image is more or less what the current-gen version looks like right now on my PC. Granted, we didn't have 3070s in 2015, but still.
    Yeah these are screenshots from like 5 years ago, on a 1080ti
https://imgur.com/a/eCfNU
    I mean I'm playing with several HD and other graphical mods so ... My game *does* more or less look like the right side.
        On top of that, today they announced the update uses some the more popular texture mods. Aside from the lighting updates, if you use any of those mods, you‚Äôre not far off.
            Excellent. Why wouldn‚Äôt they use mods that offer a better experience? Other companies should take note.

If it wasn‚Äôt free.. different story but here we are.
                If the quality is there, why do the work again? It must be cheaper too. n designers being paid x dollars for however many months of work vs. offering the mod‚Äôs creator a flat free for use in perpetuity. Any mod creator would probably be so thrilled at the idea of their work being used by the company who created the game they loved enough to mod that they‚Äôd take a few grand.
                Please no. That will very quickly lead to buyable mods and the death of free mods
    Plus the left image looks like it was taken on a 720p or below screen. It's way more blurry and blocky than it needed to be when the Witcher 3 launched.

I'm sure the update looks great. Really bad comparison though.
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs is sweet about keeping the original art style. So many games go ahead and push everything further down the technological line while also changing the art in the process, The Last of Us Part 1 for example. The Witcher 3 kept the same art style while putting in new assets and modern techniques. Looks great nothing ground breaking but the polish is free and helps it hold up.
As someone who played it on PC, the next gen version looks like the PC ( with mods) version

Edit: This isn‚Äôt a dig at the next-gen version! I am excited and looking forward to playing it again !
    This. I took me a while to find this comment but this is exactly what it looks like on PC with mods. Just the common ones, nothing fancy.
Kinda like Switch version on the left and PC version on the right.
tbf this is for every game after several years, especially our childhood games, good god the graphics suck ass compared to now, but they always looke realistic as fuck back then
Might not be so incorrect. PC or console? Graphic settings? It absolutely could look like the one on the right in 2015, if you weren't, say, playing on medium and no hairworks.
I'm currently playing the PC version for the first time. Looks like it's the GOG version. No mods or hacks or anything. It looks **a lot** more like the picture on the right than then left.
    Of course it does. The picture on the left is probably off a PS4, compressed about 20 times and from one of the few moments the game shits the bed lighting wise.
Gotta pick the fine, overlooked, details to pay attention to. I vividly remember being impressed by the 3D rock textures outside of Michael's house in GTAV on 360 just after launch, but just before the next-gen release, those rocks suddenly became a flat low-geometry blob. They deliberately downgraded the visuals so the next-gen release would look even better in comparison.
Yeah whenever I see a new game trailer, I think to myself that graphics have kind of stagnated over the past 10 years, and that there are games from 10 years that look about as good as games today (Battlefield 3/4 and Crysis 3 are the first to come to mind). Then I go and actually play those games, and while some things haven‚Äôt improved all that much (foliage and textures), the difference is night and day.
Funny, I was thinking the original looked pretty good for almost 9 years ago now
Well I think on PC, especially with the mods, the upgrade is probably less of a leap - similair thing happened to Alan Wake Remastered, where the leap was even smaller.
Low effort update in my opinion. Mainly just including mods modders made and recreating other mods. They didn't even bother updating the fire sprites because it would've required actual work.
I just came to say the same thing, i ran it on my evga 970 and it looked like that, but when i went to the 1080 that was definitely when my mind was truly blown.
Hell I've been playing it for the last couple or months and even right now and in my memory it already looks like the upgraded version
or just wondering through the Skellige mainland, damn that was gorgeous
    They could've released Skellige or Blood & Wine as standalone games and I think it would've been a success,
        Blood & Wine is peak Witcher 3 for me. Such an absolutely gorgeous area and great epilogue for Geralt.

Look forward to seeing updated Toussaint.
            There's a part of me that hopes they don't bring back Geralt in the next game, at least not in a major way. Him settling down on his farm living a life of luxury is such a perfect end after all the shit he's been through.
                It would be funny if the game took you to Geralt's farm and you get to see him mucking about, randomly lighting and snuffing out torches while cursing a nearby chest, yelling at Roach to get off the roof, and being chased across the yard by horny witches. Instead of killing monsters himself he sends you off on quests to kill them for him because he's so done with that life, and rewards you with one of his old swords.
                    He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
                        But he's all fucked up from fighting.
                    >and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
                    It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
                        Take notes CD project, take notes!
                He needs to be the first Witcher to die in his bed.
                    who's gonna tell him
                Didn‚Äôt they already announced he won‚Äôt? At least not as the main character. Or am I imagining things again?
                    Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
                Very high chances Geralt won't come back, at least not in a major way. The Polish voice actor had serious health issues. The Reds brought him back for new quest in this update (new armor set) and were very lucky the actor could do this one quest for them, even though he sounds a bit different. At the moment I don't think he could do voiceover for entire game.
                    Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
                    The character is not the voice. See God of War.
            Please tell me the "filterless toussaint mod" gets a pass in next gen , toussaint is much better with that mod
            Peak Witcher is in either Hearts of Stone or Velen side quests. But that's for me. Blood and Wine was great and different but I prefer more grime side of Witcher
        If the game was just skellige I might have actually visited all the loot barrels there haha
            I did this in my first playthrough. Never again.
                I kept thinking there was gonna be some cool Easter egg or hidden treasure on one of the dozens of tiny islands you stumble across surrounded by these treasures. Nothing. Not that I found anyway, though there were some unused assets for cut quests
                    IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
                        ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
                Those whales scare you too? I'm scared rn
            I usually 100% games that I love but seriously fuck dealing with sailing and harpies for basically fuck all.
                If they made water based combat less terrible I wouldn't mind

But when your only options are horribly weak crossbow or sword fighting on a tiny platform, im just going to avoid it wherever possible.
                Yeah i hated Skellige tbh lol, such a pain in the ass to traverse
            Still don‚Äôt think I would have the extra 200 hours to invest in that endeavor.
            Fuck that quest! I get terrible OCD about completing *all the things*, and sailing around diving for all those stupid barrels was *the worst*.
        Toussaint was absolutely gorgeous, especially compared to walking around the bleak war torn areas of the map. I'm excited to see what it looks like.

Honestly that‚Äôs basically Irish mythology in a nutshell. Check out the Candlelit Tales podcast if you like stories where nothing good happens and everybody dies at the end.
True the wedding quest in heart of stone is magical
    Hearts of Stone is just magical in general. That whole thing was just so well done.
        It's one of my favorite quest lines from any video game I've ever played.
        HoS gets my vote for best 10 hours of story in video game history.
The Witcher 3 is definitely a game that needs to be played to appreciate it. Its beauty doesn't really translate to screenshots, or even videos, really.

It's best appreciated when playing it and taking in the whole package.

        What was that?!

Must've been the wind.
Well, just like most recent upgrades and remasters it looks like they did a lot of work on lighting so it should be even better.
oh yeah, velen during the sunset?

^*magnificent*
Amen. Nothing has ever felt more tactile in video games than the wind moving the grass, the setting sun, all of it.
And foggggg
Happy cake day dude
A lot of QoL improvements as well like a new quick casting feature for controllers, a new behind the back camera angle like an Arkham game. UI improvements for immersion, a toggable less cluttered map etc.
    Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter, I highly recommend both. Inventory management is my least favorite feature in gaming in general.
        > Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter

Not lighting god damn candles when you're trying to loot is about 20 of those
            This guy loots
        Fast travel from anywhere is also great, especially for a replay. I can understand wanting exploration and immersion on a first play through, but damn it saves so much time not having to find a signpost anytime you want to go somewhere, especially when doing an armor quest or traveling around to craft something etc.
            Yeah definitely grab that one too.

As a compromise for explorers it would be cool if it were unlocked after discovering 100% of the map or something.
                The thing is, fast travel anywhere can break a lot of quests that require you to be funneled towards a certain point. That's the issue with the mod and you never know which quest might break if you fast travel in the middle of it. 

Maybe they'll make it work in a patch since I don't see it in the list of included mods.
            Galloping in cities is an amazing mod too
            I always used the fast travel mod because the immersion was broken when you got to the signpost anyway, whether you fast travel from there or where you are it makes no difference, and I prefer exploring on my own terms rather than when the game makes me.
                I just meant by having to walk more and seeing more of the map as opposed to just main areas
            also a big fan of map quest objectives. puts the quest markers on your map, and lets you highlight and mark them instead of selecting it from your quest list and then going to your map to see where it is.
            It's been years since I played this game but I remember using a fast travel mod and it breaking a couple quests that have triggers that can be unwittingly bypassed if you fast travel away.

Hopefully they fixed that but if not, be careful with when you fast travel
        That's why I love Horizon Forbidden West's inventory changes from the first game. They just send things to your stash and you can resupply there.
            That was excellent. It let them still design difficult fights that can‚Äôt be cheese by having 5000 healing potions, but doesn‚Äôt punish a player for collecting *everything, all the time*. 

It encouraged me to think about what variation of ammo I used when, what buffs I had going, etc. huge improvement over the first game.
                Also: Looting from the mount. Holy hell.
            A welcome improvement. Now if they just took a page from BOTW and made looting instant...
                There‚Äôs an option for that
                They have an accessibility feature to auto pick shit. Turned it on and it was SO MUCH better.
        PREACH. 60 kilograms of swords, armor, daggers, all kinds of shit in your "backpack", but nah, can't fit _one more_ sword, that's just too much. I have never understood where weight limit came from, it's not like there's this "realism" factor to being able to only carry 50 swords where the player can't see them, but not 51 once you hit the limit.

I modded Witcher 3 to have no weight limit and it was infinitely more enjoyable.
            Same. I did this for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. I just don't see the point. Which means you can also ignore any potions and abilities that increase your weight limit, letting you focus on the more interesting parts of the game.
        Inventory limits in games like these litterally do only one thing, and that's make you waste your time going back and forth to sell items. The inventory is big enough that removing the weight limit basically has no real influence on gameplay or balance, only on time for people who like to pick up everything.
        Inventory management is tricky. You have to be really familiar with a game to do it well, know what to take and when and what to leave. It‚Äôs especially hard if you put down a game for a bit then go back and try to remember what you actually need to have. I have this problem with the Witcher but not with Fallout but I‚Äôve also put over ten times the hours into Fallout 3, NV, and 4.
        Auto-Oil will also reduce the amount of time you spend in the inventory.
        Dont ever touch Fallout 76 then, dont even need to mention the other major issues
        Interesting. I enjoy inventory management tbh
        Is no weight limit gonna be available in this update?
            I assume the current mods will work unless there are dramatic changes.
    Please tell me I no longer have to light up 20 candles every time I steal from the poorest family in the village.
    I think GoW 2018 has made the over-the-shoulder angle the most popular. It definitely helps the world feel more in-scale.
Makes absolute sense since the modders of these games do ridiculous things. I hope they incorporate various fixes and tweaks that people have made, there were literally hundreds of tiny ones for skyrim that did all manner of minor things, like changing one texture or fixing one npc pathing bug etc
    Developers should really take advantage of modders more often. They're already fixing the game for free out of there own love for it why not partner with them in some way.
        Is that Saints Row 2 patch ever going to come out or is that just a myth now? They could have released it years ago and modders could have done the rest. Now it looks grim since Volition is now Gearbox.
    Mods for Skyrim and the 3D Fallout games were a *huge* factor in increasing their replayability. My 2nd playthrough of most of those games were with a lot of mods that made me savor the world and gameplay.

An inventory and UI mod for Skyrim was my go-to. The default was just not intuitive.
    If only Rockstar did this with manhunt red dead 2 bully edition.
What?! Definitely excited to play it again
Do we hav a list of all the QoL / mods that are included now!?
I'm interested to see how much stuff they left in. Particularly hoping that the buffs to Bombs and Crossbows come across, and also that the flying monster knockdown fall damage is preserved, because it's hilarious lol.
The updated graphics is literally just a community mod
Unless I've read the list wrong it only has 6 mods included
Is this update for PC too?
What the fuck are you even trying to say here
> tones of community mods

Many different tones? It must be very musical.
Exactly!  People seem to have forgotten this very important detail.  This is an update for a game released in 2015.
    It's an *incredibly* easy detail to miss in the current world of greedy game developers and publishers
        wouldnt it be easier to miss if everyone did this? i feel like this is the key factor in it all because of expectation of greed
        Bruh this same company was totally dishonest and lied about their last release so badly PlayStation pulled it from their store, that was partly greed lol
            Sony pulled it from the store not because it was buggy, but because CDPR said that people should return the game and Sony threw a fit.
Should also be noted if you don‚Äôt own it, it‚Äôs on sale for 10$ on GOG right now!
    Not bad for one of the best games of all time. Plus when you are done with it, there‚Äôs a whole entire mini game where you play as a witcher hunting monsters and tracking your daughter through deadly wilderness and locales.
        Its wild how they made an entire RPG as side content in a card game.
            You two just made this entire thread.
        On one hand, at least it's not a gatcha/microtransaction based, but on the other, I spent hundreds of hours grinding through the side games for more cards before I had a competitive deck.
            Just pay ng spies. Or nr spies. 

Or uh. Yeah that.
            Nah, its not hard to have a competitive deck in the default type. If u wanna play monster cards on the other hand....
        I heard you can even own your own vineyard. Amazing stuff for a card game
    Got it for like $3 during steam sale best purchase ever
    Goty edition is $3.80.
Even if you bought it on sale digitally? It dont have to be a specific version purchased?


I bought Witcher 3 on PSN on sale for cheap, but never got around to playing more than the first hour. (I cant seem to stop doing that. I keep buying games on sale for $10-15 and ignoring them)

Lately I resolved to start working though my backlog of sale games. Im going throigh Death Stranding now and was planning on doing Ghost of Tsushima next, not sure about after that though.

I have Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Deathloop, Outer Worlds, and a few others I bought and never got around too.
    Yeah. You bought the game and now you get the free upgrade. It doesn't matter which version.
        If you also want the extra DLC for free, I think you need to have owned it before as well (or have the GOTY edition which includes them).
            The free DLC was basically two free games
                Wasn't free if you bought them back when they came out, but they were well worth the twenty bucks or whatever I paid for them.
            As far I know the only edition of the game I have seen, at least on PC, is the ultimate edition which includes the paid expansions. But I have no clue for the console versions.
                On Steam there's a standard version with no DLC, and a separate GOTY edition which costs a little more and includes all the DLC.
                    Same with xbox.
    Witcher 3 should be at the top of your list! Incredible game :)
    Have fun with Ghost of Tsushima. I loved that game
        Just finished it, this game is so beautiful and fun to play!
            Yeah, the gameplay variety can be kind of limited, but the beautiful world and art style combined with tight core mechanics and a moving story made it my favorite game of 2020
    I bought it on super sale on PC and Steam was telling me it was coming‚Ä¶ so I think yes.
    >Even if you bought it on sale digitally? It dont have to be a specific version purchased?

I specifically bought the GOTY version (or whatever it's called) months ago when it was $10 in anticipation of this update
    Witcher 3, cyberpunk and ghost's of Tsushima are probably in my top 5 games in the last decade. Amazing games. I hope you have a lot of free time on your hands lol.
        Damn, in the season‚Äôs sale I decided to only buy two games. I went for rdr2 and had to make a choice between cyberpunk and spider man remastered. I picked spider man but now I feel like I made a mistake lol
        Witcher 3, Cyberpunk and Breath of the Wild for me. Haven‚Äôt played Ghosts of Tsushima because I haven‚Äôt had a PlayStation before. A friend just gave me their PS4 when they got a PS5 so think I need to play that next!
    Bro Witcher 3 is like 200-300 hours long. Gaming is a serious hobby lol
        Are those completionist numbers? A typical full playthrough (including sidequests and DLCs) is closer to ~125 hours. Howlongtobeat says ~200 hours for completionists.
            I feel like I'm an outlier but I find every single howlongtobeat way too short for completionist run. It's like they timed how long it would be to speed though grabbing collectables with a guide instead of actually playing the game.
            Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot! I spent just over 300 hours without the DLC, for a near-ish completion run. I did all the side quests, collected all of the Gwent cards, fully upgraded at least 2 schools‚Äô gear sets and collected/partially upgraded the others, and completed the entire map in Velen/Novigrad and White Orchard but not Skellige. But this does also include time I spent doing shit like taking screenshots of the sunset and finding the longest paths to slide down the Skellige mountainsides, lol.
Probably as godly as Yennefer thinks it looks
Would like to see him after a month of not using it lol

    >That's a patented name

I think minoxidil is the generic name of the drug. Rogaine is the patented name.
    My brand!
I find it a tad misleading bc the last gen‚Äôs pic doesn‚Äôt use the hairworks setting even though it had it and the new one does.
Same. I've been delaying replaying it until this update is released. Looking forward to it.
    You know what, I'm gonna play it again too... on my PS4, just to join you guys.
        I to will join, but not again as this will be my first time!
            I'd pay good money to play it again for the first time. Enjoy it!
                Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha. 

If the download ever finishes... It's at 6.7GB out of 32.1GB and downloading at a speed of: \~30KB/s

; \]
    I played it again last summer but stopped after the main game to do the DLCs after this update. Now that I'm planning on upgrading from Series S to Series X, I might play through it all with raytracing from the beginning lol
    played it once so far when i got my SX, and for about 2 years now was waiting for this upgrade to do a death march playthrough. It already looked great when i played it back then so i cant wait
Hairworks looks like ass too. I prefer the non-simmed hair. It was the same thing with Tomb Raider and her hair looking like it's made out of silk how it blows around constantly. Looked so unnatural but it's supposed to be better because it has physics! But they go too crazy with it and the hair ends up moving in an unnatural way.
    I personally think it just makes hair looks like strands of clay in Witcher 3. It never appealed to me at all, especially with the crazy performance impact even with a 1080ti which was top of the line back then. I didn't find it to be as bad in Tomb Raider but I still kept it off on those games too.
    I love it for monsters, on them it looks incredible. There‚Äôs a mod on pc that disables hair works on Geralt but leaves it on monsters.
That was my thought too, and honestly it looks like mid graphics settings with the lack of lighting blend.  Not sure what level the new is on though. 

I was running a 1060 on PC when I picked up the original, so about 1 year after release.  And running on ultra with hairworks was notably cool, but if I wanted zero drops, I'd still turn it off.  Not worth looking at 10,000 separate hairs to miss a hit on a banshee.
Probably because it was originally not enabled on consoles, but is in the new version.
consoles
>no longer required to have an Nvidia card?

Never was.
It's interesting that people say this. I bought it on PC when it released but never finished the game for whatever reason. 

Came back a year ago and tried but the animations, roach (and geralts) movement, and the lifeless NPCs seemed Soo janky and dated. 

I know it's an unfair comparison but I think games like rdr2 and even GTA 5 set the bar really high for me on PC. 

That said, I downloaded some mods and it totally changed things...I still think the game is a master piece even if I never finished it. Hoping to complete it with the remaster.
    I think it's a difference between visual detail and animation. Visually I would say Witcher 3 wins out (though not like GTA 5 is slacking), but as far as animation goes I agree that GTA 5 is just super impressive. There's been some serious advancement in the nuances in video games, so I can see a bit how that part might be the thing that makes Witcher 3 age, but at least personally I don't think it's aged out yet.
        I'd argue it's really just Rockstar that has incredible animation in their open world games.  Assassins Creed for example has extremely janky animation even in the latest releases.

A lot of what makes RDR2 and GTA 5's animation great is also why people find the controls sluggish feeling.  It takes a bit of time for the character to turn or speed up into a run because the game gives characters a sense of weight and momentum, and in turn this give the animation time to play out.  In many other games, for example, when a character turns they pop into the new direction with a little bit of settle, they don't shift their weight and turn their hips and take a step.  Animation in games will always be a push and pull with how responsive you want the controls to feel.
        When it comes to GTA games you can thank Euphoria for that.
        I think we‚Äôve just come through a period with some real genre defying games. I think withcher 3 belongs on that list, it just dropped before some real heavy hitters.
First time i see someone says the witcher 3 animations were good, let alone "movie like". They were terrible. Super dated and janky. The graphics were gorgeous tho
>shitty compressed screenshots

omg, right? Like I can see the difference in the OP photo, but it's full of .jpg compression artifacts. Makes fine detail very difficult to see. Very bad image tro use for a comparison.
And it‚Äôs not stuck at 30 fps on consoles anymore
Well... Duh. You get used to everything, but if you were to play the old version again you'd definitely notice a difference
    And the proceed to get used to it again within the hour.
        Yeah and I can get used to Banjo Kazooie visuals after an hour
        So, the solution is to play any game despite of what it looks
> Obvious improvement.

Not in all details. I think the old hair texture looks better than the new one with physics, which just looks like strips of plastic.
That's because it's not an obvious improvement at all.

Maybe the rest of the game is noticeably more attractive, but these screenies look like side by sides from the same year with bloom on and off. And the bloom is way overkill. Why are the faces shiny?
    Part of the problem is that it's a shitty, low resolution screen shot.  They improved the textures of a ton of stuff as well as adding extra draw distance and denser foliage, but a big part of the update are two types of ray-traced lighting and better HDR, none of which is in this screen shot.  All of that being said, it's still a 7 year old game.  It isn't like it suddenly looks like it came out this year, but if you want a better idea of the differences, Digital Foundry published a preview video last week.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if they also post an in-depth comparison once they're allowed to have it themselves.  The footage in this video is from a press event they were invited to.  

[YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/6Nzs-__nlTo)
    There's very little bloom on either screenshot. The right side has substantially better lighting, is that what you call bloom?

As for the faces, it's raining? You can see the guy's shirt is soaking wet on both screenshots, and there's a few droplets visible on both sides.
    As another guy said, this is a horrible representation of it. You need to fire up the game yourself to truly admire the differences. 

Viewing any kind of screenshot or video online is not going to give you an accurate representation. 

I remember thinking the TLOU Part 1 remake looked good, but once I actually played it - I realized it was stunning.
It‚Äôs not a true next gen game, it‚Äôs just an upgrade. It‚Äôs upgradable on the PC too which means the version you played was inferior
Yeah exactly. I played it on pc for years and it looked exactly like the right lol.
I thought it meant next gen relative to the release date of the game, which is 2015.
That's against the law!  *Grabs pitchfork*
Looks whiter.

    Oh I'm not saying there aren't I just want to see them I'll look them up in a bit. I'll just probably wait and install it on Wednesday
It's a parasite therm pushed by "hypers", I bet they don't even realize what it actually means and calling every single "good" videocard/console as "nextgen". Technically, it should be rightfully applied only to *unexisting* things, which only in plans/development right now, and everything else already mass-released shouldn't even have "special" name as it's just "current" one... 

But I bet that doesn't bother anyone of those who uses this word mindlessly... As well as hundreds(you'll be surprised...) other words...
To be fair, cropping from a Youtube video with 720p resolution ain't gonna show any of the new graphic fidelity lmao!
RT global illumination.
That's all I'm seeing and don't really like it
added shitty bloom effects r/gaming "woooah"
God seriously. There‚Äôs so many people saying it doesn‚Äôt look any different based on 1 single screenshot. I‚Äôve seen a lot of comparisons it‚Äôs a big difference. But fuck even a 60fps patch for new consoles and DLSS/FSR support on pc would‚Äôve been worth a whole 0 dollars

Even if it wasn‚Äôt a big difference how can anyone possibly complain about getting something no matter how unnecessary it might be for free? I don‚Äôt get it.

They could‚Äôve done absolutely nothing and no one would‚Äôve said a thing

We should be praising CDPR for this in hopes that other devs and publishers get the idea and do it themselves. Complaining about it just makes it less likely for other companies to do this.
I concur. I started Witcher 3 but never got very far. Might give it another go, eventually, with the shiny new upgrade.
[deleted]
I doubt it. There were plenty of issues in the Switch version, such as half rate backround animations, that were already changed for the PC release on Steam, but they didn't completely redo the graphical style or game logic as it was always intended to be a handheld title that would be released on other platforms coincidentally. If you want a graphically impressive version I guess Monster Hunter: World, such as it is, is your choice.
The face of the woman next to Geralt looks pretty different

But everyone else, yeah just seems like lighting differences
There's better shadow depth - esp the inside of the tent. But yes, the lighting looks worse in this. I'm very surprised people are fawning over it. Probably in aggregate it looks better, but not this screenie.
Yeah these screenshots are incredibly similar. I'd even say the hair looks worse in the new version, it looks like a bad photoshop masking job. Did this game really need a visual update?
It‚Äôs free so does it matter? I‚Äôd argue that Ray tracing, DLSS/FSR are in engine cutscenes and 60fps modes on consoles alone are a big enough improvement  alone to justify this. 

In engine cutscenes especially. That‚Äôs huge. I don‚Äôt know what the original ones were rendered at probably 1080p but playing at 4k on a large screen makes pre rendered ones look terrible. It also means smoother transitions from gameplay to cutscene while also having the cutscene look how the game does.
True, the game was so well made, you can barely tell the difference between generations.
    The Ps4 version definitely looks worse than the new update, i played it on pc before ps4 and was startled by the drop in quality.
This comment is literally the first mention of cyberpunk I saw in this post
I think people wonder why tf OP picked this screenshot. If I put them side by side, I'd assume that they came out simultaneously and the one on the right has bad HDR.
Wifi
More like raytraced global illumination and raytraced ambient occlusion
It certainly is crazy how lighting can really impact a video game's scene.
    I mean, everything we see in the real world is literally lighting, so it's not that crazy.
    I would say this day and age lighting has theb biggest impact.
You can tell it's not 2015/2016 anymore because you didn't get downvoted for saying that.
    I‚Äôm playing it for the first time now. Apparently there is was a a hot topic at one point. 

I just learned about the new movement setting 5 min ago.
To be fair Skyrim had a free update on Ps5 Xbox Series X/S unlike GTA V.
    They're letting any plans of an rdr2 update or remaster rot in a ditch iirc because of how poorly received the GTA remake was alongside how GTA online sells stupid dlc like hotcakes so why even bother updating rdr.
        it's insane to me, that they somehow believe it's due to lack of interest in remasters or remakes.. but in reality, the GTA trilogy was a fucking desaster. pressed on disc. it was doomed the moment someone decided it was okay to release it like that.


dude i am so in for red dead redemption 1 and an upgrade for 2 to next gen.
4k and 60 fps very needed for both.


the rdr1 remaster leaks looked very good to me. would buy it day 1 if it's not filled and a complete mess like the gta trilogy was.



edit: after some additional research to the rdr1 remaster topic; unfortunately it appears to have been a fan-mod of the xbox 360 version running in an emulator... at least that's what a few sources say. so the remaster of rdr1 wasn't real after all it seems.
        Man what I would give for a GTA 3D universe remake that's playable for someone born this millineum
            Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
        Why would we need rdr2 update? That game still look gorgeous.
            I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
                And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
                    The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
                All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
    Skyrim gets a lot of flack for the stream of re-release but at least they usually had some content differences involved. Regular, GOTY, Special, and Anniversary

Skyrim had a free update to sse and then ae (without the full cc package) if you owned it already
    Right? I bought Skyrim from GameStop midnight release. It was just a steam key. 11 years later I have gotten all of the updates (SSE AND NOW AE) for absolutely free. Fucking good value.
        As good a game the witcher is, it'll never outlive Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game. It's a game engine and modders' playground.
            Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
                Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
                    For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
        Same, and with all of the mods out there, at least on PC, the game still looks pretty badass even today imo.

        Tbf, if you bought it past 2013/2014, you'd most likely be buying the Legendary Edition, which had all the DLC. Usually was around $20. They delisted it when SE came out so you couldn't just buy the old one that way anymore, which is a little wack, but SE runs so much better and has all the DLC as well, so.
        I mean, it was 3 DLCs, and two of them were full on expansions and the other regularly hit rock bottom prices and was necessary for a fair number of good mods.

If you had any interest in skyrim and didn't own the DLC already you were doing yourself a massive disservice.
I did get a free Skyrim upgrade years ago.
If we're fair about Skyrim, it did get some engine upgrades that do technically make it a different game.
It started with shark cards and is now at paying for 60fps
I got the 2020 edition ot gta 4 and it is a total joke man. No character audio at all. I contact them and they want me to get buy the newer version from their website
I'm pretty positive that is correct, yes.
The pc version gets the free upgrade also fyi.
I played half life 2 for the first time as a kid in probably 2010. I turned to my dad after getting through Route Kanal and said "this game looks just like real life!" He laughed.
    I wish I still had the eyes of a child. But they fell out of my pocket when I went for a walk the other day so I'll have to find some new ones.
        I had the eyes of a child at one time. Shortly after my parents divorce i realized they were going to buy my love so i did what any kid of the mid 90s would do, i made sure they bought me every video game and console i saw. One day after svhool i was playing my virtual boy. My dad bought this thing and my mom hated it, she was sure i was going to go blind. For the uninitiated, virtual boy was designed like the oculus and played 3d games on 32 bit. THIRTYTWO BIT. This was circa 96/97 because i didnt have my 64 or jaguar yet. So i strapped this thing on my head and decided to start playing warioland because it was new and i wanted to escape for several hours. Well noone told me the battery life on my new virtual boy was trash. Like 3 or 4 hours and the thing was dead so i took it off and then i realized all my mothers fears had come true. The batteries hadnt died. I had fucking gone blind. I couldnt see a fucking thing. I was panicking. The pure fear set in i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe. Little 7 year old me knew he couldnt live life without vision. So i did what any child would do. I cried. Not quietly, no, i sobbed loudly. My brother came into the room to tell me to shut the fuck up and thats when i realized, i hadnt gone blind. It had just gotten dark outside and i had no lights on. I was a dumb child. Im a pretty dumb adult.
            Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
                Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

    Half Life 2's graphics have held up enormously well though. You can cherry pick some of the canal and still find photo-real scenes (which fall apart if you get close, yes).

NPC asset quality and facial animations are still 2nd to very very few. It also somehow avoid the "plastic shiny" feel a lot of hyper modern engines have.

The entire lighting system in that game was "pre-baked" and the pre-baker used a lot of raytracing for the "globally illuminated" look. Ahead of its time and hella efficient. Lots of games without dynamic time of day copied the method for the next two decades.
        Textures in HL2 have this inherent grittiness unique to it. It really does feel more real than most things released since. Like you mentioned, so many games feel almost *too* perfect and refined. Everything looks shiny, clean, and fake. HL2, partially because it was a post apocalyptic game, had this ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù to it that I haven‚Äôt seen replicated perfectly since. I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
            g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
                All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
                    Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
                        Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                            If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
            It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
        Going back and playing HL2 or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines it‚Äôs just insane how good the facial animations were, there‚Äôs games that come out 20+ years later that still somehow fuck it up.
         the best water I've seen in any game
            It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
        I played Portal raytraced and thought this is basically how I rememeber Portal looking when it came out.  It ran so badly however that I then ran the original Portal, and I finished it again it was so good. The game still holds up great, but the lighting, materials and textures look like something out of Quake 2.

It really make you appreciate how much accurate lighting, shadows and nice materials can change a game.
        The first engine I saw using pre-baked lighting that had path-trace (and surface-illumination) was in Quake 2 from 1997. Its resolution was quite crude compared to Half-Life 2, which resulted in some fairly chunky shadows. Generating these lightmaps back then was a *slow* process.

The Source engine has its roots in a branch of the original Quake's codebase, so it makes sense that bounced lighting could be easily implemented. Not sure if the original Half-Life games incorporated that...
        the way you describe how modern games look is exactly what i always felt looking at them but i couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. yeah, they look like plastic. it doesn‚Äôt look real. like for example bf5 looks much worse compared to bf1 because everything looks plasticy and featureless
    HL2 holds up *exceptionally* well. A lot of it is from the textures -- I don't know how to describe it, but there is a "coherence" among every texture that nothing looked particularly out of place. 

Compare it to say Black Mesa, BM might have much higher resolution textures, but a lot of them somehow looked "flat" and cartoonish, a bit like the "HD texture pack for minecraft" memes.
        A good art direction goes much further for making a visually stunning game than brute forcing it with higher res textures, models, and graphic tech.
        I just played through Portal with RTX and the whole time I thought, of all games, Portal doesn't need this. The original was done so well because the aesthetics were clean and the engine handled light and reflection pretty well to begin with.
            Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
                >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.
        https://youtu.be/mnxs6CR6Zrk

I'm not 100% sure but I think this video touches on why HL2 looks so good. Pretty interesting video regardless if you're into that kind of thing
    I think it has do with the fact we tie it to experiential memory. "I was going through this alley and a face hugger popped up, so I used my gravity gun to catch and release a barrel right in it's face!" It ties in all the emotional energy you may have had and whatever associations the images first game you all get linked like a custom circuit. (I am not a neruologist!)

Gaming is a live experience, and thus gets filed away differently.
        I think they're also a highly comparative medium. Graphics that are contemporaneously considered cutting edge tend to remain that way in ours heads because at the time we can't imagine anything looking better so our memories of them get updated as modern graphics improve. Plus the immersive nature of video games means the best of them make us feel like they're actually happening in a sense. 

I remember playing Spidey PS4 and thinking this is exactly how I remember Spider-man 2 on the PS2 looking. Even more recently when I first saw the Dead Space Remake gameplay I was almost disappointed at what I considered a lack of real improvement. I really thought I was looking at a remaster more than a ground up remake. Then they showed the comparison to the original side by side and my jaw dropped at just how dated the original looked. Memory is a funny thing.
            Halo MCC has a toggle to switch between the remastered and original graphics. It's a trip to go back and forth between them.
                Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
                    You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
                    For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
        Absolutely- similar to the way we remember stories in books which have no images at all (well, maybe illustrations)
        VR is a whole different ballgame with regards to immersion and memories. After I played HL Alyx I could think back to certain scenes or set pieces in the game and it really felt like an actual memory, like I'd really lived it. It was super weird.
    I remember getting a PS1 and Tomb Raider III for Christmas in the late nineties, then booting it up on my old big ass TV and being like "wow, it will never get any more realistic than this," polygon everything (boobs) and all.
    Honestly I think HL2 still looks great. Black Mesa has great assets and you can tell the difference when you look but while you're playing it's very easy to forget that the game came out 15 years ago.
    My uncle was playing Madden 2005 or something around that time
 My grandfather came into the room and said he couldn't tell if it was real football or a video game. We all agreed.
    I mean, half life two still looks pretty freaking good.
    The game still looks very good though.
    It was an amazing looking game for it's time. Shit, it still looks good.
    HL2 still holds up
    HL2 still looks good. It has aged better than most games. I plays it though like every other year. Last two times hs been in VR.
That's how ES oblivion for me was, I was playing the NES games for a while so when I saw a friend play Oblivion I never saw a game look so realistic. Then I played it again years later a bit after Skyrim came out and the difference was insane.
    I remember looking at Oblivion when it was new and also thinking "games will never look better than this" 

I think part of it is that it was a new game for the 360, where as ps2/OGXbox games still had a pretty blocky look to them (although it was an improvement over PS1 games) so a game engine being able to convey roundness seemed like a graphical breakthrough. and oh man... were those faces [round](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/elderscrolls/Newheim_the_Portly.jpg)
        I said that once. "graphics will never be better than this!" That was for battle arena toshindan ü§£
            Star Wars Battlefront II for me. I don‚Äôt even think they were that good but I remember being like ¬´¬†damn it feels like I‚Äôm on Kashyyk rn¬†¬ª
        Im playing oblivion at 4k 60 on my series x and I'm still impressed by the graphics. The textures on the walls and design of the environments are pretty impressive for 2006. Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad, but that wouldn't have been much of an issue at 720p.
            >Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad

I actually think the opposite. Oblivion at a distance looks like a painting (even today), it's just when you get up close and see the character models and animations that it starts to show it's age.
                Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
                    Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
                    The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
                I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
        Stepping out of the sewers for the first time...god what an unforgettable feeling. Being in awe of the colors and the water and the Ayleid ruin across the lake.
I guess our brains have built in anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion lol

It's funny how that works. I had the same experience with Ocarina of Time. When ZFG streams it it's beautifully upscaled and looks great, just how I remembered it. When I saw how it actually looked back on the N64 I was blown away.

Maybe any game memories that stick around that long get confused with "real" memories and our brains kinda make them fit more closely to real life.

        Very good point. I started thinking about that when I saw a recent frontpage post with comparisons of the same sprites on CRT vs modern monitors. CRT even seems to add the illusion of shadows, if the sprites are designed for it.
        I used to have a 21‚Äù Sun monitor that weighed over 70 damn pounds.  Amazing picture.  Probably would have kept it well into the flat-panel era if it just didn‚Äôt weigh so much.
    Our brains also have auto fps increase too, i remember first watching a 60fps video a decade+ ago and thought nothing could be better.

    Yea but even playing Goldeneye again after playing Halo or Splinter Cell on the og Xbox made it look rough.
        Splinter cell looked unbelievably good at the time
            It really did look good. That 5 or so year period between N64 games and Xbox stuff was an insane jump compared to the difference in 5 year old games today.

The 3rd game, Chaos Theory, is still one of my all-time favorites. Man it is a bummer that Splinter Cell is basically dead as a franchise and we probably won't be getting a new Splinter Cell for a long, long time. Like, Ubisoft has Ghost Recon and Assassins Creed, combine the concepts into a modern open-world stealth/stealth action game, it would probably have a huge audience.
    Man, like a decade ago, someone left a late model crt outside to be picked up as trash. My friends and I grabbed it, hauled it into my buddies house, pulled out the old SNES and spent the next few days beating mega man X before putting the tv back out on the curb to be picked up with the trash.

SNES games looked stunning on it. It was a very late CRT, flat screen rather than curved like cheaper ones but thiiiic and extremely heavy.

Same friend bought a neo geo arcade unit a few years later with a crt screen. Definitely looks good.
    Its not so much that CRT display them batter, but that the pixels were never meant to be displayed sharply. Filters can replicate the look perfectly fine. The issue is more that a lot of people never played them back on CRT and don't realize how they should display.
I remember seeing NFL 2k for Dreamcast in a Babbages and thinking it was a live NFL game on TV. I was convinced that was the peak of what games could look like.
    I remember buying that game,  and everybody who saw it thought it was real. Showed it to my boss who only played pc games,  and he went and picked up a dreamcast that day.
    To be fair visual concepts did an outstanding job.  No Madden can hold a candle to 2K5 and I‚Äôm still angry about it all.  Fuck EA.
Honestly that is probably because you played it on a CRT and then went back and played it on an LED tv.
    No, this is a pretty common phenomenon. Our minds fill in detail that was never there.
        Both are true, old games really did look better‚Ä¶but only on CRTs. That ever so slight blur and image distortion helped. The sprites of 2D games and textures of 3D games often look like absolute ass on HD LEDs, way worse than they originally looked.
            It‚Äôs not so much that the CRT blur inherently helped, it‚Äôs that it was quantifiable and things from that era were designed with it in mind. You take those unmodified inputs and put them in a different context and what had been carefully designed to blend in sticks out badly.
*Bethesda enters the chat*
    If you had Skyrim LE, the SE game was completely free. If you have SE, you get the Anniversary Edition patches + 4 CC content for free.
        Just wait until you want to play in VR.
    Get out!
        Go on! Git!
            Yeah git, ok another terrible vr port which you lean on modders to ‚ÄúFIX,‚Äù but after that yew GITONOUTAHERE
                I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
            Hey we have the same face!
        They can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs an object in the way of the door; you have to glitch yourself out until the community creates a patch to fix it!
    SE was free on PC (console wasn‚Äôt back compat at the time), and Anniversary was free on both (with option bundle of all Creation club content)
    Bethesda is actually doing this exact same thing with Fallout 4. Total next-gen face-lift for free, sometime in the spring.
And Atlus. They have sold us P5 like 5 times already.
    P5 in name? Yeah. Actual just P5? 3 times. Vanilla p5, 1sr release of Royal, then the ports this year.
    They just released it for platforms that never had it to begin with???? Royal is different from the first and adds like 40 hours??? Strikers and the Rhythm game are just completely different games.
    And Bethesda, Skyrim on every electronic device...still waiting for our god Todd Howard to release it on some fucking smart toaster.
        The upgrade to SE, VR and AE were all free if you bought the original game. Don't be dishonest.
            dishonestly is all these people know. Reddit hates Bethesda, so why tell the truth when you can lie and get infinite upvotes
                It's the worst kind of lazy.
                    well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(
    It would be worth checking the data but I feel like the majority of remastered, repackaged games have been coming from Japanese devs. Not to say that Western devs haven‚Äôt put a lot of those too.
        Interesting point there, I haven't thought about it myself. If there's a good and kinda necessary remaster, I'm down for it. Otherwise is just reselling the same game.
            To be fair, some of it is also due to the lack of backward compatibility and a lot of ports from handheld titles which were more popular in Japan than in the West.
Maybe they realized they have some good will to buy back.
    Nah, CDPR has always done stuff like this. It's just nobody noticed until W3 because that was the first one to be popular
Naughty Dog sold the last of us remaster even more expensive than the original lol
    The PS5 *remake* costs more than the original, which is fair. A ton of work was needed to complete it.
 Cries in Skyrim special legendary maximum super edition 5.
    All of Skyrims upgrades were free when they were able to give them for free.
You make a wonderful argument in favor of books
    That's why it can be so disappointing to watch film adaptations of your favorite books. I usually have different images of characters in my mind than the movie version. But I guess that also makes it super satisfying when the two versions align.
        Preach, brother / sister. I read TLoTR annually until the Jackson films came out, then it was once a decade because I had *his* images in my head instead of my own.
            I take it you dislike Peter Jackson's vision? Care to elaborate on the why?
                [deleted]
                    This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.

        Their hardware just didn't come with drivers okay
    Except I got integrated graphics when it comes to books
That's climate change for ya.

I mean I'm playing with several HD and other graphical mods so ... My game *does* more or less look like the right side.
    On top of that, today they announced the update uses some the more popular texture mods. Aside from the lighting updates, if you use any of those mods, you‚Äôre not far off.
        Excellent. Why wouldn‚Äôt they use mods that offer a better experience? Other companies should take note.

If it wasn‚Äôt free.. different story but here we are.
            If the quality is there, why do the work again? It must be cheaper too. n designers being paid x dollars for however many months of work vs. offering the mod‚Äôs creator a flat free for use in perpetuity. Any mod creator would probably be so thrilled at the idea of their work being used by the company who created the game they loved enough to mod that they‚Äôd take a few grand.
            Please no. That will very quickly lead to buyable mods and the death of free mods
Plus the left image looks like it was taken on a 720p or below screen. It's way more blurry and blocky than it needed to be when the Witcher 3 launched.

I'm sure the update looks great. Really bad comparison though.
This. I took me a while to find this comment but this is exactly what it looks like on PC with mods. Just the common ones, nothing fancy.
Of course it does. The picture on the left is probably off a PS4, compressed about 20 times and from one of the few moments the game shits the bed lighting wise.
They could've released Skellige or Blood & Wine as standalone games and I think it would've been a success,
    Blood & Wine is peak Witcher 3 for me. Such an absolutely gorgeous area and great epilogue for Geralt.

Look forward to seeing updated Toussaint.
        There's a part of me that hopes they don't bring back Geralt in the next game, at least not in a major way. Him settling down on his farm living a life of luxury is such a perfect end after all the shit he's been through.
            It would be funny if the game took you to Geralt's farm and you get to see him mucking about, randomly lighting and snuffing out torches while cursing a nearby chest, yelling at Roach to get off the roof, and being chased across the yard by horny witches. Instead of killing monsters himself he sends you off on quests to kill them for him because he's so done with that life, and rewards you with one of his old swords.
                He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
                    But he's all fucked up from fighting.
                >and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
                It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
                    Take notes CD project, take notes!
            He needs to be the first Witcher to die in his bed.
                who's gonna tell him
            Didn‚Äôt they already announced he won‚Äôt? At least not as the main character. Or am I imagining things again?
                Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
            Very high chances Geralt won't come back, at least not in a major way. The Polish voice actor had serious health issues. The Reds brought him back for new quest in this update (new armor set) and were very lucky the actor could do this one quest for them, even though he sounds a bit different. At the moment I don't think he could do voiceover for entire game.
                Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
                The character is not the voice. See God of War.
        Please tell me the "filterless toussaint mod" gets a pass in next gen , toussaint is much better with that mod
        Peak Witcher is in either Hearts of Stone or Velen side quests. But that's for me. Blood and Wine was great and different but I prefer more grime side of Witcher
    If the game was just skellige I might have actually visited all the loot barrels there haha
        I did this in my first playthrough. Never again.
            I kept thinking there was gonna be some cool Easter egg or hidden treasure on one of the dozens of tiny islands you stumble across surrounded by these treasures. Nothing. Not that I found anyway, though there were some unused assets for cut quests
                IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
                    ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
            Those whales scare you too? I'm scared rn
        I usually 100% games that I love but seriously fuck dealing with sailing and harpies for basically fuck all.
            If they made water based combat less terrible I wouldn't mind

But when your only options are horribly weak crossbow or sword fighting on a tiny platform, im just going to avoid it wherever possible.
            Yeah i hated Skellige tbh lol, such a pain in the ass to traverse
        Still don‚Äôt think I would have the extra 200 hours to invest in that endeavor.
        Fuck that quest! I get terrible OCD about completing *all the things*, and sailing around diving for all those stupid barrels was *the worst*.
    Toussaint was absolutely gorgeous, especially compared to walking around the bleak war torn areas of the map. I'm excited to see what it looks like.

    Fear a bhata‚Ä¶

Honestly that‚Äôs basically Irish mythology in a nutshell. Check out the Candlelit Tales podcast if you like stories where nothing good happens and everybody dies at the end.
Hearts of Stone is just magical in general. That whole thing was just so well done.
    It's one of my favorite quest lines from any video game I've ever played.

    What was that?!

Must've been the wind.
Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter, I highly recommend both. Inventory management is my least favorite feature in gaming in general.
    > Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter

Not lighting god damn candles when you're trying to loot is about 20 of those
        This guy loots
    Fast travel from anywhere is also great, especially for a replay. I can understand wanting exploration and immersion on a first play through, but damn it saves so much time not having to find a signpost anytime you want to go somewhere, especially when doing an armor quest or traveling around to craft something etc.
        Yeah definitely grab that one too.

As a compromise for explorers it would be cool if it were unlocked after discovering 100% of the map or something.
            The thing is, fast travel anywhere can break a lot of quests that require you to be funneled towards a certain point. That's the issue with the mod and you never know which quest might break if you fast travel in the middle of it. 

Maybe they'll make it work in a patch since I don't see it in the list of included mods.
        Galloping in cities is an amazing mod too
        I always used the fast travel mod because the immersion was broken when you got to the signpost anyway, whether you fast travel from there or where you are it makes no difference, and I prefer exploring on my own terms rather than when the game makes me.
            I just meant by having to walk more and seeing more of the map as opposed to just main areas
        also a big fan of map quest objectives. puts the quest markers on your map, and lets you highlight and mark them instead of selecting it from your quest list and then going to your map to see where it is.
        It's been years since I played this game but I remember using a fast travel mod and it breaking a couple quests that have triggers that can be unwittingly bypassed if you fast travel away.

Hopefully they fixed that but if not, be careful with when you fast travel
    That's why I love Horizon Forbidden West's inventory changes from the first game. They just send things to your stash and you can resupply there.
        That was excellent. It let them still design difficult fights that can‚Äôt be cheese by having 5000 healing potions, but doesn‚Äôt punish a player for collecting *everything, all the time*. 

It encouraged me to think about what variation of ammo I used when, what buffs I had going, etc. huge improvement over the first game.
            Also: Looting from the mount. Holy hell.
        A welcome improvement. Now if they just took a page from BOTW and made looting instant...
            There‚Äôs an option for that
            They have an accessibility feature to auto pick shit. Turned it on and it was SO MUCH better.
    PREACH. 60 kilograms of swords, armor, daggers, all kinds of shit in your "backpack", but nah, can't fit _one more_ sword, that's just too much. I have never understood where weight limit came from, it's not like there's this "realism" factor to being able to only carry 50 swords where the player can't see them, but not 51 once you hit the limit.

I modded Witcher 3 to have no weight limit and it was infinitely more enjoyable.
        Same. I did this for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. I just don't see the point. Which means you can also ignore any potions and abilities that increase your weight limit, letting you focus on the more interesting parts of the game.
    Inventory limits in games like these litterally do only one thing, and that's make you waste your time going back and forth to sell items. The inventory is big enough that removing the weight limit basically has no real influence on gameplay or balance, only on time for people who like to pick up everything.
    Inventory management is tricky. You have to be really familiar with a game to do it well, know what to take and when and what to leave. It‚Äôs especially hard if you put down a game for a bit then go back and try to remember what you actually need to have. I have this problem with the Witcher but not with Fallout but I‚Äôve also put over ten times the hours into Fallout 3, NV, and 4.
    Auto-Oil will also reduce the amount of time you spend in the inventory.
    Dont ever touch Fallout 76 then, dont even need to mention the other major issues
    Interesting. I enjoy inventory management tbh
    Is no weight limit gonna be available in this update?
        I assume the current mods will work unless there are dramatic changes.
Please tell me I no longer have to light up 20 candles every time I steal from the poorest family in the village.
I think GoW 2018 has made the over-the-shoulder angle the most popular. It definitely helps the world feel more in-scale.
Developers should really take advantage of modders more often. They're already fixing the game for free out of there own love for it why not partner with them in some way.
    Is that Saints Row 2 patch ever going to come out or is that just a myth now? They could have released it years ago and modders could have done the rest. Now it looks grim since Volition is now Gearbox.
Mods for Skyrim and the 3D Fallout games were a *huge* factor in increasing their replayability. My 2nd playthrough of most of those games were with a lot of mods that made me savor the world and gameplay.

An inventory and UI mod for Skyrim was my go-to. The default was just not intuitive.
If only Rockstar did this with manhunt red dead 2 bully edition.
It's an *incredibly* easy detail to miss in the current world of greedy game developers and publishers
    wouldnt it be easier to miss if everyone did this? i feel like this is the key factor in it all because of expectation of greed
    Bruh this same company was totally dishonest and lied about their last release so badly PlayStation pulled it from their store, that was partly greed lol
        Sony pulled it from the store not because it was buggy, but because CDPR said that people should return the game and Sony threw a fit.
Not bad for one of the best games of all time. Plus when you are done with it, there‚Äôs a whole entire mini game where you play as a witcher hunting monsters and tracking your daughter through deadly wilderness and locales.
    Its wild how they made an entire RPG as side content in a card game.
        You two just made this entire thread.
    On one hand, at least it's not a gatcha/microtransaction based, but on the other, I spent hundreds of hours grinding through the side games for more cards before I had a competitive deck.
        Just pay ng spies. Or nr spies. 

Or uh. Yeah that.
        Nah, its not hard to have a competitive deck in the default type. If u wanna play monster cards on the other hand....
    I heard you can even own your own vineyard. Amazing stuff for a card game
Got it for like $3 during steam sale best purchase ever
Goty edition is $3.80.
Yeah. You bought the game and now you get the free upgrade. It doesn't matter which version.
    If you also want the extra DLC for free, I think you need to have owned it before as well (or have the GOTY edition which includes them).
        The free DLC was basically two free games
            Wasn't free if you bought them back when they came out, but they were well worth the twenty bucks or whatever I paid for them.
        As far I know the only edition of the game I have seen, at least on PC, is the ultimate edition which includes the paid expansions. But I have no clue for the console versions.
            On Steam there's a standard version with no DLC, and a separate GOTY edition which costs a little more and includes all the DLC.
                Same with xbox.
Witcher 3 should be at the top of your list! Incredible game :)
Have fun with Ghost of Tsushima. I loved that game
    Just finished it, this game is so beautiful and fun to play!
        Yeah, the gameplay variety can be kind of limited, but the beautiful world and art style combined with tight core mechanics and a moving story made it my favorite game of 2020
I bought it on super sale on PC and Steam was telling me it was coming‚Ä¶ so I think yes.
>Even if you bought it on sale digitally? It dont have to be a specific version purchased?

I specifically bought the GOTY version (or whatever it's called) months ago when it was $10 in anticipation of this update
Witcher 3, cyberpunk and ghost's of Tsushima are probably in my top 5 games in the last decade. Amazing games. I hope you have a lot of free time on your hands lol.
    Damn, in the season‚Äôs sale I decided to only buy two games. I went for rdr2 and had to make a choice between cyberpunk and spider man remastered. I picked spider man but now I feel like I made a mistake lol
    Witcher 3, Cyberpunk and Breath of the Wild for me. Haven‚Äôt played Ghosts of Tsushima because I haven‚Äôt had a PlayStation before. A friend just gave me their PS4 when they got a PS5 so think I need to play that next!
Bro Witcher 3 is like 200-300 hours long. Gaming is a serious hobby lol
    Are those completionist numbers? A typical full playthrough (including sidequests and DLCs) is closer to ~125 hours. Howlongtobeat says ~200 hours for completionists.
        I feel like I'm an outlier but I find every single howlongtobeat way too short for completionist run. It's like they timed how long it would be to speed though grabbing collectables with a guide instead of actually playing the game.
        Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot! I spent just over 300 hours without the DLC, for a near-ish completion run. I did all the side quests, collected all of the Gwent cards, fully upgraded at least 2 schools‚Äô gear sets and collected/partially upgraded the others, and completed the entire map in Velen/Novigrad and White Orchard but not Skellige. But this does also include time I spent doing shit like taking screenshots of the sunset and finding the longest paths to slide down the Skellige mountainsides, lol.
>That's a patented name

I think minoxidil is the generic name of the drug. Rogaine is the patented name.
My brand!
You know what, I'm gonna play it again too... on my PS4, just to join you guys.
    I to will join, but not again as this will be my first time!
        I'd pay good money to play it again for the first time. Enjoy it!
            Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha. 

If the download ever finishes... It's at 6.7GB out of 32.1GB and downloading at a speed of: \~30KB/s

; \]
I played it again last summer but stopped after the main game to do the DLCs after this update. Now that I'm planning on upgrading from Series S to Series X, I might play through it all with raytracing from the beginning lol
played it once so far when i got my SX, and for about 2 years now was waiting for this upgrade to do a death march playthrough. It already looked great when i played it back then so i cant wait
I personally think it just makes hair looks like strands of clay in Witcher 3. It never appealed to me at all, especially with the crazy performance impact even with a 1080ti which was top of the line back then. I didn't find it to be as bad in Tomb Raider but I still kept it off on those games too.
I love it for monsters, on them it looks incredible. There‚Äôs a mod on pc that disables hair works on Geralt but leaves it on monsters.
I think it's a difference between visual detail and animation. Visually I would say Witcher 3 wins out (though not like GTA 5 is slacking), but as far as animation goes I agree that GTA 5 is just super impressive. There's been some serious advancement in the nuances in video games, so I can see a bit how that part might be the thing that makes Witcher 3 age, but at least personally I don't think it's aged out yet.
    I'd argue it's really just Rockstar that has incredible animation in their open world games.  Assassins Creed for example has extremely janky animation even in the latest releases.

A lot of what makes RDR2 and GTA 5's animation great is also why people find the controls sluggish feeling.  It takes a bit of time for the character to turn or speed up into a run because the game gives characters a sense of weight and momentum, and in turn this give the animation time to play out.  In many other games, for example, when a character turns they pop into the new direction with a little bit of settle, they don't shift their weight and turn their hips and take a step.  Animation in games will always be a push and pull with how responsive you want the controls to feel.
    When it comes to GTA games you can thank Euphoria for that.
    I think we‚Äôve just come through a period with some real genre defying games. I think withcher 3 belongs on that list, it just dropped before some real heavy hitters.
And the proceed to get used to it again within the hour.
    Yeah and I can get used to Banjo Kazooie visuals after an hour
    So, the solution is to play any game despite of what it looks
Part of the problem is that it's a shitty, low resolution screen shot.  They improved the textures of a ton of stuff as well as adding extra draw distance and denser foliage, but a big part of the update are two types of ray-traced lighting and better HDR, none of which is in this screen shot.  All of that being said, it's still a 7 year old game.  It isn't like it suddenly looks like it came out this year, but if you want a better idea of the differences, Digital Foundry published a preview video last week.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if they also post an in-depth comparison once they're allowed to have it themselves.  The footage in this video is from a press event they were invited to.

There's very little bloom on either screenshot. The right side has substantially better lighting, is that what you call bloom?

As for the faces, it's raining? You can see the guy's shirt is soaking wet on both screenshots, and there's a few droplets visible on both sides.
As another guy said, this is a horrible representation of it. You need to fire up the game yourself to truly admire the differences. 

Viewing any kind of screenshot or video online is not going to give you an accurate representation. 

I remember thinking the TLOU Part 1 remake looked good, but once I actually played it - I realized it was stunning.
Oh I'm not saying there aren't I just want to see them I'll look them up in a bit. I'll just probably wait and install it on Wednesday
The Ps4 version definitely looks worse than the new update, i played it on pc before ps4 and was startled by the drop in quality.
I mean, everything we see in the real world is literally lighting, so it's not that crazy.
I would say this day and age lighting has theb biggest impact.
I‚Äôm playing it for the first time now. Apparently there is was a a hot topic at one point. 

I just learned about the new movement setting 5 min ago.
They're letting any plans of an rdr2 update or remaster rot in a ditch iirc because of how poorly received the GTA remake was alongside how GTA online sells stupid dlc like hotcakes so why even bother updating rdr.
    it's insane to me, that they somehow believe it's due to lack of interest in remasters or remakes.. but in reality, the GTA trilogy was a fucking desaster. pressed on disc. it was doomed the moment someone decided it was okay to release it like that.


dude i am so in for red dead redemption 1 and an upgrade for 2 to next gen.
4k and 60 fps very needed for both.


the rdr1 remaster leaks looked very good to me. would buy it day 1 if it's not filled and a complete mess like the gta trilogy was.



edit: after some additional research to the rdr1 remaster topic; unfortunately it appears to have been a fan-mod of the xbox 360 version running in an emulator... at least that's what a few sources say. so the remaster of rdr1 wasn't real after all it seems.
    Man what I would give for a GTA 3D universe remake that's playable for someone born this millineum
        Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
    Why would we need rdr2 update? That game still look gorgeous.
        I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
            And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
                The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
            All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
Skyrim gets a lot of flack for the stream of re-release but at least they usually had some content differences involved. Regular, GOTY, Special, and Anniversary

Right? I bought Skyrim from GameStop midnight release. It was just a steam key. 11 years later I have gotten all of the updates (SSE AND NOW AE) for absolutely free. Fucking good value.
    As good a game the witcher is, it'll never outlive Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game. It's a game engine and modders' playground.
        Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
            Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
                For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
    Same, and with all of the mods out there, at least on PC, the game still looks pretty badass even today imo.

    Tbf, if you bought it past 2013/2014, you'd most likely be buying the Legendary Edition, which had all the DLC. Usually was around $20. They delisted it when SE came out so you couldn't just buy the old one that way anymore, which is a little wack, but SE runs so much better and has all the DLC as well, so.
    I mean, it was 3 DLCs, and two of them were full on expansions and the other regularly hit rock bottom prices and was necessary for a fair number of good mods.

If you had any interest in skyrim and didn't own the DLC already you were doing yourself a massive disservice.
I wish I still had the eyes of a child. But they fell out of my pocket when I went for a walk the other day so I'll have to find some new ones.
    I had the eyes of a child at one time. Shortly after my parents divorce i realized they were going to buy my love so i did what any kid of the mid 90s would do, i made sure they bought me every video game and console i saw. One day after svhool i was playing my virtual boy. My dad bought this thing and my mom hated it, she was sure i was going to go blind. For the uninitiated, virtual boy was designed like the oculus and played 3d games on 32 bit. THIRTYTWO BIT. This was circa 96/97 because i didnt have my 64 or jaguar yet. So i strapped this thing on my head and decided to start playing warioland because it was new and i wanted to escape for several hours. Well noone told me the battery life on my new virtual boy was trash. Like 3 or 4 hours and the thing was dead so i took it off and then i realized all my mothers fears had come true. The batteries hadnt died. I had fucking gone blind. I couldnt see a fucking thing. I was panicking. The pure fear set in i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe. Little 7 year old me knew he couldnt live life without vision. So i did what any child would do. I cried. Not quietly, no, i sobbed loudly. My brother came into the room to tell me to shut the fuck up and thats when i realized, i hadnt gone blind. It had just gotten dark outside and i had no lights on. I was a dumb child. Im a pretty dumb adult.
        Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
            Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

        If it makes you feel any better, one morning when I was around 16 or 17, I woke up after a solid night of drinking thinking that I had somehow had sight miraculously restored in one eye.

    For a while after doing shrooms I had this. Once I was walking along the river in my city and actually stopped and was awed just by the way the sun was reflecting off the buildings.

Half Life 2's graphics have held up enormously well though. You can cherry pick some of the canal and still find photo-real scenes (which fall apart if you get close, yes).

NPC asset quality and facial animations are still 2nd to very very few. It also somehow avoid the "plastic shiny" feel a lot of hyper modern engines have.

The entire lighting system in that game was "pre-baked" and the pre-baker used a lot of raytracing for the "globally illuminated" look. Ahead of its time and hella efficient. Lots of games without dynamic time of day copied the method for the next two decades.
    Textures in HL2 have this inherent grittiness unique to it. It really does feel more real than most things released since. Like you mentioned, so many games feel almost *too* perfect and refined. Everything looks shiny, clean, and fake. HL2, partially because it was a post apocalyptic game, had this ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù to it that I haven‚Äôt seen replicated perfectly since. I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now

You're welcome.

        g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
            All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
                Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
                    Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                        If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
        It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
    Going back and playing HL2 or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines it‚Äôs just insane how good the facial animations were, there‚Äôs games that come out 20+ years later that still somehow fuck it up.
     the best water I've seen in any game
        It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
    I played Portal raytraced and thought this is basically how I rememeber Portal looking when it came out.  It ran so badly however that I then ran the original Portal, and I finished it again it was so good. The game still holds up great, but the lighting, materials and textures look like something out of Quake 2.

It really make you appreciate how much accurate lighting, shadows and nice materials can change a game.
    The first engine I saw using pre-baked lighting that had path-trace (and surface-illumination) was in Quake 2 from 1997. Its resolution was quite crude compared to Half-Life 2, which resulted in some fairly chunky shadows. Generating these lightmaps back then was a *slow* process.

The Source engine has its roots in a branch of the original Quake's codebase, so it makes sense that bounced lighting could be easily implemented. Not sure if the original Half-Life games incorporated that...
    the way you describe how modern games look is exactly what i always felt looking at them but i couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. yeah, they look like plastic. it doesn‚Äôt look real. like for example bf5 looks much worse compared to bf1 because everything looks plasticy and featureless
HL2 holds up *exceptionally* well. A lot of it is from the textures -- I don't know how to describe it, but there is a "coherence" among every texture that nothing looked particularly out of place. 

Compare it to say Black Mesa, BM might have much higher resolution textures, but a lot of them somehow looked "flat" and cartoonish, a bit like the "HD texture pack for minecraft" memes.
    A good art direction goes much further for making a visually stunning game than brute forcing it with higher res textures, models, and graphic tech.
    I just played through Portal with RTX and the whole time I thought, of all games, Portal doesn't need this. The original was done so well because the aesthetics were clean and the engine handled light and reflection pretty well to begin with.
        Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
            >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.

I'm not 100% sure but I think this video touches on why HL2 looks so good. Pretty interesting video regardless if you're into that kind of thing
I think it has do with the fact we tie it to experiential memory. "I was going through this alley and a face hugger popped up, so I used my gravity gun to catch and release a barrel right in it's face!" It ties in all the emotional energy you may have had and whatever associations the images first game you all get linked like a custom circuit. (I am not a neruologist!)

Gaming is a live experience, and thus gets filed away differently.
    I think they're also a highly comparative medium. Graphics that are contemporaneously considered cutting edge tend to remain that way in ours heads because at the time we can't imagine anything looking better so our memories of them get updated as modern graphics improve. Plus the immersive nature of video games means the best of them make us feel like they're actually happening in a sense. 

I remember playing Spidey PS4 and thinking this is exactly how I remember Spider-man 2 on the PS2 looking. Even more recently when I first saw the Dead Space Remake gameplay I was almost disappointed at what I considered a lack of real improvement. I really thought I was looking at a remaster more than a ground up remake. Then they showed the comparison to the original side by side and my jaw dropped at just how dated the original looked. Memory is a funny thing.
        Halo MCC has a toggle to switch between the remastered and original graphics. It's a trip to go back and forth between them.
            Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
                You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
                For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
    Absolutely- similar to the way we remember stories in books which have no images at all (well, maybe illustrations)
    VR is a whole different ballgame with regards to immersion and memories. After I played HL Alyx I could think back to certain scenes or set pieces in the game and it really felt like an actual memory, like I'd really lived it. It was super weird.
I remember getting a PS1 and Tomb Raider III for Christmas in the late nineties, then booting it up on my old big ass TV and being like "wow, it will never get any more realistic than this," polygon everything (boobs) and all.
Honestly I think HL2 still looks great. Black Mesa has great assets and you can tell the difference when you look but while you're playing it's very easy to forget that the game came out 15 years ago.
My uncle was playing Madden 2005 or something around that time
 My grandfather came into the room and said he couldn't tell if it was real football or a video game. We all agreed.
I mean, half life two still looks pretty freaking good.
The game still looks very good though.
It was an amazing looking game for it's time. Shit, it still looks good.
HL2 still holds up
HL2 still looks good. It has aged better than most games. I plays it though like every other year. Last two times hs been in VR.
I remember looking at Oblivion when it was new and also thinking "games will never look better than this" 

I think part of it is that it was a new game for the 360, where as ps2/OGXbox games still had a pretty blocky look to them (although it was an improvement over PS1 games) so a game engine being able to convey roundness seemed like a graphical breakthrough. and oh man... were those faces [round](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/elderscrolls/Newheim_the_Portly.jpg)
    I said that once. "graphics will never be better than this!" That was for battle arena toshindan ü§£
        Star Wars Battlefront II for me. I don‚Äôt even think they were that good but I remember being like ¬´¬†damn it feels like I‚Äôm on Kashyyk rn¬†¬ª
    Im playing oblivion at 4k 60 on my series x and I'm still impressed by the graphics. The textures on the walls and design of the environments are pretty impressive for 2006. Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad, but that wouldn't have been much of an issue at 720p.
        >Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad

I actually think the opposite. Oblivion at a distance looks like a painting (even today), it's just when you get up close and see the character models and animations that it starts to show it's age.
            Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
                Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
                The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
            I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
    Stepping out of the sewers for the first time...god what an unforgettable feeling. Being in awe of the colors and the water and the Ayleid ruin across the lake.

    Very good point. I started thinking about that when I saw a recent frontpage post with comparisons of the same sprites on CRT vs modern monitors. CRT even seems to add the illusion of shadows, if the sprites are designed for it.
    I used to have a 21‚Äù Sun monitor that weighed over 70 damn pounds.  Amazing picture.  Probably would have kept it well into the flat-panel era if it just didn‚Äôt weigh so much.
Our brains also have auto fps increase too, i remember first watching a 60fps video a decade+ ago and thought nothing could be better.
Yea but even playing Goldeneye again after playing Halo or Splinter Cell on the og Xbox made it look rough.
    Splinter cell looked unbelievably good at the time
        It really did look good. That 5 or so year period between N64 games and Xbox stuff was an insane jump compared to the difference in 5 year old games today.

The 3rd game, Chaos Theory, is still one of my all-time favorites. Man it is a bummer that Splinter Cell is basically dead as a franchise and we probably won't be getting a new Splinter Cell for a long, long time. Like, Ubisoft has Ghost Recon and Assassins Creed, combine the concepts into a modern open-world stealth/stealth action game, it would probably have a huge audience.
Man, like a decade ago, someone left a late model crt outside to be picked up as trash. My friends and I grabbed it, hauled it into my buddies house, pulled out the old SNES and spent the next few days beating mega man X before putting the tv back out on the curb to be picked up with the trash.

SNES games looked stunning on it. It was a very late CRT, flat screen rather than curved like cheaper ones but thiiiic and extremely heavy.

Same friend bought a neo geo arcade unit a few years later with a crt screen. Definitely looks good.
Its not so much that CRT display them batter, but that the pixels were never meant to be displayed sharply. Filters can replicate the look perfectly fine. The issue is more that a lot of people never played them back on CRT and don't realize how they should display.
I remember buying that game,  and everybody who saw it thought it was real. Showed it to my boss who only played pc games,  and he went and picked up a dreamcast that day.
To be fair visual concepts did an outstanding job.  No Madden can hold a candle to 2K5 and I‚Äôm still angry about it all.  Fuck EA.
No, this is a pretty common phenomenon. Our minds fill in detail that was never there.
    Both are true, old games really did look better‚Ä¶but only on CRTs. That ever so slight blur and image distortion helped. The sprites of 2D games and textures of 3D games often look like absolute ass on HD LEDs, way worse than they originally looked.
        It‚Äôs not so much that the CRT blur inherently helped, it‚Äôs that it was quantifiable and things from that era were designed with it in mind. You take those unmodified inputs and put them in a different context and what had been carefully designed to blend in sticks out badly.
If you had Skyrim LE, the SE game was completely free. If you have SE, you get the Anniversary Edition patches + 4 CC content for free.
    Just wait until you want to play in VR.
Get out!
    Go on! Git!
        Yeah git, ok another terrible vr port which you lean on modders to ‚ÄúFIX,‚Äù but after that yew GITONOUTAHERE
            I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
        Hey we have the same face!
    They can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs an object in the way of the door; you have to glitch yourself out until the community creates a patch to fix it!
SE was free on PC (console wasn‚Äôt back compat at the time), and Anniversary was free on both (with option bundle of all Creation club content)
Bethesda is actually doing this exact same thing with Fallout 4. Total next-gen face-lift for free, sometime in the spring.
P5 in name? Yeah. Actual just P5? 3 times. Vanilla p5, 1sr release of Royal, then the ports this year.
They just released it for platforms that never had it to begin with???? Royal is different from the first and adds like 40 hours??? Strikers and the Rhythm game are just completely different games.
And Bethesda, Skyrim on every electronic device...still waiting for our god Todd Howard to release it on some fucking smart toaster.
    The upgrade to SE, VR and AE were all free if you bought the original game. Don't be dishonest.
        dishonestly is all these people know. Reddit hates Bethesda, so why tell the truth when you can lie and get infinite upvotes
            It's the worst kind of lazy.
                well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(
It would be worth checking the data but I feel like the majority of remastered, repackaged games have been coming from Japanese devs. Not to say that Western devs haven‚Äôt put a lot of those too.
    Interesting point there, I haven't thought about it myself. If there's a good and kinda necessary remaster, I'm down for it. Otherwise is just reselling the same game.
        To be fair, some of it is also due to the lack of backward compatibility and a lot of ports from handheld titles which were more popular in Japan than in the West.
Nah, CDPR has always done stuff like this. It's just nobody noticed until W3 because that was the first one to be popular
The PS5 *remake* costs more than the original, which is fair. A ton of work was needed to complete it.
All of Skyrims upgrades were free when they were able to give them for free.
That's why it can be so disappointing to watch film adaptations of your favorite books. I usually have different images of characters in my mind than the movie version. But I guess that also makes it super satisfying when the two versions align.
    Preach, brother / sister. I read TLoTR annually until the Jackson films came out, then it was once a decade because I had *his* images in my head instead of my own.
        I take it you dislike Peter Jackson's vision? Care to elaborate on the why?
            [deleted]
                This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.

    Their hardware just didn't come with drivers okay
Except I got integrated graphics when it comes to books
On top of that, today they announced the update uses some the more popular texture mods. Aside from the lighting updates, if you use any of those mods, you‚Äôre not far off.
    Excellent. Why wouldn‚Äôt they use mods that offer a better experience? Other companies should take note.

If it wasn‚Äôt free.. different story but here we are.
        If the quality is there, why do the work again? It must be cheaper too. n designers being paid x dollars for however many months of work vs. offering the mod‚Äôs creator a flat free for use in perpetuity. Any mod creator would probably be so thrilled at the idea of their work being used by the company who created the game they loved enough to mod that they‚Äôd take a few grand.
        Please no. That will very quickly lead to buyable mods and the death of free mods
Blood & Wine is peak Witcher 3 for me. Such an absolutely gorgeous area and great epilogue for Geralt.

Look forward to seeing updated Toussaint.
    There's a part of me that hopes they don't bring back Geralt in the next game, at least not in a major way. Him settling down on his farm living a life of luxury is such a perfect end after all the shit he's been through.
        It would be funny if the game took you to Geralt's farm and you get to see him mucking about, randomly lighting and snuffing out torches while cursing a nearby chest, yelling at Roach to get off the roof, and being chased across the yard by horny witches. Instead of killing monsters himself he sends you off on quests to kill them for him because he's so done with that life, and rewards you with one of his old swords.
            He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
                But he's all fucked up from fighting.
            >and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
            It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
                Take notes CD project, take notes!
        He needs to be the first Witcher to die in his bed.
            who's gonna tell him
        Didn‚Äôt they already announced he won‚Äôt? At least not as the main character. Or am I imagining things again?
            Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
        Very high chances Geralt won't come back, at least not in a major way. The Polish voice actor had serious health issues. The Reds brought him back for new quest in this update (new armor set) and were very lucky the actor could do this one quest for them, even though he sounds a bit different. At the moment I don't think he could do voiceover for entire game.
            Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
            The character is not the voice. See God of War.
    Please tell me the "filterless toussaint mod" gets a pass in next gen , toussaint is much better with that mod
    Peak Witcher is in either Hearts of Stone or Velen side quests. But that's for me. Blood and Wine was great and different but I prefer more grime side of Witcher
If the game was just skellige I might have actually visited all the loot barrels there haha
    I did this in my first playthrough. Never again.
        I kept thinking there was gonna be some cool Easter egg or hidden treasure on one of the dozens of tiny islands you stumble across surrounded by these treasures. Nothing. Not that I found anyway, though there were some unused assets for cut quests
            IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
                ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
        Those whales scare you too? I'm scared rn
    I usually 100% games that I love but seriously fuck dealing with sailing and harpies for basically fuck all.
        If they made water based combat less terrible I wouldn't mind

But when your only options are horribly weak crossbow or sword fighting on a tiny platform, im just going to avoid it wherever possible.
        Yeah i hated Skellige tbh lol, such a pain in the ass to traverse
    Still don‚Äôt think I would have the extra 200 hours to invest in that endeavor.
    Fuck that quest! I get terrible OCD about completing *all the things*, and sailing around diving for all those stupid barrels was *the worst*.
Toussaint was absolutely gorgeous, especially compared to walking around the bleak war torn areas of the map. I'm excited to see what it looks like.
Fear a bhata‚Ä¶

Honestly that‚Äôs basically Irish mythology in a nutshell. Check out the Candlelit Tales podcast if you like stories where nothing good happens and everybody dies at the end.
It's one of my favorite quest lines from any video game I've ever played.
HoS gets my vote for best 10 hours of story in video game history.
Damn, you‚Äôre ugly
    HOW YOU LIKE THAT SILVER?!?!
> a

^^*of
What was that?!

Must've been the wind.
> Auto loot and no weight limit mods make this game about 25 hours shorter

Not lighting god damn candles when you're trying to loot is about 20 of those
    This guy loots
Fast travel from anywhere is also great, especially for a replay. I can understand wanting exploration and immersion on a first play through, but damn it saves so much time not having to find a signpost anytime you want to go somewhere, especially when doing an armor quest or traveling around to craft something etc.
    Yeah definitely grab that one too.

As a compromise for explorers it would be cool if it were unlocked after discovering 100% of the map or something.
        The thing is, fast travel anywhere can break a lot of quests that require you to be funneled towards a certain point. That's the issue with the mod and you never know which quest might break if you fast travel in the middle of it. 

Maybe they'll make it work in a patch since I don't see it in the list of included mods.
    Galloping in cities is an amazing mod too
    I always used the fast travel mod because the immersion was broken when you got to the signpost anyway, whether you fast travel from there or where you are it makes no difference, and I prefer exploring on my own terms rather than when the game makes me.
        I just meant by having to walk more and seeing more of the map as opposed to just main areas
    also a big fan of map quest objectives. puts the quest markers on your map, and lets you highlight and mark them instead of selecting it from your quest list and then going to your map to see where it is.
    It's been years since I played this game but I remember using a fast travel mod and it breaking a couple quests that have triggers that can be unwittingly bypassed if you fast travel away.

Hopefully they fixed that but if not, be careful with when you fast travel
That's why I love Horizon Forbidden West's inventory changes from the first game. They just send things to your stash and you can resupply there.
    That was excellent. It let them still design difficult fights that can‚Äôt be cheese by having 5000 healing potions, but doesn‚Äôt punish a player for collecting *everything, all the time*. 

It encouraged me to think about what variation of ammo I used when, what buffs I had going, etc. huge improvement over the first game.
        Also: Looting from the mount. Holy hell.
    A welcome improvement. Now if they just took a page from BOTW and made looting instant...
        There‚Äôs an option for that
        They have an accessibility feature to auto pick shit. Turned it on and it was SO MUCH better.
PREACH. 60 kilograms of swords, armor, daggers, all kinds of shit in your "backpack", but nah, can't fit _one more_ sword, that's just too much. I have never understood where weight limit came from, it's not like there's this "realism" factor to being able to only carry 50 swords where the player can't see them, but not 51 once you hit the limit.

I modded Witcher 3 to have no weight limit and it was infinitely more enjoyable.
    Same. I did this for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. I just don't see the point. Which means you can also ignore any potions and abilities that increase your weight limit, letting you focus on the more interesting parts of the game.
Inventory limits in games like these litterally do only one thing, and that's make you waste your time going back and forth to sell items. The inventory is big enough that removing the weight limit basically has no real influence on gameplay or balance, only on time for people who like to pick up everything.
Inventory management is tricky. You have to be really familiar with a game to do it well, know what to take and when and what to leave. It‚Äôs especially hard if you put down a game for a bit then go back and try to remember what you actually need to have. I have this problem with the Witcher but not with Fallout but I‚Äôve also put over ten times the hours into Fallout 3, NV, and 4.
Auto-Oil will also reduce the amount of time you spend in the inventory.
Dont ever touch Fallout 76 then, dont even need to mention the other major issues
Interesting. I enjoy inventory management tbh
Is no weight limit gonna be available in this update?
    I assume the current mods will work unless there are dramatic changes.
Is that Saints Row 2 patch ever going to come out or is that just a myth now? They could have released it years ago and modders could have done the rest. Now it looks grim since Volition is now Gearbox.
wouldnt it be easier to miss if everyone did this? i feel like this is the key factor in it all because of expectation of greed
Bruh this same company was totally dishonest and lied about their last release so badly PlayStation pulled it from their store, that was partly greed lol
    Sony pulled it from the store not because it was buggy, but because CDPR said that people should return the game and Sony threw a fit.
Its wild how they made an entire RPG as side content in a card game.
    You two just made this entire thread.
On one hand, at least it's not a gatcha/microtransaction based, but on the other, I spent hundreds of hours grinding through the side games for more cards before I had a competitive deck.
    Just pay ng spies. Or nr spies. 

Or uh. Yeah that.
    Nah, its not hard to have a competitive deck in the default type. If u wanna play monster cards on the other hand....
I heard you can even own your own vineyard. Amazing stuff for a card game
If you also want the extra DLC for free, I think you need to have owned it before as well (or have the GOTY edition which includes them).
    The free DLC was basically two free games
        Wasn't free if you bought them back when they came out, but they were well worth the twenty bucks or whatever I paid for them.
    As far I know the only edition of the game I have seen, at least on PC, is the ultimate edition which includes the paid expansions. But I have no clue for the console versions.
        On Steam there's a standard version with no DLC, and a separate GOTY edition which costs a little more and includes all the DLC.
            Same with xbox.
Just finished it, this game is so beautiful and fun to play!
    Yeah, the gameplay variety can be kind of limited, but the beautiful world and art style combined with tight core mechanics and a moving story made it my favorite game of 2020
Damn, in the season‚Äôs sale I decided to only buy two games. I went for rdr2 and had to make a choice between cyberpunk and spider man remastered. I picked spider man but now I feel like I made a mistake lol
Witcher 3, Cyberpunk and Breath of the Wild for me. Haven‚Äôt played Ghosts of Tsushima because I haven‚Äôt had a PlayStation before. A friend just gave me their PS4 when they got a PS5 so think I need to play that next!
Are those completionist numbers? A typical full playthrough (including sidequests and DLCs) is closer to ~125 hours. Howlongtobeat says ~200 hours for completionists.
    I feel like I'm an outlier but I find every single howlongtobeat way too short for completionist run. It's like they timed how long it would be to speed though grabbing collectables with a guide instead of actually playing the game.
    Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot! I spent just over 300 hours without the DLC, for a near-ish completion run. I did all the side quests, collected all of the Gwent cards, fully upgraded at least 2 schools‚Äô gear sets and collected/partially upgraded the others, and completed the entire map in Velen/Novigrad and White Orchard but not Skellige. But this does also include time I spent doing shit like taking screenshots of the sunset and finding the longest paths to slide down the Skellige mountainsides, lol.
I to will join, but not again as this will be my first time!
    I'd pay good money to play it again for the first time. Enjoy it!
        Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha.

I'd argue it's really just Rockstar that has incredible animation in their open world games.  Assassins Creed for example has extremely janky animation even in the latest releases.

A lot of what makes RDR2 and GTA 5's animation great is also why people find the controls sluggish feeling.  It takes a bit of time for the character to turn or speed up into a run because the game gives characters a sense of weight and momentum, and in turn this give the animation time to play out.  In many other games, for example, when a character turns they pop into the new direction with a little bit of settle, they don't shift their weight and turn their hips and take a step.  Animation in games will always be a push and pull with how responsive you want the controls to feel.
When it comes to GTA games you can thank Euphoria for that.
I think we‚Äôve just come through a period with some real genre defying games. I think withcher 3 belongs on that list, it just dropped before some real heavy hitters.
Yeah and I can get used to Banjo Kazooie visuals after an hour
So, the solution is to play any game despite of what it looks
it's insane to me, that they somehow believe it's due to lack of interest in remasters or remakes.. but in reality, the GTA trilogy was a fucking desaster. pressed on disc. it was doomed the moment someone decided it was okay to release it like that.


dude i am so in for red dead redemption 1 and an upgrade for 2 to next gen.
4k and 60 fps very needed for both.


the rdr1 remaster leaks looked very good to me. would buy it day 1 if it's not filled and a complete mess like the gta trilogy was.



edit: after some additional research to the rdr1 remaster topic; unfortunately it appears to have been a fan-mod of the xbox 360 version running in an emulator... at least that's what a few sources say. so the remaster of rdr1 wasn't real after all it seems.
Man what I would give for a GTA 3D universe remake that's playable for someone born this millineum
    Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
Why would we need rdr2 update? That game still look gorgeous.
    I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
        And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
            The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
        All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.

As good a game the witcher is, it'll never outlive Skyrim. Skyrim is not just a game. It's a game engine and modders' playground.
    Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
        Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
            For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
Same, and with all of the mods out there, at least on PC, the game still looks pretty badass even today imo.
Tbf, if you bought it past 2013/2014, you'd most likely be buying the Legendary Edition, which had all the DLC. Usually was around $20. They delisted it when SE came out so you couldn't just buy the old one that way anymore, which is a little wack, but SE runs so much better and has all the DLC as well, so.
I mean, it was 3 DLCs, and two of them were full on expansions and the other regularly hit rock bottom prices and was necessary for a fair number of good mods.

If you had any interest in skyrim and didn't own the DLC already you were doing yourself a massive disservice.
I had the eyes of a child at one time. Shortly after my parents divorce i realized they were going to buy my love so i did what any kid of the mid 90s would do, i made sure they bought me every video game and console i saw. One day after svhool i was playing my virtual boy. My dad bought this thing and my mom hated it, she was sure i was going to go blind. For the uninitiated, virtual boy was designed like the oculus and played 3d games on 32 bit. THIRTYTWO BIT. This was circa 96/97 because i didnt have my 64 or jaguar yet. So i strapped this thing on my head and decided to start playing warioland because it was new and i wanted to escape for several hours. Well noone told me the battery life on my new virtual boy was trash. Like 3 or 4 hours and the thing was dead so i took it off and then i realized all my mothers fears had come true. The batteries hadnt died. I had fucking gone blind. I couldnt see a fucking thing. I was panicking. The pure fear set in i was having a panic attack i couldnt breathe. Little 7 year old me knew he couldnt live life without vision. So i did what any child would do. I cried. Not quietly, no, i sobbed loudly. My brother came into the room to tell me to shut the fuck up and thats when i realized, i hadnt gone blind. It had just gotten dark outside and i had no lights on. I was a dumb child. Im a pretty dumb adult.
    Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
        Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

    If it makes you feel any better, one morning when I was around 16 or 17, I woke up after a solid night of drinking thinking that I had somehow had sight miraculously restored in one eye.

    Wasn't the virtual boy the one with the searing red color palette limitation?

Textures in HL2 have this inherent grittiness unique to it. It really does feel more real than most things released since. Like you mentioned, so many games feel almost *too* perfect and refined. Everything looks shiny, clean, and fake. HL2, partially because it was a post apocalyptic game, had this ‚Äúgrunge‚Äù to it that I haven‚Äôt seen replicated perfectly since. I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now
    > I think it‚Äôs probably my favorite game in terms of atmosphere, and it blows my mind that it came out almost 20 years ago now

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
    g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
        All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
            Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
                Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                    If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
    It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
Going back and playing HL2 or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines it‚Äôs just insane how good the facial animations were, there‚Äôs games that come out 20+ years later that still somehow fuck it up.
 the best water I've seen in any game
    It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
I played Portal raytraced and thought this is basically how I rememeber Portal looking when it came out.  It ran so badly however that I then ran the original Portal, and I finished it again it was so good. The game still holds up great, but the lighting, materials and textures look like something out of Quake 2.

It really make you appreciate how much accurate lighting, shadows and nice materials can change a game.
The first engine I saw using pre-baked lighting that had path-trace (and surface-illumination) was in Quake 2 from 1997. Its resolution was quite crude compared to Half-Life 2, which resulted in some fairly chunky shadows. Generating these lightmaps back then was a *slow* process.

The Source engine has its roots in a branch of the original Quake's codebase, so it makes sense that bounced lighting could be easily implemented. Not sure if the original Half-Life games incorporated that...
the way you describe how modern games look is exactly what i always felt looking at them but i couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. yeah, they look like plastic. it doesn‚Äôt look real. like for example bf5 looks much worse compared to bf1 because everything looks plasticy and featureless
A good art direction goes much further for making a visually stunning game than brute forcing it with higher res textures, models, and graphic tech.
I just played through Portal with RTX and the whole time I thought, of all games, Portal doesn't need this. The original was done so well because the aesthetics were clean and the engine handled light and reflection pretty well to begin with.
    Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
        >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.
https://youtu.be/mnxs6CR6Zrk

I'm not 100% sure but I think this video touches on why HL2 looks so good. Pretty interesting video regardless if you're into that kind of thing
I think they're also a highly comparative medium. Graphics that are contemporaneously considered cutting edge tend to remain that way in ours heads because at the time we can't imagine anything looking better so our memories of them get updated as modern graphics improve. Plus the immersive nature of video games means the best of them make us feel like they're actually happening in a sense. 

I remember playing Spidey PS4 and thinking this is exactly how I remember Spider-man 2 on the PS2 looking. Even more recently when I first saw the Dead Space Remake gameplay I was almost disappointed at what I considered a lack of real improvement. I really thought I was looking at a remaster more than a ground up remake. Then they showed the comparison to the original side by side and my jaw dropped at just how dated the original looked. Memory is a funny thing.
    Halo MCC has a toggle to switch between the remastered and original graphics. It's a trip to go back and forth between them.
        Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
            You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
            For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
Absolutely- similar to the way we remember stories in books which have no images at all (well, maybe illustrations)
VR is a whole different ballgame with regards to immersion and memories. After I played HL Alyx I could think back to certain scenes or set pieces in the game and it really felt like an actual memory, like I'd really lived it. It was super weird.
I said that once. "graphics will never be better than this!" That was for battle arena toshindan ü§£
    Star Wars Battlefront II for me. I don‚Äôt even think they were that good but I remember being like ¬´¬†damn it feels like I‚Äôm on Kashyyk rn¬†¬ª
Im playing oblivion at 4k 60 on my series x and I'm still impressed by the graphics. The textures on the walls and design of the environments are pretty impressive for 2006. Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad, but that wouldn't have been much of an issue at 720p.
    >Obviously stuff in the distance looks pretty bad

I actually think the opposite. Oblivion at a distance looks like a painting (even today), it's just when you get up close and see the character models and animations that it starts to show it's age.
        Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
            Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
            The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
        I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
Stepping out of the sewers for the first time...god what an unforgettable feeling. Being in awe of the colors and the water and the Ayleid ruin across the lake.
Very good point. I started thinking about that when I saw a recent frontpage post with comparisons of the same sprites on CRT vs modern monitors. CRT even seems to add the illusion of shadows, if the sprites are designed for it.
I used to have a 21‚Äù Sun monitor that weighed over 70 damn pounds.  Amazing picture.  Probably would have kept it well into the flat-panel era if it just didn‚Äôt weigh so much.
Splinter cell looked unbelievably good at the time
    It really did look good. That 5 or so year period between N64 games and Xbox stuff was an insane jump compared to the difference in 5 year old games today.

The 3rd game, Chaos Theory, is still one of my all-time favorites. Man it is a bummer that Splinter Cell is basically dead as a franchise and we probably won't be getting a new Splinter Cell for a long, long time. Like, Ubisoft has Ghost Recon and Assassins Creed, combine the concepts into a modern open-world stealth/stealth action game, it would probably have a huge audience.
Both are true, old games really did look better‚Ä¶but only on CRTs. That ever so slight blur and image distortion helped. The sprites of 2D games and textures of 3D games often look like absolute ass on HD LEDs, way worse than they originally looked.
    It‚Äôs not so much that the CRT blur inherently helped, it‚Äôs that it was quantifiable and things from that era were designed with it in mind. You take those unmodified inputs and put them in a different context and what had been carefully designed to blend in sticks out badly.
Just wait until you want to play in VR.
Go on! Git!
    Yeah git, ok another terrible vr port which you lean on modders to ‚ÄúFIX,‚Äù but after that yew GITONOUTAHERE
        I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
    Hey we have the same face!
They can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs an object in the way of the door; you have to glitch yourself out until the community creates a patch to fix it!
The upgrade to SE, VR and AE were all free if you bought the original game. Don't be dishonest.
    dishonestly is all these people know. Reddit hates Bethesda, so why tell the truth when you can lie and get infinite upvotes
        It's the worst kind of lazy.
            well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(
Interesting point there, I haven't thought about it myself. If there's a good and kinda necessary remaster, I'm down for it. Otherwise is just reselling the same game.
    To be fair, some of it is also due to the lack of backward compatibility and a lot of ports from handheld titles which were more popular in Japan than in the West.
Preach, brother / sister. I read TLoTR annually until the Jackson films came out, then it was once a decade because I had *his* images in my head instead of my own.
    I take it you dislike Peter Jackson's vision? Care to elaborate on the why?
        [deleted]
            This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.
Their hardware just didn't come with drivers okay
Excellent. Why wouldn‚Äôt they use mods that offer a better experience? Other companies should take note.

If it wasn‚Äôt free.. different story but here we are.
    If the quality is there, why do the work again? It must be cheaper too. n designers being paid x dollars for however many months of work vs. offering the mod‚Äôs creator a flat free for use in perpetuity. Any mod creator would probably be so thrilled at the idea of their work being used by the company who created the game they loved enough to mod that they‚Äôd take a few grand.
    Please no. That will very quickly lead to buyable mods and the death of free mods
There's a part of me that hopes they don't bring back Geralt in the next game, at least not in a major way. Him settling down on his farm living a life of luxury is such a perfect end after all the shit he's been through.
    It would be funny if the game took you to Geralt's farm and you get to see him mucking about, randomly lighting and snuffing out torches while cursing a nearby chest, yelling at Roach to get off the roof, and being chased across the yard by horny witches. Instead of killing monsters himself he sends you off on quests to kill them for him because he's so done with that life, and rewards you with one of his old swords.
        He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
            But he's all fucked up from fighting.
        >and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
        It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
            Take notes CD project, take notes!
    He needs to be the first Witcher to die in his bed.
        who's gonna tell him
    Didn‚Äôt they already announced he won‚Äôt? At least not as the main character. Or am I imagining things again?
        Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
    Very high chances Geralt won't come back, at least not in a major way. The Polish voice actor had serious health issues. The Reds brought him back for new quest in this update (new armor set) and were very lucky the actor could do this one quest for them, even though he sounds a bit different. At the moment I don't think he could do voiceover for entire game.
        Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
        The character is not the voice. See God of War.
Please tell me the "filterless toussaint mod" gets a pass in next gen , toussaint is much better with that mod
Peak Witcher is in either Hearts of Stone or Velen side quests. But that's for me. Blood and Wine was great and different but I prefer more grime side of Witcher
I did this in my first playthrough. Never again.
    I kept thinking there was gonna be some cool Easter egg or hidden treasure on one of the dozens of tiny islands you stumble across surrounded by these treasures. Nothing. Not that I found anyway, though there were some unused assets for cut quests
        IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
            ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
    Those whales scare you too? I'm scared rn
I usually 100% games that I love but seriously fuck dealing with sailing and harpies for basically fuck all.
    If they made water based combat less terrible I wouldn't mind

But when your only options are horribly weak crossbow or sword fighting on a tiny platform, im just going to avoid it wherever possible.
    Yeah i hated Skellige tbh lol, such a pain in the ass to traverse
Still don‚Äôt think I would have the extra 200 hours to invest in that endeavor.
Fuck that quest! I get terrible OCD about completing *all the things*, and sailing around diving for all those stupid barrels was *the worst*.
HOW YOU LIKE THAT SILVER?!?!
This guy loots
Yeah definitely grab that one too.

As a compromise for explorers it would be cool if it were unlocked after discovering 100% of the map or something.
    The thing is, fast travel anywhere can break a lot of quests that require you to be funneled towards a certain point. That's the issue with the mod and you never know which quest might break if you fast travel in the middle of it. 

Maybe they'll make it work in a patch since I don't see it in the list of included mods.
Galloping in cities is an amazing mod too
I always used the fast travel mod because the immersion was broken when you got to the signpost anyway, whether you fast travel from there or where you are it makes no difference, and I prefer exploring on my own terms rather than when the game makes me.
    I just meant by having to walk more and seeing more of the map as opposed to just main areas
also a big fan of map quest objectives. puts the quest markers on your map, and lets you highlight and mark them instead of selecting it from your quest list and then going to your map to see where it is.
It's been years since I played this game but I remember using a fast travel mod and it breaking a couple quests that have triggers that can be unwittingly bypassed if you fast travel away.

Hopefully they fixed that but if not, be careful with when you fast travel
That was excellent. It let them still design difficult fights that can‚Äôt be cheese by having 5000 healing potions, but doesn‚Äôt punish a player for collecting *everything, all the time*. 

It encouraged me to think about what variation of ammo I used when, what buffs I had going, etc. huge improvement over the first game.
    Also: Looting from the mount. Holy hell.
A welcome improvement. Now if they just took a page from BOTW and made looting instant...
    There‚Äôs an option for that
    They have an accessibility feature to auto pick shit. Turned it on and it was SO MUCH better.
Same. I did this for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. I just don't see the point. Which means you can also ignore any potions and abilities that increase your weight limit, letting you focus on the more interesting parts of the game.
I assume the current mods will work unless there are dramatic changes.
Sony pulled it from the store not because it was buggy, but because CDPR said that people should return the game and Sony threw a fit.
You two just made this entire thread.
Just pay ng spies. Or nr spies. 

Or uh. Yeah that.
Nah, its not hard to have a competitive deck in the default type. If u wanna play monster cards on the other hand....
The free DLC was basically two free games
    Wasn't free if you bought them back when they came out, but they were well worth the twenty bucks or whatever I paid for them.
As far I know the only edition of the game I have seen, at least on PC, is the ultimate edition which includes the paid expansions. But I have no clue for the console versions.
    On Steam there's a standard version with no DLC, and a separate GOTY edition which costs a little more and includes all the DLC.
        Same with xbox.
Yeah, the gameplay variety can be kind of limited, but the beautiful world and art style combined with tight core mechanics and a moving story made it my favorite game of 2020
I feel like I'm an outlier but I find every single howlongtobeat way too short for completionist run. It's like they timed how long it would be to speed though grabbing collectables with a guide instead of actually playing the game.
Yeah, there‚Äôs a lot! I spent just over 300 hours without the DLC, for a near-ish completion run. I did all the side quests, collected all of the Gwent cards, fully upgraded at least 2 schools‚Äô gear sets and collected/partially upgraded the others, and completed the entire map in Velen/Novigrad and White Orchard but not Skellige. But this does also include time I spent doing shit like taking screenshots of the sunset and finding the longest paths to slide down the Skellige mountainsides, lol.
I'd pay good money to play it again for the first time. Enjoy it!
    Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha. 

If the download ever finishes... It's at 6.7GB out of 32.1GB and downloading at a speed of: \~30KB/s

Gta China town remake is all I want lot of nostalgia for that game
I mean like for example specifically Red Dead 2 Online gets neglected. Very bad bugs, R* outright said they have no plan to fix horrific issues like the prevalence of hackers in PC lobbies. RDR2 story mode could use some TLC in the form of allowing online outfits to be bought for story mode,such as ponchos not being available among other cool cosmetics. 

But the worst part is watching GTA online get update after update and RDO we can't even get basic bug fixes. :-( even pretty bad bugs like not being able to use stables properly.
    And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
        The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
    All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
That would be quite the surprise after updating windows
-balls hand into a fist-
Just look at Morrowind. People on YouTube still making primarily morrowind content and getting 100K+ views.
    Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
        For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
Totally thought this was a bamboozle joke and then you brought it back around. üëè

I‚Äôve had a similar experience when the power went out on me when I was in a VR headset. Didn‚Äôt think I was blind, but it sure was jarring to have my virtual reality disappear and then see nothing but darkness *after* taking my headset off too. Turns out the Sun was up when I started playing but had gone down by then (so I had no lights in in the room).
    Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

If it makes you feel any better, one morning when I was around 16 or 17, I woke up after a solid night of drinking thinking that I had somehow had sight miraculously restored in one eye.

Not gonna lie, 3/4 way into your comment I was expecting "back in 1998 the undertaker threw mankind off"

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
g-man has great voice acting too.  really made the character.
    All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
        Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
            Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
                If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
It's like how Fallout 3 and NV used gritty textures that appeared to have depth, and then Fallout 4 went with smooth and plasticy textures.
It had reflections like 15 years before other games started having screen space reflections that break whenever you move your view or objects block other objects. Good thing we finally have raytracing to fix that 20 years later.
Portal doesn't need it, and the performance is utter shit as far as a showcase DLC. Not complaining, as it's free. It's just weird they chose Portal of all games. Enclosed environs with static lighting made dynamically raytraced? WTF cares...

(it scales from 0.2 FPS to \~60 FPS with DLSS - it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.) I'd take HL2 with RTX any day over that.
    >  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.

Thanks, I'm sure I will! I just want to slowly explore the world and inadvertently forget about the main quest as I did in all the elder scrolls games, haha. 

If the download ever finishes... It's at 6.7GB out of 32.1GB and downloading at a speed of: \~30KB/s

And rdr2 is such a better game. Not even that close.
    The online has such great potential to be one of the very best multiplayer experiences out there. The cowboy simulator is right there, but everything feels half-assed to what it could fully be.

Its frustrating.
All I really want is an update to allow wearing the bandana and neckerchiefs without your shirt having to be buttoned up to the neck.

And a real leather duster would be great too.
Morrowind‚Äôs modding community has been steadily growing the past few years, which is kind of amazing considering the age of the game
    For many of us it was the best of the series. I dabbled with the CS and built an island with a modest story and some custom loot. It took hundreds of hours to do and I had an online friend do all of my testing. That was one of my favorite game related experiences ever.
Yeah, I really thought his dad was gonna come in and beat him with jumper cables or it would turn out to be the same day the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

    I started reading, saw how long it was and stopped to check of it was shittymorph.  I been got too many times.
        Did the same. I've been had so many times I feel shame now when it happens.
    I know Shittymorph is the Mankind guy, but who is the jumper cables guy?
I didn't make it to the end of the 2nd line when I went to the end fully expecting "in nineteen ninety eight"
By focus on the little details he meant cut out more eyeballs.
They don't say child's eyes didn't fall out of their pockets during their trip...
This is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful wife....
You may ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow did I get here?‚Äù
    "Wake up Mr. Freeman, and smell the *ashes*..."
> N--no, that can't be. Surely not. Oh no. 2004. But, middle school wasn't that long ag--wait, why do I have a wife and a child. How did I get this job? 20 years ago...

And [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/29/lotr-fellowship-1659123883518.jpg) came out **three years before** HL2.

You're welcome.

Also: hey you damn kids, get off my lawn!
All the sound effects make Source what it is, too. The sound of a crowbar clanking into the wall‚Ä¶
    Every sound from the Half Life games feels so unique, yet familiar. I honestly love just sitting and enjoying the scenes and sounds of the menus in Half Life 2 because they alone are all that is needed to really set your suspension of disbelief and envelop you in the world.

Busting open a box with my crowbar to find a charge for my HEV suit and hearing that voice telling you the charge percentage is something I can always hear in my head with perfect clarity no matter how long it's been since I've played the first Half Life.

The care they put in to these games will never cease to astound me.
        Valve, and for a while Blizzard, just had amazing long lasting voice and sound clips.  To this day I'll always recognize sounds or lines from HL, HL2, TF2, Portal, DoD, Starcraft, Warcraft 3, etc.  But new games? No idea, things rarely stand out.
            If you haven't played Death Standing yet, the audio in that is incredibly unique and memorable, while being largely quite mundane.
>  it's ALMOST... as if they did it on purpose.

You mean all those RTX 4090 cards littered around everywhere (one literally placed front and center in the ending scene) is Nvidia shamelessly trying to sell us something? Nooooo... 

But to be honest, the raytraced lighting and shadows when the energy pellets fly around looked pretty cool. My monkey brain really can't see the "four times the light bounces!" tho.
Oh shit really? Is that for the remaster of Combat Evolved? I've been a Sony boy out of misplaced loyalty since I got the PSX as a kid so I only ever owned the first Halo on PC but in my head it still looks incredible. I can picture the first time I saw the flood and its basically a scene from an Alien movie, must be a real trip to be able to see the graphical upgrade with just a flick of the switch.

Closest I've had to that I think was playing MGS Ground Zeros and you can unlock the original MGS Solid Snake skin and play a mission with the guards also having the enemy skin from MGS. Really stressed me out when I realised the game that looked so amazing to me as a kid stars a main character who doesn't actually have eyes.
    You can swap the graphics between old and new for Halo CEA and Halo 2A.
    For both combat evolved and 2, actually! In 2 you can also switch in cutscenes, which is especially wild because the remastered cutscenes are prerendered CGI by Blur Studios which look very, very photorealistic.
Some of the mountains had a very large and blown up texture. The character models are pretty ugly, I'll give you that. And that camera jumpscare zoom in every time you talk to one doesn't help.
    Okay the mountains are pretty bad, but I still think the forests, castles and ocean looks good from a distance.
    The Jumpscare zoom is my favourite part of Bethesda games and I'm sad it doesn't happen in Fallout 4
I love how you can see the tower of the Imperial City from almost everywhere in Cyrodiil
I swear, after buying 3 versions of Skyrim, including the VR port, I'm only going to buy maybe one more version of Skyrim before I am fed up with their nonsense.
It's the worst kind of lazy.
    well if they told the truth they'd have to find something else to build their personality around shitting on :(

    This. I don't dislike his vision, but it's hard to get it out of your head.
He is only about a third of the way through his lifespan so i wouldnt be suprised if they brought him back yet again. Maybe he comes out to save the world and fucks off back to his vineyard again.
    But he's all fucked up from fighting.
>and rewards you with one of his old swords.

With the line "It's alright, I have plenty of them"
It‚Äôd be an opportunity for a custom character, someone Geralt trains up the way Vesimir did Geralt. But it can be whoever the player makes them ‚Äî gender, race, attributes (school of cat vs school of bear oriented). CDPR is great at character-creation‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be nice to see it in third person somewhere.

But this also allows the game to make its own non-cannon version of Geralt after the conclusion of 3.
    Take notes CD project, take notes!
who's gonna tell him
Yeah they said geralt's story is done iirc.  I'm looking forward to an interdimensional Ciri story.
Just hire Cavill to do it. Hell, he might even do it for free in Polish and English
The character is not the voice. See God of War.
IIRC some devs said there weren't supposed to be question marks on them originally. You'd just see birds circling above as you're travelling, grab some extra loot, and move on. Then the marks were added and they turned into a checklist.
    ok that was a terrible decision. I hate leaving '?' on my maps so I have to go and clear them.
Same with xbox.
