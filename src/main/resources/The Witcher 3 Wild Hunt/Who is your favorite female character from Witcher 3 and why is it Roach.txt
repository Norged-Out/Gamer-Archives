[[Who is your favorite female character from Witcher 3 and why is it Roach]]





I don't see the crones here
    Them crone titties tho
        Big milkers
    Yes, the witches are beautiful in the painting. but later...
        Are you afraid of a real woman?
            The truth, Yes, suppose the one in the middle wants to be on top of you. Not only would you be afraid, but you would be devastated.
    Is there a way to romance the crones? Asking for a friend.
        Mod tools coming out soon
    In their natural beauty or magical beauty?
        Natural beauty ofc
            Meaty
Roach is wild! In the sky, in a wall, half buried underground, etc. you name it 😅

Also, no Jutta!? 🫣
    I love when he’s running and just decides his balls get itchy so squats mid gallop to relieve himself
        Hate to be that guy, but Roach is canonically a mare
            I thought geralt had multiple roaches cause of the whole witchers aging slowly thing leading to roach dying multiple times and being replaced?
                Yes, but he prefers mares. Can’t remember why
                    They have more nerve and don't spook as easily.
                    He wants to pull a loki
                        Wdym? I haven’t read the comics or seen the show
                            Loki in norse mythology fucked a horse I believe lmao, not the marvel loki thankfully.
                                Oh lmao. I’m not huge into Norse myths in particular
                            Ok its even weirder than I remember, he shape shifted into a female horse and got shagged by the male horse and then gave birth to a horse. man them vikings were on some shit when they made these stories lmaooo
                                LMFAO that’s wild
                    One mission he's clearly a stallion. Might have been part of the trip though.
                        Are you referencing to the mission in Toussaint where Roach can talk?
                            Yes
                                In that mission Geralt does say 'what's up with your voice? I expected a young mare to sound more... feminine.' and Roach answers 'Based on what? Your vast experience with talking animals? As far as I know I'm your first.'

So it is never said that Roach is a stallion. More that she sounds like you would not expect a mare to sound.
                                    Ok good point there, forgot about that
                That and i imagine a witchers horse can die or run off when attacked by monsters.
                He does, the Roach in the games is a different one than in the books. The one that we use in the games however - that specific Roach - is confirmed to be a mare.
I was going to say I love the all of these characters, then saw Birna Bran.

Don't get me wrong, she was really well executed, but unlike the rest of these, the narrative really incentivised the player to hate her as much as possible. She was ruthless, unreasonable, and unlikable, which is the entire point of the Skellige clan leader narrative, but yeah. Did not regret getting her tied up to be fed to the sirens whatsoever.
    she indeed was very well executed
        Maaaan i was gonna do that one too xDD
        Took me a while to get that one, but fair play aha.
    I always hear her name in Cerys’ voice:
Beeernah Bran!
        Cerys accent makes me feel things
    She's positioned as the villain of the narrative but I'm not sure she's the worst person there. All the Jarls are kind of dicks.
        Everyone on Skellige except maybe Cerys is a piece of shit. Almost all the men murder, rape, pillage and take slaves. The exact kind of people Geralt normally hates.
        I don’t think the other Jarls would’ve orchestrated a massacre of the entire event mauling them to death with bears. 

Except Lugos, but he’s notoriously a prick.
        Philippa is worse imo.
    Tied up and fed to Sirens is someone's fantasy.
        admittedly mine when i found out she orchestrated the massacre just to get her son on the throne
            Sometimes, heads just roll
    I mean, then you love Birna Bran too, because you hate her XD. That means the writing did it's job. Kinda like we love the bad guy in the movie because he's a terrible person. When you hate the character it means it's working.
        Yeah I mean it's kind of the same as Micah and Dutch from Red Dead 2. You absolutely hate them to their core but that's a testament to how well characterised they were as eventual antagonists.

My point was that Birna is the ONLY character here that you feel that way towards. Even Syanna you spend time with and some of her motivations are somewhat justified even if she was completely reckless in using someone as dangerous and reactive as Dettlaff to do her bidding; Birna Bran is just..... spiteful?
            I got the good ending for Syanna so yeah, I get ya. I don't hate her lol.

Also, fuck Micah.
                Indeed fuck Micah, funny how you can fail earlier missions because “Micah has died”. On a second playthrough you’re like “god I wish this was canon”.
    I enjoyed finding her body later in the game.  I took a picture of Geralt posing next to her when I found it.
    The best part of Birna Bran's character is that Svanrige actually does turn out to be an extremely capable leader. There was something there. She wasn't just a caricature of evil.
It’s a toss up between Yennefer and Anna Henrietta 😩
    Someone likes bossy women.
        I *am* a bossy woman 😉
            Boss me around, please 😫
                Redditor try not to be horny challenge impossible
            Concerts don't suck you suck.
        Me too brother, me too
I don't see Iris von Everec, the prettiest of them all
    FINALLY IM NOT ALONE
    Yes! She is my favourite! Not only the prettiest but the depth of her character is insanely good.
        God the decision at the end of that quest is the heaviest decision I’ve ever had to make in a video game 😭
Shani, Cerys and obviously best girl Roach :) 
i mean who else can ride all day long and never ask for a break! /s
    Roach but the male version you get from not selling Ciri
        Wait you get female Roach?

>!Does the quest change where you talk to Roach?!<
            The regular brown Roach you start with is a mare (female) and is referred to in feminine terms. The black stallion (male) you get from Emhyr is treated identically by the game and still referred to in feminine terms. The quest is identical too.
She’s not the most popular, but Anna Henrietta. Wish she would’ve been a romance option.
    Nah, she only has eyes for Dandelion
        Even more proof you don't need that shit.
Birna is here but not Tomira?
    I would have added her but there was one box left. if I added her I would have had to make another column and add 3 more people to not trigger my OCD. In the end it was between her and Roach and clearly one of them was the obvious winner.
Roach Forever Obviously. 💖

Sylvia Anna. I can fix her.

In all seriousness tho, where Tomira??
    Her ass was too big to fit
        xLetails would beg to disagree
Ciri is probably my favorite- she embodies that wide eyed girl who has to grow up fast, but also has such exceptional power
    Plus she makes pee pee go boing!
        I like the honesty
            I'd say 90% of people on here have a save slot at the Skellige sauna.
The immense hatred I feel when seeing Philippa or Syanna...

Favorite character as that? Actually Yen. Her interactions with Geralt - after reading the books there's basically atleast one reference every dialog and I love it! These two are just perfect, toxic but perfect for each other.

Roach is obviously more then a character. She's more then that, more then any in this list!

Honorable mentions go out to Annarietta! Heavily misunderstood character imo...
I'm in the minority because I find Shani slightly irritating. Probably because I wasn't trying to romance her and the game was hellbent on dragging me to do it. 

Keira is fine, Ciri is cool. Yennefer is someone I respect immensely, but I don't exactly "like her". She kinda cramps my style lol. 

I fucking loathe Phillippa. I have rebooted playthroughs just to figure out a path in which she just dies or doesn't appear. I have attempted to side with Radovid simply to not have to deal with her. 

  
As for my favorites? I'm a Triss guy, but my favorites are the Duchess and Cerys. Both women with power, I guess. Right behind them is Priscilla. Not to romance, I just like her character a lot.
    Cerys ftw
Shani <3
    Shani.

Oh, and Priscilla was pretty good too.
        Hell yes :) love your flair :D
    Yeah, it broke my heart when she didn't appear in season 2 of the Netflix show and probably won't even the latter seasons. One more reason to hate the show.
You left out Iris! ☹️
    Her goth vibe is perfection.
        I simultaneously want to be her and want to be _with_ her, lol.
Yennefer
    Obviously, but an honorable mention goes out to Tomira.
Anna Henrietta
She was already one of my favorites the first time I played. But after making a whole write-up about her, having to replay her missions multiple times. I can’t help but to choose Anna Henrietta.

Now as an afterthought, where the hell is Iris von Everec? Only appears in one mission and she leaves such an impact on anyone who plays the game
    Good call on Iris. Absolutely fantastic character — and love her art! “Scenes from a Marriage” is one of the most memorable quests in the game.
Triss Merigold
    Indeed.
    This guy gets it
    This is the way
    Finally
    Triss, my beloved
Shani. 

The most normal chick in the game.
    im more into the crazy ones
Where is Regis my beloved
Yen or Anna. Shit. I guess I have a type. What is it?
Roach is female?
    Yup!
        Unless you take Ciri to Emhyr and then refuse the coin. You get a black stallion as the new Roach.
            Haha it's still female.  🤣🤣👍
The bangable ones
    Sir, step away from the horse, please.
        The horse isn't bangable. He's a best friend. 

Also, it's MAAM 🤣
            Oh, I'm sorry for assuming, Ma'am. 

>He's a best friend

The Horse is a Ma'am too. XD
                 I realized that right after posting. Sorry, Roach. I'm an idiot today. 

(I'm also an idiot most days)
                Isnt roach a male horse (a stallion I guess)? Im just going by the blood and wine mission where you get to talk to him/her
    So, all of them?
        Sans the horse. 

Roach is always number 1 except when it comes to bangin
Comon' Roach... -Geralt
    Cum on Roach... -Geralt
Maid Bilberry is the fairest of them all
Im a simple man. For me its the herbalist with dat ass from White Orchard.
The girl you teachs how to fight during a side quest in novigrad.
All good, will go 1) Shani  2) Yen  3) Kira metz
Princess is the 🐐
Where is Bertha from Crippled Kate's?
What are the Yen, Triss, and Ciri outfits?
    I think they’re from the next gen update, I’m not sure exactly but they’re not from a mod because I have them on console and I just have the complete edition for PS5

In the main menu go into settings and there’s a toggle somewhere for Ciri/Yen/Triss alternate appearance
        They are modded. Alternative appearances have a bit more clothing on both Yen and Ciri.
        Noted. I’m good though, I really don’t need them more sexualized. Ciri especially. 😬
Where's the goth Queen herself, Iris von Everec?
Yennefer, but also Sylvia/Syanna. It's the black hair and knowledge they'll likely hurt me that draws me to them
Yen. Always has been. Always will be.
Well i played witcher 3 times and twice I picked you Yennifer as my romance.. So. I think yennefer. But ciri is also alright.
Sorry, Triss will always win for me.
Yen
Yennifer
Shani, I'm so sorry..... **WHISTLES**
    If I could have picked Shani, I would have. She's better than Yen or Triss. Beauty, brains, caring, humorous, and a good temperment.
Why are Yen and Ciri almost naked?
    Bit of an exaggeration about ciri lol, yen tho
I would preface this with saying she gave me the most emotional feeling in the game. Priscilla
Who is the one between Shani and Syanna? I don't recognise the outfit.
    Corinne Tilly, the oneiromancer chick
        Thanks
Cerys for me. That accent could convince me to jump off a bridge.
Tomira the Herbalist in White Orchard.
Because Roach can stand on roofs and whatnot.. 😊
You fucked up doodt. I can't believe you didn't list.. TOMIRA  why? Are you fawkin blind?
“I am the rules” -Anna Henrietta
Yen and ciri
Yennifer and ciri
Philippa. Yennifer a close second.
Roach's voice through me for a loop
Roach!! Because “Equine Phantoms” is an absolutely brilliant and hilarious quest 💜
Roach is always ready to ride.. 
Unlike others we don't have to select right dialogues, bring gifts, complete side quests and all 😁
Triss, for two reasons.
None of these gals are fat or ugly. That's how you can tell CDPR hasn't gone fully ESG woke.... yet.
I’d be okay if Cerys stepped on me so she’s very good contender
Keira and I noticed the female characters in the game aren’t really damsels in distress they are strong and can fend for them shelves
    I don't think any games these days have Damsel's in distress. That trend is long dead.
        Yea maybe I worded that wrong but a lot of second female characters are there just for the plot in games or aren’t well written
        Well in some games at least
    If you have read the books, thos doesn't come as a big surprise, all female charakters in the books 
are written as strong and independent. And the witcher games just continued with this (maybe not the first one with this kind of cringe "collectors card game") . 

I also had a rather funny conversation with some colleagues who were complaining about the wokeness of the female charakters in the witcher netflix series. They genuinely thought that these 'woke' females were only added due to #MeeToo's  impact in Holywood screenwriting, but were rather looking sheepish when I told them that this is exactly the way these figures were envisioned more than 20 years ago by some polish dude.

@topic: obviously Priscilla, because she's the whole package without any magic behind her looks or craft.
        And I know Henry cavill left because they changed a lot of things about the Witcher lore
        You said there went ‘woke’ like that in the book what do you mean
        But some of the show based off the games they do change because of that stuff
        Weren’t the sorceress women in books treated back because people thought magic was bad
Triss
Everyone looks familiar but who’s the woman in the blind fold & the woman next to her also.


Both in the Top row.
    Philippa Eilhart and Vivienne de Tabris
My Devils Spawn.
Roach, duh.
Where the crones at?
Ciri bias aside I actually really like cerys even if she isn’t from the books I could believe someone similar to her could exist though I do think she should’ve had a more pronounced negative trait so she fit in a lil better. It’s like when the tau first came out in 40K. She’s a beacon of light in the dreary world of the Witcher. Someone who actually gives a fuck about their subjects. Closest thing the universe will have to a benevolent and competent leader.
I was fumbling along in the game not really getting it and not having any fun, then I met Keira and became unreasonably attached to her

And Philippa of course
She always keeps you guessing, but she’s always there for you, and the most important quality is that she doesn’t talk much. Roach is my queen.
Its roach because she is the only real reliable that doesnt lie to Geralt
Phillipa and Keira have one of the greatest racks I've ever seen in games !
kiEra was cool
Yen with a side of Kira is enough for me.
ROACH  is (THE BEST)
Roach supremacy. I do like Cerys though, and  despite Syanna's story arc mainly being based on multiple betrayals, I thought she was an interesting and complex character.
Roach is love
What horny bastard gave everyone crop tops?!
Roach makes a Labyrinth reference when you can understand her voice. Enough said.
Where's Adela? I've only got puss peepers for her.
Roach ❤️
Cerys 👑
Ciri ⚔️
Priscilla 🪕
In this order. The rest is "meh" or nah.
Keira Metz, really crushed on her
Shanni is my best good girl.
Your Yenn looks much nicer than mine
disappointed the herbologist isn't listed
Shani is one of the best woman in The Witcher. But else I like Yen and her sense of humor
All the short haired hotties
Shani.
Where my boy dudu at ???? How dare you not include him, I would choose him for reasons.
I love them all but Syanna has me on a chokehold tbh
I didn't see Marlene on the list!
    Let 'er cook
Shani, I love her personality.
Roach Cool rides gets you the chick I guess
Where’s Tomira?
I want Yen to kick me in the ribs 

  
Yeah roach is cool
2nd row first one that witch can't think of her name
Remember that lil elf prostitute. Yeah
Shani.Romanced her in Witcher 1( loved polish VA) and it's a pity she was just a fling option in W3 , cause I would pick her over Yen and Triss.
Keira and Ves
Not gonna lie I love Keira so much. And Triss
    I mean Keira was willing to unleash a plague on Velen and Nilfgaard just for a shot at a cushy job working for Radovid (who was busy killing her fellow sorceresses). Not exactly a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Iris von Everec followed closely by Cerys an Craite, then Ciri. Roach is up there for kicking two fisticuffs opponents, and knocking them out for me tho lmao
Now that I see all of them together, it really drives home to me how good CDPR is at writing interesting female characters. Dumb horny bullshit aside, they have a lot of depth of character that some games just lack.
I like Kiera because of her personality. I enjoyed her using me and leaving me, being selfish and deceitful. It all scratched a nice spot for me.
The correct answer is of course a roach. However, after that, it’s definitely Ciri, then Shani then Triss
Ciri. It is definitely my favourite video games female characters of all time.
Wheres the acrobat half elf recruited for the heist
Shani, Triss, Iron Maiden
Cerys
Priscilla
Ciri
I’m going to be all the way legit and unapologetically blunt. Whichever ones show titty. There I said what everyone secretly is thinking.
    There are at least 4 of them lol
I am inclined to agree with. Everyone else in the list may be a beautiful or a good character, but can you ride them? I mean, ride them to get to places.
Well, Roach frustrates me the most in the entire game, so no she is my least favorite 👀
I thought Cantarella was pretty cool 
I also thought Rosa Var Attre had the potential to be interesting and was going to be a more significant character than she ended up being
I like ves a lot, i wish we got more of the blue stripes in general
Im pretty much obsessed with Iris von Everec
Maybe it's just the fairy tale land, but I'm crushing hard on Syanna.  Renfri has always been one of my favs from the books (and even the show-- probably the only good episode of the whole debacle), and being able to hang out with her reincarnated self is loads of fun.
Cause is the prettiest for sure.
Yennefer us my fav....after Roach.
I've won some great Gwent rounds with the roach card ! And I never let it die in my playthroughs 🤣
Triss Merigold because, so pretty 😁🥰
Cerys
If only Shani is available in the base game, shes the most wife material of all.
Shani supremacy (followed by Anna Henrietta, Priscilla, and Cerys)
Roach let me ride whenever I wanted and he did not team up with yen because I also chose triss, ending with me being tied up to a bed
Where's Iris? I need a goth mommy like Iris in my life.
My favourite is Iris!!!
Roach
Roach isn’t necessarily she, it’s just any horse Geralt rides
Roach is wild
Because I can mod Roach to ride her better. I can't say the same about the other ones.
Where is Iris!!!???
Roach is best girl but also Cerys and Triss.
Love my girl Keira
Her Enlightened Ladyship, Anna Henrietta, Duchess of Toussaint
Make the letter T between yennefer and triss and you'll have my favorites
I knew you were missing someone, Elihal :)  
[https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Elihal](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Elihal)
Iris von Everec ??
"I play for the plot"
The plot:
Definitely not Anna Henrietta.

Shani and roach tho 👌
Bonk all of you, bonk, bonk, bonk.......
Don't know why, but I was thinking that there weren't any female characters in the Witcher
Cerys, Corinne and Keira! I loved the Crones of Crookback Bog too, such unique characters!
Who is that to the right of shani?

Avallachs girl?
    Corrine Tilly
Yes.
Cus Roach is awesome. She has superpowers. She can teleport, levitate and climb buildings.
Roach is always there, always reliable, roach never lies or manipulates, Roach is there for you through thick and thin
Roach is second to none <з

But Shanni is the best (human) girl, followed closely by Yennefer, then it's Ciri, Annarietta, and Iris von Everec. Love the Lodge of Sorceresses too, even though others hate them.
Philippa Eilhart
So far: Triss, Cerys, Ves and Henrietta. :D
Especially Ves... Goddamn, she could slap me for days!
Where Strumpet?
The big trio and next Keira Metz
I see a lot of cleavage, but not enough Roach....
Roach is simply superior
Shani best girl
It's either Yen or Shani.
Roach doesn’t bitches or complains about politics or Geralt handing heaping piles of ass whoopings at gwent in the wee hours of the foglets night , Roach is there when others aren’t willing to love the  Butcher Of Blaviken when he has to get the job done either in words or blood. Roach is more based then Vesemir because at least my trophies are worth thousands words then some musty pistachio polish Pierce Brosnan. This message was in support by the leader of the Blue Stripes Vernon Roche, also known as shit-for-rags.
I was gonna say Triss then i saw Ciri, was gonna say Ciri then i saw Roche🗿
Ciri is too easy of an answer so I gotta pick my second.

Cerys. Her story if she becomes queen is incredible and I like her sass.
Does having a romance with kiara affect the outcome of having a romance with tess/yen?
    Nope, you can Romance anyone you want, the game only cares if you two-time Triss and Yen
        Oh wow okay nice! Thanks!
Triss, Anna-Henrietta
Is there mod for those ciri and yennifer outfits??? And is there mod for the crones (in human form) ?
Anna Henrietta by far. That woman has class.
Dat Ass
What’s with the outfits Yen, Ciri and Triss are wearing? Some horny teenagers work? They look horrible.
I love Shani love in Witcher 1, wish we could pick the female that want to be with. I hate yennefer in opening in the castle
Ciri! 😮‍💨🥺
Roach is always with you.
Can be Vlad von Everec considered female only this time? (im 100% straigth)
Does CDPR have a “breedable” characters quota? Between this and 2077 I’m constantly aroused!
I hate those yen, ciri, and triss outfits
    I actually agree. The outfits themselves are good but I just really like Yen and Ciri's own outfits, they really fit them.
    Really? Because I felt the opposite. They look sooo cute that I am looking for the mods OP used for Ciri and Yen. Triss's fit already exists in-game haha
        No I was just kidding. Yeah, really
    Agreed. Like, the heels and the sort of sexified run/walk animations already somewhat annoy me (and don’t come at me about how heels were historically for men and cavalry riders cause WHY ISN’T GERALT WEARING HEELS THEN???), seeing them slapped into little midriffs and high cut skirts is just exhausting. Yen especially, honestly. She’s comfortable in her sexuality but she’s not here to be ogled. 

Ciri also feels uncomfy, just cause she’s functionally our player character’s daughter, so when people decide she needs to be sexier it gives me some ick. 

It’s not the worst in gaming by far, just…tiring background radiation.
        Go outside, lmao.

First off, That outfit is something Yen can 100% wear. In fact it's mostly the same (exposed legs, off-shoulder top, it just removes the corset) And wdym by sexified run/walk? what does that even mean?

Ciri's outfit is the exact same, she has two outfits in the game, one is an unbuttoned shirt and the other is (surprise) a cropped top armor. The only difference is that OP removed the useless cloth flap thing that was on the OG armor.

Also, Ciri is Geralt's adopted daughter, not the players so the "Ick" factor is dumb.

Furthermore these are fictional characters in a videogame, a person can tweak it to his liking but OP didn't even change all that much. Oh noo, a belly. Have you ever been outside and seen what people generally wear? Yeah these are medieval times but it's a fantasy with magic too lol.

This comment reeks of 🤡
Ciri, Triss or Cerys. All the others are rude or annoying except for Pricilla but she’s a bit of a discount session Daven.
That red haired Goddess Ms Merigold
Shani is literally the best girl : no backstabbing, no manipulation, no power hungry or specific power/magic.

Just a hard working girl making her way through life that you can settle and be happy with.
Because I really didn't like any of the characters beside Zoltan and Iorveth. Not that they were bad, I just didn't like their... Things.
Because his name is awesome
Roach is a boy though? At least he has a masculine voice when you trip balls eith him towards the end of the game.
Roach is male…………
    No, roach is always female, both in the books and games
        Then why in that one trippy mission does roach talk with a mans voice?
            Are you sure it’s not just a low female voice? The books mention that every roach Geralt has is always a mare, in the games he refers to her as she/her and I think even mentions that he only ever has mares
                🤷‍♂️ im not in tone with the books, Ive only ever played 2 and 3
                    I managed to miss the quest where roach talks on both my play through so just played it now, there’s an option where Geralt can ask why roach sounds manly despite being female
                        Yea I’m remembering that
Them crone titties tho
    Big milkers
Yes, the witches are beautiful in the painting. but later...
    Are you afraid of a real woman?
        The truth, Yes, suppose the one in the middle wants to be on top of you. Not only would you be afraid, but you would be devastated.
Is there a way to romance the crones? Asking for a friend.
    Mod tools coming out soon
In their natural beauty or magical beauty?
    Natural beauty ofc
        Meaty
I love when he’s running and just decides his balls get itchy so squats mid gallop to relieve himself
    Hate to be that guy, but Roach is canonically a mare
        I thought geralt had multiple roaches cause of the whole witchers aging slowly thing leading to roach dying multiple times and being replaced?
            Yes, but he prefers mares. Can’t remember why
                They have more nerve and don't spook as easily.
                He wants to pull a loki
                    Wdym? I haven’t read the comics or seen the show
                        Loki in norse mythology fucked a horse I believe lmao, not the marvel loki thankfully.
                            Oh lmao. I’m not huge into Norse myths in particular
                        Ok its even weirder than I remember, he shape shifted into a female horse and got shagged by the male horse and then gave birth to a horse. man them vikings were on some shit when they made these stories lmaooo
                            LMFAO that’s wild
                One mission he's clearly a stallion. Might have been part of the trip though.
                    Are you referencing to the mission in Toussaint where Roach can talk?
                        Yes
                            In that mission Geralt does say 'what's up with your voice? I expected a young mare to sound more... feminine.' and Roach answers 'Based on what? Your vast experience with talking animals? As far as I know I'm your first.'

So it is never said that Roach is a stallion. More that she sounds like you would not expect a mare to sound.
                                Ok good point there, forgot about that
            That and i imagine a witchers horse can die or run off when attacked by monsters.
            He does, the Roach in the games is a different one than in the books. The one that we use in the games however - that specific Roach - is confirmed to be a mare.
she indeed was very well executed
    Maaaan i was gonna do that one too xDD
    Took me a while to get that one, but fair play aha.
I always hear her name in Cerys’ voice:
Beeernah Bran!
    Cerys accent makes me feel things
She's positioned as the villain of the narrative but I'm not sure she's the worst person there. All the Jarls are kind of dicks.
    Everyone on Skellige except maybe Cerys is a piece of shit. Almost all the men murder, rape, pillage and take slaves. The exact kind of people Geralt normally hates.
    I don’t think the other Jarls would’ve orchestrated a massacre of the entire event mauling them to death with bears. 

Except Lugos, but he’s notoriously a prick.
    Philippa is worse imo.
Tied up and fed to Sirens is someone's fantasy.
    admittedly mine when i found out she orchestrated the massacre just to get her son on the throne
        Sometimes, heads just roll
I mean, then you love Birna Bran too, because you hate her XD. That means the writing did it's job. Kinda like we love the bad guy in the movie because he's a terrible person. When you hate the character it means it's working.
    Yeah I mean it's kind of the same as Micah and Dutch from Red Dead 2. You absolutely hate them to their core but that's a testament to how well characterised they were as eventual antagonists.

My point was that Birna is the ONLY character here that you feel that way towards. Even Syanna you spend time with and some of her motivations are somewhat justified even if she was completely reckless in using someone as dangerous and reactive as Dettlaff to do her bidding; Birna Bran is just..... spiteful?
        I got the good ending for Syanna so yeah, I get ya. I don't hate her lol.

Also, fuck Micah.
            Indeed fuck Micah, funny how you can fail earlier missions because “Micah has died”. On a second playthrough you’re like “god I wish this was canon”.
I enjoyed finding her body later in the game.  I took a picture of Geralt posing next to her when I found it.
The best part of Birna Bran's character is that Svanrige actually does turn out to be an extremely capable leader. There was something there. She wasn't just a caricature of evil.
Someone likes bossy women.
    I *am* a bossy woman 😉
        Boss me around, please 😫
            Redditor try not to be horny challenge impossible
        Concerts don't suck you suck.
    Me too brother, me too
FINALLY IM NOT ALONE
Yes! She is my favourite! Not only the prettiest but the depth of her character is insanely good.
    God the decision at the end of that quest is the heaviest decision I’ve ever had to make in a video game 😭
Roach but the male version you get from not selling Ciri
    Wait you get female Roach?

>!Does the quest change where you talk to Roach?!<
        The regular brown Roach you start with is a mare (female) and is referred to in feminine terms. The black stallion (male) you get from Emhyr is treated identically by the game and still referred to in feminine terms. The quest is identical too.
Nah, she only has eyes for Dandelion
    Even more proof you don't need that shit.
I would have added her but there was one box left. if I added her I would have had to make another column and add 3 more people to not trigger my OCD. In the end it was between her and Roach and clearly one of them was the obvious winner.
Her ass was too big to fit
    xLetails would beg to disagree
Plus she makes pee pee go boing!
    I like the honesty
        I'd say 90% of people on here have a save slot at the Skellige sauna.
Cerys ftw
Shani.

Oh, and Priscilla was pretty good too.
    Hell yes :) love your flair :D
Yeah, it broke my heart when she didn't appear in season 2 of the Netflix show and probably won't even the latter seasons. One more reason to hate the show.
Her goth vibe is perfection.
    I simultaneously want to be her and want to be _with_ her, lol.
Obviously, but an honorable mention goes out to Tomira.
Good call on Iris. Absolutely fantastic character — and love her art! “Scenes from a Marriage” is one of the most memorable quests in the game.
Indeed.
This guy gets it
This is the way
Finally
Triss, my beloved
im more into the crazy ones
Yup!
    Unless you take Ciri to Emhyr and then refuse the coin. You get a black stallion as the new Roach.
        Haha it's still female.  🤣🤣👍
Sir, step away from the horse, please.
    The horse isn't bangable. He's a best friend. 

Also, it's MAAM 🤣
        Oh, I'm sorry for assuming, Ma'am. 

>He's a best friend

The Horse is a Ma'am too. XD
             I realized that right after posting. Sorry, Roach. I'm an idiot today. 

(I'm also an idiot most days)
            Isnt roach a male horse (a stallion I guess)? Im just going by the blood and wine mission where you get to talk to him/her
So, all of them?
    Sans the horse. 

Roach is always number 1 except when it comes to bangin
Cum on Roach... -Geralt
I think they’re from the next gen update, I’m not sure exactly but they’re not from a mod because I have them on console and I just have the complete edition for PS5

In the main menu go into settings and there’s a toggle somewhere for Ciri/Yen/Triss alternate appearance
    They are modded. Alternative appearances have a bit more clothing on both Yen and Ciri.
    Noted. I’m good though, I really don’t need them more sexualized. Ciri especially. 😬
If I could have picked Shani, I would have. She's better than Yen or Triss. Beauty, brains, caring, humorous, and a good temperment.
Bit of an exaggeration about ciri lol, yen tho
Corinne Tilly, the oneiromancer chick
    Thanks
I don't think any games these days have Damsel's in distress. That trend is long dead.
    Yea maybe I worded that wrong but a lot of second female characters are there just for the plot in games or aren’t well written
    Well in some games at least
If you have read the books, thos doesn't come as a big surprise, all female charakters in the books 
are written as strong and independent. And the witcher games just continued with this (maybe not the first one with this kind of cringe "collectors card game") . 

I also had a rather funny conversation with some colleagues who were complaining about the wokeness of the female charakters in the witcher netflix series. They genuinely thought that these 'woke' females were only added due to #MeeToo's  impact in Holywood screenwriting, but were rather looking sheepish when I told them that this is exactly the way these figures were envisioned more than 20 years ago by some polish dude.

@topic: obviously Priscilla, because she's the whole package without any magic behind her looks or craft.
    And I know Henry cavill left because they changed a lot of things about the Witcher lore
    You said there went ‘woke’ like that in the book what do you mean
    But some of the show based off the games they do change because of that stuff
    Weren’t the sorceress women in books treated back because people thought magic was bad
Philippa Eilhart and Vivienne de Tabris
Let 'er cook
I mean Keira was willing to unleash a plague on Velen and Nilfgaard just for a shot at a cushy job working for Radovid (who was busy killing her fellow sorceresses). Not exactly a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize.
There are at least 4 of them lol
Corrine Tilly
Nope, you can Romance anyone you want, the game only cares if you two-time Triss and Yen
    Oh wow okay nice! Thanks!
I actually agree. The outfits themselves are good but I just really like Yen and Ciri's own outfits, they really fit them.
Really? Because I felt the opposite. They look sooo cute that I am looking for the mods OP used for Ciri and Yen. Triss's fit already exists in-game haha
    No I was just kidding. Yeah, really
Agreed. Like, the heels and the sort of sexified run/walk animations already somewhat annoy me (and don’t come at me about how heels were historically for men and cavalry riders cause WHY ISN’T GERALT WEARING HEELS THEN???), seeing them slapped into little midriffs and high cut skirts is just exhausting. Yen especially, honestly. She’s comfortable in her sexuality but she’s not here to be ogled. 

Ciri also feels uncomfy, just cause she’s functionally our player character’s daughter, so when people decide she needs to be sexier it gives me some ick. 

It’s not the worst in gaming by far, just…tiring background radiation.
    Go outside, lmao.

First off, That outfit is something Yen can 100% wear. In fact it's mostly the same (exposed legs, off-shoulder top, it just removes the corset) And wdym by sexified run/walk? what does that even mean?

Ciri's outfit is the exact same, she has two outfits in the game, one is an unbuttoned shirt and the other is (surprise) a cropped top armor. The only difference is that OP removed the useless cloth flap thing that was on the OG armor.

Also, Ciri is Geralt's adopted daughter, not the players so the "Ick" factor is dumb.

Furthermore these are fictional characters in a videogame, a person can tweak it to his liking but OP didn't even change all that much. Oh noo, a belly. Have you ever been outside and seen what people generally wear? Yeah these are medieval times but it's a fantasy with magic too lol.

This comment reeks of 🤡
No, roach is always female, both in the books and games
    Then why in that one trippy mission does roach talk with a mans voice?
        Are you sure it’s not just a low female voice? The books mention that every roach Geralt has is always a mare, in the games he refers to her as she/her and I think even mentions that he only ever has mares
            🤷‍♂️ im not in tone with the books, Ive only ever played 2 and 3
                I managed to miss the quest where roach talks on both my play through so just played it now, there’s an option where Geralt can ask why roach sounds manly despite being female
                    Yea I’m remembering that
Big milkers
Are you afraid of a real woman?
    The truth, Yes, suppose the one in the middle wants to be on top of you. Not only would you be afraid, but you would be devastated.
Mod tools coming out soon
Natural beauty ofc
    Meaty
Hate to be that guy, but Roach is canonically a mare
    I thought geralt had multiple roaches cause of the whole witchers aging slowly thing leading to roach dying multiple times and being replaced?
        Yes, but he prefers mares. Can’t remember why
            They have more nerve and don't spook as easily.
            He wants to pull a loki
                Wdym? I haven’t read the comics or seen the show
