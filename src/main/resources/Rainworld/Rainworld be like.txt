[[Rainworld be like]]





Story? I’m 27 hours in and haven’t seen any sort of story.
      
\*Lore  


The story is very breif on your first playthrough. You need to bring pearls to moon (after recieving the gift from fp of course) to recieve some small bits of the surprisingly deep lore.
        How to get to fp?
            just go to memory crypts in shaded citadel or the easier but harder way that is chimney canopy.
                Alright, I’ll try. Still need to figure out where memory crypts are but I’m gonna try to do that.

Shaded Citadel SUUUUUCKS tho is Chimney Canopy really harder?
                    Shaded is hard cuz darkness, spooders and Im-gonna-cut-off-ur-balls boisChimney is hard cuz 5124057723048 lizards (and 435 vultures)
                    well. yes but actually no. I prefer you take chimney canopy since the leg and the region's name I forgot is fucking cancer.
                        Unfortunate Development is, indeed, literally cancer
                            quite is. since I have the curse of DLLs, dropwigs, leapzards and scavs.  
I like difficulty but I require some space and not frickton of poles and 8 DLLs camping on me. plus chimney canopy is faster and easy. long as scavs aren't around.
                            Hggg the cursive re formstrans arrey eeksixkstsds hjhhhh noww give me your money or bone removal
                        The underhang. Very unfriendly place but unless you know advanced slugcat tech you won't get through chimney canopy to fp
            There are 2 ways. Either go to the shaded citadel then down (that will lead you to a linear, challenging and super cool path that will be the experience of your life) Or you go UP then RIGHT then UP again. That will lead you on a nice path, but not a super memorable one.
                I really loved the wall lol it was super memorable (but I also haven’t taken the memory crypts route lol, it looks way less fun imo, but I definitely need to visit the leg and underhang, still got ptsd from struts though lmao)
            Aww man
    Really? In every campaign so far I've seen tons and tons of lore.
Art- indie comic  
Gameplay- CBT  
Story- buddism on nihilism with some cosmic horror
Relatable
As a wise man once told me: "depressed buddhists"
This is rainworld tmie
Pretty much
Accurate
It do be like that
yes.
How haven't I seen this until now!?!? This is soo accurate!
