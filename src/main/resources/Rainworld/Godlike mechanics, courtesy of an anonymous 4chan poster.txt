I always feel like a god when  I outmaneuver a creature with advanced movement.
That was a dance off with the dropwig, god damn

Oh, I probably should have put the [source](https://boards.4channel.org/v/thread/544628804). It's the sixth reply from the top.

Obvious content warning - 4chan has a blunt communication style, sometimes including slurs. Rain World has gathered some good interest from its users, praising it over other popular indie titles for its creativity and its ability to "filter out casuals".

EDIT: Here's another [awesome one](https://ii.yuki.la/f/c6/681ebce6ddb1e4774b83a19d9a638ad2860a0090c9107e42ff05a2eed9337c6f.webm).
    > EDIT: Here's another awesome one.

Any chance this is archived somewhere?
        There are some 4chan archival sites like desuarchive, but finding something this old is trouble. The whole point of 4chan is to be ephemeral.

rainworld has been discussed in 4chan?
    It‚Äôs actually rather popular over there. Click through some of [these threads](https://yuki.la/search.html?boards=v&startdate=2017-02-02&enddate=2021-02-18&sort=descending&postext=Rain%20world#page=1) if you want. (Obvious warning, 4chan doesn‚Äôt hesitate to use slurs and talk abrasively).

Considering that the average 4chan user adores ‚Äúniche‚Äù experiences and despises ‚Äúcasual‚Äù gaming (or anything that got popular, in fact), it‚Äôs no surprise they praise the game so much.
        wow, I've been in 4chan a few times myself but I wasn't expecting rainworld to be sort of a hot topic there
            Depends on the board. /vg/'s current indie game thread has a couple Rain World posts at the very start
        Sounds like my cup of tea. I'll make sure to check it out.
        Average 4chan user adores niche experiences and despises casual gaming? Maybe I should join 4chan sometime.
            You might want to do a bit of research on 4chan's culture before diving in headfirst though
                you might have a fair point
Damn this is smooth, Especially that downthrow.
I know this post is 1 year old but, im new and, how you do the first slide and jump
    [Like so.](https://static.miraheze.org/rainworldwiki/8/83/Bb1.1S.gif)
        Thank You!
‚ÄúGet styled on nerd‚Äù
May I post this on my RW youtube clips channel? I will credit you and your og post!
    Haha, you don't have to ask for each one. Feel free to steal all the Rain World content I posted here. There's a bunch of videos like this.
        you are the same person and I feel dumb. thank you XD you are very generous
I could play this game for years and never pull that kind of insanity off.

    I'm unsure if the bot will answer, but here's the original URL if that helps.

        Good bot... No, wait

Force of habit
            Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99986% sure that oneirical is not a bot.

right there
Wait how did you throwed the spear downwards? :|
    You can only throw down while backflipping.
The little hops of joy at the end has brought a smile to my face very pog.
Just WOW
Are there any rainworld TAS runs out there yet? Would be interesting to see what folks find out about optimizing the game and random rainworld mechanics

Wait how do you roll and jumb backwards?
    At what timestamp does that happen? If you mean 0:08, that's just a roll getting cancelled, followed by a normal jump input.
        But how do you roll?
            Hold down left/right and down at the same time while falling. Read [this page](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Rolls) for more information!
if only it was as easy as this makes it seem
Why did my brain start playing duel of the fates when I saw this?
The real godlike mechanic is the dropwig putting the spear perfectly infront of the torch
