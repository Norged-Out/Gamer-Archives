Very relatable
Well, technically you still touch grass, but it also touched and even can be say hugged you too
Only 48 hours?
    been thinking about it 24/7 since I first saw it a year ago
Same homie
I have been thinking non stop about this game since i met it that was 3 mouths ago
I haven't been able to post another part of my stories because my brain is hyperfoucsed on rainworld for the entirety of this week
    same
As we should
I took a tv into my office to be able to play comfortably and my gf told me I finally lost it.
Worm grass. The grass that touches back.

I can't even begin to describe the panic I had the first time I noticed it aiming towards me. Genuine "even the **grass** wants me dead?!" moment. Now if only a certain friend was a more reliable taxi service over them...
I've known this game since Downpour came out and it's lived in my head rent free since then
You can, but only once.
    especially if *crouching* through it with a >!gooieduck!<
Just eat it back ( Duh )

I touch into the grass, and it touches back.
Steals ur meme
    "hippity hoppity, your meme is now my property"
    I thought this was already an established joke.
I picked it up I think like 2 years ago and played for a while until I got confused and quit. Then about 2 months ago I got this huge urge to play again and I can't put it down, it'll pull you in faster than a dll
Touch grass with the assistance of a noodle leg deer
Scug found ground leeches
so like dose snake grass just drag you down or dose it like, suck your di- uh BLOOD! I meant blood
    it drags you down and immobilizes, then it devours/sucks out blood
