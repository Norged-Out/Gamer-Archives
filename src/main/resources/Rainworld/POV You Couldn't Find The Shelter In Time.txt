[[POV You Couldn't Find The Shelter In Time]]





I need a version of this with the audio
    The original was ‚Äúmeow meow meow- AAAAAAAAAGH‚Äù, totally perfect video
        Not "waaa Waaaa WAAAAA"?
            Yes
            It's actually "waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa WAAAAaaaaaaa"
    I need the scream to be the kirby falling meme scream
Incredible animation however this is Reddit so I must comment on this being an incorrect use of ‚ÄúPOV‚Äù

Really tho incredible animation
    I think it's tradition to use POV wrong.
        Yeah, I mean, Im more surprised when someone actually uses it right
        Which law was that?
    I mean, it would be wrong off of reddit too.
        True, it‚Äôs just that I have to say it
        Where would it be right?
            They meant it wouldn‚Äôt be right anywhere
                Wrong, it would be right on opposite day wouldn't it?
                    Oh yeah you‚Äôre right. I always forget about that‚Ä¶
    But the game is in third person, so that makes the use of POV here technically right
    How does one use it correctly? And what would be the correct term?

Not trying to be mocking or sarcastic, btw. Genuinely curious.
        When slugcat is first-person
        Well jokes aside, POV means the video is from the point of view of the subject, so like it would be first person through the eyes/perspective of the slugcat in this video.

Editing this to disclaim that this doesn‚Äôt make the video bad and is intentionally a massive nitpick, but people commenting on the misuse of POV is kinda a meme on reddit
            Ah, I see.

...So how would you do this? Like this?:

"POV: You're watching a Slugcat who forgot the rain existed"
                You could technically use TPPOV instead and at least probably avoid being possibly eaten by reddit for it maybe
                    What's TPPOV stand for?
                        I was thinking Third Person POV
                            Ah, makes sense. Cool!
    Well technically, it could still be used in this case, as your pov is still watching the slugcat from a screen, even when this is currently happening
    It's the POV of an overseer watching you
MeimeoeowAUGHHHHHHHH
    Whats the original with sound called?
        ‚Äúmeow meow meow aghhaggauguughghg‚Äù
            Wow that is exactly what it is called. Just watched it on loop for 2 minutes
                It‚Äôs beautiful
Amazing animation!
*POV: You watch as Gourmand fails to find the shelter in time
Lol
