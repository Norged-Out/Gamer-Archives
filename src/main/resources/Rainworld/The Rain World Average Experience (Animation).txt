[[The Rain World Average Experience (Animation)]]





It's just a skill issue

If you were a good player, you could have easily escape the Pole plant, which would then catch the cyan lizard, then you would defeat the entire group of scavenger without any equipment while dodging 2 Vulture kings until they get both eaten by Leviathan, and after that use the spears from the scavs to defeat that Leviathan.
    Clearly
        Its ok op, not being able to do that is quite a common L
            True, I wouldn't have gotten past the Cyan

        Casually killing the entire fauna and flora in one room
        Donâ€™t they just have wayyy too much hp
    I would love to see a clip of that being pulled off
rookie mistake, the best RW players just don't play the game at all, that way you can't die.
Slugcat is cute
    yeaahh
Holy shit, smooth animation! Also, that scavenger. It's all their fault imo
This is well made!
Fake, the karma was above level 1. That implies you didn't die 30 times already during that cycle.

Lovely animation though!
Looks sweet, I can't wait to see more work from you! ðŸ˜Š
    Thank you! :>
lol, the artstyle is very cute :D
    Thanks!
I love your animation style! This reminds me of the first time I allowed my friend to play hunter (he was completely new outside of 2 rounds in the arena), it was great.
Lmfao
this is the most accurate thing I've seen in my entire life

also, pretty good animation, I love your artstyle :3
    Thank u!! :>
all i see is just a big skill issue.
This is so cool and well made I love itt
    Thanks! :>>

            good bot
This is so well done! Great job!
This is too accurate ToT (Also absolutely love the animation!)
I am impressed by both the visuals and the sound design, this is professional-level stuff!
    Tysm!
Awesome animation, was not expecting the ending, however pleasantly surprised.
Relatable

Can you make more?
    Maybe
Fuck yes!

This is an amazing and pretty funny animation -w- I really fucking like it â€¢wâ€¢ nice work.
Git gud. But also holy sh*t this animation slaps
This is ridiculously well made
That's actually so amazing, funny and well done! :D I'd love to see more
Cool animation bro!
    Thx!
These things are like when you open a mimic chest in like, any game that has them. 
You realize the mistake you made when you notice its moving a little but by then your already doing the animation...
This post should have warned me
When i saw the leapzard i thought it was a tamed one ngl. Lizards can be janky good boys if you have the patience
This is my favorite post on the subreddit

None of that made sense it was survivor
    That's the point
    You actually can get Leapzards and King Vultures on Survivor by lineaging
        Sorry to bother, but how exactly do you lineage? Will you tell me if my understanding is correct?:

>!Go through Hunter mode until you encounter (whatever creature you want to have accessible in Monk or Survivor), kill it/hang around it until something else does (like leapzards seem to yeet themselves into the void in Sky Islands a lot, but I havenâ€™t made it past Sky Islands in Hunter yet and realistically probably never will), then when you resume playing Monk, the creature should be available if youâ€™re in the same area where it perished in Hunter? Do I have it right? I couldnâ€™t bring myself to kill the cyan boy in Hunter but did see a ton yeet themselves into oblivion or get killed by scavs, but still havenâ€™t seen any in Monk yet. :( I am not talented enough to survive Hunger I think but I really really really want at least one leapzard if not a whole pack. 

Also, any tips for if thereâ€™s any other lizards that can travel through all areas with you?!<
            Your understanding is incorrect. How lineaging works:

Short answer: kill creature from the same den for several cycles and it might become something else

Long answer: After creature is killed, there's 33%(50% fpr Hunter) chance per cycle that creature will respawn. There are 2 types of creature dens(spawnpoints) - static dens and lineage dens. Static dens always respawn same creature. Lineage dens have chance to spawn next creature from their list. Each den has it's own creature list and chances. For example den2 in room SU_A40 has this list:

Green-0.1, Pink-0.5, Blue-0.2, Red-0

That means this den will spawn Green Lizard. On each respawning(33% each cycle) there's 10% that Pink will start spawning there. Then there'll be 50% on each respawning that Blue will start spawning there. Then there'll be 20% on each respawning that Red will start spawning there.

Then Red will respawn there each time
                Iâ€™m sorry I havenâ€™t replied yet - I think Iâ€™m just really bad at math (or reading comprehension) because I donâ€™t quite get it, but I wanted to say I really appreciate you taking the time to help me on this, and Iâ€™m going to keep reading this (+ doing associated research to try to break it down into Lantern-Mouse-size-pieces since that seems to be closer to where my intellectual prowess is at) until I get it. It really meant a lot to get your reply and I just wanted to say thank you, thank you very much.
                    Google "Rain world wiki Lineage System"
                        Sorry, Iâ€™ve done that a number of times already! I wouldnâ€™t try to bother a kind internet stranger before at least attempting a rudimentary google & DuckDuckGo search first, devouring the first page results & related links first. Now I think itâ€™s probably time for me to try to look and see if thereâ€™s any YT videos on it, maybe there they will have something for Lantern Mice brains like me!

But again, the bigger point I wanted to make was to say thank you. It really does mean a lot to me, and Iâ€™m going to keep reading it (& reading it to my partner who Iâ€™m playing with - totally not related, but canâ€™t wait to Jolly Co-Op and raise pups with them!!!!) until I get it, I promise.
                            If you want you can dm on Discord (LoerisOtter#6432) and ask questions
                                Oh wow, I didnâ€™t realize that was an option on discord!! (This is my first game since PokÃ©mon Yellow/Gold/Crystal, so Iâ€™m deeply out of touch, but holy smokes, I am so charmed & enchanted with this world, Iâ€™m going to figure it out no matter what!) Iâ€™ll make a discord account first thing tomorrow and ask!! 

Apologies to bother again, but is there any particular Discord etiquette to follow (beyond just regular internet & greater social etiquette)?  I feel bad asking yet another question, and especially donâ€™t want to do so in a way thatâ€™s anywhere remotely outside of polite (even though my intentions are to be very polite, appreciative, and kind)!

Iâ€™ll make a discord account first thing tomorrow and ask!! 

Apologies to bother again, but is there any particular Discord etiquette to follow (beyond just regular internet & greater social etiquette)?  I feel bad asking yet another question, and especially donâ€™t want to do so in a way thatâ€™s anywhere remotely outside of polite (even though my intentions are to be very polite, appreciative, and kind)!
Sorry, Iâ€™ve done that a number of times already! I wouldnâ€™t try to bother a kind internet stranger before at least attempting a rudimentary google & DuckDuckGo search first, devouring the first page results & related links first. Now I think itâ€™s probably time for me to try to look and see if thereâ€™s any YT videos on it, maybe there they will have something for Lantern Mice brains like me!

But again, the bigger point I wanted to make was to say thank you. It really does mean a lot to me, and Iâ€™m going to keep reading it (& reading it to my partner who Iâ€™m playing with - totally not related, but canâ€™t wait to Jolly Co-Op and raise pups with them!!!!) until I get it, I promise.
    If you want you can dm on Discord (LoerisOtter#6432) and ask questions
        Oh wow, I didnâ€™t realize that was an option on discord!! (This is my first game since PokÃ©mon Yellow/Gold/Crystal, so Iâ€™m deeply out of touch, but holy smokes, I am so charmed & enchanted with this world, Iâ€™m going to figure it out no matter what!) Iâ€™ll make a discord account first thing tomorrow and ask!!
