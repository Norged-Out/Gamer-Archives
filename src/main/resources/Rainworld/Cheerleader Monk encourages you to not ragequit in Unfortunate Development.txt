[[Cheerleader Monk encourages you to not ragequit in Unfortunate Development]]





My favorite Rainworld post, Monk deserves all the good vibes in return
This rules
Thanks monk
*"The perfect post doesn't exist."*
👏👏👏 What a good performance!
Thanks to you, I’ll continue to try for a platinum!
i am stuck in canopy trying to get to karma 4 to get to the wall i think i'm losing my mind
    If you still have a passage, you can use it to teleport to the nearest shelter (not the one where you last saved) and get max karma this way.

You can walk back to a previous shelter, teleport back to your current shelter, and try to cross the bridge without dying (you have room for 1 death).
        I rushed canopy so I don't have a passage, but I just might go back to the outskirt and farm for Survivor. I hadn't thought of that
        Infact you can't teleport to any shelter in the given area if you have visited it in any point of a run across multiple slugcats

That's how I skipped most of exterior on survivor
    I’m doing that too, good luck to us both. Oh wait you said that a year ago
        I'm in the same situation right now in hunter mode lol
Cheerleader Monk encourages me in real life.
Thanks <3
You now what... i will keep on then...
Alright il give it another 17 attempts!

To be honest unfortunate development isn’t that hard for me. Prolly cause I’m really lucky I feel what with one of the daddys falling off the tower grabbing a lizard that chased me being an example of my luck.

Maybe I haven’t seen everything UD has to offer?
    just extremely lucky, died over 50 times in UD and decided to just go around
        I highly recommend going through UD it makes reaching my guy 5P so rewarding. I also feel like you get to see cooler parts of 5P's computer system. Also if you can do it quick and safely it's way faster than RTA.
            i love Rain World's open world because i have no idea what you all are talking about lol, I reached 5P through the Underhang and then climbing the Wall.

what is so bad about Unfortunate Development? I'm thinking of taking that path when I replay it.
                There's just more Daddy's climbing around and Protos on the walls. That and the chameleons are super annoying. It makes for a much more difficult path but you get to see some cool environments going through it.
            It is probably really rewarding but I got so frustrated after dying so many times I just said "screw this" and went around because I wanted to be able to play the rest of the game. Maybe sometime I'll go back and do UD.
    I don't think there are any lizards in UD.
        I must be referring to the area outside then.
*cheerleader monk fills you with determination*
Holy shit, it's so cute I want to hug him.... Tho probably after he put the squid down, don't want them to do an extra large and powerful ink bomb on us
So this the top of the top. This is what I will see someday randomly when Reddit decides to show me the top post of r/rainworld in 30 years.
    Indeed. I am eternal and inevitable. Like the cycle of rebirths that plagues all living things, the world is cursed to watch monk cheerleeding on loop until the stars die.
what is that i have not seen that creature in the game so far
    A hazer. When thrown, they emit ink clouds. They can be eaten for 1 pip after they have been used or killed. They’re rare - I remember one in Industrial Complex. Fall off the bridge in the water reservoir, then go left.
look at him go!
I beat unfortunate development because of this but then my game crashed :(
can I post this on my rain world clips channel? its super cute. I would give you full credit with links to this post and your profile in the description!
    Sure thing. I did not originally make the clip, though, it first appeared somewhere on 4chan's /v/ board on a Rain World thread. Due to the nature of 4chan, it will never be known who actually made this adorable gif.
        ok, Im still gonna give you credit as you made this popular. thank you!
I just reroute through the recursive transform arrays so I can be out of most of the unfortunate development
this is literally the best rain world reddit posrt of all time
This needs to be lore where it’s tradition for slugcats to dance with hazers in a ceremony.
I... i finally get it
this is the funniest shit ive seen, i can rest now that i have seen cheerleading monk....
AYO THATS ME WHAT
Deez nuts
Ty monk
wow this came at the perfect time
