Rapture is just that advanced
    Is the tennis ball maker not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
    Rapture was ahead of its time.
        I mean they did have cameras

            cameras existed before 1960
                yeah but they had cctv and automatic image recognition
Yellow tennis balls were probably one of the greatest things invented in Rapture.
Well, Rapture was ahead of its time...
    Rapture was ahead of its time... still is, but it used to be too.

Hey maybe the game designers thought "these guys won't know this is a tennis ball if it's black and white"
    Get out of here with your logic
Fun fact: [Gibson is rumored to have used a custom color for their guitars](http://blog.warmoth.com/2016/02/09/tv-yellow-faded-origin-classic-guitar-color/) just because it looked great on black and white TV in the 50's.
Elizabeth made a tear to the future. Duh. 
That's cool, they are green though so...
    Congratulations, you're color blind! 
        Nope. Every tennis ball I have ever seen had been a very neon green. The one in the thumbnail of this post is certainly yellow ish but the one in the game is clearly more green than yellow.
            You really ought to take a colorblindness test. You could be surprised at the result.
                Everyone I have talked to has confirmed that they consider tennis balls green. I understand that it's like a chartreuse but I think it's more of a preference thing unless Americans make different tennis balls than us. 
                    This is the colour of ball I'm used to : https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000244895921.jpg?strip=all&w=960

Though I also found some green ones in Google image.

Where do you live?
                        Canada. And ya that's a very yellow looking example. Every ball I have handled has been greener than that and they only become more green with use. 
                            I'm in Quebec and we use yellow ones...
                                Just used a hexadecimal colour reader on a pic of a tennis ball. Shits green yo
                                    I 10% agree, a yellowish limeish green, but still green over yellow
    Tennis balls aren't green. That one in the thumbnail is pretty much equal in both red and green for RGB values. It's yellow.
Tears, maybe? [If Rapture and Columbia were connected, then Suchong could probably have snatched a tennis ball from another tear, or gotten one that one of the Finks had acquired from a tear.](/spoiler)
    Tears weren't a thing until Bioshock infinite was created. this is just an errror.
        Yeah, I know it's an error. But that doesn't mean it can't be retconned ;)
            Please, no more retcons.
                There are always retcons.
        Not to mention who the fuck would bother making a year to replace tennis balls with the "better" version (which isn't really better anyways since Rapture has no TVs IIRC, it has screens with messages but no cable TVs).
            Rapture has TVs/monitors. Sophia Lamb talks on them, and I know there are others.
    They aren't. Infinite sucks.
        Isn't that a bit like saying that Darth Vader isn't Luke's father, because you hate the Empire Strikes Back?
            No, because Empire is amazing and anyone who lambasts it as "bad" is simply incorrect.
                I feel similarly about Infinite.
                    <shakes head somberly> I'm sorry man.
                        Dude your logic is  "The things I like are correct and everyone else is wrong!" 

You're the worst kind of troll. 
                            Mkay
        I thought Infinite was great. All 3 are great. 
        LIES!
Only the best and the brightest 
Early electric guitars were made slightly yellow for a similar reason. Being full white they would become an eyesore on TV due to them being relatively big, that is why both Gibson and Fender made their "white" guitars yellow in the 50's. To this day Gibson uses that particular colour now under the name of TV-yellow
I was considering replaying this an hour ago, good thing I didn't.
Literally unplayable should be a subredit
I'm 99.2189432916294797% sure that underwater cities also didn't exist during 1960
    If it wasn't for that 0.7810567083705203% possibility I wouldn't have bothered playing.

Andrew Ryan was the pioneer for yellow tennis balls. Everyone knows that.
Research showed? When I hear that, my brain thinks there was a whole study asking the question wether a neon yellow ball is more visible than a black/white ball.


    You might not be far off.

In Australia our sporting institute and Cricketing Australia did studies like that on the color of cricket balls, trying to find one that could be used without loss of viability if the grounds had to put the lights on. 

A real issue, since certain forms of cricket move at a glacial pace, and the sun can start setting before a session is complete.
Huh, seeing that screenshot made me realise that the remaster is actually pretty nice graphically.
Ugh the /s bullshit has made it to titles.
I hate you, OP.
Just goes to show how far ahead of its time Rapture was.
Prototype. 
sorry im colored blind i dont see the difference lol.
TV became popular in the '50s.
Shit game
I love this game!
