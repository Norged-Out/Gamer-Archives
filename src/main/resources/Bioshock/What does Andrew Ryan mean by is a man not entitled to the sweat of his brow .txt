[[What does Andrew Ryan mean by is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow ]]


I'm currently playing the first bioshock, i wanna know what Ryan meant by this, does it mean a man should get what he deserves after working hard? Or does he mean a man should have the right to work whatever he wants? Or maybe neither? I'm interested in his character honestly.


Basically is a man not entitled to the fruits of his own labour

He is using this in the context of a government taking the fruits in taxes ( democracy) and taking it to share with everyone (communism).
    So what he think is the fruits of a man's labour should be his and only his?
        He says it should belong to the man himself, he is hyper capitalist so pushing the rhetoric that you should be able to work hard and enjoy the fruits of your labour.
            Yes and no. He does encourage entrepreneurial manufacturers whose idea rests on the actual labors of factory workers.

Basically, Ryan (whose name is an anagram of Ayn Rand) is a hyper capitalist who believe in what he calls The Great Chain, which is an ideology he's created according to which the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

Edit: The sweat of his brow quote, therefore, doesn't refer to every man owning the fruit of his labor. Is is an anti-communist rhetoric to denounce governments and market regulations he's felt disappointed by, prompting the creation of Rapture.

If Ryan fundamentally believed that workers owned what their labour creates, he'd be a trade unionist.

(Yes, before you ask, I'm a socialist.)
                To piggyback on this for OP: Basically what Andrew Ryan is saying is actually pro-capitalist rhetoric, ie the capitalists that own the machinery and employs the workers should be able to profit to the fullest extent without governmental interference.
                    Well said
                    This 👆🏽
                >the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

He sounds a lot like a regular laissez faire free market capitalist

That is, not a "hyper-capitalist" or whatever made-up terms people here are using. Just a regular old cappie
                    Don't some capitalists believe in taxes?
                        Yeah, it’s literally only laissez-faire not regular capitalism
                Andrew Ryan is an anagram for Ayn Rand Rew
                    Thank you. I thought I was going crazy lol
                How old are you?
                Holy fk. Never realized Andrew Ryan was a caricature of Ayn Rand till now. Their stories line up a lot, from living in Russia to moving to the US. Her two best known novels are also Foundtainhead (Frank Fontain) and Atlas Shrugged. Just connected the dots on this lmao.
                Lmao imagine being a socialist in the 21th century
                    Imagine wanting your taxes to go to things that matter and for rich blowhards to stop hoarding all of the money
                        Imagine supporting the most murderous ideology of the 20th century and still thinking you're morally right
                            Quite right. Except Capitalism has a much higher death rate...
                                It's almost as if imperialist States start wars and expansion rather than free markets or most as if States produce concentration camps, religious prosecution, censorship, etc. Specially marxist ones
                                    The US isn't even free or competitive
                            These people need to play bioshock 2 and see how it shows that the opposite side of the coin is just as bad if not worse.
                                Yup, bioshock spares no one in it's message of how utopias are only a figment of human imagination, nor the ancoms, nor the libertarians, or conservatives or socialists are spared of critique along the series
                                    Yup, all our systems we’ve ever come up with suck. It’s just about finding the historically least sucky one and going from there.
                                Opportunists abound you always have to be vigilant but democratic socialism is undebatably more moral than unregulated capitalism. We all see the direction the U.S. is headed
                                    Well yeah democratic socialism (I am a Canadian so I can’t really dis it) but bioshock 2 doesn’t deal with that. Lamb is still a tyrant, no one voted her in she just started a cult and if you questioned it or went against it you’d be killed. She psychologically manipulated the rapture population that was already down in the dumps because the system they were in sucked big daddy doo doo already.
            Hmm, what are most people's opinions about his idea? I find it interesting, not sure if I agree also not sure if I disagree.
                It is the type of thing that sounds good but when you really think about its its the type of rhetoric that the people at the top would tell the people on the bottom so they have the right to work hard with no government support or regulations for whatever low wage they feel like paying you. 

The game goes into this so best to stop asking here before you get a spoiler haha
                As with most ideologies: The core principle is making sense and is not bad in itself. Buuuuuut... as an extreme form of capitalism, it will spiral out of control with those you can fight their way to the top as the ones will all and those who cannot work so hard or so much or that aren't so clever or ruthless at the bottom.

Every ideology needs some kind of limit. At least the human factor will grind it into uselessness, if kept unchecked.
                    Also, as with most ideologies, it relies on people to carry it out, as Levine said. Rapture is full of hypocrites, including Ryan, who aren't practicing his ideology really.
                    The real problem with capitalism is that if you start off the 'game' with lots of capital, you don't have to work super hard, but if you start off with very little capital, chances are you'll stay poor no matter how hard you work.
                        Especially the longer the system runs. If you're rich, you're incentivized by the system to both protect and grow that wealth, which means you want to stamp out the competition. Over generations, this means more and more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and the opportunities for others to acquire wealth evaporate because the rich see that as competition (and therefore a potential threat to their own wealth and "success").
                        > chances are

Meaning if one applies oneself that the OTHER chances (also) are they might make use of the mechanism themselves

Meanwhile those who work can get to  have opportunity with additional work made available by the capitalists organized abilities expanding their businesses beyond mere craft guild levels, and the cheaper better products being advanced and produced for all the people via "economy of scale" - so much more made possible via "Capital".

It all goes much further back to the start of civilization when specialization of labor and craft  happened - people moving 'up' from simple farming.  Capitalism is only a tool of that process.

.
                It's really, reeeeeaaaaaally stupid. Almost all of Ryans wealth is made from other people working and while he'll spend hours talking about how he built Rapture, he didn't. Other people built it for him and he, alongside others, continues to exploit them.

Equally he'll tell you how everyone in Rapture starts equal and only advances due to their own work except guess what? Some people start off in a better position because they were rich on the surface and bought their way in which is really obvious looking at Ryan - he isn't ruling Rapture because he's the best at business, he rigged the game in his favour from the start by owning all the required infrastructure.

Ryan also doesn't even believe his own philosophy that much. He claims that if you're smart or strong enough to make an advantage, you should and that's the way of things but once people started hacking shops, leveraging their skills for an advantage, what happens? He starts throwing them in prison.
                It's bullshit; it leans on the false assumption that the richest people are the smartest, most innovative and best at what they do, who are most deserving of their wealth. 

If you need undeniable proof of how false this notion is look at VHS Vs Betamax, or Blue Ray Vs HD Dvd. Both times the inferior product won through crony capitalism where instead of the product standing in the free market for the consumer to choose, the decision was made by backroom exclusivity deals and marketing.

Secondly it leans on the false narrative that anyone can succeed from nothing. There are no self made billionaires (which is the true mark of rich, a million will barely buy you a decent house these days), some inherit generational wealth, some encounter rich people that help them into the circles of the rich and some scam people and commit crimes to get their start. 

Regardless you cannot have a common upbringing and education then be guaranteed a fair shot at becoming rich, you always have to be born with the edge, luck into an edge or cheat into an edge.

Also without limits Capitaliism would eat every up and shit it out as exhausted waste like the great serpent that eats the world then eats itself because it runs out of things to eat leaving nothing behind but death.

Eventually Randism just goes back to being Feudalism with noble families that own and control everything through virtue of inheritance and everyone else being slaves with no rights kept ignorant in order to make them docile. That basically brings all progress to a halt because information becomes the exclusive domain of a few people with no incentive to change the status quo.
                    >Secondly it leans on the false narrative that anyone can succeed from nothing. There are no self made billionaires (which is the true mark of rich, a million will barely buy you a decent house these days), some inherit generational wealth, some encounter rich people that help them into the circles of the rich and some scam people and commit crimes to get their start. 

And sometimes people just create something that other people want to buy.
                        Innovative products are more likely to be bought out for a token amount of money that sounds big but is ultimately a fraction of the ideas worth and shelved by the monopoly holding competitor that is making a bigger profit on a lower quality and less efficient product.
                    I disagree that it is impossible to go from nothing to a self made billionaire.
                        Find me someone that did with no outside help, personal favours or loans of money that the average person wouldn't have access to.

                                Dude, you need to get a life, go outside, and spend less time on Reddit. The fact that you’re sat, waiting for a stranger on Reddit to respond to you is pathetic honestly.  

I gave my opinion, it’s not my job to provide you with links and examples to back it up.  I simply do not care what you think mate, hate to break it to you. 

Alas, I’ll satisfy your sad existence with an excellent list of self made millionaires who came from nothing -

                                    all examples you linked are people who rode on once-in-a-lifetime tech booms  in the 90s when you could be competitive with basic knowledge and not a computer science degree. or industries that hadn't been made such as mail order furniture which is extremely common now. The other decided to sell their soul for oil deals that were funded by the wedding gifts given to them by rich in laws they sold for capital, making their entire narrative "married into money". They all lucked out. The philosophy is no better than socialism, its like pointing to lottery winners and saying "see we have a shot".

                        It's not that it's impossible, it's just incredibly rare.
                            You might as well just buy bunch of lotteries and hope to win in that case.
                        Reality disagrees with you
                Ryan is what is called an objectivist. Basically, as an objectivist, you pursue your own self interests at the expense of everyone else. Altruism is frowned upon and you’re encouraged to support systems and ideas that fulfill your own happiness. It’s a philosophy developed by Ayn Rand who Ryan is based on and the setting of Bioshock is loosely based on her book Atlas Shrugged. Rapture is basically an objectivist society taken to its extreme logical conclusion.
                    >at the expense of everyone else

Just a clarification here (for other users who might be reading this thread). Ayn Rand didn't support killing, hurting or robbing other people. And she supported the existence of a government to guarantee property rights and enforce contracts. So "at the expense of everyone else" doesn't mean an anarchist free for all. It's just a classic laissez faire capitalism.
                        Thanks for the clarification. I didn’t mean to imply that she condoned what you mentioned here.
                            I know you didn't. Just wanted to clarify for OP and any other users.
                The whole point of the game is that ideology doesn't work in a society
                It can be good in theory. But in practice, it can lead to poor people revolting and it can lead to rich people becoming the defacto government, since there is no government to garantee rule of law. Which is what happened in Rapture. As you play the game, you'll see that. So at the very least, taxes and welfare help maintain societal order.

Also, Ryan was right in one thing. Altruism as an ideology can be exploited by a selfish populist who will use the desperate people for his own gain (which also happened in Rapture with Fontaine):

*"Whenever anyone wants others to do their work, they call upon their altruism. "Never mind your own needs," they say, "think of the needs of ..." of ... whoever. Of the state. Of the poor. Of the army. Of the king. Of God. The list goes on and on. How many catastrophes were launched with the words "think of yourself"? It's the "king and country" crowd who light the torch of destruction."*
                He’s not saying the workers should profit… he’s saying the guy who bought the machines and factories should be able to reap endless profits from it with no hindrance and everyone working under him only deserve as much as he says. We can see in our own world how badly that can be abused and why we need laws to protect workers. Rapture was doing pretty well until the riots.
        And anyone who dares suggest they should get a share is deemed a parasite, because they are reaping the benefits of another's sweat instead of working for themselves

Essentially, you get what you earn. And _only_ what you earn.
        He believes that the fruits of a man's labor should be entirely his to enjoy or dispose of as he sees fit.
        Remember, this game is a look at what can happen when that type of thinking is taken to the absolute extreme.
        His name is also an reference to Ayn Rand. Read atlas shrugged for the origin of rapture
        When you say his do you mean Ryan or the man working?
        Yeah
    If I had money I would award this comment
    Or god (religion)
    First off, it’s Marxist socialism vs capitalism. Democracy isn’t really a part of this. And It’s not taxes, but the fact that in capitalism the boss/owner makes more than the workers while putting in less effort sometimes no effort at all (passive ownership). In Marxist socialism, the workers own the means of production and all get an equal cut. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production.

Edit: it’s been a while since I played the game but yeah, in this case taxes are what he’s referring to.
    I dont think that democracy is the word you're looking for. But yes, he doesn't want a government taking taxes at all.
    “A man builds the parasite asks where is my share?”
Well the rest of the quote explains it nicely, without even looking up other sources. Did you not hear the rest of the quote?

*I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture, a city where the artist would not fear the censor, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality, Where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well.*
    Yeah, it also seems pretty telling of Ryan's actual beliefs that the three organizations he cites as "stealing the sweat of the working man's brow" are all linked to helping the poor. Washington? The New Deal. The Vatican? Alms for the poor. Moscow? Wealth redistribution. It seems that it wasn't social injustice, nor the violation of human rights, nor even the evils of the holocaust that Ryan hated. The thing that drove Ryan to the bottom of the sea was the fact that governments around the world seemed to be deciding that the bottom rung of society deserved to not be crushed under the boot of society's wealthy elite, which he just couldn't accept.
Find it for yourself Commie! No free handouts of knowledge! Pay me and I will tell you.
Smartest bioshock fan
    💀
government and other parasitic actors suck away the gain of the citizens work

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow#Etymology
It means he wants to collect the sweat from everyone’s brow. It doesn’t say what the end goal is, but I imagine it’s to bottle and sell it.
He means a man should be rewarded for the work he does or something like that
It demonstrates how truly ignorant Ryan is because his brow never sweats at any point in his life. 

HE doesn't have to work building Rapture; all he does is move money around and tell people where to go.
He's saying that as a man who sweats, shouldn't you be entitled to that sweat, to do with as you please?
Going to get downvoted.

You get up and work your ass off, it sucks. But, you’ve earned the reward at the end of the day, why should you have to share? I wouldn’t take my money and give it to the poor, that’s not my responsibility. Why should the government take what you’ve earned and give it to them instead? (Welfare/unemployment) etc.

So,I am entitled to the sweat on my brow.
    > I wouldn’t take my money and give it to the poor, that’s not my responsibility.

But you could if you wanted to.    It would be your choice.

Compelled Faux-Charity should not be forced on to according to Ryans beliefs
    When you get into a car accident and we cant find your insurance paperwork we'll just leave you on the side of the road to die just like you want.
    First off: the taxes you pay are being used for police, firefighters, roads, etc. so why not use tax money to help people? 

Society is literally better off when there's less homelessness and poverty, allowing people who are born in bad situations to thrive only benefits society and makes a strong economy that's more resistant to crises and has more purchasing power. Wealth is also more equally distributed instead of the majority of wealth going to the top of an ever-shrinking pyramid head, which ironically works like a parasite that leeches the economy dry if unchecked.

What if someone who worked for years has an accident so they can't work anymore? Or if a natural catastrophe hits them so hard they can't realistically go to work for a long while? Or if they're born dirt poor so they have terrible education and have a very slim chance of getting out of the cycle of poverty? It's not only the moral thing to do but it's important for the wellbeing of your society and you benefit from it whether you want to believe it or not.

The mindset that we shouldn't have a socio-economic safety net is ignorant at best if you ask me.
        [deleted]
            But that doesn't have anything to do with the sweat of your brow. Andrew Ryan rejects Social Security or anything like it because he wants everyone to provide for themselves regardless of how fair or sustainable it is. That's a different thing from not wanting social security to go to people who only take advantage of it, I think everyone agrees on that.

Note that I don't know how Social Security works in the US.
To reference a less used Ryan quote (going from memory here so bear with me) 

“The man expecting the doctor to treat him for free and the man who expects the farmer to feed him out of charity are parasites, no different from the pervert who prowls the streets looking for a victim to ravish”

Ryan believes (to a radical extent) that people are entitled to the fruits of their own labor, and not others’ labor. He believes people who leech and try to look for quick/easy solutions are parasites, taking away from society
Well he's a hyper capitalist so he doesn't really believe in taxes or anything. Everything you earn by your work in the free market, you get to keep. I only found one audio tape where Andrew was sticking up to this right for someone else than himself tho. In Arcadia, some woman mentions in a tape him saying something about the sweat of some farmer's brow.

 We know from the game that he does break his rules pretty quickly when things don't go his way, Andrew Ryan is a good example that in a totalitarian state the leader most often gets corrupted by the power, whatever the -ism is. In Bioshock and in Andrew Ryan's case it's "objectivism". Google it. Also Google Ayn Rand, she coined objectivism irl.
It's meant to mean zero tax/welfare so everyone keeps 100% of their earnings. But if you've read any of *Das Kapital* by Karl Marx, it actually sounds more communist or socialist.
    That’s exactly my thought. It’s Marxist socialism and I think it’s a reference to owning the means of production. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production
        It does sound Marxist in the sense that the worker is entitled to the surplus of their labour and it shouldn't be stolen by the bourgeoisie owner who exploits them, but it's a complete reference to Ayn Rand who was as capitalist and antimarxist as you can get, opposing taxes and social programs because, why someone else should benefit from their labour? But hypocritically living her last days under social welfare and broke. And you can see the influences in the game. A remote society built underwater, far from any government interference, ruled by entrpeneurs and selfish people who feel entitled for everything but didn't know that it was doomed from the start.
        Have you not played the game? On first glance I get why you would make that connection, but if you've played the game you would know that Andrew Ryan is anything but a Marxist or socialist.
            Yeah man, I’ve played the game but that was like 15 years ago by now lmao. It came out in like 2008 right?
                I think 2007, makes more sense if you played it that long ago.
        Except Ryan didn't believe in marxism or "surplus value". From his perspective, a communist government would be stealing from him. Which is why he left Russia.
    actually in the marxian theoreticals of that  it is 100% "Welfare"  : where 'the good of all' is what determines what happens to the results of your working efforts.  Whether you want it or not.   It is the very Opposite of what Ryan believes.
...but the parasite says NO 😂💀
my mans hated taxes
“Is a man not entitled to the fruits of his labor/hard work?”
Is a man not entitled to what he himself has created
In a nutshell, it’s a lot of Ayn Rands teachings on subjectivism. Andrew Ryan is a huge fan of Ayn Rand. Ayn Rand/Andrew Ryan, get it? Basically, people should be out for themselves and not share anything with anyone. That is a very dumbed down version but kinda true.
He’s saying that basically someone should be allowed what they earn by hard work.  That it’s theirs and they shouldn’t have to share it.

Communism = you don’t get the sweat on your brow because it’s shared out between everyone evenly

Capitalism with taxes (democracy) = you don’t get a portion of what you earn because it goes towards taxes
Basically capitalism with no taxes. That’s the government or system or dream or city or whatever that Andrew Ryan believes in.
Everyone thinks he's hyper capitalist but this phrase is as socialist as it gets. He's saying people deserve what they work for and someone else doesn't get to take all the benefits of your labor.
What he meant is "I'm entitled to lick the sweat off my own brow, damn it!" I tend to agree.
It's part of Ryan's interpretation of Any Rand's extremely flawed philosophy of "Objectivism" as she termed it (most other philosophers don't like that name).

Basically, Ryan is saying if you work hard, you should be entitled to the rewards/benefits of what you create. But of course, Ryan doesn't think that should apply to the people who toil in Ryan Industries or Fountaine Fisheries for a pittance, hence why Peach Wilkins often complains.

Ryan is a massive hypocrite in many ways, but the way he turned Rapture into his personal dictatorship shows that he actually believed "Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? No, it belongs to me."
    >Ryan doesn't think that should apply to the people who toil in Ryan Industries or Fountaine Fisheries for a pittance

In theory, Ryan thinks that if someone is more capable than him, they are free to leave their job and start their own business that will earn more and take more of the market. In practice, yeah, as soon as Frank started doing exactly that, he performed a hostile takeover of his business.
        Well after all, it was the sweat of Ryan’s brow that paid those people to do the hostile takeover, so clearly he’s entitled to Fontaine Futuristics
He goes on to say, and this is from memory so it's not a direct quote, "is man not entitled to the sweat of his own brow? No, says the man in washington, it belongs to the government. No, says the man in moscow, it belongs to everyone! No says the man in the Vatican, it belongs to god!"  - his point is that, in Rapture, no one tells you what to do with your income. You earned it and it's yours. But it wasn't just money. He didn't want scientists to be constrained by the morality of the church or artists to be censored by the morality of the public. What's yours is yours and no one can tell you what to do with it.  
That's what I got out of it, anyway.
He uses the image of a man working in his own field to show what he means, but that is a delusional lie, he really means the man who owns that field that the man who is sweating in the picture is working on.
Isn't it self-evident? When he asks, 'Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?', he's implying that someone should be able to keep the fruits of his labour, whether that's in currency and ownership.
So what he think is the fruits of a man's labour should be his and only his?
    He says it should belong to the man himself, he is hyper capitalist so pushing the rhetoric that you should be able to work hard and enjoy the fruits of your labour.
        Yes and no. He does encourage entrepreneurial manufacturers whose idea rests on the actual labors of factory workers.

Basically, Ryan (whose name is an anagram of Ayn Rand) is a hyper capitalist who believe in what he calls The Great Chain, which is an ideology he's created according to which the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

Edit: The sweat of his brow quote, therefore, doesn't refer to every man owning the fruit of his labor. Is is an anti-communist rhetoric to denounce governments and market regulations he's felt disappointed by, prompting the creation of Rapture.

If Ryan fundamentally believed that workers owned what their labour creates, he'd be a trade unionist.

(Yes, before you ask, I'm a socialist.)
            To piggyback on this for OP: Basically what Andrew Ryan is saying is actually pro-capitalist rhetoric, ie the capitalists that own the machinery and employs the workers should be able to profit to the fullest extent without governmental interference.
                Well said
                This 👆🏽
            >the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

He sounds a lot like a regular laissez faire free market capitalist

That is, not a "hyper-capitalist" or whatever made-up terms people here are using. Just a regular old cappie
                Don't some capitalists believe in taxes?
                    Yeah, it’s literally only laissez-faire not regular capitalism
            Andrew Ryan is an anagram for Ayn Rand Rew
                Thank you. I thought I was going crazy lol
            How old are you?
            Holy fk. Never realized Andrew Ryan was a caricature of Ayn Rand till now. Their stories line up a lot, from living in Russia to moving to the US. Her two best known novels are also Foundtainhead (Frank Fontain) and Atlas Shrugged. Just connected the dots on this lmao.
            Lmao imagine being a socialist in the 21th century
                Imagine wanting your taxes to go to things that matter and for rich blowhards to stop hoarding all of the money
                    Imagine supporting the most murderous ideology of the 20th century and still thinking you're morally right
                        Quite right. Except Capitalism has a much higher death rate...
                            It's almost as if imperialist States start wars and expansion rather than free markets or most as if States produce concentration camps, religious prosecution, censorship, etc. Specially marxist ones
                                The US isn't even free or competitive
                        These people need to play bioshock 2 and see how it shows that the opposite side of the coin is just as bad if not worse.
                            Yup, bioshock spares no one in it's message of how utopias are only a figment of human imagination, nor the ancoms, nor the libertarians, or conservatives or socialists are spared of critique along the series
                                Yup, all our systems we’ve ever come up with suck. It’s just about finding the historically least sucky one and going from there.
                            Opportunists abound you always have to be vigilant but democratic socialism is undebatably more moral than unregulated capitalism. We all see the direction the U.S. is headed
                                Well yeah democratic socialism (I am a Canadian so I can’t really dis it) but bioshock 2 doesn’t deal with that. Lamb is still a tyrant, no one voted her in she just started a cult and if you questioned it or went against it you’d be killed. She psychologically manipulated the rapture population that was already down in the dumps because the system they were in sucked big daddy doo doo already.
        Hmm, what are most people's opinions about his idea? I find it interesting, not sure if I agree also not sure if I disagree.
            It is the type of thing that sounds good but when you really think about its its the type of rhetoric that the people at the top would tell the people on the bottom so they have the right to work hard with no government support or regulations for whatever low wage they feel like paying you. 

The game goes into this so best to stop asking here before you get a spoiler haha
            As with most ideologies: The core principle is making sense and is not bad in itself. Buuuuuut... as an extreme form of capitalism, it will spiral out of control with those you can fight their way to the top as the ones will all and those who cannot work so hard or so much or that aren't so clever or ruthless at the bottom.

Every ideology needs some kind of limit. At least the human factor will grind it into uselessness, if kept unchecked.
                Also, as with most ideologies, it relies on people to carry it out, as Levine said. Rapture is full of hypocrites, including Ryan, who aren't practicing his ideology really.
                The real problem with capitalism is that if you start off the 'game' with lots of capital, you don't have to work super hard, but if you start off with very little capital, chances are you'll stay poor no matter how hard you work.
                    Especially the longer the system runs. If you're rich, you're incentivized by the system to both protect and grow that wealth, which means you want to stamp out the competition. Over generations, this means more and more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and the opportunities for others to acquire wealth evaporate because the rich see that as competition (and therefore a potential threat to their own wealth and "success").
                    > chances are

Meaning if one applies oneself that the OTHER chances (also) are they might make use of the mechanism themselves

Meanwhile those who work can get to  have opportunity with additional work made available by the capitalists organized abilities expanding their businesses beyond mere craft guild levels, and the cheaper better products being advanced and produced for all the people via "economy of scale" - so much more made possible via "Capital".

It all goes much further back to the start of civilization when specialization of labor and craft  happened - people moving 'up' from simple farming.  Capitalism is only a tool of that process.

.
            It's really, reeeeeaaaaaally stupid. Almost all of Ryans wealth is made from other people working and while he'll spend hours talking about how he built Rapture, he didn't. Other people built it for him and he, alongside others, continues to exploit them.

Equally he'll tell you how everyone in Rapture starts equal and only advances due to their own work except guess what? Some people start off in a better position because they were rich on the surface and bought their way in which is really obvious looking at Ryan - he isn't ruling Rapture because he's the best at business, he rigged the game in his favour from the start by owning all the required infrastructure.

Ryan also doesn't even believe his own philosophy that much. He claims that if you're smart or strong enough to make an advantage, you should and that's the way of things but once people started hacking shops, leveraging their skills for an advantage, what happens? He starts throwing them in prison.
            It's bullshit; it leans on the false assumption that the richest people are the smartest, most innovative and best at what they do, who are most deserving of their wealth. 

If you need undeniable proof of how false this notion is look at VHS Vs Betamax, or Blue Ray Vs HD Dvd. Both times the inferior product won through crony capitalism where instead of the product standing in the free market for the consumer to choose, the decision was made by backroom exclusivity deals and marketing.

Secondly it leans on the false narrative that anyone can succeed from nothing. There are no self made billionaires (which is the true mark of rich, a million will barely buy you a decent house these days), some inherit generational wealth, some encounter rich people that help them into the circles of the rich and some scam people and commit crimes to get their start. 

Regardless you cannot have a common upbringing and education then be guaranteed a fair shot at becoming rich, you always have to be born with the edge, luck into an edge or cheat into an edge.

Also without limits Capitaliism would eat every up and shit it out as exhausted waste like the great serpent that eats the world then eats itself because it runs out of things to eat leaving nothing behind but death.

Eventually Randism just goes back to being Feudalism with noble families that own and control everything through virtue of inheritance and everyone else being slaves with no rights kept ignorant in order to make them docile. That basically brings all progress to a halt because information becomes the exclusive domain of a few people with no incentive to change the status quo.

                    Innovative products are more likely to be bought out for a token amount of money that sounds big but is ultimately a fraction of the ideas worth and shelved by the monopoly holding competitor that is making a bigger profit on a lower quality and less efficient product.
                I disagree that it is impossible to go from nothing to a self made billionaire.
                    Find me someone that did with no outside help, personal favours or loans of money that the average person wouldn't have access to.

                        You might as well just buy bunch of lotteries and hope to win in that case.
                    Reality disagrees with you
            Ryan is what is called an objectivist. Basically, as an objectivist, you pursue your own self interests at the expense of everyone else. Altruism is frowned upon and you’re encouraged to support systems and ideas that fulfill your own happiness. It’s a philosophy developed by Ayn Rand who Ryan is based on and the setting of Bioshock is loosely based on her book Atlas Shrugged. Rapture is basically an objectivist society taken to its extreme logical conclusion.
                >at the expense of everyone else

Just a clarification here (for other users who might be reading this thread). Ayn Rand didn't support killing, hurting or robbing other people. And she supported the existence of a government to guarantee property rights and enforce contracts. So "at the expense of everyone else" doesn't mean an anarchist free for all. It's just a classic laissez faire capitalism.
                    Thanks for the clarification. I didn’t mean to imply that she condoned what you mentioned here.
                        I know you didn't. Just wanted to clarify for OP and any other users.
            The whole point of the game is that ideology doesn't work in a society
            It can be good in theory. But in practice, it can lead to poor people revolting and it can lead to rich people becoming the defacto government, since there is no government to garantee rule of law. Which is what happened in Rapture. As you play the game, you'll see that. So at the very least, taxes and welfare help maintain societal order.

Also, Ryan was right in one thing. Altruism as an ideology can be exploited by a selfish populist who will use the desperate people for his own gain (which also happened in Rapture with Fontaine):

*"Whenever anyone wants others to do their work, they call upon their altruism. "Never mind your own needs," they say, "think of the needs of ..." of ... whoever. Of the state. Of the poor. Of the army. Of the king. Of God. The list goes on and on. How many catastrophes were launched with the words "think of yourself"? It's the "king and country" crowd who light the torch of destruction."*
            He’s not saying the workers should profit… he’s saying the guy who bought the machines and factories should be able to reap endless profits from it with no hindrance and everyone working under him only deserve as much as he says. We can see in our own world how badly that can be abused and why we need laws to protect workers. Rapture was doing pretty well until the riots.
    And anyone who dares suggest they should get a share is deemed a parasite, because they are reaping the benefits of another's sweat instead of working for themselves

Essentially, you get what you earn. And _only_ what you earn.
    He believes that the fruits of a man's labor should be entirely his to enjoy or dispose of as he sees fit.
    Remember, this game is a look at what can happen when that type of thinking is taken to the absolute extreme.
    His name is also an reference to Ayn Rand. Read atlas shrugged for the origin of rapture
    When you say his do you mean Ryan or the man working?
    Yeah
If I had money I would award this comment
Or god (religion)
First off, it’s Marxist socialism vs capitalism. Democracy isn’t really a part of this. And It’s not taxes, but the fact that in capitalism the boss/owner makes more than the workers while putting in less effort sometimes no effort at all (passive ownership). In Marxist socialism, the workers own the means of production and all get an equal cut. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production.

Edit: it’s been a while since I played the game but yeah, in this case taxes are what he’s referring to.
I dont think that democracy is the word you're looking for. But yes, he doesn't want a government taking taxes at all.
“A man builds the parasite asks where is my share?”
Yeah, it also seems pretty telling of Ryan's actual beliefs that the three organizations he cites as "stealing the sweat of the working man's brow" are all linked to helping the poor. Washington? The New Deal. The Vatican? Alms for the poor. Moscow? Wealth redistribution. It seems that it wasn't social injustice, nor the violation of human rights, nor even the evils of the holocaust that Ryan hated. The thing that drove Ryan to the bottom of the sea was the fact that governments around the world seemed to be deciding that the bottom rung of society deserved to not be crushed under the boot of society's wealthy elite, which he just couldn't accept.
💀
> I wouldn’t take my money and give it to the poor, that’s not my responsibility.

But you could if you wanted to.    It would be your choice.

Compelled Faux-Charity should not be forced on to according to Ryans beliefs
When you get into a car accident and we cant find your insurance paperwork we'll just leave you on the side of the road to die just like you want.
First off: the taxes you pay are being used for police, firefighters, roads, etc. so why not use tax money to help people? 

Society is literally better off when there's less homelessness and poverty, allowing people who are born in bad situations to thrive only benefits society and makes a strong economy that's more resistant to crises and has more purchasing power. Wealth is also more equally distributed instead of the majority of wealth going to the top of an ever-shrinking pyramid head, which ironically works like a parasite that leeches the economy dry if unchecked.

What if someone who worked for years has an accident so they can't work anymore? Or if a natural catastrophe hits them so hard they can't realistically go to work for a long while? Or if they're born dirt poor so they have terrible education and have a very slim chance of getting out of the cycle of poverty? It's not only the moral thing to do but it's important for the wellbeing of your society and you benefit from it whether you want to believe it or not.

The mindset that we shouldn't have a socio-economic safety net is ignorant at best if you ask me.

        But that doesn't have anything to do with the sweat of your brow. Andrew Ryan rejects Social Security or anything like it because he wants everyone to provide for themselves regardless of how fair or sustainable it is. That's a different thing from not wanting social security to go to people who only take advantage of it, I think everyone agrees on that.

Note that I don't know how Social Security works in the US.
That’s exactly my thought. It’s Marxist socialism and I think it’s a reference to owning the means of production. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production
    It does sound Marxist in the sense that the worker is entitled to the surplus of their labour and it shouldn't be stolen by the bourgeoisie owner who exploits them, but it's a complete reference to Ayn Rand who was as capitalist and antimarxist as you can get, opposing taxes and social programs because, why someone else should benefit from their labour? But hypocritically living her last days under social welfare and broke. And you can see the influences in the game. A remote society built underwater, far from any government interference, ruled by entrpeneurs and selfish people who feel entitled for everything but didn't know that it was doomed from the start.
    Have you not played the game? On first glance I get why you would make that connection, but if you've played the game you would know that Andrew Ryan is anything but a Marxist or socialist.
        Yeah man, I’ve played the game but that was like 15 years ago by now lmao. It came out in like 2008 right?
            I think 2007, makes more sense if you played it that long ago.
    Except Ryan didn't believe in marxism or "surplus value". From his perspective, a communist government would be stealing from him. Which is why he left Russia.
actually in the marxian theoreticals of that  it is 100% "Welfare"  : where 'the good of all' is what determines what happens to the results of your working efforts.  Whether you want it or not.   It is the very Opposite of what Ryan believes.
>Ryan doesn't think that should apply to the people who toil in Ryan Industries or Fountaine Fisheries for a pittance

In theory, Ryan thinks that if someone is more capable than him, they are free to leave their job and start their own business that will earn more and take more of the market. In practice, yeah, as soon as Frank started doing exactly that, he performed a hostile takeover of his business.
    Well after all, it was the sweat of Ryan’s brow that paid those people to do the hostile takeover, so clearly he’s entitled to Fontaine Futuristics
He says it should belong to the man himself, he is hyper capitalist so pushing the rhetoric that you should be able to work hard and enjoy the fruits of your labour.
    Yes and no. He does encourage entrepreneurial manufacturers whose idea rests on the actual labors of factory workers.

Basically, Ryan (whose name is an anagram of Ayn Rand) is a hyper capitalist who believe in what he calls The Great Chain, which is an ideology he's created according to which the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

Edit: The sweat of his brow quote, therefore, doesn't refer to every man owning the fruit of his labor. Is is an anti-communist rhetoric to denounce governments and market regulations he's felt disappointed by, prompting the creation of Rapture.

If Ryan fundamentally believed that workers owned what their labour creates, he'd be a trade unionist.

(Yes, before you ask, I'm a socialist.)
        To piggyback on this for OP: Basically what Andrew Ryan is saying is actually pro-capitalist rhetoric, ie the capitalists that own the machinery and employs the workers should be able to profit to the fullest extent without governmental interference.
            Well said
            This 👆🏽
        >the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

He sounds a lot like a regular laissez faire free market capitalist

That is, not a "hyper-capitalist" or whatever made-up terms people here are using. Just a regular old cappie
            Don't some capitalists believe in taxes?
                Yeah, it’s literally only laissez-faire not regular capitalism
        Andrew Ryan is an anagram for Ayn Rand Rew
            Thank you. I thought I was going crazy lol
        How old are you?

Just a clarification here (for other users who might be reading this thread). Ayn Rand didn't support killing, hurting or robbing other people. And she supported the existence of a government to guarantee property rights and enforce contracts. So "at the expense of everyone else" doesn't mean an anarchist free for all. It's just a classic laissez faire capitalism.
                Thanks for the clarification. I didn’t mean to imply that she condoned what you mentioned here.
                    I know you didn't. Just wanted to clarify for OP and any other users.
        The whole point of the game is that ideology doesn't work in a society
        It can be good in theory. But in practice, it can lead to poor people revolting and it can lead to rich people becoming the defacto government, since there is no government to garantee rule of law. Which is what happened in Rapture. As you play the game, you'll see that. So at the very least, taxes and welfare help maintain societal order.

Also, Ryan was right in one thing. Altruism as an ideology can be exploited by a selfish populist who will use the desperate people for his own gain (which also happened in Rapture with Fontaine):

*"Whenever anyone wants others to do their work, they call upon their altruism. "Never mind your own needs," they say, "think of the needs of ..." of ... whoever. Of the state. Of the poor. Of the army. Of the king. Of God. The list goes on and on. How many catastrophes were launched with the words "think of yourself"? It's the "king and country" crowd who light the torch of destruction."*
        He’s not saying the workers should profit… he’s saying the guy who bought the machines and factories should be able to reap endless profits from it with no hindrance and everyone working under him only deserve as much as he says. We can see in our own world how badly that can be abused and why we need laws to protect workers. Rapture was doing pretty well until the riots.
And anyone who dares suggest they should get a share is deemed a parasite, because they are reaping the benefits of another's sweat instead of working for themselves

Essentially, you get what you earn. And _only_ what you earn.
He believes that the fruits of a man's labor should be entirely his to enjoy or dispose of as he sees fit.
Remember, this game is a look at what can happen when that type of thinking is taken to the absolute extreme.
His name is also an reference to Ayn Rand. Read atlas shrugged for the origin of rapture
When you say his do you mean Ryan or the man working?
Yeah
[deleted]
    But that doesn't have anything to do with the sweat of your brow. Andrew Ryan rejects Social Security or anything like it because he wants everyone to provide for themselves regardless of how fair or sustainable it is. That's a different thing from not wanting social security to go to people who only take advantage of it, I think everyone agrees on that.

Note that I don't know how Social Security works in the US.
It does sound Marxist in the sense that the worker is entitled to the surplus of their labour and it shouldn't be stolen by the bourgeoisie owner who exploits them, but it's a complete reference to Ayn Rand who was as capitalist and antimarxist as you can get, opposing taxes and social programs because, why someone else should benefit from their labour? But hypocritically living her last days under social welfare and broke. And you can see the influences in the game. A remote society built underwater, far from any government interference, ruled by entrpeneurs and selfish people who feel entitled for everything but didn't know that it was doomed from the start.
Have you not played the game? On first glance I get why you would make that connection, but if you've played the game you would know that Andrew Ryan is anything but a Marxist or socialist.
    Yeah man, I’ve played the game but that was like 15 years ago by now lmao. It came out in like 2008 right?
        I think 2007, makes more sense if you played it that long ago.
Except Ryan didn't believe in marxism or "surplus value". From his perspective, a communist government would be stealing from him. Which is why he left Russia.
Well after all, it was the sweat of Ryan’s brow that paid those people to do the hostile takeover, so clearly he’s entitled to Fontaine Futuristics
Yes and no. He does encourage entrepreneurial manufacturers whose idea rests on the actual labors of factory workers.

Basically, Ryan (whose name is an anagram of Ayn Rand) is a hyper capitalist who believe in what he calls The Great Chain, which is an ideology he's created according to which the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

Edit: The sweat of his brow quote, therefore, doesn't refer to every man owning the fruit of his labor. Is is an anti-communist rhetoric to denounce governments and market regulations he's felt disappointed by, prompting the creation of Rapture.

If Ryan fundamentally believed that workers owned what their labour creates, he'd be a trade unionist.

(Yes, before you ask, I'm a socialist.)
    To piggyback on this for OP: Basically what Andrew Ryan is saying is actually pro-capitalist rhetoric, ie the capitalists that own the machinery and employs the workers should be able to profit to the fullest extent without governmental interference.
        Well said

    >the market is ruled by undefinable laws that one oughtn't touch, letting the market regulate itself. This, he states, is true freedom.

He sounds a lot like a regular laissez faire free market capitalist

That is, not a "hyper-capitalist" or whatever made-up terms people here are using. Just a regular old cappie
        Don't some capitalists believe in taxes?
            Yeah, it’s literally only laissez-faire not regular capitalism
    Andrew Ryan is an anagram for Ayn Rand Rew
        Thank you. I thought I was going crazy lol
    How old are you?
    Holy fk. Never realized Andrew Ryan was a caricature of Ayn Rand till now. Their stories line up a lot, from living in Russia to moving to the US. Her two best known novels are also Foundtainhead (Frank Fontain) and Atlas Shrugged. Just connected the dots on this lmao.
    Lmao imagine being a socialist in the 21th century
        Imagine wanting your taxes to go to things that matter and for rich blowhards to stop hoarding all of the money
            Imagine supporting the most murderous ideology of the 20th century and still thinking you're morally right
                Quite right. Except Capitalism has a much higher death rate...
                    It's almost as if imperialist States start wars and expansion rather than free markets or most as if States produce concentration camps, religious prosecution, censorship, etc. Specially marxist ones
                        The US isn't even free or competitive
                These people need to play bioshock 2 and see how it shows that the opposite side of the coin is just as bad if not worse.
                    Yup, bioshock spares no one in it's message of how utopias are only a figment of human imagination, nor the ancoms, nor the libertarians, or conservatives or socialists are spared of critique along the series
                        Yup, all our systems we’ve ever come up with suck. It’s just about finding the historically least sucky one and going from there.
                    Opportunists abound you always have to be vigilant but democratic socialism is undebatably more moral than unregulated capitalism. We all see the direction the U.S. is headed
                        Well yeah democratic socialism (I am a Canadian so I can’t really dis it) but bioshock 2 doesn’t deal with that. Lamb is still a tyrant, no one voted her in she just started a cult and if you questioned it or went against it you’d be killed. She psychologically manipulated the rapture population that was already down in the dumps because the system they were in sucked big daddy doo doo already.
Hmm, what are most people's opinions about his idea? I find it interesting, not sure if I agree also not sure if I disagree.
    It is the type of thing that sounds good but when you really think about its its the type of rhetoric that the people at the top would tell the people on the bottom so they have the right to work hard with no government support or regulations for whatever low wage they feel like paying you. 

The game goes into this so best to stop asking here before you get a spoiler haha
    As with most ideologies: The core principle is making sense and is not bad in itself. Buuuuuut... as an extreme form of capitalism, it will spiral out of control with those you can fight their way to the top as the ones will all and those who cannot work so hard or so much or that aren't so clever or ruthless at the bottom.

Every ideology needs some kind of limit. At least the human factor will grind it into uselessness, if kept unchecked.
        Also, as with most ideologies, it relies on people to carry it out, as Levine said. Rapture is full of hypocrites, including Ryan, who aren't practicing his ideology really.
        The real problem with capitalism is that if you start off the 'game' with lots of capital, you don't have to work super hard, but if you start off with very little capital, chances are you'll stay poor no matter how hard you work.
            Especially the longer the system runs. If you're rich, you're incentivized by the system to both protect and grow that wealth, which means you want to stamp out the competition. Over generations, this means more and more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and the opportunities for others to acquire wealth evaporate because the rich see that as competition (and therefore a potential threat to their own wealth and "success").
            > chances are

Meaning if one applies oneself that the OTHER chances (also) are they might make use of the mechanism themselves

Meanwhile those who work can get to  have opportunity with additional work made available by the capitalists organized abilities expanding their businesses beyond mere craft guild levels, and the cheaper better products being advanced and produced for all the people via "economy of scale" - so much more made possible via "Capital".

It all goes much further back to the start of civilization when specialization of labor and craft  happened - people moving 'up' from simple farming.  Capitalism is only a tool of that process.

.
    It's really, reeeeeaaaaaally stupid. Almost all of Ryans wealth is made from other people working and while he'll spend hours talking about how he built Rapture, he didn't. Other people built it for him and he, alongside others, continues to exploit them.

Equally he'll tell you how everyone in Rapture starts equal and only advances due to their own work except guess what? Some people start off in a better position because they were rich on the surface and bought their way in which is really obvious looking at Ryan - he isn't ruling Rapture because he's the best at business, he rigged the game in his favour from the start by owning all the required infrastructure.

Ryan also doesn't even believe his own philosophy that much. He claims that if you're smart or strong enough to make an advantage, you should and that's the way of things but once people started hacking shops, leveraging their skills for an advantage, what happens? He starts throwing them in prison.
    It's bullshit; it leans on the false assumption that the richest people are the smartest, most innovative and best at what they do, who are most deserving of their wealth. 

If you need undeniable proof of how false this notion is look at VHS Vs Betamax, or Blue Ray Vs HD Dvd. Both times the inferior product won through crony capitalism where instead of the product standing in the free market for the consumer to choose, the decision was made by backroom exclusivity deals and marketing.

Secondly it leans on the false narrative that anyone can succeed from nothing. There are no self made billionaires (which is the true mark of rich, a million will barely buy you a decent house these days), some inherit generational wealth, some encounter rich people that help them into the circles of the rich and some scam people and commit crimes to get their start. 

Regardless you cannot have a common upbringing and education then be guaranteed a fair shot at becoming rich, you always have to be born with the edge, luck into an edge or cheat into an edge.

Also without limits Capitaliism would eat every up and shit it out as exhausted waste like the great serpent that eats the world then eats itself because it runs out of things to eat leaving nothing behind but death.

Eventually Randism just goes back to being Feudalism with noble families that own and control everything through virtue of inheritance and everyone else being slaves with no rights kept ignorant in order to make them docile. That basically brings all progress to a halt because information becomes the exclusive domain of a few people with no incentive to change the status quo.

And sometimes people just create something that other people want to buy.
            Innovative products are more likely to be bought out for a token amount of money that sounds big but is ultimately a fraction of the ideas worth and shelved by the monopoly holding competitor that is making a bigger profit on a lower quality and less efficient product.
        I disagree that it is impossible to go from nothing to a self made billionaire.
            Find me someone that did with no outside help, personal favours or loans of money that the average person wouldn't have access to.

                    Dude, you need to get a life, go outside, and spend less time on Reddit. The fact that you’re sat, waiting for a stranger on Reddit to respond to you is pathetic honestly.  

I gave my opinion, it’s not my job to provide you with links and examples to back it up.  I simply do not care what you think mate, hate to break it to you.

                        all examples you linked are people who rode on once-in-a-lifetime tech booms  in the 90s when you could be competitive with basic knowledge and not a computer science degree. or industries that hadn't been made such as mail order furniture which is extremely common now. The other decided to sell their soul for oil deals that were funded by the wedding gifts given to them by rich in laws they sold for capital, making their entire narrative "married into money". They all lucked out. The philosophy is no better than socialism, its like pointing to lottery winners and saying "see we have a shot".

            It's not that it's impossible, it's just incredibly rare.
                You might as well just buy bunch of lotteries and hope to win in that case.
            Reality disagrees with you
    Ryan is what is called an objectivist. Basically, as an objectivist, you pursue your own self interests at the expense of everyone else. Altruism is frowned upon and you’re encouraged to support systems and ideas that fulfill your own happiness. It’s a philosophy developed by Ayn Rand who Ryan is based on and the setting of Bioshock is loosely based on her book Atlas Shrugged. Rapture is basically an objectivist society taken to its extreme logical conclusion.

            Yup, bioshock spares no one in it's message of how utopias are only a figment of human imagination, nor the ancoms, nor the libertarians, or conservatives or socialists are spared of critique along the series
                Yup, all our systems we’ve ever come up with suck. It’s just about finding the historically least sucky one and going from there.
            Opportunists abound you always have to be vigilant but democratic socialism is undebatably more moral than unregulated capitalism. We all see the direction the U.S. is headed
                Well yeah democratic socialism (I am a Canadian so I can’t really dis it) but bioshock 2 doesn’t deal with that. Lamb is still a tyrant, no one voted her in she just started a cult and if you questioned it or went against it you’d be killed. She psychologically manipulated the rapture population that was already down in the dumps because the system they were in sucked big daddy doo doo already.
Also, as with most ideologies, it relies on people to carry it out, as Levine said. Rapture is full of hypocrites, including Ryan, who aren't practicing his ideology really.
The real problem with capitalism is that if you start off the 'game' with lots of capital, you don't have to work super hard, but if you start off with very little capital, chances are you'll stay poor no matter how hard you work.
    Especially the longer the system runs. If you're rich, you're incentivized by the system to both protect and grow that wealth, which means you want to stamp out the competition. Over generations, this means more and more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and the opportunities for others to acquire wealth evaporate because the rich see that as competition (and therefore a potential threat to their own wealth and "success").
    > chances are

Meaning if one applies oneself that the OTHER chances (also) are they might make use of the mechanism themselves

Meanwhile those who work can get to  have opportunity with additional work made available by the capitalists organized abilities expanding their businesses beyond mere craft guild levels, and the cheaper better products being advanced and produced for all the people via "economy of scale" - so much more made possible via "Capital".

It all goes much further back to the start of civilization when specialization of labor and craft  happened - people moving 'up' from simple farming.  Capitalism is only a tool of that process.

>Secondly it leans on the false narrative that anyone can succeed from nothing. There are no self made billionaires (which is the true mark of rich, a million will barely buy you a decent house these days), some inherit generational wealth, some encounter rich people that help them into the circles of the rich and some scam people and commit crimes to get their start. 

And sometimes people just create something that other people want to buy.
    Innovative products are more likely to be bought out for a token amount of money that sounds big but is ultimately a fraction of the ideas worth and shelved by the monopoly holding competitor that is making a bigger profit on a lower quality and less efficient product.
I disagree that it is impossible to go from nothing to a self made billionaire.
    Find me someone that did with no outside help, personal favours or loans of money that the average person wouldn't have access to.

            Dude, you need to get a life, go outside, and spend less time on Reddit. The fact that you’re sat, waiting for a stranger on Reddit to respond to you is pathetic honestly.  

I gave my opinion, it’s not my job to provide you with links and examples to back it up.  I simply do not care what you think mate, hate to break it to you. 

Alas, I’ll satisfy your sad existence with an excellent list of self made millionaires who came from nothing -

    It's not that it's impossible, it's just incredibly rare.
        You might as well just buy bunch of lotteries and hope to win in that case.
    Reality disagrees with you
>at the expense of everyone else

Just a clarification here (for other users who might be reading this thread). Ayn Rand didn't support killing, hurting or robbing other people. And she supported the existence of a government to guarantee property rights and enforce contracts. So "at the expense of everyone else" doesn't mean an anarchist free for all. It's just a classic laissez faire capitalism.
    Thanks for the clarification. I didn’t mean to imply that she condoned what you mentioned here.
        I know you didn't. Just wanted to clarify for OP and any other users.
Yeah, it’s literally only laissez-faire not regular capitalism
Imagine supporting the most murderous ideology of the 20th century and still thinking you're morally right
    Quite right. Except Capitalism has a much higher death rate...
        It's almost as if imperialist States start wars and expansion rather than free markets or most as if States produce concentration camps, religious prosecution, censorship, etc. Specially marxist ones
            The US isn't even free or competitive
