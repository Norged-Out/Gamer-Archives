    He's going to be so surprised to find out that Atlas was SHODAN the whole time.
Ladies and gentlemen, we gottem.
Omg. We need updates when he finds out.
Funny that they noticed the "would you kindly" theme, but thinking a Dublin accent is British is even more hilarious.
    That’s not Dublin it’s clearly Ireland smh my head 😤
        Dublin is in Ireland 😑
            What 😳
                Legit the capital of Ireland
                    How
                        Because it is a city that serves as the capital

Britain consists of 3 countries

Northern Ireland-Belfast (Northern Ireland is considered part of the United Kingdom which consists of NI and the British countries

        I love this comment. Shake my head my head haha.
Ahhhh so pure
    So innocent
"It's a surprise tool that will help us later"
I don't think the British or the Irish are going to take to kindly to this
Mmmm aaaaaaah I feel pain reading this as an Irish person atlas is IRISH grrrrrrrr THE ENGLISH ARE POSH PIGS
    I’m English, and I feel for you brother. The accents are VERY different!
        What’s a British accent anyway? English, Scottish, Welsh, various accents. Would an American ask a Scottish person if they were British or just someone speaking southern English?
            Very true. The stereotypical British accent is about as far from my northern accent as you can get. 

I used to work at a tourist place where we got a lot of Americans (and other nationalities of course) come through. And so many were confused as to why I didn’t sound like a cockney.
    I am American but I always find it funny when people call Australian accents British. But Irish accents British? That's not even close!
    Ikr
        [removed]
            ikr
    Im northen English and we just sound Scottish
        Northern English sounding Scottish? No....you don’t?
            sorry you don't sound Scottish! Fae Scottish Quine
    Glad I'm not the only one triggered lol
    Pretty sure they even say that explicitly at the beginning of the game
    Even as a Scottish person being called British is literally pain inducing never mind being Irish and being called British
    was about to say that, but yes, not a good thing to confuse.
Ohhh, this'll be fun
British? sm
    [deleted]
        Geographically part of the British Isle. But Ireland hasn't been British controlled since the 1920's. And go tell an Irishman that he's British? There is a very good chance you will be beaten down and beaten down *hard*. sm
            Irishman here and he's every fucking bit correct on that point. Ireland gained our independence from Britain in 1916 and has been a Republic ever since. Britain retained power over 6 of our 32 counties, hence Northern Ireland was born. While we don't harbour animosity towards England or Britain, we don't take to bring lumped in with them either. Our independence was hard fought and we like it acknowledged. Americans don't have the market cornered on celebrating their independence from Britain.
                [deleted]
                    Sure, you're absolutely correct, and I thought I might get a reply like that in fairness. But I didn't want to get too much into a history lesson on here, my comment was already long enough.
                    Man it was 1937, it was still under british rule after the Anglo-Irish Treaty.
                [deleted]
                    Well aren't you quite the cliché? Where did you get aggression against America in my comment? I'm Simply making the point that the while the world knows  and oddly panders to your independence day, you're not the only country that wants its independence from Britain acknowledged.
                        [deleted]
                            ...Sure.
            Do we actually know Atlas is from the Republic of Ireland and not Northern Ireland? I don't remember that ever being specified.
                The accent makes it very clear, he's not northern
                    Fair enough, I've never been that great at discerning Irish accents.
                        Yeah, if you know the difference between the Northern and Rep. accent, as Lazypigman said there's no question.
                Yep. His Irish accent is *very* specific. Not only is he from the The Republic, he is from Dublin, the capital city.

You could go even further and say he’s from the North side of Dublin.
        This is false
Im so airheaded. I didn’t realize how often he said it until the end! My husband still teases me about that
    Right? I didn't notice until the end. I just thought of him as a very polite man haha
British!!!!! 😡😡😡😡
You got to show us his reaction after >!the twist!<
    [What a Twist](https://media2.giphy.com/media/HtBKcjpHfD7s4/giphy.gif)
how the turn tables
How could you get annoyed at that?
He’s more Irish sounding I thought... at least when you go to find his wife and kid? I mean Patrick and Moira... (shrugs)
Would you kindly share their reaction after things progress?
This brought me an inordinate amount of joy.
He's Irish haha
after the twist tell us his reaction
As an Irish person, the fact that he said Atlas was British hurts my soul
So innocent...
So innocent...
I think he’s supposed to be irish not british
ah yes british, indeed, a man of culture have we here
Boy bout to have his heart broken.
British?
How is atlas british?
Which one is he? Red or green?
He's not BRITISH
Is not one pointing out that he said British accent
Pretty sure he has a republic accent which makes him definitely not British
My sister was SO set on saving Patrick and Moira... That was literally her whole reason to harvest the little sisters, thinking she'd be able to save them if she were evil.
HA
LMAO well good luck to him
It’s actually an Irish accent you piece of sh*t/s
Would you kindly head to Ryan's office, and kill the son of a bitch
    must ressist oh f\*ck he is  dead
    A man chooses, a slave obeys!
This will not age well
Would you Kindly continue playing Bioshock?
your friend caught on quicker than I did.. but without realizing it
Please update
He does not know what's gonna hit him
Buckle up!
That was the biggest throw when I learned the truth. We need updates
Show your friend this post once they’re  done.
So innocent
Oh, you sick and twisted bastard! Let us know how this turns out, you may end up losing a friend over this.
I think the twist is better in Italian 

In that language instead of “would you kindly” he says “per cortesia” at the end of a sentence

This “per cortesia” however is more subtle and munch more used than “would you kindly” in English and as such you don’t really notice how often he uses it
This made me giggle evilly
I felt really dumb when I first played the game. I never noticed how much he said it, and I didn’t even really fully understand the ending until I watched videos about it. It was a great twist, but my dumbass just didn’t realize it haha. Kinda ruined it for myself.
I had no idea he ever said "would you kindly" before that cutscene when I first played it.
Update us when his innocence is shattered
He’s Irish.....
British?
It’s actually an Irish accent you piece of shit

/s
I love how they think Atlas is english and not Irish
Oh boy, he's in for a real nasty surprise. I was also lucky enough to go in blind and didn't even notice how often he says "Would you kindly".
Can you ask him if he'd kindly not look up any spoilers
I'm a bit confused by who's saying what here. So if we used the colors to determine who's speaking, OP first asked about Atlas. OP's friend then says he's alright, then OP says he can be annoying? It makes more sense for OP's friend to say he can be annoying. Either way let's see what happens after the twist, and wait till he plays Burial at Sea.
    Isn't it obvious? The person who's saying more is the op
    yeah, not understanding which is which here either
spoon of disappointment in 3 hours....
Ooooffffff
Let him play bioshock infinite burial at sea part 2 after this
Is he the green or red?
I honestly didn't notice he was saying it because I'm used to people asking me nicely for stuff.... so when "the reveal" happened I had to actually go onto youtube to even see if he ever said that to begin with.
    Same here. I actually didn't notice even on subsequent playthroughs somehow.
Ah thats amazing. I wasnt actually aware he said it so often up until he fell through and told me
Scotty doesn't know..
xD
Photos taken moments before disaster.
Welp, do I have some news for you
would you kindly sort by new
oh boy oh boy...
!remindme 6 days


Well I tried
!remindme 1 day
Hehehehe
‘Code Yellow. I just told your heart to stop beating, but not instantly, the heart is stubborn.’
Any update? Would you kindly tell me If he knows it?
    he knows, but didn’t say anything to warrant any kind of update.
"British"

Pain.
Bioshock 1 and Undetale fucking nailed it with the meta narrative.
Would you kindly go fuck yourself frank Fontaine?
Awe that’s precious....
Well, I suppose that Ireland was once part of the UK, and is technically a part of the British Islands.  
Northern Ireland also exists.  
Can't wait to see his reaction to the reveal.
BRITISH? My boy Irish
 He’s Italian… pretending to be Irish
will do!

    Do we actually know Atlas is from the Republic of Ireland and not Northern Ireland? I don't remember that ever being specified.
        The accent makes it very clear, he's not northern
            Fair enough, I've never been that great at discerning Irish accents.
                Yeah, if you know the difference between the Northern and Rep. accent, as Lazypigman said there's no question.
        Yep. His Irish accent is *very* specific. Not only is he from the The Republic, he is from Dublin, the capital city.

You could go even further and say he’s from the North side of Dublin.
This is false
I too would like an update!

No reaction! He just said something along the lines of “I didn’t see that coming”

Very true. The stereotypical British accent is about as far from my northern accent as you can get. 

I used to work at a tourist place where we got a lot of Americans (and other nationalities of course) come through. And so many were confused as to why I didn’t sound like a cockney.
ikr
sorry you don't sound Scottish! Fae Scottish Quine
Irishman here and he's every fucking bit correct on that point. Ireland gained our independence from Britain in 1916 and has been a Republic ever since. Britain retained power over 6 of our 32 counties, hence Northern Ireland was born. While we don't harbour animosity towards England or Britain, we don't take to bring lumped in with them either. Our independence was hard fought and we like it acknowledged. Americans don't have the market cornered on celebrating their independence from Britain.

        Sure, you're absolutely correct, and I thought I might get a reply like that in fairness. But I didn't want to get too much into a history lesson on here, my comment was already long enough.
        Man it was 1937, it was still under british rule after the Anglo-Irish Treaty.
