[[Did anyone like andrew ryan unrionically]]


I enjoyed and almost admired his character in a way. He came from places where he saw some of the worst in humanity and I can see where he's coming from. I think he's a very cool character and frankly I admire how much he's trying to save his city despite his failures.


Yes. Andrew Ryan is a fine man, and I have it on good authority that he has a very big penis.
    Oh. Wait ignore that
        Google? How do I switch to my alts?
            Hey guys. I'm here to corroborate that Andrew Ryan is indeed well hung.
His uncompromising belief in his personal philosophy is pretty impressive.  It's nice to have an antagonist with such powerful convictions but what's more I really enjoyed him for how deeply flawed he is. As such a greatly enjoyed Andrew Ryan as a character in a larger narrative. 

As far as Andrew Ryan, the person, goes - he's a scum bag.  Probably the single biggest hypocrite in the entire city lol.  Says personal freedom should be valued above all else, but doesn't hesitate to rob citizens of their personal freedom via pheromones.  Once burned a forest of his down because the government tried to turn it into a national park, but was more than happy to "nationalize" Fontaine Futuristics (but we all know he basically pocketed the company for his own private gain), and he broke one of Rapture's very few laws when he beat his lover to death with a pipe.  Oh and it's hard to take a guy who proclaims to believe that Government shouldn't interview in the private affairs of others when he has his own personal, secret police force + prison and steps all over religious freedom by barring religious texts (that's like telling someone they're free to drive after you've just banned all cars).

He may have claimed he wanted to save Rapture but his actions tell a very different story.  Not to say he is anywhere is as bad as Hitler, post-fall mindset really reminds of me Hitler's as Berlin was falling - this belief that if they do not pull through this ordeal then they do not deserve to exist. Below is one of his final speeches from April 22nd, 1945 given to some of his remaining officers.

>“Everyone has lied to me, everyone has deceived me, no one has told me the truth. The armed forces have lied to me and now the SS has left me in the lurch. The German people have not fought heroically. It deserves to perish,” Hitler had said according to the report.

>“It is not I who have lost the war, but the German people,” he had said.

I find Ryan's mentality near the end to be very similar - "It's not my "Great Chain" philosophy, inability to take into account human nature, or my refusal to adapt/compromise that damned Rapture! It's all the fault of the citizens (who happen to be trapped in the flawed system of my own design)!"  Sure, the advent of ADAM threw him a real curveball, but I think it's disingenuous to act as if there was no way he could have seen this coming.  The writing was one the wall and if he didn't see the truth it wasn't because it was hidden from him, but rather because he didn't want to confront such an inconvenient reality.  He had ample time to react and yet his ego wouldn't allow him to compromise or admit that maybe his core belief wasn't as perfect as he thought it was.
    >Sure, the advent of ADAM threw him a real curveball, but I think it's disingenuous to act as if there was no way he could have seen this coming. The writing was one the wall

I agree. ADAM for sure amplified the speed and severity of Rapture's fall but it would have happened anyway.
    That is an interesting comparison and I don't think you are wrong. What I cannot understand how people don't see what kind of person Ryan was. He murdered his girlfriend, set up a system that brain \*\*\*\*\*ed people and slaughtered little girls. How can anyone really LIKE him? sm
    He did admit that he betrayed his own philosophy tho.
    Agree
    Totally agree, it's his conviction to a completely flawed ideal that made him such a great antagonist / narrator or I actually don't know how to define him in the game
I admired him as a villain. He was smooth and smart a self made man very suave. I would love to see a really good actor play him I'm a movie.
    I actually love the actor who played qaurk thr ferengi from deep space nine they're like this race of greedy alien with the rule sof acquisition. Its funny as hell.
        I want a really charismatic actor who looks real good in a tailored suit. One that can play a real good monster. I want to really love his character and rooy for him until he eventually snaps like I did in the game.

                    I just know I'd pay good money to see a Sander Cohen spin-off movie/TV series with Johnny Depp - he feels like such a perfect cast.
                        yes thats also a perfect choice. their voices sounds similar for some reason
He's the reason Rapture failed. Everything he did to "save Rapture" either was really for his own personal benefit or made things worse in general in the City. Ryan was a murder, a tyrant and a slaver. sm
I liked him in the beginning. I kind of get the idea that he went though hardship and doesn't want the fruits of his labour taken away from him. Also rewarding honest characters like McDonagh was good. 

But later he goes against his own principles and becomes the very thing he swore to destroy, which is basically being a ruler, a dictator of rapture. 
So I don't like him in the end.
No, cuz I’m not a fucking sociopath.
If it wasn't for him the city we know and love would've never came to fruition. I liked and can understand Andrew Ryan, circa, maybe, 1952 and earlier? You build an empire of wealth and power coming from absolutely nothing, and every other power that be either trying to control or destroy what you've earned and worked towards? No, absolutely not.

Now, would my reaction to the U. S. Government have been to burn the woods I own to the ground so they couldn't have it and create a secret underwater city in the North Atlantic? Maybe not. But I can get where he's coming from.

It's following the cities creation and the Golden Age where my relating to him part ways. His realization that no matter where he goes, there will always be those that challenge the status quo and his power is where the ugliest of his sides emerge and become exacerbated. He wants to silence those that oppose him. But, in doing so, will also punish and harm good people and citizens. And by this point he either just didn't care or was able to somehow rationalize all of his actions.
    >Now, would my reaction to the U. S. Government have been to burn the woods I own to the ground so they couldn't have it and create a secret underwater city in the North Atlantic? Maybe not. 

Ryan burning down that forest (which under US law he would have been compensated for) is really just a large scale version of flipping over the table when you loose a game of chess. Something sore losers' and children do. sm
"My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasite doesn't understand.. a season for all things. A time to live and a time to die. A time to build and a time to destroy."
He's classy and good with words, doesn't mean jack shit tho.

PS: Pun not intended
Andrew Ryan starts out a genuinely good, if somewhat eccentric, guy and Rapture thrived for a while because of him, but as malefactors caused stress on Rapture he abandoned his principles and became the kind of tyrant he fled.

That's why he has Jack kill him, he's screwed anyway so he decides to go out on his own terms instead of remaining tyrant of a dead city; he does what he would have once done and burns the forest so to speak.
Consider that most of what you know of Ryan is biased opinion from his detractors (many likely ADAM-Addled)  in Audio Diaries, and words from Fontaine/Atlas who has to get Jack to hate Ryan enough to assassinate him (and Fontaine later admits so much of what he said was lies).      The only real 'fact'  in audio diaries is that someone said what is heard recorded, and NOT 'fact' because what the person says need not actually be truth).  

SO Much of what really happened  is kept vague in this game (and there is no authoratative narrator).

The writers manipulated what you saw/heard  (even with sad mood music at the fake-blown-up-family scene) to drive their plot.  They got YOU to unknowingly assist the stories real villain.

The writers presented the whole thing as if the people there in Rapture  'at that time' thought like they do today.  Most, in that era, did not and certainly NOT the ones who went to Rapture.   

The truth is that Ryan was a builder/achiever who created Rapture to preserve humanity against the likely destruction of the Surface World, and it was the 'Bio' 'Shock' of ADAM pushed by a sociopath parasite who intentionally destroyed Rapture.

.
    Agreed, I got the impression that it was mainly Fontaine and ADAM to blame
    THIS. Especially after reading the books. Everyone here is quick to say it’s Ryan who brought about Raptures downfall but I think the shoe is on the other foot for the most part. Yes he certainly contributed but there was instigation at every turn which only resulted in crazier and more overreaching behavior on Ryans part.
        Ryan had to react with 'War Measures'  to try to save Rapture - adding all the security devices, lockdowns, Pheromone Control of the Murderously Insane Splicers to nullify Atlas's maniacs, etc...  In the first 2 games we only see Rapture AFTER all the fighting/terrorism  has wrecked the place.   

It is possible that what we see (in BS1) is also the worst parts   because Atlas has to bring Jack to Ryan, and it would be logical that path bypasses where Ryan still has real control (and where many survivors likely are more secure/normal surroundings  and are busy doing things to stay alive AND are ready to defend themselves en masse).

BS2 you have Sofia Lamb in charge (in the area we see in-game) for ~7 years of further deterioration and neglect.  

.
        Books? I’m only aware of one. Are there more than one?
He is one bad ass mofo. How can you not like him
Mmm... no, not really. He's a murderer and a hypocrite.
his character is admirable but hes an ancap so hes an idiot lol

edit: to the person who downvoted me; thats literally *why* rapture failed. it wasnt just ryan, it was the ideological foundation on which rapture was built. capitalism cannot exist without a state to support it, unlike socialism. history has shown us that and its really funny lol
Absolutely, fucking love him
Yes, I agreed with him on everything and was delighted to find out that he was based on an actual person named Ayn Rand. It was through Bioshock that I was introduced to the philosophy of Objectivism and couldn’t be happier. The story leaves the events behind what happened vague and we only get bits and pieces from audio logs from people who would have been biased towards one side or the other. You were manipulated into working for Fontaine and that makes me think that you were also misled on a lot of things that were told to you about Ryan.
    Fuck objectivism. It has the basis that socially, everyone is equal. Wrong, those with wealthy background automatically have a one-up on most people. 

Not a fan of demonizing the poor too.
Did updoot tho because you’re based as fuck
I felt the same way. I agree with a lot of his ideology. It's the way he implemented it that was the problem. It's like Communism on paper is great, but greed always gets in the way and ruins it's success.

Edit*  Downvotes for what? The truth? Damn parasites.
    I mean if you'll try to say it rly simply one man built a city and another destroyed it (Fontaine). His ideology is weak on practice tho. If not Fontaine then Lamb if not Lamb then  there'd find someone to exploit difference between wealthy and poor.
I definitely think he has admirable qualities. Much like Mr. House
Before reading Bioshock: Rapture, I liked his character. Not necessarily his philosophy, but just his character in general. However after reading the book, I hated him. Him and Fontaine are the ones who fucked Rapture. He ignored everything, focusing solely on taking down Frank. In the end, it cost him.
the Philosophie is obviously a caricatur and over the top but has a really cool premisse. He failed though when He used state Power to interfere in the market and seized Fontaine futuristics. Then He used state Propaganda to lie to the people. He became the very Thing He Set Out to destroy
    Sadly his philosophy isn't a caricature, it's exactly what a lot of mentally challenged people believe. Ayn Rand is beloved by a lot of people.

Unfortunately, Argentina just got a president who's bought into the ideology, watch the country's death spiral.
        This is a 2 year old tread you tried to just bring modern politics into lol
            I mean it was a thing two years ago as well, lol, just not Argentina specifically.
                Than you should have tried to start your Argument about if a Video game about an under water City may be an over-the-top portrail of Its premise or not at that time lol. No need to revive a comment nobody except the 2 of us will ever see
                    Plenty of people were advocating for Objectivism at the time though? Like i said, Ayn Rand had a massive following.

the underwater city was even technically possible, if one was rich enough they could have done it with the technology of the time. but *none* of that has to do with Andrew Ryan's ideology now does it? It was simply a means to an end.

Rapture being underwater wasn't Ryan's dream, it was simply the only way he could have complete isolation from the outside world for his actual dream, which was objectivism (Anarcho-capitalism by another name) plain and simple.
                        "the underwater City has nothing to do with ryans ideology" the takes you see on reddit never fail to amaze.
Pls point me to the ayn rand quote that says anarcho capitalizm needs complete Isolation from the outside World if you want to prove that the ideology in bioshock is not an over the top caricature lol
                            Her retarded ideology ran on the assumption that was the natural state of the world, so isolation is hardly necessary, but Andrew Ryan wanted to ensure his project wouldn't be "corrupted" by the massive influence of democracy, communism, or religion.

again, the isolation was the means, not the ends. He wanted his experiment to be "pure", and while that's obviously motivated by his ideology, it's not the ideology itself.
He's my all time favorite video game character
Oh. Wait ignore that

Rapture being underwater wasn't Ryan's dream, it was simply the only way he could have complete isolation from the outside world for his actual dream, which was objectivism (Anarcho-capitalism by another name) plain and simple.
    "the underwater City has nothing to do with ryans ideology" the takes you see on reddit never fail to amaze.
Pls point me to the ayn rand quote that says anarcho capitalizm needs complete Isolation from the outside World if you want to prove that the ideology in bioshock is not an over the top caricature lol
        Her retarded ideology ran on the assumption that was the natural state of the world, so isolation is hardly necessary, but Andrew Ryan wanted to ensure his project wouldn't be "corrupted" by the massive influence of democracy, communism, or religion.

again, the isolation was the means, not the ends. He wanted his experiment to be "pure", and while that's obviously motivated by his ideology, it's not the ideology itself.
yes thats also a perfect choice. their voices sounds similar for some reason
