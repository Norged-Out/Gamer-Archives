[[Why Rapture Failed]]


1) Autarky

Economist's overwhelming agree that an open economy that trades with other nations is more efficient than a closed economy. To be fair, rapture does trade but in order to keep their city secret they have to tightly regulate any contact with the outside world. This will lead to a higher prices, and a lower standard of living; when you combine this with the ban on religious texts it creates a perfect environment for smugglers and corruption.

2) Educated but maligned political class given no means of political participation

Rapture only recruited highly educated, ambitious, and successful people; yet their society .is highly stratified. Countries can survive high income inequality if the lower class lacks education; as they won't have the ability and knowledge to revolt (although it's inefficient) but if they have it then that nation is a powder keg.

Rapture lacks any form of democratic process they could use to address their grievances, and when the common man is denied the ballot he usually picks the brick.

Blair mountain is a pretty good example of this.

3) Housing prices

Can you imagine how expensive it is to build an apartment building under the sea? I shudder to think of the rent.

4) No party able to regulate the private market.

Another problem with Rapture is that there really isn't a government; as Ryan is involved in the free market himself. Instead of taxes; he uses the profit from his business.

There's  several problems with that. One is if he has a bad year; then who's going to pay for police, fireman, plumbers etc? I find the idea of Rapture getting foreign loans difficult. The second would be that he has a strong incentive to use government authority to hurt his competition, which will inevitably lead to a monopoly.

Finally, it means no one will help with a tragedy of the commons situation; such as drug treatment.

5) Cultural bias towards lower class, lack of technology
 
A highly educated society like the United States usually automates menial tasks, as it's workers could be productive if they were doing other things. Rapture; presumably because of apathy; doesn't. Combined with point two and one this also means that there ability to produce valuable services for other nations is limited.

Raptures disdain for the lower class is probably most destructive when it comes to plumbing; as it is by far the most important job in the city, but it's treated like being a Walmart cashier. That's a recipe for disaster.

6) Lack of a private army/effective law enforcement

The certainly had security but it was very weak; and stood no chance at holding back this storm. This was after WW2; combat veterans are everywhere.


Also, please correct me if I'm wrong, but Ryan wanted to make a utopia for rich capitalists. For the people who didn't want to give their money to social services. 

So there is a fundamental problem when you have this utopia full of people who look down on 'the poor dreges of society' and then there is noone to do menial labor. 

And I don't know about you but in a room full of Elon Musk's, Steve Job's and Donald Trump's exactly 0 of them are going to be willing to clean toilets or the many, many glass hallways. 

I'm not saying to enforce class rules. But the culture and people that made Rapture is a problem. Its like trying to build a tower with no structure or foundation.
    The US has this problem now and I don't think we've quite solved it. But one of the ways to mitigate it is to automate most of the menial jobs. Of course that's harder when you can only export limited amounts of goods and no services outside.

Come to think of it; one of the ways to combat that is to raise wages for those jobs; but I can see Ryan not allowing it; and if you can't export you're still wasting labor.
        Yes! Automation is key. This I think was the ultimate goal of the Big Daddy. Their original purpose was maintainence of Rapture, obviously they can go outside and fix the buildings under the pressure of the water. Until the plasmids when they were repurposed for little sister protection. 

They also don't have much brain function thanks to the experiments, they have a task to do and for the most part they do it till they die. For all intents and purposes they're robots.

I think, had Rapture not failed, there would have been multiple different classes of big daddy, some for janitorial duties, cleaning etc. All the 'meanial labour' would have been taken care of by them.
            That being the case, where are you gonna get the man in the suit?

The problem is the assumption that menial labor is unskilled labor, which it most certainly isn't.  As OP pointed out, plumbing and HVAC are the most important jobs in Rapture.
                I agree, they definitely aren't unskilled.  It's the culture of Rapture. The jobs aren't unskilled the people don't *value* them. Or at the very least don't appreciate the workers that do them

Getting the body is the unethical part of it. I had always assumed that the body in the suit was a reanimated cadaver or a person coerced or purchased - think criminals, homeless people or human trafficking victims - and then experimented upon. They are literally part of the suit after all.

Once they are a part of the suit, with the tech in Rapture it's not unreasonable that the skills could be 'programmed' into the body. Like Dr. Yi Schong and Sinclair working together on a plasmid, but instead of shooting fire from your fingers, it tells you how to repair fissures in metal.
            There were literal robotic little sisters in Minerva's Den, though Rapture fell before they entered use.
    That's why Ryan shouldn't reject regulations and social welfare. Without these things, the real villain Fontaine was able to create the drug Adam and rile up the poor
        Correct. But rejection of these concepts was what Rapture was founded upon. "Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? No says the man in Washington [your money] is for the poor. I rejected those answers and chose Rapture" - Andrew Ryan

If Rapture was made with social welfare and regulations it would not be rapture
            But it will survive with the power of moderation. Bioshock basically give us a look at an extremist's society and shows us how to fix it
                But whose moderation? On what side? Rapture was founded with Laissez-faire ideals. A free market and minimal if any government involvement. 

People were drawn there by that concept. 

If Andrew Ryan began enforcing taxes for social services he would be no better than the government he created Rapture to escape. Those not on Sinclair's side would revolt, calling Ryan a hypocrite. 

Who defines what is moderation? In a democratic society, it is individuals that (should) represent our views and values. But in a society with no government, in a truely free market, *any* taxes are too much. 

If one tried to build Rapture 2.0 with social services implemented from the beginning, you wouldn't attract the same people. Because those people do not want to give their money to social services..

It's why [in reality] the obscenely rich spend so much time and money looking for loopholes to avoid taxes.
                    Laissez-faire is a bit too extreme, how about just good old regular capitalism with regulations and social welfare and all that. And of course objectivist people can still enjoy reaping the reward of their work with a bit of their wealth given away to ensure a stable society, without parasite like Fontaine going around creating drugs and riling up the poor.
One must not underestimate the power of moderation,  it's what ensure the most stability for most society
                        >	 without parasite like Fontaine

Fontaine is many, many things, but he is *not* a parasite. That very fact is part of the reason why Ryan’s philosophy is so poor.
                            Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that. Ryan just didn't account for the fact that parasites can be quite capable in what they do.
Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city
                                >	Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that.

Fontaine funded Tenenbaum’s research and brough Suchong on board to help with the project. He is responsible for marketing and making it a success. Fontaine’s role is no different than, say, Ryan’s role in constructing Rapture or Sinclair’s role in running Persephone. 

>	Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city

…I’d hardly call Fontaine’s role in Jack or the Civil War “leeching.”
                                    Like I said, Ryan just didn't realize that parasites can be quite capable in their own right. In the end, Fontaine is the person who tried to steal the city. So who is the parasite here?
And who did the fighting in the civil war? You don't see Atlas personally go to Ryan's room and club him in the head, do you? And it's not like Fontaine create this whole war to take back the city for the proletariat. No he ditched his army in the end, just to steal the whole city for himself.
Well reasoned. Brace yourself for the Andrew Ryan fanboys.
    How are there unironic Andrew stans? Have they just not played the game? I don’t see how you could get like 5 seconds into the game and not realise that he’s an incompetent asshole and the fall of rapture was all his fault.
        >	How are there unironic Andrew stans? Have they just not played the game? I don’t see how you could get like 5 seconds into the game and not realise that he’s an incompetent asshole and the fall of rapture was all his fault.

There’s one such fanboy here already, u/Premer777. These types willfully ignore the evidence provided in game in order to beat the drum of their own head canon: everything was great until ~~the Fire Nation attacked~~ Fontaine rolled into town. 

Just look at the kind of language they use. They call [Fontaine a terroist ](https://reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/uaa8vi/_/i5xm7yn/?context=1)and compare Andrew Ryan’s policies to the US Constitution. 

It’s delusional. Which, given the of the rest of their posting history, is right on brand.
            It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

Is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?
                >	It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Not really. Rapture was built hotly on the heels of World War II. Historically World War II results in large pro-government sentiments for the Allied nations. Obviously not everyone in Rapture is from the US, but a significant portion is. 

>	Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

At the beginning, yes. Once the Civil War breaks out, not so much. I’ve only ever heard the Ryan fan boys call it terrorism. 

>	is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?

Not at all. I’m just sick and tired of certain people trying to pretend everything was fine and dandy in Rapture until 1958. It was a shit hole from the very beginning.
                    government interference in people lives and in business was a huge issue for very many people 

pro government feeling for one thing quickly goes away fast enough when things are to return to normal

yes terrorism when you have whats labeled rebels wandering the streets killing people and disrupting their livelihood and threatening sustenance with a rebel egging that destruction and mayhem on.  mcdonagh talked about how people had to use adam to protect theirs from such actions

thats not public discourse its  threatening peoples survival 

you perhaps are sick and tired of others  who hold  contrary viewa and cant face the possibility you do not understand things as well as you think

your labeling such peop'e fanbois is rather strange when perhaps its more you who more fitting to that label

fine and dandy is the way you interpret it, but like any society rapture had problems when were being handled until it was blown apart when adam overwhelmed the various society's solution and fontaine instigated his terrible deeds to use the people he had poisoned
                        At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

Much like u/Premer777, I will be blocking you as well. Hope you eventually actually learn about Bioshock and "how the world worked back then." Feel free to  edit whatever nasty comment you'd like in your post as a rebuttal. Shouting into the void is a great emotional exercise.
                            uh, no  

you seem fairly certain of some kind of persecution here

it is not an original dodge for a discussion at hand

neither is user blocking being used to avoid discussion
        Libertarians.
        There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven't played the game since you didn't recognize Fontaine is the real villain
            >	There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven’t played the game since you didn’t recognize Fontaine is the real villain

Ugh, it’s you again. There are two villains. Andrew Ryan is just as much the “real villain” as Fontaine.
                If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn't pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point
                    >	If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn’t pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point

Putting aside that poor critical thinking for a moment, the finale Fontaine section was shoe horned in because the publishers felt a boss fight was required to cap off the game. The post-Ryab levels were rushed through, the writing dips in quality, and the final fight against Fontaine is laughable. 

The tacked on nature of the finale is well known.
                        That explains why the final boss was such a corny fight. It’s basically Bane-Joker from Arkham Asylum
                        Levine has often stated that he hated the "Boss fight" at the end of BS. sm
                    Doesn’t mean he thinks they have a good point.
                        He does. Go search "Ken Levine on Objectivism", you will see Levine finds Ayn Rand's philosophy interesting and lateral thinking
                            That kind of supports why all his employees think he’s an ass.
                            In that interview he claims that objectivism failed because of ryan. He doesn’t endorse it or put it down but explains that Ryan is the reason rapture failed. So yes Ryan is one of the intended villains
                                Then you should look for another one where he said: "It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity"
                                    That’s the interview I’m talking about. Your missing the point. His point was that even if Ryan has the best of intentions. He’s a flawed human being with humanity. Rapture was always doomed to fail.
An Anarcho-Capitalism Utopia can only go so far.
Also magical drugs. Those helped a bit. Or at least they helped accelerate things
    >	Also magical drugs. Those helped a bit. Or at least they helped accelerate things

Andrew Ryan had several opportunities to step in to mitigate or prevent the Adam issue. He initially specifically chose to do nothing. Later, when he controlled the sole significant supply, he ramped up the production of Little Sisters and Big Daddys. 

Rapture’s beginning and end sits firmly with Andrew Ryan. Fontaine, like so many others, are a symptom of Ryan’s philosophy.

Edit: Spelling
        well put. I can't understand why more people don't see this. sm
            >	well put. I can’t understand why more people don’t see this. sm

I believe it’s because they specifically choose to *not* see it. 

Bioshock 1 and 2 positively pounds you over the head with how bad Ryan is.
        That’s why Fontaine moved there in the first place
    It's a problem but not an insurmountable one. The only times I can think of a drug problem crippling a society is when another country keeps pumping it in; like China and Opium or the Native Americans and alcohol. 

If they had competent law enforcement and a treatment program instead of just ignoring it ADAM would probably have been manageable.
        In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.  

Rapture Free Press (with all its competition) should have fully exposed those effects and scared the shit out of anyone wanting to use ADAM (Think headlines screamin ***ADAM=CANCER !!! *** .   Convenient to the story : that exposure was not allowed to happen as the gamewriters had to rig the events and crisis that a shooter game requires.

Competent law enforcement was overwhelmed.   Imagine the same happening  in our society just as easily .

.
            >	In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.

There is no indication at all these side effects were “delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.” In anything, the audio diary “[The Market is Patient](https://youtu.be/BjDVTFH3p4A)” indicates the side effects happened towards the beginning of Plasmids being rolled out:
>	There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this Plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too.

“Free Press” means not subjected to government review. It has nothing to do with the quality of the press. *Everyone* in Rapture was cutting corners to turn a better profit. That includes papers. That includes reporters or editors being bribed into silence. There’s a hundred plausible reasons for why a paper wouldn’t report on it. 

But sure. Chalk it up to shoddy writing with your Ryan colored glasses. Why are you even in r/Bioshock if you hate the writing so much?

Edit: u/novavegasxiii
                uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press
                    Without regulation the oligarchs buy the newspapers and effectively control them, then silence any attempt to spread the news. The only way a newspaper would run it is in a proxy conflict between the oligarchs, which is self-defeating to the concept of an oligarch so it doesn't happen. 

See: Russia
                        without regulation anyone in rapture could start a newspaper and with the technologies demonstrated in rapture it did not take as big an organization to do so

with a massive police state and missing understanding of freedom then such oligarchs get away with it and they are cronies of the government types who take their payoffs

rapture if you might notice was largely missing the government component of you supposition
                    >	uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press

That’s because the press, minus a few notable reporters or events, is mostly ineffective. Either the audience doesn’t care, or else the reporters downplay/don’t cover specific stories. 

It’s vitally important to maintain a free press to try and catch those Watergate moments but…for every Watergate that’s published, there’s 10 more which are ignored for a variety of reasons.
                        you really know little about the function of the free press in history and only assume it all would be nullified in rapture

you dont get it that it just takes one exposure to change things a great deal and you automatically assume that could never happen

little children being enslaved and turned to mutants and abused would have been enough to end fontaine virtually instantly

same with exposing the smuggling or the way fontaine criminally coerced his control of the fisheries
    magical drugs which only seem to exhibit themselves massively when ryan was running the adam

the story minimizes adams bad effects before the mere months when ryan had control before war descended on Rapture
Yep, it could be argued no peaceful way to solve differences and weakness of law enforcement (in any normal society, Fontaine would have been in prison long ago) helped to cause the collapse of Rapture, even without ADAM.
This isn't to offend anyone given that i do consider myself as a person with below average intelligence,

Rapture failed because of the idea that if everyone is smart, sophisticated and perfect.... Well then no one really is? But that constant clash of ideals cannot exist if someone who wants it yet resists it as well puts it into play, Andrew Ryan could not survive without the opposition and i think that's an aspect of his character that is not glossed on enough, i believe that he recognised that power that both sofia and fontaine were capable of possessing when it came to appeasing both themselves and the peoppe of rapture, they were both people who thought of themselves as flawless in a sense and believed that their ideas were as flawless as they were and when everyone has the mindset of being the very best it causes friction, that's why society as a whole has and always will be "flawled" in the sense that it is simply impossible to live somewhere or create any progress that would mean anything if everyone was superior, society has those who are less and those who are more and while it's not for anyone in particular decide there are those lile ryan who believed it to be the case, they thought that they were of a certain level and that's what drove their aspirations and their motives and with everyone trying to one up eachother... As I've repeated many times already.... There is no way to evolve
    Can you rephrase that? I'm having a hard time following you without periods or carriage returns to separate your sentences
To the last one I agree. The only sort of police I could think of is the Big Daddy’s and they are mainly used for utility, repairs and preventing subs from getting to close. If WW2 war heros were chosen as people to go to Rapture they could help make a legal government law enforcement to regulate stuff. That could be a reason Colombia lasted longer, it had a legal system in place to prevent anarchy
    He did have a police force (I remember he hired an ex cop or PI from Brooklyn) the problem is they were way too underfunded and spread thin to effectively control the city. At the bare minimum he should have had a cadre of foreign body guards.
        Yeah, plus they needed to have some sort of proper law enforcement with some proper funding. Plus while they were highly advanced for the scientific fields at the time, adam is highly addictive substance so while it assisted life for some with minor things(like lighting a cigar or repairing things with electricity) it should have been properly managed like the drug it is. Probably only give it to those in certain industries and heavily regulate the flow of Adam to only a small amount per person
            Come to think of it; it would have been a very good idea to hire former Russians, Poles, ang Eastern Europeans as his personal body guards; as they are the most likely to sympathetize with his ideology.

Come to think of it; I wonder how many people went to Rapture instead of Israel in this universe?
                Hmmm… not sure. What were Raptures requirements for being invited in, that would be a part.
Because Ken Levine does not think highly of objectivism. Also because underwater habitats are high maintenance, fragile, and reliant on efficient resource use/reuse. It is an environment which, like space colonies, depends on a high level of cooperation and thus social trust. 

Probably early space colonies will need to be autocratic to survive. You cannot let people be homeless on Mars as everybody needs air and water, there is limited livable habitat volume, you can't let people have guns for obvious reasons, you can't let people do drugs and so on. Likewise with Rapture.
because libertarianism. There, that's the Cliff notes version.
    Funny, because the game creator Levine has some libertarian leaning. But he's still believes that going moderate is more important for the stability of society
This is why I love this community, where we can disregard Bioshock as fiction and have a debate on its intricacies as though it were in real life 🐋
This was an excellent review and really highlights how even above ground countries find themselves ready to cave in, let alone an isolated city at the bottom of the ocean. Well done!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Andrew Ryan= Ayn Rand

The entire game is mocking her writings like Atlas Shrugged
This is so clear and easy to understand, thank you!
*Fun fact: I'm so dumb I didn't realize Andrew Ryan was a partial anagram of Ayn Rand until after we shipped. But our intent was certainly to discuss Rand, but more specifically, the nature of rigid ideologues.*

No, it's because it would have made for a boring game if it wasn't all spooky and fucked up.
Well yes, the 2 main problems of Rapture is that the city has no regulations and social welfare. Without them, the real villain Fontaine was able to create the drug Adam and rile up the poor. Now if only Ryan bring back those 2 things
Only part I disagree with is the part about Andrew Ryan, the rest is pretty spot on. Andrew wouldn't have torn down other companies to make a monopoly, he didn't believe in doing that kind of thing. He believed in a fair market.
    I thought about that. His belief in free markets is genuine but when push came to shove he nationalized Fontaine, and he wasn't above violating the free speech or no ethics allowed in science rule.. 

I have no doubt he would do more if he was pushed.
        ryan had to run that company to make adam for the destabilizing addicts 

there were also medical uses for adam

control was needed to keep adam in production  and then the civil war started a few months later when  adam was loudly called for in the populace to protect people from the terrorist types led by atlas

when ryan 'seized' Fontaine Futuristic, more crimes were discovered infinding the enslaved children

there also may have been the issue of restitution for fontaines victims which part of his assets was the fontaine futuristics company
    > Andrew wouldn't have torn down other companies to make a monopoly, he didn't believe in doing that kind of thing

But he did.  How do you think Fontaine Futuristics became Ryan Industries?
        It's because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation
            >	It’s because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation

Wait. Is your arguement really that Ryan killed Fontaine due to “perverting the free market” and then to correct it, Ryan created a monopoly?
                Was it a perverted monopoly though?
                    >	Was it a perverted monopoly though?

…Are you really asking if production of Adam, Little Sisters, Big Daddys, and Plasmids was perverted? 

Yes. The answer is yes.
    >	Only part I disagree with is the part about Andrew Ryan, the rest is pretty spot on. Andrew wouldn’t have torn down other companies to make a monopoly, he didn’t believe in doing that kind of thing. He believed in a fair market.

Except Ryan did that. After Fontaine died, nominally at the hands of Andrew Ryan, Ryan claimed all of Fontaine’s holdings for Ryan Industries.
        someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem
            >	someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

Or you could dismantle it entirely and shut it down? That seems like the logical choice. 

>	nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later

…you really think Ryan was going to only temporarily hold onto the most lucrative industry in Rapture? 

>	 and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem

If that was true, Ryan would have handed it out for free by the bucket. Don’t fool yourself. Like so many other things, Ryan was in it just for the money.
                >dismantle it entirely and shut it down

dismantle it when there is the medical use.   the hints we saw about significant cures would be something to lose.

ryan probably had to reorganize the futuristics company after extracting the co-criminals fontaine had employed and whatever mess fontaine had left on his persona change

ryan did not have much time anyway with little over three months before the terrorism started and with all the activities investigating and cleaning out fontaines criminal activities

>going to only temporarily hold

with increasing evidence of violent insanity from going cold turkey and all the addicted people ryan may have needed the same tech organization to try to find a cure  and only then get rid of the source of the trouble.    ryan did not need more insane people.

>would have handed it out for free by the bucket

except the futuristics company was disrupted when fontaine died and there already were shortages as mcdonagh says in audio diaries.   Rapture did not have a large police force to handle the eterrorism and with citizens clamouring for adam plasmids to protect themselves there was no other solution in that emergfency

>fool

maybe you should not fool yourself into thinking ryan didnt care.   he never had to build rapture in the first place to try to preserve a society he believed in and a refuge from the parasites he saw as likely destroying the surface world
                    At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

>ban on religious texts

those shown were Smuggled In - contraband brought in while committing the crime of Smuggling after the city was isolated so that its self-dependency could be facilitated.

Ryan in BS2 says he doesn't care if people worship.

Ryan was more interested in religion not gaining power over the individual - much like the US Constitution has the provisions to NOT allow the formation of a State Religion in America.

>Rapture only recruited highly educated, ambitious, and successful people

if so, then they WOULD be the people who would adapt to the environment and utilize the various freedoms Rapture provided.

With minimal government participating IN Society was the direct path versus political machinations.

>Housing prices

Built with Ryan and others money, and using economy of scale.  the construction was completed halfway thru the timeline up to the time Rapture started falling apart because of the terrorist Fontaine created

>No party able to regulate the private market

No party able to impede the private market either ?

Ryan did not seem to interfere with his story built up rival Fontaine - until Fontaine showed himself a criminal working against Rapture's survival

>Cultural bias towards lower class, lack of technology

Rapture was  a far more technological society than on the surface, and with the city newly built with such accouterments.     Most sane societies have a bias towards middle class as in encouraging people not to be parasites upon the rest.   Consider how many 'poor' in Rapture's story  were due to being ADAM-Addled and debilitated by their own choices.  The majority would be 'Go Getters' able to adapt, versus the sudden spawning of welfare state denizens the story creates.

>Lack of a private army/effective law enforcement

Private army ??    Anyway,  we saw splicers dressed as cops and repeated mention of 'constables' as well as signs about private security.   Dont you think having a HEAVY security presence would have led to its abuse?
Rapture wasnt a Police state.    When ADAM was unleashed by Fontaine to destabilize Rapture it was unfortunate, but the storytellers avoided all the other ways that criminal should have been thwarted long before that.

rapture fell because a biological agent was introduced to a society which made its users superpowerful and insane 

one man used that disturbance to further his own greed for seizing of power and in unleashing it all but destroy the society
The US has this problem now and I don't think we've quite solved it. But one of the ways to mitigate it is to automate most of the menial jobs. Of course that's harder when you can only export limited amounts of goods and no services outside.

Come to think of it; one of the ways to combat that is to raise wages for those jobs; but I can see Ryan not allowing it; and if you can't export you're still wasting labor.
    Yes! Automation is key. This I think was the ultimate goal of the Big Daddy. Their original purpose was maintainence of Rapture, obviously they can go outside and fix the buildings under the pressure of the water. Until the plasmids when they were repurposed for little sister protection. 

They also don't have much brain function thanks to the experiments, they have a task to do and for the most part they do it till they die. For all intents and purposes they're robots.

I think, had Rapture not failed, there would have been multiple different classes of big daddy, some for janitorial duties, cleaning etc. All the 'meanial labour' would have been taken care of by them.
        That being the case, where are you gonna get the man in the suit?

The problem is the assumption that menial labor is unskilled labor, which it most certainly isn't.  As OP pointed out, plumbing and HVAC are the most important jobs in Rapture.
            I agree, they definitely aren't unskilled.  It's the culture of Rapture. The jobs aren't unskilled the people don't *value* them. Or at the very least don't appreciate the workers that do them

Getting the body is the unethical part of it. I had always assumed that the body in the suit was a reanimated cadaver or a person coerced or purchased - think criminals, homeless people or human trafficking victims - and then experimented upon. They are literally part of the suit after all.

Once they are a part of the suit, with the tech in Rapture it's not unreasonable that the skills could be 'programmed' into the body. Like Dr. Yi Schong and Sinclair working together on a plasmid, but instead of shooting fire from your fingers, it tells you how to repair fissures in metal.
        There were literal robotic little sisters in Minerva's Den, though Rapture fell before they entered use.
That's why Ryan shouldn't reject regulations and social welfare. Without these things, the real villain Fontaine was able to create the drug Adam and rile up the poor
    Correct. But rejection of these concepts was what Rapture was founded upon. "Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? No says the man in Washington [your money] is for the poor. I rejected those answers and chose Rapture" - Andrew Ryan

If Rapture was made with social welfare and regulations it would not be rapture
        But it will survive with the power of moderation. Bioshock basically give us a look at an extremist's society and shows us how to fix it
            But whose moderation? On what side? Rapture was founded with Laissez-faire ideals. A free market and minimal if any government involvement. 

People were drawn there by that concept. 

If Andrew Ryan began enforcing taxes for social services he would be no better than the government he created Rapture to escape. Those not on Sinclair's side would revolt, calling Ryan a hypocrite. 

Who defines what is moderation? In a democratic society, it is individuals that (should) represent our views and values. But in a society with no government, in a truely free market, *any* taxes are too much. 

If one tried to build Rapture 2.0 with social services implemented from the beginning, you wouldn't attract the same people. Because those people do not want to give their money to social services..

It's why [in reality] the obscenely rich spend so much time and money looking for loopholes to avoid taxes.
                Laissez-faire is a bit too extreme, how about just good old regular capitalism with regulations and social welfare and all that. And of course objectivist people can still enjoy reaping the reward of their work with a bit of their wealth given away to ensure a stable society, without parasite like Fontaine going around creating drugs and riling up the poor.
One must not underestimate the power of moderation,  it's what ensure the most stability for most society
                    >	 without parasite like Fontaine

Fontaine is many, many things, but he is *not* a parasite. That very fact is part of the reason why Ryan’s philosophy is so poor.
                        Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that. Ryan just didn't account for the fact that parasites can be quite capable in what they do.
Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city
                            >	Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that.

Fontaine funded Tenenbaum’s research and brough Suchong on board to help with the project. He is responsible for marketing and making it a success. Fontaine’s role is no different than, say, Ryan’s role in constructing Rapture or Sinclair’s role in running Persephone. 

>	Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city

…I’d hardly call Fontaine’s role in Jack or the Civil War “leeching.”
                                Like I said, Ryan just didn't realize that parasites can be quite capable in their own right. In the end, Fontaine is the person who tried to steal the city. So who is the parasite here?
And who did the fighting in the civil war? You don't see Atlas personally go to Ryan's room and club him in the head, do you? And it's not like Fontaine create this whole war to take back the city for the proletariat. No he ditched his army in the end, just to steal the whole city for himself.
How are there unironic Andrew stans? Have they just not played the game? I don’t see how you could get like 5 seconds into the game and not realise that he’s an incompetent asshole and the fall of rapture was all his fault.
    >	How are there unironic Andrew stans? Have they just not played the game? I don’t see how you could get like 5 seconds into the game and not realise that he’s an incompetent asshole and the fall of rapture was all his fault.

There’s one such fanboy here already, u/Premer777. These types willfully ignore the evidence provided in game in order to beat the drum of their own head canon: everything was great until ~~the Fire Nation attacked~~ Fontaine rolled into town. 

Just look at the kind of language they use. They call [Fontaine a terroist ](https://reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/uaa8vi/_/i5xm7yn/?context=1)and compare Andrew Ryan’s policies to the US Constitution. 

It’s delusional. Which, given the of the rest of their posting history, is right on brand.
        It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

Is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?
            >	It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Not really. Rapture was built hotly on the heels of World War II. Historically World War II results in large pro-government sentiments for the Allied nations. Obviously not everyone in Rapture is from the US, but a significant portion is. 

>	Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

At the beginning, yes. Once the Civil War breaks out, not so much. I’ve only ever heard the Ryan fan boys call it terrorism. 

>	is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?

Not at all. I’m just sick and tired of certain people trying to pretend everything was fine and dandy in Rapture until 1958. It was a shit hole from the very beginning.
                government interference in people lives and in business was a huge issue for very many people 

pro government feeling for one thing quickly goes away fast enough when things are to return to normal

yes terrorism when you have whats labeled rebels wandering the streets killing people and disrupting their livelihood and threatening sustenance with a rebel egging that destruction and mayhem on.  mcdonagh talked about how people had to use adam to protect theirs from such actions

thats not public discourse its  threatening peoples survival 

you perhaps are sick and tired of others  who hold  contrary viewa and cant face the possibility you do not understand things as well as you think

your labeling such peop'e fanbois is rather strange when perhaps its more you who more fitting to that label

fine and dandy is the way you interpret it, but like any society rapture had problems when were being handled until it was blown apart when adam overwhelmed the various society's solution and fontaine instigated his terrible deeds to use the people he had poisoned
                    At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

Much like u/Premer777, I will be blocking you as well. Hope you eventually actually learn about Bioshock and "how the world worked back then." Feel free to  edit whatever nasty comment you'd like in your post as a rebuttal. Shouting into the void is a great emotional exercise.
                        uh, no  

you seem fairly certain of some kind of persecution here

it is not an original dodge for a discussion at hand

neither is user blocking being used to avoid discussion
    Libertarians.
    There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven't played the game since you didn't recognize Fontaine is the real villain
        >	There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven’t played the game since you didn’t recognize Fontaine is the real villain

Ugh, it’s you again. There are two villains. Andrew Ryan is just as much the “real villain” as Fontaine.
            If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn't pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point
                >	If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn’t pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point

Putting aside that poor critical thinking for a moment, the finale Fontaine section was shoe horned in because the publishers felt a boss fight was required to cap off the game. The post-Ryab levels were rushed through, the writing dips in quality, and the final fight against Fontaine is laughable. 

The tacked on nature of the finale is well known.
                    That explains why the final boss was such a corny fight. It’s basically Bane-Joker from Arkham Asylum
                    Levine has often stated that he hated the "Boss fight" at the end of BS. sm
                Doesn’t mean he thinks they have a good point.
                    He does. Go search "Ken Levine on Objectivism", you will see Levine finds Ayn Rand's philosophy interesting and lateral thinking
                        That kind of supports why all his employees think he’s an ass.
                        In that interview he claims that objectivism failed because of ryan. He doesn’t endorse it or put it down but explains that Ryan is the reason rapture failed. So yes Ryan is one of the intended villains
                            Then you should look for another one where he said: "It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity"
                                That’s the interview I’m talking about. Your missing the point. His point was that even if Ryan has the best of intentions. He’s a flawed human being with humanity. Rapture was always doomed to fail.
>	Also magical drugs. Those helped a bit. Or at least they helped accelerate things

Andrew Ryan had several opportunities to step in to mitigate or prevent the Adam issue. He initially specifically chose to do nothing. Later, when he controlled the sole significant supply, he ramped up the production of Little Sisters and Big Daddys. 

Rapture’s beginning and end sits firmly with Andrew Ryan. Fontaine, like so many others, are a symptom of Ryan’s philosophy.

Edit: Spelling
    well put. I can't understand why more people don't see this. sm
        >	well put. I can’t understand why more people don’t see this. sm

I believe it’s because they specifically choose to *not* see it. 

Bioshock 1 and 2 positively pounds you over the head with how bad Ryan is.
    That’s why Fontaine moved there in the first place
It's a problem but not an insurmountable one. The only times I can think of a drug problem crippling a society is when another country keeps pumping it in; like China and Opium or the Native Americans and alcohol. 

If they had competent law enforcement and a treatment program instead of just ignoring it ADAM would probably have been manageable.
    In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.  

Rapture Free Press (with all its competition) should have fully exposed those effects and scared the shit out of anyone wanting to use ADAM (Think headlines screamin ***ADAM=CANCER !!! *** .   Convenient to the story : that exposure was not allowed to happen as the gamewriters had to rig the events and crisis that a shooter game requires.

Competent law enforcement was overwhelmed.   Imagine the same happening  in our society just as easily .

.
        >	In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.

There is no indication at all these side effects were “delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.” In anything, the audio diary “[The Market is Patient](https://youtu.be/BjDVTFH3p4A)” indicates the side effects happened towards the beginning of Plasmids being rolled out:
>	There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this Plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too.

“Free Press” means not subjected to government review. It has nothing to do with the quality of the press. *Everyone* in Rapture was cutting corners to turn a better profit. That includes papers. That includes reporters or editors being bribed into silence. There’s a hundred plausible reasons for why a paper wouldn’t report on it. 

But sure. Chalk it up to shoddy writing with your Ryan colored glasses. Why are you even in r/Bioshock if you hate the writing so much?

Edit: u/novavegasxiii
            uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press
                Without regulation the oligarchs buy the newspapers and effectively control them, then silence any attempt to spread the news. The only way a newspaper would run it is in a proxy conflict between the oligarchs, which is self-defeating to the concept of an oligarch so it doesn't happen. 

See: Russia
                    without regulation anyone in rapture could start a newspaper and with the technologies demonstrated in rapture it did not take as big an organization to do so

with a massive police state and missing understanding of freedom then such oligarchs get away with it and they are cronies of the government types who take their payoffs

rapture if you might notice was largely missing the government component of you supposition
                >	uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press

That’s because the press, minus a few notable reporters or events, is mostly ineffective. Either the audience doesn’t care, or else the reporters downplay/don’t cover specific stories. 

It’s vitally important to maintain a free press to try and catch those Watergate moments but…for every Watergate that’s published, there’s 10 more which are ignored for a variety of reasons.
                    you really know little about the function of the free press in history and only assume it all would be nullified in rapture

you dont get it that it just takes one exposure to change things a great deal and you automatically assume that could never happen

little children being enslaved and turned to mutants and abused would have been enough to end fontaine virtually instantly

same with exposing the smuggling or the way fontaine criminally coerced his control of the fisheries
magical drugs which only seem to exhibit themselves massively when ryan was running the adam

the story minimizes adams bad effects before the mere months when ryan had control before war descended on Rapture
Can you rephrase that? I'm having a hard time following you without periods or carriage returns to separate your sentences
He did have a police force (I remember he hired an ex cop or PI from Brooklyn) the problem is they were way too underfunded and spread thin to effectively control the city. At the bare minimum he should have had a cadre of foreign body guards.
    Yeah, plus they needed to have some sort of proper law enforcement with some proper funding. Plus while they were highly advanced for the scientific fields at the time, adam is highly addictive substance so while it assisted life for some with minor things(like lighting a cigar or repairing things with electricity) it should have been properly managed like the drug it is. Probably only give it to those in certain industries and heavily regulate the flow of Adam to only a small amount per person
        Come to think of it; it would have been a very good idea to hire former Russians, Poles, ang Eastern Europeans as his personal body guards; as they are the most likely to sympathetize with his ideology.

Come to think of it; I wonder how many people went to Rapture instead of Israel in this universe?
            Hmmm… not sure. What were Raptures requirements for being invited in, that would be a part.
Funny, because the game creator Levine has some libertarian leaning. But he's still believes that going moderate is more important for the stability of society
I thought about that. His belief in free markets is genuine but when push came to shove he nationalized Fontaine, and he wasn't above violating the free speech or no ethics allowed in science rule.. 

I have no doubt he would do more if he was pushed.
    ryan had to run that company to make adam for the destabilizing addicts 

there were also medical uses for adam

control was needed to keep adam in production  and then the civil war started a few months later when  adam was loudly called for in the populace to protect people from the terrorist types led by atlas

when ryan 'seized' Fontaine Futuristic, more crimes were discovered infinding the enslaved children

there also may have been the issue of restitution for fontaines victims which part of his assets was the fontaine futuristics company
> Andrew wouldn't have torn down other companies to make a monopoly, he didn't believe in doing that kind of thing

But he did.  How do you think Fontaine Futuristics became Ryan Industries?
    It's because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation
        >	It’s because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation

Wait. Is your arguement really that Ryan killed Fontaine due to “perverting the free market” and then to correct it, Ryan created a monopoly?
            Was it a perverted monopoly though?
                >	Was it a perverted monopoly though?

…Are you really asking if production of Adam, Little Sisters, Big Daddys, and Plasmids was perverted? 

Yes. The answer is yes.
>	Only part I disagree with is the part about Andrew Ryan, the rest is pretty spot on. Andrew wouldn’t have torn down other companies to make a monopoly, he didn’t believe in doing that kind of thing. He believed in a fair market.

Except Ryan did that. After Fontaine died, nominally at the hands of Andrew Ryan, Ryan claimed all of Fontaine’s holdings for Ryan Industries.
    someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem
        >	someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

Or you could dismantle it entirely and shut it down? That seems like the logical choice. 

>	nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later

…you really think Ryan was going to only temporarily hold onto the most lucrative industry in Rapture? 

>	 and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem

If that was true, Ryan would have handed it out for free by the bucket. Don’t fool yourself. Like so many other things, Ryan was in it just for the money.
            >dismantle it entirely and shut it down

dismantle it when there is the medical use.   the hints we saw about significant cures would be something to lose.

ryan probably had to reorganize the futuristics company after extracting the co-criminals fontaine had employed and whatever mess fontaine had left on his persona change

ryan did not have much time anyway with little over three months before the terrorism started and with all the activities investigating and cleaning out fontaines criminal activities

>going to only temporarily hold

with increasing evidence of violent insanity from going cold turkey and all the addicted people ryan may have needed the same tech organization to try to find a cure  and only then get rid of the source of the trouble.    ryan did not need more insane people.

>would have handed it out for free by the bucket

except the futuristics company was disrupted when fontaine died and there already were shortages as mcdonagh says in audio diaries.   Rapture did not have a large police force to handle the eterrorism and with citizens clamouring for adam plasmids to protect themselves there was no other solution in that emergfency

>fool

maybe you should not fool yourself into thinking ryan didnt care.   he never had to build rapture in the first place to try to preserve a society he believed in and a refuge from the parasites he saw as likely destroying the surface world
                At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

Not really. Rapture was built hotly on the heels of World War II. Historically World War II results in large pro-government sentiments for the Allied nations. Obviously not everyone in Rapture is from the US, but a significant portion is. 

>	Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

At the beginning, yes. Once the Civil War breaks out, not so much. I’ve only ever heard the Ryan fan boys call it terrorism. 

>	is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?

Not at all. I’m just sick and tired of certain people trying to pretend everything was fine and dandy in Rapture until 1958. It was a shit hole from the very beginning.
            government interference in people lives and in business was a huge issue for very many people 

pro government feeling for one thing quickly goes away fast enough when things are to return to normal

yes terrorism when you have whats labeled rebels wandering the streets killing people and disrupting their livelihood and threatening sustenance with a rebel egging that destruction and mayhem on.  mcdonagh talked about how people had to use adam to protect theirs from such actions

thats not public discourse its  threatening peoples survival 

you perhaps are sick and tired of others  who hold  contrary viewa and cant face the possibility you do not understand things as well as you think

your labeling such peop'e fanbois is rather strange when perhaps its more you who more fitting to that label

fine and dandy is the way you interpret it, but like any society rapture had problems when were being handled until it was blown apart when adam overwhelmed the various society's solution and fontaine instigated his terrible deeds to use the people he had poisoned

Libertarians.
There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven't played the game since you didn't recognize Fontaine is the real villain
    >	There are Ryan stan because the creator Levine stan Ryan and Ayn Rand too. Looks like youre the one haven’t played the game since you didn’t recognize Fontaine is the real villain

Ugh, it’s you again. There are two villains. Andrew Ryan is just as much the “real villain” as Fontaine.
        If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn't pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point
            >	If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn’t pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point

Putting aside that poor critical thinking for a moment, the finale Fontaine section was shoe horned in because the publishers felt a boss fight was required to cap off the game. The post-Ryab levels were rushed through, the writing dips in quality, and the final fight against Fontaine is laughable. 

The tacked on nature of the finale is well known.
                That explains why the final boss was such a corny fight. It’s basically Bane-Joker from Arkham Asylum
                Levine has often stated that he hated the "Boss fight" at the end of BS. sm
            Doesn’t mean he thinks they have a good point.
                He does. Go search "Ken Levine on Objectivism", you will see Levine finds Ayn Rand's philosophy interesting and lateral thinking
                    That kind of supports why all his employees think he’s an ass.
                    In that interview he claims that objectivism failed because of ryan. He doesn’t endorse it or put it down but explains that Ryan is the reason rapture failed. So yes Ryan is one of the intended villains
                        Then you should look for another one where he said: "It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity"
                            That’s the interview I’m talking about. Your missing the point. His point was that even if Ryan has the best of intentions. He’s a flawed human being with humanity. Rapture was always doomed to fail.
well put. I can't understand why more people don't see this. sm
    >	well put. I can’t understand why more people don’t see this. sm

I believe it’s because they specifically choose to *not* see it. 

Bioshock 1 and 2 positively pounds you over the head with how bad Ryan is.
That’s why Fontaine moved there in the first place
In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.  

Rapture Free Press (with all its competition) should have fully exposed those effects and scared the shit out of anyone wanting to use ADAM (Think headlines screamin ***ADAM=CANCER !!! *** .   Convenient to the story : that exposure was not allowed to happen as the gamewriters had to rig the events and crisis that a shooter game requires.

Competent law enforcement was overwhelmed.   Imagine the same happening  in our society just as easily .

.
    >	In the story the major negative effects were delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.  Then he suddenly has a crisis, as monsters murder people in the streets.

There is no indication at all these side effects were “delayed so to fall at Ryans feet.” In anything, the audio diary “[The Market is Patient](https://youtu.be/BjDVTFH3p4A)” indicates the side effects happened towards the beginning of Plasmids being rolled out:
>	There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this Plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too.

“Free Press” means not subjected to government review. It has nothing to do with the quality of the press. *Everyone* in Rapture was cutting corners to turn a better profit. That includes papers. That includes reporters or editors being bribed into silence. There’s a hundred plausible reasons for why a paper wouldn’t report on it. 

But sure. Chalk it up to shoddy writing with your Ryan colored glasses. Why are you even in r/Bioshock if you hate the writing so much?

Edit: u/novavegasxiii
        uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press
            Without regulation the oligarchs buy the newspapers and effectively control them, then silence any attempt to spread the news. The only way a newspaper would run it is in a proxy conflict between the oligarchs, which is self-defeating to the concept of an oligarch so it doesn't happen. 

See: Russia
                without regulation anyone in rapture could start a newspaper and with the technologies demonstrated in rapture it did not take as big an organization to do so

with a massive police state and missing understanding of freedom then such oligarchs get away with it and they are cronies of the government types who take their payoffs

rapture if you might notice was largely missing the government component of you supposition
            >	uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press

That’s because the press, minus a few notable reporters or events, is mostly ineffective. Either the audience doesn’t care, or else the reporters downplay/don’t cover specific stories. 

It’s vitally important to maintain a free press to try and catch those Watergate moments but…for every Watergate that’s published, there’s 10 more which are ignored for a variety of reasons.
                you really know little about the function of the free press in history and only assume it all would be nullified in rapture

you dont get it that it just takes one exposure to change things a great deal and you automatically assume that could never happen

little children being enslaved and turned to mutants and abused would have been enough to end fontaine virtually instantly

same with exposing the smuggling or the way fontaine criminally coerced his control of the fisheries
Yeah, plus they needed to have some sort of proper law enforcement with some proper funding. Plus while they were highly advanced for the scientific fields at the time, adam is highly addictive substance so while it assisted life for some with minor things(like lighting a cigar or repairing things with electricity) it should have been properly managed like the drug it is. Probably only give it to those in certain industries and heavily regulate the flow of Adam to only a small amount per person
    Come to think of it; it would have been a very good idea to hire former Russians, Poles, ang Eastern Europeans as his personal body guards; as they are the most likely to sympathetize with his ideology.

Come to think of it; I wonder how many people went to Rapture instead of Israel in this universe?
        Hmmm… not sure. What were Raptures requirements for being invited in, that would be a part.
ryan had to run that company to make adam for the destabilizing addicts 

there were also medical uses for adam

control was needed to keep adam in production  and then the civil war started a few months later when  adam was loudly called for in the populace to protect people from the terrorist types led by atlas

when ryan 'seized' Fontaine Futuristic, more crimes were discovered infinding the enslaved children

there also may have been the issue of restitution for fontaines victims which part of his assets was the fontaine futuristics company
It's because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation
    >	It’s because Fontaine was using the black market and corrupting the free market of Rapture. It was an act of preservation

Wait. Is your arguement really that Ryan killed Fontaine due to “perverting the free market” and then to correct it, Ryan created a monopoly?
        Was it a perverted monopoly though?
            >	Was it a perverted monopoly though?

…Are you really asking if production of Adam, Little Sisters, Big Daddys, and Plasmids was perverted? 

Yes. The answer is yes.
someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem
    >	someone had to run that company to make adam for the addicts  and perhaps more for the medical uses

Or you could dismantle it entirely and shut it down? That seems like the logical choice. 

>	nothing says  the control was permanent and then the civil war started a few months later

…you really think Ryan was going to only temporarily hold onto the most lucrative industry in Rapture? 

>	 and adam was needed to protect people from the rebel splicer mayhem

If that was true, Ryan would have handed it out for free by the bucket. Don’t fool yourself. Like so many other things, Ryan was in it just for the money.
        >dismantle it entirely and shut it down

dismantle it when there is the medical use.   the hints we saw about significant cures would be something to lose.

ryan probably had to reorganize the futuristics company after extracting the co-criminals fontaine had employed and whatever mess fontaine had left on his persona change

ryan did not have much time anyway with little over three months before the terrorism started and with all the activities investigating and cleaning out fontaines criminal activities

>going to only temporarily hold

with increasing evidence of violent insanity from going cold turkey and all the addicted people ryan may have needed the same tech organization to try to find a cure  and only then get rid of the source of the trouble.    ryan did not need more insane people.

>would have handed it out for free by the bucket

except the futuristics company was disrupted when fontaine died and there already were shortages as mcdonagh says in audio diaries.   Rapture did not have a large police force to handle the eterrorism and with citizens clamouring for adam plasmids to protect themselves there was no other solution in that emergfency

>fool

maybe you should not fool yourself into thinking ryan didnt care.   he never had to build rapture in the first place to try to preserve a society he believed in and a refuge from the parasites he saw as likely destroying the surface world
            At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

That being the case, where are you gonna get the man in the suit?

The problem is the assumption that menial labor is unskilled labor, which it most certainly isn't.  As OP pointed out, plumbing and HVAC are the most important jobs in Rapture.
    I agree, they definitely aren't unskilled.  It's the culture of Rapture. The jobs aren't unskilled the people don't *value* them. Or at the very least don't appreciate the workers that do them

Getting the body is the unethical part of it. I had always assumed that the body in the suit was a reanimated cadaver or a person coerced or purchased - think criminals, homeless people or human trafficking victims - and then experimented upon. They are literally part of the suit after all.

Once they are a part of the suit, with the tech in Rapture it's not unreasonable that the skills could be 'programmed' into the body. Like Dr. Yi Schong and Sinclair working together on a plasmid, but instead of shooting fire from your fingers, it tells you how to repair fissures in metal.
There were literal robotic little sisters in Minerva's Den, though Rapture fell before they entered use.
But it will survive with the power of moderation. Bioshock basically give us a look at an extremist's society and shows us how to fix it
    But whose moderation? On what side? Rapture was founded with Laissez-faire ideals. A free market and minimal if any government involvement. 

People were drawn there by that concept. 

If Andrew Ryan began enforcing taxes for social services he would be no better than the government he created Rapture to escape. Those not on Sinclair's side would revolt, calling Ryan a hypocrite. 

Who defines what is moderation? In a democratic society, it is individuals that (should) represent our views and values. But in a society with no government, in a truely free market, *any* taxes are too much. 

If one tried to build Rapture 2.0 with social services implemented from the beginning, you wouldn't attract the same people. Because those people do not want to give their money to social services..

It's why [in reality] the obscenely rich spend so much time and money looking for loopholes to avoid taxes.
        Laissez-faire is a bit too extreme, how about just good old regular capitalism with regulations and social welfare and all that. And of course objectivist people can still enjoy reaping the reward of their work with a bit of their wealth given away to ensure a stable society, without parasite like Fontaine going around creating drugs and riling up the poor.
One must not underestimate the power of moderation,  it's what ensure the most stability for most society
            >	 without parasite like Fontaine

Fontaine is many, many things, but he is *not* a parasite. That very fact is part of the reason why Ryan’s philosophy is so poor.
                Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that. Ryan just didn't account for the fact that parasites can be quite capable in what they do.
Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city
                    >	Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that.

Fontaine funded Tenenbaum’s research and brough Suchong on board to help with the project. He is responsible for marketing and making it a success. Fontaine’s role is no different than, say, Ryan’s role in constructing Rapture or Sinclair’s role in running Persephone. 

>	Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city

…I’d hardly call Fontaine’s role in Jack or the Civil War “leeching.”
                        Like I said, Ryan just didn't realize that parasites can be quite capable in their own right. In the end, Fontaine is the person who tried to steal the city. So who is the parasite here?
And who did the fighting in the civil war? You don't see Atlas personally go to Ryan's room and club him in the head, do you? And it's not like Fontaine create this whole war to take back the city for the proletariat. No he ditched his army in the end, just to steal the whole city for himself.
It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

Is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?

            Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that. Ryan just didn't account for the fact that parasites can be quite capable in what they do.
Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city
                >	Fontaine is A Parasite who leeched off the works of Tenenbaum and Suchong, the Adam was their idea. Fontaine simply build his empire on top of that.

Fontaine funded Tenenbaum’s research and brough Suchong on board to help with the project. He is responsible for marketing and making it a success. Fontaine’s role is no different than, say, Ryan’s role in constructing Rapture or Sinclair’s role in running Persephone. 

>	Not to mention Fontaine also leeched off the fighting effort of both the Atlas Army and Jack, just to steal a city

…I’d hardly call Fontaine’s role in Jack or the Civil War “leeching.”
                    Like I said, Ryan just didn't realize that parasites can be quite capable in their own right. In the end, Fontaine is the person who tried to steal the city. So who is the parasite here?
And who did the fighting in the civil war? You don't see Atlas personally go to Ryan's room and club him in the head, do you? And it's not like Fontaine create this whole war to take back the city for the proletariat. No he ditched his army in the end, just to steal the whole city for himself.
>	It is obvious that you do not seem capable of seeing Rapture from the point of view of the time period the game represents.   Abhorrence of government interference was very common then and they are not even there  looking at the destructive nannystate abuses we have today.

Not really. Rapture was built hotly on the heels of World War II. Historically World War II results in large pro-government sentiments for the Allied nations. Obviously not everyone in Rapture is from the US, but a significant portion is. 

>	Fontaine did use terrorism to try to seize control of rapture.

At the beginning, yes. Once the Civil War breaks out, not so much. I’ve only ever heard the Ryan fan boys call it terrorism. 

>	is it just your limitations a current view that are confusing you about understanding Rapture and the philosophy in effect there?

Not at all. I’m just sick and tired of certain people trying to pretend everything was fine and dandy in Rapture until 1958. It was a shit hole from the very beginning.
    government interference in people lives and in business was a huge issue for very many people 

pro government feeling for one thing quickly goes away fast enough when things are to return to normal

yes terrorism when you have whats labeled rebels wandering the streets killing people and disrupting their livelihood and threatening sustenance with a rebel egging that destruction and mayhem on.  mcdonagh talked about how people had to use adam to protect theirs from such actions

thats not public discourse its  threatening peoples survival 

you perhaps are sick and tired of others  who hold  contrary viewa and cant face the possibility you do not understand things as well as you think

your labeling such peop'e fanbois is rather strange when perhaps its more you who more fitting to that label

fine and dandy is the way you interpret it, but like any society rapture had problems when were being handled until it was blown apart when adam overwhelmed the various society's solution and fontaine instigated his terrible deeds to use the people he had poisoned
        At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

Much like u/Premer777, I will be blocking you as well. Hope you eventually actually learn about Bioshock and "how the world worked back then." Feel free to  edit whatever nasty comment you'd like in your post as a rebuttal. Shouting into the void is a great emotional exercise.
            uh, no  

you seem fairly certain of some kind of persecution here

it is not an original dodge for a discussion at hand

neither is user blocking being used to avoid discussion
If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn't pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point
    >	If Levine truly wants Ryan to be wrong, bad and evil, he wouldn’t pivot the plot to Fontaine at the end. But he did, because he believes Ryan/Ayn Rand has a point

Putting aside that poor critical thinking for a moment, the finale Fontaine section was shoe horned in because the publishers felt a boss fight was required to cap off the game. The post-Ryab levels were rushed through, the writing dips in quality, and the final fight against Fontaine is laughable. 

The tacked on nature of the finale is well known.
        That explains why the final boss was such a corny fight. It’s basically Bane-Joker from Arkham Asylum
        Levine has often stated that he hated the "Boss fight" at the end of BS. sm
    Doesn’t mean he thinks they have a good point.
        He does. Go search "Ken Levine on Objectivism", you will see Levine finds Ayn Rand's philosophy interesting and lateral thinking
            That kind of supports why all his employees think he’s an ass.
            In that interview he claims that objectivism failed because of ryan. He doesn’t endorse it or put it down but explains that Ryan is the reason rapture failed. So yes Ryan is one of the intended villains
                Then you should look for another one where he said: "It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity"
                    That’s the interview I’m talking about. Your missing the point. His point was that even if Ryan has the best of intentions. He’s a flawed human being with humanity. Rapture was always doomed to fail.
uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press
    Without regulation the oligarchs buy the newspapers and effectively control them, then silence any attempt to spread the news. The only way a newspaper would run it is in a proxy conflict between the oligarchs, which is self-defeating to the concept of an oligarch so it doesn't happen. 

See: Russia
        without regulation anyone in rapture could start a newspaper and with the technologies demonstrated in rapture it did not take as big an organization to do so

with a massive police state and missing understanding of freedom then such oligarchs get away with it and they are cronies of the government types who take their payoffs

rapture if you might notice was largely missing the government component of you supposition
    >	uh you automatically assume an ineffective entire system of free press

That’s because the press, minus a few notable reporters or events, is mostly ineffective. Either the audience doesn’t care, or else the reporters downplay/don’t cover specific stories. 

It’s vitally important to maintain a free press to try and catch those Watergate moments but…for every Watergate that’s published, there’s 10 more which are ignored for a variety of reasons.
        you really know little about the function of the free press in history and only assume it all would be nullified in rapture

you dont get it that it just takes one exposure to change things a great deal and you automatically assume that could never happen

little children being enslaved and turned to mutants and abused would have been enough to end fontaine virtually instantly

same with exposing the smuggling or the way fontaine criminally coerced his control of the fisheries
Hmmm… not sure. What were Raptures requirements for being invited in, that would be a part.
Was it a perverted monopoly though?
    >	Was it a perverted monopoly though?

…Are you really asking if production of Adam, Little Sisters, Big Daddys, and Plasmids was perverted? 

Yes. The answer is yes.
>dismantle it entirely and shut it down

dismantle it when there is the medical use.   the hints we saw about significant cures would be something to lose.

ryan probably had to reorganize the futuristics company after extracting the co-criminals fontaine had employed and whatever mess fontaine had left on his persona change

ryan did not have much time anyway with little over three months before the terrorism started and with all the activities investigating and cleaning out fontaines criminal activities

>going to only temporarily hold

with increasing evidence of violent insanity from going cold turkey and all the addicted people ryan may have needed the same tech organization to try to find a cure  and only then get rid of the source of the trouble.    ryan did not need more insane people.

>would have handed it out for free by the bucket

except the futuristics company was disrupted when fontaine died and there already were shortages as mcdonagh says in audio diaries.   Rapture did not have a large police force to handle the eterrorism and with citizens clamouring for adam plasmids to protect themselves there was no other solution in that emergfency

>fool

maybe you should not fool yourself into thinking ryan didnt care.   he never had to build rapture in the first place to try to preserve a society he believed in and a refuge from the parasites he saw as likely destroying the surface world
    At this point, I'm fairly certain you are the same user as u/Premer777. Your syntax, arguements used, quoting style, and insistence on Ryan's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary presented in the franchise reinforce this belief.

Laissez-faire is a bit too extreme, how about just good old regular capitalism with regulations and social welfare and all that. And of course objectivist people can still enjoy reaping the reward of their work with a bit of their wealth given away to ensure a stable society, without parasite like Fontaine going around creating drugs and riling up the poor.
One must not underestimate the power of moderation,  it's what ensure the most stability for most society
