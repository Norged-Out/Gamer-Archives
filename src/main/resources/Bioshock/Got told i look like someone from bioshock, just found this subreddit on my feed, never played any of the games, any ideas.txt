[[Got told i look like someone from bioshock, just found this subreddit on my feed, never played any of the games, any ideas]]





Is a man not entitled to his upvotes
    No says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor!
    No says the moderator. It belongs to the subreddit
        No, says the lurker, it belongs to everyone!
        No, says the shitposter it belongs to u/spez
            SPEZ IS THE ONE TRUTH IN THIS CRUEL WORLD.

HEIL SPEZ, LONG LIVE SHIT üí© I‚ÄôM GONNA CRY
        I rejected those answer, instead, I chose something different
            I chose the impossible, I chose, Reddit !
                I love this fandom
                    Real
                    Some...sometimes reddit is SO beautiful!!
                    Same. üòå
    I love this
        This never gets old tbh
    Would you kindly upvote this?
    This was perfect
    Maybe one day I‚Äôll have a post with so many likes üòû
        Not today, and prob not tomorrow‚Ä¶
        I downvoted for attention seeking behavior.
You look like a much, much younger Andrew Ryan.
    For your reference, OP https://imgur.com/a/1M8X06F
    The birth of Rapture. A young Andrew Ryan starting to build his own Utopia. Sounds great to me.
        Ryan wasn't young when he founded rapture, he was like mid forties at the youngest. We don't know exactly how old he is, but he was a child in 1917 leaving Belarus and rapture was founded in 1946. A young ryan would be establishing his fortune in america, i think.
    Even his expression. He looks like he's watching what untamed governmental and religious dogma does to the common man and wants to chose something else... looks like he wants to choose...


Rapture...
        I love the pause before you said .....rapture... I could almost hear how you would sound saying that out loud.
            An awed yet inspired half whisper. Just like Ryan lol
    Yeah I agree, I can totally see the resemblance there lol.
    Means Jack?
        Jack doesn‚Äôt necessarily look a lot like Ryan, just because he‚Äôs his son.
            We have some pictures of jack, from ryan's conspiracy theory board, and the wallet photo, and jack seems to look more like Jasmine.
            OP also doesn't look exactly like Ryan and more like his son imo
                Lmao touch√© on the logic but OP def looks like young Ryan to me.
                    Since we're discussing heavily stylized graphics from 2007 here, I think that both of us can be true, so :)
Is a man entitled to the sweat of his brow?
    No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor!
        No says the man in the Vatican, it belongs to god!
            No says the man in Moscow, it belongs to everyone!
                I rejected those answers!
                    Instead, I chose something different.
                        I chose the impossible‚Ä¶
                            I chose... Rapture.
                                *cue one of the greatest intro cutscenes of all time*
                                SHARK TALE BABYYY
        Irony as it‚Äôs the other way round now, a modern bio shock would be ‚Äúno, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the rich.‚Äù (Or the corporations.)
            I think the irony was purposeful on the part of Bioshock's writers. In their time as well, the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, because all the answers are unfair. 

Ryan rejected those answers, but his answer is unfair too. "It belongs to the one who pays for it." The issue is clearly seen with Professor Langford, who dedicated her life to maintaining the Arcadia, and Ryan killed it because he bought her rights. 

The point is that rights are inalienable. Ryan is a hypocrite, but he made an excellent point at the beginning of his speach: the sweat of their brow belongs to the one who sheds it, every single time they shed it.
    I, rejected those answers!
        I CHOOSE...REDDIT!
            Hhahahahhaha
            https://media.tenor.com/YNBKbwhjfNcAAAAM/the-simpsons-ralph-wiggum.gif took me a moment to realize you were holding the o lol
    The man in Moscow would spread it to the rest of the crowd.
    Stop working so hard I‚Äôll get you a towel
    NO, says the capitalist, it belongs to your employer!
You look like someone who would build a city at the bottom of the ocean
    Would you kindly provide a specific example?

        No Sherlock, Shit.
            Shit Sherlock, No.
        There always has to be that one person who ruins the vibe with a stupid negative comment.  Cheer up dude.  Enjoy the comments.
Get your ass back to the fallout subreddit, Mr. House
    YES. he‚Äôs simultaneously my enemies in both games lmao, he looks a lot like House
        every fictional capitalist character--andrew ryan, mister house, joey drew--looks like a combination of walt disney and howard hughes
            Coincidence? I think not!
            Hahahaha so real
            Joey Drew looks like Peter Parker's boss.
        Funny that they both died the same way.
    The pre fallout Mr house üòÇ‚Ä¶ the fallout Mr house looks like a living breathing mummification gone wrong
    You can kill Mr. House with a golf club in New Vegas and it references Bioshock. I think it was one of the challenges you have to complete in the game.
        I was told "Go do this,the gun runners achievement is great." And I was not let down.
    This!
    Dude‚Äôs skin isn‚Äôt nearly desiccated enough to be mister house.
    They're basically the same character lol
    Exactly what I‚Äôm thinking
Damn you look just like bioshock
    Im bioshock
        John Bioshock
            He doesn't afraid of anything
            Bio shock
            *Who is John Bioshock?*
            Well Jack is somehow short for John.

Coincidence?

I think not!
        Bioshooketh

A man chooses
    A slave obeys
        Now would you kindly
            Go in there and kill the son of a bitch?
                OBEY!!!

*gets his face caved in with a golf club*
                    *gurgle noises*
Andrew Ryan
Do you like golf OP
    Loves it so much he would die for it.
    Kinda
        Those who live by the club will die by the club
            Best fucking comment. Ever.
                Of all time.
        Mr. Ryan is just playing a game of mini golf with his son
Hi Ryan just wanted to thank you for the plasmids and I have no regrets killing half of raptures population
    The what
        Plasmids are what will give you magic in the game bioshock and also caused the downfall of rapture/the under water city
            Damn üóø
                You really need to play the game.  It's the best game hands down
            Bro, what are you doing???? He hasnt INVENTED them yet. Mf hasnt even met Fontaine yet
No gods or kings. Only OP
Sorry about your golf club dude.

In all seriousness, you look like a character named Andrew Ryan. His lore is absolutely fucking insane if you wanna have a look-see at his Wikipedia page
    I‚Äôll take a look
    I almost forgot how utterly brilliant the whole story was...may need to replay them all
        I played through the first game all the way through on release. Such a great game.
You look like a man who chooses
Isnt Man entitled to BE SO FKIN FRESHH
You kinda look like Primis Dempsey
    Oh my god finally someone out of the cod zombies reddit who says that
        Was about to second the Tank Dempsey statement!
        It's a pretty accurate statement
YouTube lets play, be sure to use a face cam
    Could u imagine using ai voice generator and doing a andrew ryan let's play of bioshock
You have the kind of face I could bash repeatedly with a 9 iron

Source: I've used a 9 iron to bash in the face of someone you look very similar to. But I was asked very kindly to do it.
Bro got that Mr House from Fallout New Vegas look
Don‚Äôt go golfing.
Wow cant believe it! John Bioshock in the flesh!
    I can't wait for the moment when John Bioshock Infinites all over the place
        I love it when John Bioshock enters Minerva's Den üòè
You definitely look like you have a transatlantic accent lol
Jokes aside (and yes you do look like a younger Andrew Ryan from the game) you should definitely play Bioshock! The atmosphere is like no other :)
You‚Äôre also Dempsey from cod zombies so idk man maybe you‚Äôre just a real life NPC.
You look like someone who would know a guy who had something dreamed up and then tattooed inside your head
Just answer this question. Are you a man or a slave?
    A man
        You definitely look like a man who chooses. ü§å

(Also, highly recommend the games)
That's the spitting image of a young Andrew Ryan, insane
You look like someone who would pull the Great Chain
Is a man not entitled to the look of his face? No, says Reddit, it belongs to [r/bioshock](http://reddit.com/r/bioshock)
Freddie Mercury
Listen, me, you, 18 holes, what's the worst that could happen? Someone gets a putter through the skull after the 12th hole because of an unfortunate phrasing?
Damn it Richtofen! This wasn't part of the plan!

(Didn't expect you in this subreddit, either!)
    Lmao
Are you the same dude I‚Äôve been seeing on the COD zombies subs?
    Ye
Andrew Ryan.
Bro is about to fund an underwater futuristic city
Am I the only one who thinks, if you remove the mustache, he looks like Atlas from the Burial at Sea DLC?
You definitely look like Andrew Ryan and it's pretty neat.
Andrew Ryan or Mr. House pick one
You look like you have a lot of opinions on sweat ownership
No gods, no masters. Only man.
I know this is about Bioshock but bro looks like Primis Dempsey from CoD Zombies
    Or Primis Richtofen
Stay away from golf, would you kindly
Or Gomez, from the Adam's Family.
Avoid golf clubs‚Ä¶
Andrew Ryan by far. Younger. In his prime. Id def use this for clout ü§£ü§ùüëè

‚ÄúIs a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?‚Äù
So you made a post instead of looking up literally anything about the game? Bro, just be honest ‚ÄúI kinda look like Andrew Ryan and wanted to show it off‚Äù FTFY. You definitely do
    I posted a pic on another subreddit and people said i look like someone from bioshock so i had curiosity
I didn't want to be the one to tell you that but man that bioshock game owes you some royalties
hi, Jack
would you kindly upvote this?
There he is! It's John Bioshock himself!
Would you kindly take that camera and snap a few more snapshots us?
I know it‚Äôs the wrong sub but I‚Äôm getting more Robert House
This the same dude that said ‚Äúsomeone told me I look like tank Dempsey‚Äù buddy is fishing for upvotes
    Not upvotes but opinions, if there was an option to disable upvotes I would turn it on
You look like Tank Dempsey and Edward Richthofen's son
    They had fun
Please look up Mr. House from fallout new Vegas. 

And if you happen to become a billionaire and plan to save Vegas from ww3‚Ä¶.remember me
Baby Andrew Ryan.
ben shapiro and andrew ryan
More like Mr. House from Fallout New Vegas
You're such bullshit, you knew what you were doing :D
You look more like Primis Dempsey from cod
    Omg I saw your pfp then went and saw your posts. Haha
        Oorah
how do i make my hair look like yours you good looking women snabbing gentlemen!
    Basically ask for a executive contour haircut
        And a lot of hair gel
Id say the asshole nurse from sucker punch
You look like the dude that played Oswalt Mosley on peaky blinders
Holy shit. Lol spot on.
Tony stark dad's. And ryan
With the sweat from your brow, Rapture can be yours as well.
Would you kindly compare yourself to Andrew Ryan
A man chooses‚Ä¶.
Now THIS is a man who *chooses*
Omg!!!! I'm very scared rn lol
A man chooses!
Ever considered building a secret city?
Bruh. You really look a lot like Ryan. Put on a brown suit and play some golf, would you kindly?
Would you kindly?
You look like you're entitled to the sweat of your brow
A MAN CHOOSES.
    A SLAVE OBEYS
Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
    Ah fuck someone beat me to it
the house always wins..
Get yourself a pinstripe suit and you'd fit right in down in Rapture, strolling through Fort Frolic or relaxing in your luxury Olympus Heights apartment.


I'd certainly recommend giving the first Bioshock a try at least. The graphics may be a little dated but it's still great and there's a novel too if you want to learn a bit more about the city and just how things went to hell.
The parasites said ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù
He‚Äôs on his way to build‚Ä¶ RAPTURE
You start getting any Ultra-libertarian ideas...lock yourself in a room cause you about to get a lot of people killed and worse o.O
Andrew Bryan
How do you feel about a paradise underneath the ocean?
Oh come on, youre trolling :D
It's the intentional old-timey mustache style and hairstyle. It's reminiscent of 1920's-1940's America. Bioshock leans into that style.
    Yeah i was doing some kind of primis tank dempsey style
        You totally nailed the look by the way! It looks awesome!
Yes, yes you do.
Mr House
A man chooses a slave obeys.
Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
He does bear a resemblance to Howard Hughes, who many a rich, eccentric inventor has been modeled after, including Andrew Ryan as well as Robert Edwin House and Tony Stark among others.
You look like you would ask kindly for someone to complete a few harmless objectives
Stop mewing before you shit your pants
    Im not even mewing üóø
just a little heads up, if any of your relatives come up to you with golf clubs in their hands..... run
You look like skinny Gomez adams
Idk, I‚Äôve never played the game‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre a handsome dude. Would be a whole lot less creepy without this sad mustache though.
Would you Kindly Though ?
A man chooses a slave obey
You look like you're gonna tell me a man chooses but a slave obeys. Like legit Andrew Ryan vibes. You Like the ocean and the idea of putting a city at the bottom of it in a 1949 style?
    Depends
Never shave that mustache. Never grow it out. You have reached peak mustache.
    Thats my plan
This is crazy
Andrei Rianofski?
Absolutely fantastic
House too Fallout
You're beautiful. DM me bby.
    üóø
Definitely reminds me of a younger Andrew Ryan!! :D
You look like a man who chooses.. not obeys
Yeah no you look like Andrew Ryan if he were younger
‚ÄúThe name‚Äôs Augustus Sinclair, sport. Esquire.‚Äù
Just watched Masters of the Air. You look even more like Robert "Rosie" Rosenthal as depicted in the series. 

https://i.imgur.com/CJGdV4S.jpg
Mr. Bioshock is that you
Andrew Ryan in real life?!?
OP, please please PLEASE tell me that you will play the first Bioshock. ü•≤ü•∫
Would you kindly?
"Hello my name is Andrew Ryan"
Mr. House?
Nope. Primis tank Dempsey Black Ops 2/3/4
    Waiting for a jacket to complete the look
Andrew Ryan or Edward Rictofen from cod zombies
    What about tank dempsey
        Ooh looking back on it, abit of blonde dye and you would be a perfect Orgins Dempsey
            More like primis dempsey, the one from origins, so basically a more brownish hair
A MAN CHOOSES‚Ä¶. A SLAVE OBEYS‚Ä¶.
It's Mr. House from Fallout New Vegas
You look like a mix of a much younger Andrew Ryan and a much less ghoulish Sander Cohen.
You look like Primis Richtofen from COD Zombies
no king. no god. only‚Ä¶. man
BRO YOU EXACTLY LIKE TANK DEMPSEY FROM ORIGINS, BLACK OPS 2 ZOMBIES XDDDDD
    Lmao
Why Freddy Mercury here?
I CHOSE... RAPTURE
A man does a slave obeys
Nah, that's Kirin Jindosh.
Well if it ain't Josiah Tralawney!
You look like Howard stark In the first captain America movie
Would you kindly
You also look like Francis Ferdinand from the [WW1 Rap Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCEUZ4rFiac)
A man chooses, a slave obeys
Everybody saying mr. house from fallout New Vegas, but I say slap a pair of glasses on this man and you have Jack Cabot from fallout 4
is a man not entitled to the tongue of his mog
you look like Andrew Ryan.
Bro isn‚Äôt real
well there it is. your halloween costume.
I wouldn't say specifically BioShock, but you wouldn't be out of place. You sort of have that early 20th century look to you.
Mr House FNV
It's time to do the Easter Egg, Dempsey.
    I thought we were done with this, Richtofen!
        There is much to do, the vessel for Maxis, the staffs, the opening of the gateway.
You should play the first game so you can see the city you built.
Ahahahhahaa.. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Who would've known that a green shirt would turn up to be the best Coldplay outfit ever?
    Lmao
Freddy Mercury is that you?
Would you kindly play the games?
Get a three-piece suit now!
Hetero Sander Cohen
Mr. House?
Did they also tell you that your future is at the bottom of the ocean?
‚ÄúIs a man not entitled, to the sweat of his brow?‚Äù

Should totally play the first one at least. You look like Andrew Ryan lol
Bro looks like Robert ‚ÄúRosie‚Äù Rosenthal from Masters Of The Sky.

Idk anything about bio shock but it looks kinda like mr house in fallout new vegas
You look like Mr. House from Fallout New Vegas
Maybe Mr. house from New Vegas
You could be a howard stark
It's MY CHOICE! MINE!! NOW would you KINDLY be a GOOD errand boy... and kill me!
Tried my best to combine House and Ryan together, think I went too far into the House influence. I tried.
BioShock or just styled from a period other than the current? Hope you didn't take it as an insult, many would be jealous.
You look like a man who chose the impossible
No pogs or keks only cringe
Okay Andrew Ryan go build rapture and this time don‚Äôt have it fall to corruption and greed
Beyond the ocean
A lighthouse is waiting for me
The Great Chain in motion
Beneath the waves of the sea
Into the city
All good things flow
The sweat on your brow
Is what you reap and sow
Forge your own fortune
From salt and from sand
No gods or kings
Only man
Folks told me, son, you won the gene pool
So I guess I had a head start on these fools
Doesn't take a Winter Blast for Jack to keep cool
But isolation in the deep blue can be cruel
I descend the depths fathom by fathom
As if the ocean opened up and I've been cast in a chasm
Upon a sweeping seascape, genetic accidents happened
But don't blame EVE, the cause of the fall had to be ADAM
If you believe the sweat of your brow oughtta be yours
Listen to Andrew Ryan, the philosophical entrepreneur
He might've put me on blast, but I'll get past his thugs
I asked who Fontaine was, and Atlas Shrugged
Welcome to Rapture, where you can manufacture
Evolution: natural selection's happening faster
Were you shocked when I said I was nothing less than electric
This city's dead but I bet that I can resurrect it
An engine never rests in Hephaestus
Like a Lazarus Vector, giving breath to the breathless
(Gasp)
I'm getting quite dependent on medkits
I just met a demented doctor obsessed with perfection
You promised me pretty, Steinman, why did I get this?
I treated your ugliness like an infection!
That's why I took a wrench when I went to the dentist
And my smile was dazzlin' after bashin' his head in
Collectin' weapons, makin' effective inventions
I'll make you vanish like Houdini
When I pump lead in you Leadheads
I call it artwork, want it censored? Forget it
I got a killer's disposition, I guess it's genetic
Death is a choice that I rejected! Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise
Roll up my sleeves, so blood will not get on'em
These shackles remind me I started from the bottom
Hello little fish, have you had your cherry popped?
I'm a grown man, damnit, I ain't scared of shots
Shots shots shots shots now my veins are on fire
Rearrangin' DNA? Sounds like playing with fire
Sciences are practiced with a lack of moral guidance
Splicers seek to satisfy their sick sadistic vices
Victims become villains, angry vandals turn to violence
Sickly children sticking by their less than gentle giants
Minds manipulated by the parasite inside'em
But if you're a parasite in Ryan's eyes, you're put to silence
The great and strong will not yield to the weak and feeble
Better change your DNA if you'd like to fight as equals
Harvest ADAM, feed on EVE, it doesn't make me evil
Because my survival rides on getting Power to the People
Dozens of desperate denizens deal with deprivation
But let's be fair, laissez-faire, forget the regulations
This economy's perfectly working without you
Now let me fill my craving at the Circus of Values
Drawn to this city, like a moth to a flame
Fallin' from grace, swallowed by a watery grave
Now I'll frolic on this stage, I'm a part in a play
Like I was nothing but a puppet, just a pawn in the game
Lookin' for something to set me apart from a slave
Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise
RISE
Rapture is bleeding through cracks that are leaking
Dwindling memories tell secrets they're keeping
Demons disguised by benign masquerades
Angels climb out of their graves
Mind over matter is the practice I'm preachin'
How else could I achieve feats of telekinesis
And I'm an expert at hacking past your defense
Then I'll attack you like a swarm from a hornet nest
(Buzz off!)
The Gatherer's Garden ain't runnin' short of guests
I've been cleaning'em out, I can afford the best
Hey!
Do you wish your waist was slimmer?
(Yes!)
Or your chin was chiseled more?
(Huh?)
Careful, vanity could send us into civil war
In a utopia, who's gonna wanna scrub the toilets?
The people in Apollo Square got no other choices
I know how this is gonna end, but I don't wanna spoil it
You try to seize my city? Time that I destroy it!
Just relax, Big Daddy, I command ya
Strike a pose, smile for the camera
I think objectively, just like Ayn Rand does
Attention: will the real Fontaine stand up?
A man chooses, unlike a slave
Who never strays from the path that his master paves
Follows every order and does everything they say
Now Would You Kindly... OBEY?
OBEY
Rise, Rapture, rise
We turn our hopes up to the skies
Rise, Rapture, rise
We'll go down with our sinking paradise
My city is thriving (Rise, Rapture, rise)
Your allies- choose them wisely (We turn our hopes up to the skies)
Our Rapture is rising (Rise, Rapture, rise)
Stand with us, Would You Kindly? (We'll go down with our sinking paradise)
RISE
A man chooses
would you kindly take a front-facing selfie so someone can put you in an Audio Diary filter lmao
Fuck you ryan but fuck you even more atlas
Play the games seriously play the games without spoilers or anything it will be soooooo funnnnnnnn
Would you kindly?
Do you ever feel the need to build an underwater city?
bro chooses
I know this isn't a bioshock character, but why does bro look like Mr. House's picture from Fallout: New Vegas
‚ÄúA man chooses‚Ä¶‚Äù
Mr.House
You also look a lot like House from Fallout Nv
You will need to make the decisions for yourself, I would recommend you take a look at BioShock because you look a lot like the guy who governs rapture, but a real man chooses and a slave obeys.
A man chooses
Just stay away from golfing pal
You look like Mr. House from fallout
Would you kindly tell us who they said you look like?
    Some people on another subreddit, but nothing related to videogames
        They said something out of bioshock
            I really asked that now for this sub than you look. The phrase "would you kindly" has a significant meaning in the context of the games, the first one specifically, and is closely tired to the guy you look like. Good games too, I recommend giving em a try. You won't regret it if you're a shooter guy who likes solving problems.
A man chooses, A slave obeys
Andrew House
Nah you look like dempsey from cod zombies tho
    Oorah
Play the game, Mr. Ryan.
Would you kindly tell them they‚Äôre right
Would you kindly play the first 2 bioshock games
HAHAHA You totally do
Would you kindly show another angle?
Little sister
i won‚Äôt u‚Ä¶.
You do üòÇ
Idk about Bioshock, but to me you looks like either Edward Richtofen or Tank Dempsey from CoD Zombies, or Robert House from Fallout.
    Oorah
        After looking at your profile, it appears I am not the first person to draw that conclusion
            Yeah lmao
ANDREW, YOU BASTARD! WOULD YOU KINDLY
Looks like Mr house
    Fallout new Vegas
Would you kindly turn to the right so I can get the full picture?
Would you kindly start building a city in the ocean?
You really do, you should ask to be a character in the next game ü§£
Dude is straight up from the video game incarnate its almost unreal. Holy crap.
Build a underwater city

        SPEZ IS THE ONE TRUTH IN THIS CRUEL WORLD.

HEIL SPEZ, LONG LIVE SHIT üí© I‚ÄôM GONNA CRY
    I rejected those answer, instead, I chose something different
        I chose the impossible, I chose, Reddit !
            I love this fandom
                Real
                Some...sometimes reddit is SO beautiful!!
                Same. üòå
I love this
    This never gets old tbh
Would you kindly upvote this?
This was perfect
Maybe one day I‚Äôll have a post with so many likes üòû
    Not today, and prob not tomorrow‚Ä¶
    I downvoted for attention seeking behavior.
For your reference, OP https://imgur.com/a/1M8X06F
The birth of Rapture. A young Andrew Ryan starting to build his own Utopia. Sounds great to me.
    Ryan wasn't young when he founded rapture, he was like mid forties at the youngest. We don't know exactly how old he is, but he was a child in 1917 leaving Belarus and rapture was founded in 1946. A young ryan would be establishing his fortune in america, i think.
Even his expression. He looks like he's watching what untamed governmental and religious dogma does to the common man and wants to chose something else... looks like he wants to choose...


Rapture...
    I love the pause before you said .....rapture... I could almost hear how you would sound saying that out loud.
        An awed yet inspired half whisper. Just like Ryan lol
Yeah I agree, I can totally see the resemblance there lol.
Means Jack?
    Jack doesn‚Äôt necessarily look a lot like Ryan, just because he‚Äôs his son.
        We have some pictures of jack, from ryan's conspiracy theory board, and the wallet photo, and jack seems to look more like Jasmine.
        OP also doesn't look exactly like Ryan and more like his son imo
            Lmao touch√© on the logic but OP def looks like young Ryan to me.
                Since we're discussing heavily stylized graphics from 2007 here, I think that both of us can be true, so :)
No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor!
    No says the man in the Vatican, it belongs to god!
        No says the man in Moscow, it belongs to everyone!
            I rejected those answers!
                Instead, I chose something different.
                    I chose the impossible‚Ä¶
                        I chose... Rapture.
                            *cue one of the greatest intro cutscenes of all time*
                            SHARK TALE BABYYY
    Irony as it‚Äôs the other way round now, a modern bio shock would be ‚Äúno, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the rich.‚Äù (Or the corporations.)
        I think the irony was purposeful on the part of Bioshock's writers. In their time as well, the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, because all the answers are unfair. 

Ryan rejected those answers, but his answer is unfair too. "It belongs to the one who pays for it." The issue is clearly seen with Professor Langford, who dedicated her life to maintaining the Arcadia, and Ryan killed it because he bought her rights. 

The point is that rights are inalienable. Ryan is a hypocrite, but he made an excellent point at the beginning of his speach: the sweat of their brow belongs to the one who sheds it, every single time they shed it.
I, rejected those answers!
    I CHOOSE...REDDIT!
        Hhahahahhaha
        https://media.tenor.com/YNBKbwhjfNcAAAAM/the-simpsons-ralph-wiggum.gif took me a moment to realize you were holding the o lol
The man in Moscow would spread it to the rest of the crowd.
Stop working so hard I‚Äôll get you a towel
NO, says the capitalist, it belongs to your employer!
Would you kindly provide a specific example?
[deleted]
    No Sherlock, Shit.
        Shit Sherlock, No.
    There always has to be that one person who ruins the vibe with a stupid negative comment.  Cheer up dude.  Enjoy the comments.
YES. he‚Äôs simultaneously my enemies in both games lmao, he looks a lot like House
    every fictional capitalist character--andrew ryan, mister house, joey drew--looks like a combination of walt disney and howard hughes
        Coincidence? I think not!
        Hahahaha so real
        Joey Drew looks like Peter Parker's boss.
    Funny that they both died the same way.
The pre fallout Mr house üòÇ‚Ä¶ the fallout Mr house looks like a living breathing mummification gone wrong
You can kill Mr. House with a golf club in New Vegas and it references Bioshock. I think it was one of the challenges you have to complete in the game.
    I was told "Go do this,the gun runners achievement is great." And I was not let down.
This!
Dude‚Äôs skin isn‚Äôt nearly desiccated enough to be mister house.
They're basically the same character lol
Exactly what I‚Äôm thinking
Im bioshock
    John Bioshock
        He doesn't afraid of anything
        Bio shock
        *Who is John Bioshock?*
        Well Jack is somehow short for John.

Coincidence?

I think not!
    Bioshooketh
        I am Bio-*shook.*
A slave obeys
    Now would you kindly
        Go in there and kill the son of a bitch?
            OBEY!!!

*gets his face caved in with a golf club*
                *gurgle noises*
Loves it so much he would die for it.
Kinda
    Those who live by the club will die by the club
        Best fucking comment. Ever.
            Of all time.
    Mr. Ryan is just playing a game of mini golf with his son
The what
    Plasmids are what will give you magic in the game bioshock and also caused the downfall of rapture/the under water city
        Damn üóø
            You really need to play the game.  It's the best game hands down
        Bro, what are you doing???? He hasnt INVENTED them yet. Mf hasnt even met Fontaine yet
I‚Äôll take a look
I almost forgot how utterly brilliant the whole story was...may need to replay them all
    I played through the first game all the way through on release. Such a great game.
Oh my god finally someone out of the cod zombies reddit who says that
    Was about to second the Tank Dempsey statement!
    It's a pretty accurate statement
Could u imagine using ai voice generator and doing a andrew ryan let's play of bioshock
I can't wait for the moment when John Bioshock Infinites all over the place
    I love it when John Bioshock enters Minerva's Den üòè
A man
    You definitely look like a man who chooses. ü§å

(Also, highly recommend the games)
Lmao
Ye
Or Primis Richtofen
I posted a pic on another subreddit and people said i look like someone from bioshock so i had curiosity
Not upvotes but opinions, if there was an option to disable upvotes I would turn it on
They had fun
Omg I saw your pfp then went and saw your posts. Haha
    Oorah
Basically ask for a executive contour haircut
    And a lot of hair gel
A SLAVE OBEYS
Ah fuck someone beat me to it
Yeah i was doing some kind of primis tank dempsey style
    You totally nailed the look by the way! It looks awesome!
Im not even mewing üóø
Depends
Thats my plan
üóø
Waiting for a jacket to complete the look
What about tank dempsey
    Ooh looking back on it, abit of blonde dye and you would be a perfect Orgins Dempsey
        More like primis dempsey, the one from origins, so basically a more brownish hair
Lmao
I thought we were done with this, Richtofen!
    There is much to do, the vessel for Maxis, the staffs, the opening of the gateway.
Lmao
Some people on another subreddit, but nothing related to videogames
    They said something out of bioshock
        I really asked that now for this sub than you look. The phrase "would you kindly" has a significant meaning in the context of the games, the first one specifically, and is closely tired to the guy you look like. Good games too, I recommend giving em a try. You won't regret it if you're a shooter guy who likes solving problems.
Oorah
Oorah
    After looking at your profile, it appears I am not the first person to draw that conclusion
        Yeah lmao
Fallout new Vegas
Nah more like primis tank dempsey
