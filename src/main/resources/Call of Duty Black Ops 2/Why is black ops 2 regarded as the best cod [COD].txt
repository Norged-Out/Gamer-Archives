[[Why is black ops 2 regarded as the best cod [COD]]]

It’s the best all around multiplayer. Balanced, great maps, less bullshit than MW2. Suits all play styles. Pick 10 is the best create a class system in COD history for me. First real camo grind. Campaign wasn’t as good as the others but it was innovative. Side missions, creating a class for single player and your choices impact the story. I don’t really like the zombies, but Buried and Origins are alright.
    League play integration too
    You can have your opinion on the zombies but its important to point out that the vast majority likes the zombies A LOT
        True, but I'm giving my opinion, not theirs.
            Very important point, a point that alot of people look past lol
            Yes. Which is why i said what i said since op asked why bo2 is generally regarded as the best cod. In this context the majoritys opinion on the game is more relevant than yours
                You're out of line but you're right
                ![gif](giphy|twxoPjMpsijwPFBVqs|downsized)
                Lol
        At the time BO1 was considered to be a better zombies experience
    You're wrong about something. The Campaign was *better* than many of the others. Custom loadouts, choices, different outcomes for most missions, two different time periods- it innovated in many ways.

The antagonist was one of the best we've seen in the series.
    I think it's all the weapons. I was playing bo1 and bo cold war and neither have many of the guns you see in this one. 
    It has the best campaign
    this +nostalgia
    Nah the first real camo grind was definitely BO3, cuz the best camos in BO2 was the ones you had to pay to get.

Not sure why I'm getting down voted it's the truth bo2 didn't even have a mastery camo and Bo3 did SMH🤓💀
    The multiplayer also had boring maps, very few standout weapons and rather poor sound design and immersion. I think it was the best multiplayer if you were into the sanitized League Play experience, but that’s it
        Yeah, I loved Blops, but the thing about mw2 that made it my favorite was that everything was so busted that literally every weapon was viable lol.
    Origins is the best zombies map, period. I get maybe not digging all of them but Origins man cmon that shit is too fun.
        I'm mostly a multiplayer guy, I play zombies casually so I'm not too into the easter eggs and whatnot. Its why buried is my favorite BO2 map. My favorite zombies are BO1 and CW.
            I can partially agree with CW, but it's still kind of broken and the last map was disappointing imo. But the first 3 dlcs were great, and Outbreak was cool-ish because it kind of gave the zombies community what it wanted with a "open-world campaign".
                I like forsaken, the Easter egg boss was kind of disappointing tho
                Cold War is just the most fun survival zombies to me. It’s always fun to pop open Die Maschine or Firebase Z.
    Oh i miss the pick 10 create a class so much. I played Cold War these days , i think it is pretty fun , but the wild cards doesnt feel that good , perk greed just seems like the best option 90% of the time, and you dont need to sacrifice grenades or secondary to have it 

Also , why the hell cant i have a shotgun+melee/pistol combo without wasting my wildcard ? Who the hell made that decision. Having LMG/Sniper with a shotgun ? Alright no problem, now having a Shotgun with a pistol? No , too broken , needs wildcard
    I don’t think it’s better than BO1 or close
    How much GB is Black Ops 2 on PC?
        Around 15.
It had the closest thing to balance in multiplayer you’re gonna get in a cod. Just about every map was good if not great. Introduced league play, pick 10, score streaks. These things have become or should have become standards in the series. It also came out at a time where cod was big but gaming wasn’t so big that every single person on the game was a sweaty wanna be streamer. It was just a good time, and no game has been as good.
[deleted]
    You mean before streaming was popular? Plenty of people played pre 2011 it just wasn't as popular as it is today where you can make a living playing video games
I liked Black Ops 2 because the TTK was so much better. It was the best-balanced CoD at the time imo. MW2 had a ton of balancing issues and the fast TTK didn't help. BO2 had decent maps, amazing zombies, fun kill streaks and no weapon was really that broken as MW2. Go play BO2 and you see why people love the game so much.
    But that isnt realistic lol it's like every other shooter.. a few bullets should indeed kill the target
        Nobody cares about realism in cod bro
            Clearly, not even the creators
                Different markets dawg, there are a solid few milsims if you'd rather. Cod just really isn't one.
                yea no shit, if you’re looking for realism in call of duty you’re a dunce
                    Bet you loved all the black ops
The campaign in Black Ops 2 was amazing and better than the first one in my opinion. Black Ops 2 also had great multiplayer and zombies.
    Was thinking about playing BO1 and 2 campaigns when they likely drop on Game Pass
        Great! I highly recommend them. They’re two of the best campaigns in COD in my opinion.
    Zombies wasnt really good bc it only had 3 good maps
        MOTD and Origins are in almost every zombies fans top 5 and Buried is the perfect casual map.. yet you think bo2 wasn't good? lol
    It was fun being able to build your loadout and I wished they brought it back some more.
Black ops 2 is just so insanely polished. It runs amazingly well, it's balanced, it's a ton of fun. There are no noobtubes to get frustrated by, and no real bugs. It just *feels* good
BECAUSE ITS FUCKING GOOD
BO1 is the best!
    I would have agreed, but I truly feel that BO1's hit detection is trash and it keeps it from being that GOAT. If they had refined that then yes, it would have been the best 100%
        I understand where you’re coming from, I just got back on the game for the first time in forever. Definitely had issues with shots on people not registering. After a few games you adjust to the hitbox and I started doing better. Hitbox could be better but if you play the game a lot you get used to it, I’ve been playing it most nights
    BO1 is also very good.  I believe that BO2 is the most balanced and that’s why it’s number 1 but BO1 is great in its own way and pretty close even with the bad hit detection.
        can’t beat the sound tracks
            BO1 and WAW menu music is so nostalgic for me. Reminds me of all the fun playing them as a kid.
                Exactly, when I loaded it up a few days ago I had the biggest smile when I heard the multiplayer lobby soundtrack. Gonna load up some mw2 later and reminisce some Campaign.
    I love black ops 1. Although alot of the maps aren't good and there's only a few viable guns.
        Yeah the regular maps are limited, with the DLCs; the maps are amazing. Sadly there’s not much luck finding any lobbies as most people have new accounts and don’t want to pay $15 and not find any matches.
I think it's largely because, it had an incredible MP, it was the first Cod set in the more distant future with futuristic technology (technically Cod4 and MW2 were set in the future but still stayed more grounded in mostly modern technology) and a lot of people either started playing during BO2 or had got to the level where they were good at Cod so could enjoy it more, nostalgia and YouTube BO2 clips blowing up at the time.

The game wasn't as good as BO1 tho, I think most who actually played both in their prime would agree, it's Campaign was weaker and it's Zombie's weren't as good as BO1, only BO2s MP was on the level of BO1 IMO.
    I agree, BO2s MP is the only thing that makes it the best cod.  It’s like they took BO1 and made it less clunky and more balanced.
1. Every weapon was viable, fun to use and good looking too with a variety of cool camos to earn and mostly reasonable challenges attached to the grind.

2. Solid map design across the board, DLC included. Cannot remember a single stinker here.

3. The introduction of the Pick 10 system, a fantastic overhaul to class customization. Combined with an excellent selection of well balanced perks, no CoD SINCE has had greater class variety and balance between classes.

4. Introduction of Scorestreaks and loopable streaks. Players were rewarded for every action they did, and players no longer needed to die in order to keep using streaks. The scorestreaks themselves were all strong, viable, and more accessible to earn than ever before.

That's just me talking about the multiplayer, the campaign was also excellent with a great villain and multiple story outcomes based on your actions or decisions you made, a first for the series.

I wasn't much of a Zombies guy, so someone else would have to talk about it, but I remember it being fun as well with solid DLC.
It was the game that started my disinterest in the series. Never liked the futuristic stuff, and I thought they jumped the shark with it from where they ended BO1, although it wasn’t as bad as the games after it in hindsight. Wasn’t a fan of most of the guns. Zombies wasn’t even that good to me until Origins came out, but I was probably just too attached to the original group.
I haven’t seen many people mention this but for me B02 was in my opinion one of the most fun games when it came sniping/trickshoting. The community was amazing from some players creating clans and having tryouts to content creators like Faze, Optic etc having recruitment challenges it really felt like a tight knit community. Plus the campaign was easily top 5 as well as zombies, even if you weren’t into it. Just my thoughts though.
    Mw2 was definitely the best for quickscoping, plus faze and optic were a huge thing on mw2 too
***SPOILERS*** 

100% agree. WaW, BO1, CoD 4, WW2 and so many more were so much better than Black Ops 2. I know what people mean about the BO2 Zombies and i can kind of understand the multiplayer, but the campaign was weak. 

I enjoyed the Mason and Woods missions in BO2 but they massively slowed down the character development of David Mason, Harper, Salazar and other characters. This meant that when you are forced to shoot Harper (the canon decision) it didn’t have the same effect as Soap’s death or even Yuri’s at a push, and he only had dialogue in one mission and some cutscenes. When Salazar betrayed you, I didn’t feel very betrayed at all. The only death that made me sad was Alex Mason’s if you shot him in the head instead of the leg. Or Frank Woods’ death if you tried to shoot Menendez instead of Harper.
Probably because it came at a time when we all had the time to spend every spare hour on it and we got good.
And the genre hadn’t been saturated with variants and spin offs.
Everything everyone else is saying plus the campaign having multiple endings depending on your choices was crazy for Call of Duty
I never enjoyed the feel of black ops games,  same with vanguard.  Always felt modern warfare games felt smoother. MW2 is best for me 🤷‍♂️
    I really enjoyed black ops 1 (blops 2&3 zombies was great tho). But yeah mw multiplayer was always better imo
        Black ops for zombies but mw multiplayer allll day
Mw2 is the Goat. The end
I can't choose between Mw2 or Bo2. They are tied. The campaigns came to me at a time when I needed the lessons and feel good vibe you can get from the choices you make and mw2 was a bonded experience I had with my now dead father. They have nostalgia but when I play them today they are still enjoyable. Unless you're on pc. Don't buy any cod games past or present on pc
Well I'm not one of those people lol, matter of fact BO2 was the straw that broke the camels back for me as it was my last COD I played until MW came out. The futuristic shit and having to put an entire clip into someone was too much
Because it was the last good game before ghosts came around and “ruined” everything. Imo I love all games from ghosts-mwII. Funny thing is that when bo2 was in its prime it was such a hated game. I remember people talking about how trash bo2 is but now it’s known as the best cod of all time. Bo2 is fun and all but I like bo3 more imo.
Black ops 1 had better maps and better classes than Bo2. 2 is by far overrated. It's good, but not better.
Purely it was the game most of us played in childhood or over, a lot of memories were made playing this game and was an amazing experience and will always look back fondly. Was regarded the the golden era of COD for a reason
Amazing campaign and multiplayer that was well balanced, had great maps and the pick 10 system was dope
WAW is and will always be the goat
No it’s definitely overrated. Game was alright but nowhere near being the best. Not even too 3. Maybe not even top 5
Nostalgia. A huge chunk of the community also started playing cod when BO2 came out.
    Honestly it's mostly this. Three years ago it was Black Ops 1. And before that it was MW2, then CoD4...
    Nope, actually. I mean, yes- nostalgia isn't a small thing, but the Campaign was excellent, Zombies was enjoyed by most, and the multiplayer was nearly perfect. Balance was strong, map designs were great, aesthetics were well-done, progression and challenges were well-done, microtransactions were fair, sound design was pretty good, Theater Mode was included, no SBMM, League Play was a decent and well-done attempt at a more competitive experience, Lobby Leaderboards, Emblem Editor, I could go on.

Campaign innovated in multiple ways and did many unique things, setting it apart from many of the others. Great antagonist, split time periods, custom loadouts and bonus objectives, multiple choices and outcomes for multiple missions, side missions, etc.
        I agree that they put more thought and effort into the games back then. The campaigns had real meaning and weren't near rehashes. The maps and zombies were more thought out as well.
    That makes more sense, when COD went to shit was when everyone started playing.. mostly kids
    Why is it always nostalgia? Cod4, waw and bo2/bo1 are by far the best cods ever made.
        Because it's mostly nostalgia that makes you think that way. Objectively were those games **better** than what we have today? Well, I think that depends on the player. I lean towards yes but that could very well be nostalgia-driven. Were the games more well made than the ones today? Again, it's subjective.
            Cod4, waw and bo2 are 100% better and more well made then any modern cod imo. People love to go on about how mw2019 had good graphics and good gun sounds all that shit but imo it doesnt matter if the core gameplay and every map is absolute dog shit. Your right tho it could be nostalgia playing a part but i honestly feel those 3 games are better than anything cod has put out these past few years, look at infinity ward mw2019 and mw2 are some of the worst cods ive played, i still have faith treyarch can deliver but im pretty much done with cod these days.
        cod4? nah
            why not
COD 4 is the best, just some vocal kids on the internet believe that.

Talk to any OG, COD 4, MW2, and Black Ops is the Golden Era. WaW honorable mention. MW3 wasn’t terrible. Black Ops 2 is great but after Advanced Warfare it marked the beginning of the futuristic sliding colorful microtransaction era. Now I liked BO2 the multiplayer was good and the maps were fun. But that’s where the trend downslopes. I forget what order they all came out in at this point but everything after MW3 for Sledgehammer and BO3 and on just killed cod.

If you guys don’t know the COD4 remaster community is well and kicking, you can’t get obscure game mode lobbies but you can get into most standard playlists and even hardcore TDM and S&D are alive and kicking during the evenings (I’m on West coast in Cali)
    I have been playing COD since Finest Hour. I remember playing COD 4 and first playing online..my mind was blown. I played all the games after that for countless hours. COD 4 is still the best imo. The simplicity and elegance combined with legendary maps really tested your skill. You didn’t have any real tweaks you could get besides perks. Black Ops is my number two
        You said it, simple…elegant…and legendary maps. No bullshit. Balanced perk system (some may argue this) simple kill streaks, it’s a true test of skill amongst players. Oh man and the C4 in this game is just too fun.

Black Ops might be my number 2 as well, the maps + the DLC maps, HC S&D with ghost pro, ninja pro, and a spy cam with a silenced galil, gtfo some of the most fun and competitive games I’ve ever been in. Oh and high rolling competitive gun game matches were the shit!
    Cod4, waw and bo2 are goated mw3 was ass
        Specialist kill streak and infected were top tier
        I really didn’t like MW3
    nah
Nostalgia. Game’s overrated like crazy. If it was my first COD game, I’m sure I’d be saying something different. But I already played 5 good CODs by the time BO2 came about. So when I played it I was unimpressed really. 

I won’t slander the zombies & campaign but the MP is mid.
    I played all the cods before it and I still think bo2 was miles better
        Tell your crew we have work for them.
    Yeah I guess it would have been a lot of peoples first game, and that compared to the cods that came after would have looked amazing. I don’t even remember the campaign but I remember thinking it was bad compared to previous cods
    Ah yes a great game regarded for making good changes compared to the previous iteration is “overrated”
It did everything right. It had the most balanced multiplayer in COD history, a fantastic campaign, and it elevated Zombies to becoming one of the main selling points for the black ops series. BO2 was the first time I had people telling me they got the game just to play zombies.
    While the zombies was amazing, it did not elevate zombies to become the main selling point. World at war made zombies what it was and black ops 1 built on top of that. Zombies would have been in future treyarch games regardless. I can see that people would of bought it just for zombies though, but again only because black ops 1 made it a standard thing and people were expecting it
        No doubt WAW started something beautiful and BO1 was legendary as well. Maybe I just jumped on the hype train later than others, but I feel like BO2 was when you started getting a lot of your EE enthusiasts, people digging deeply into the lore, etc. it felt to me like zombies became pretty much a separate entity entirely, although I can completely see people feeling that way even before BO2.
            I get what you are saying, but yeah again I feel that the dlcs for black ops 1 started that with maps like ascension, call of the dead and shangri-la all containing cool complex EEs and story. I think it is because a lot of people on the internet these days started out (or at least really got into cod) at that era
You need a psyc eval if you think BO2 is overrated it’s arguably the best COD of all time
I also don't get it and am happy to see someone else on the same page. I hated the pick 10 system (still do), I could not tell you the name of a single map, and I had infinitely more fun in WaW zombies. MW2, although not the most balanced as others have  said, was so much more fun IMO. I always feel like I missed out on BO2 because of how highly many people think back on it, but I played it plenty when it was a new game and always would just shut it off and go back to MW2 and WaW.
I believe it's because black ops 2 was an actual genuine fun game
Nowadays it's just about playing because what else are you going to do with your life?
Mw2 multiplayer was terrible and bo2 is better than bo1 mp wise. Cod4, waw and bo2 are the goated cods.
It's the first game that a lot of the current community played.
    Yeah I think that’s the main thing. Keep seeing people saying how good the campaign was, but even the og CoDs (1,2,3 etc were better imo)
Black ops 2 was extremely balanced. Every weapon felt fun to use but also unique. There were annoying things you could do, but it was hard to counter those things. 

Also, the pick 10 system is the greatest thing ever created.
    Chicom CQB wasn't bad and I'm going to die on that hill.
        Some guns weren't great but they were still fun and usable. The executioner pistol is my favorite example of bad but still alot of fun.
            Man, those things would garner a lot of rage, especially if you used them Akimbo. I think the KAP-40 was the best of the pistols, maybe tied with the Five-Seven and Tac-45.

Honestly, now that I think about it, all the secondaries were quite good if you used them within their effective ranges. Lots of 2-3 shot kills.
                I loved using secondaries in BO2. They were all honestly really good and unique in there own ways but none were ridiculously overpowered.
Personally not my favorite but I did like it. Good variety of weapons, good maps, introduction of league play, introduction of score streaks, introduction of pick 10. It innovated a lot and still was very good which can be hard to do. I personally preferred MW2, BO1, and MW3 but by all accounts BO2 was a great game
Black ops 2 had the first interactive campaign with multiple endings, cycled back and forth with 80’s with mason and woods to 2025 with harper and section, you were able to make you own class before you started the mission and adding strike force which changes the ending to the game
Legendary campaign
Legendary multiplayer 
Great zombies
    Campaign was nothing compared to blops 1 and anything that came before that tho. Not aimed at you, but I think a lot of people forget or don’t even know that cod was 99% focused on campaign before og modern warfare came out
        I too prefer BO1’s campaign by a small amount but Raul Menendez was a far more memorable villain than Dragovich. You can’t say there wasn’t a lot of focus on this campaign since you were given the opportunity to create-a-class and have multiple choices throughout, along with side missions. BO2 was Treyarch’s most ambitious campaign by far
There was massive risk taking and innovation in every aspect of BO2

First futuristic cod, multiple story campaign, the brighter colour palette was unlike other cods, pick 10 system, a zombies map where you moved from major section to section on a bus (although it sucked), challenges and camo grinds, introduced grief mode in zombies, league play in multiplayer, scorestreaks instead of killstreaks finally rewarded OBJ, and a lot of the scorestreaks like were innovative like hunter killer, dragonfire, swarm, AGR.
    I actually liked transit, idk why it gets so much hate (not the best map obviously but still great)
99% of the maps were good. 99% of the weapons/equipment/perks were good. Profile customization such as titles and emblems (especially emblems) were good. Gun camos were good. Killstreaks were good. Zombies was mostly good. 

There really isn’t much to not like here. They did a very very good job at making this game great. Not saying it’s perfect, but it was great. Are there other cods that were also pretty damn good? Yeah but I don’t think they’ve gotten nearly as good as a formula going as bo2 did.
    I enjoyed black ops2 multiplayer because I played it with friends, but other than that idk I never really thought it was that great. Had better experiences on all the other CoDs
        I mean it is only just an opinion. Bo2 isn’t my favorite cod either but I can easily see why people think it’s the best.
in bo2 each weapon category stayed in their league. the maps weren’t total dog shit there wasn’t like 20 camping spots everywhere, the weapons actually had recoil which meant you couldn’t just rely on aiming from a distance, the customization was peak, dead silence was a perk and not a power up, there were no weapons at all that were forgotten or unused due to being bad, the zombies was easily the most innovative it’s ever been, the campaign was good, there’s a reason why bo2 is always called the best cod of all time. several reasons actually 

and unlike mw2 there wasn’t anything that was obnoxiously op, there weren’t more noob tubes flying through the air than bullets. bo1 multiplayer was pretty bad imo there were like 3 op guns that everybody used, the rest of all the guns were just straight up irrelevant, so many maps were simple triple choke points, the assault rifles were op *again* for like the 10th time, it just wasn’t balanced at all. there was like 1 decent sniper 1 good shotgun and all the lmgs were mediocre at best
Best maps, best weapon variety, amazing zombies and amazing campaign. Not that hard to figure out why.
I agree its overrated. The broken camera angles and netcode alone make it terrible to play. Maybe on paper its a great game but in practice I found it very unenjoyable.
bo2 had different endings which was cool and it also had 2 time periods and i also liked the 2025 technology which was futuristic but not too futuristic
It's not, it's actually where I, and a lot of friends dropped the series.
BO2 had a much more balanced MP than MW2. MW2 was fun but at the same time there is so much rage inducing bullshit in the game that made me want to quit playing out of frustration at times (OMA Tubes, Commando, Painkiller)
It's not the best, CoD. There arefew Treyarch games that would even make it into the top 5.
I missed most of bo2 generation, and I'm reading all the replies here. I played a little but minimally.  I'm sure it is fantastic, I only ever heard people rave too. I just don't know how MW2 could be beaten overall, shit was too legendary and fun.
I’m done says who?
My favorite was playing MW3, BO1 and BO2 aaaand going to earlier games because why not. BO2 was kinda the best when it was in its prime AND you had all the DLC maps. Those were by far the best dlc maps they ever created.

The desert map, paintball map and all that shit man it was so fun
During its lifecycle, it felt like it was the best game in the series. When compared to other games its flaws start to show but it's still a majorly solid game in its own right. I prefer BO1 personally but still dig a lot about BO2.
Its not mw2 or mw3 is
Yeah i think its overrated aswell, aspecially because the amount of hackers, tryhards and the fact there is like 1 good zombies map
Maps, guns, score streaks and zombies were all top tier. It's rare to find a game you can't say anything negative about.
I've never seen someone argue that WaW is better than BO2, very interesting.
Best multiplayer buts that’s about it. I also got a gf around the time that game dropped so I lost interest pretty quick 😂
Ghosts and the boost cods coming after it greatly boosted how people saw the game. If you wanted to play a fun boots on the ground cod game/stuck on last gen then BO2 was for you. 

It took years to get to GOAT status.
The best maps and mechanics. Matches seemed pretty even, and the entire year’s DLC cost as much as one skin now.
COD 4 is the best one for me
I personally think it's just an okay CoD. Compared to MW2 it felt worse, for me personally. Maps were okay. Gun choices were plenty, but that dn hit detection in this game... I can't stomach this.
Black Ops 2 is utter garbage in my opinion and drove me away from COD for a good few years after religiously playing it for about 5 years before black ops 2. 

I hated it, thought the campaign was boring, multiplayer did nothing for me didn't like the maps probably, didn't like the futuristic setting even back then, the call announcements annoyed me for some reason. It just wasn't for me, maybe I was burnt out by that point but yeah I'm with you. It's a low tier CoD to me I much prefered Ghosts and that's saying something
MW2 and black ops 2 were definitely the best cod’s ever created. This new mw2 remake is so darn glitchy in multiplayer and warzone its a shame.
Wow thats a hot take. Menendez even at his best was no makarov. Ill always remember MW2 and MW3 as the best COD games in history.
It’s not, black ops 2 doesn’t even make it top 5 for me, it’s the first year I actually skipped cod, Bo1 is one of the best, which explains why it’s the #1 best selling cod of all time
No one mentioned ghosts
As some haven’t mentioned this, this is the game I feel like made CWL popular in the fan base. I didn’t know about CWL before this game came out and the introduction of league play made me do research as to why this was even integrated into the game in the first place and I discovered CWL and I probably wasn’t the only one who did. I don’t really follow the CWL scene but some do religiously still to this day
Pick 10 class system, good guns, good maps, and most importantly NO SKILL BASED MATCH MAKING!
Campaign is also the best IMO because

  
1. Your choices change the outcome of the story

2. You have the ability to customize your loadout before every mission

BONUS: >!Death to the MPLA meme originated from this!<
Zombies and multiplayer. 

The best way to describe BO2 multiplayer is to think of MW2 but instead of everything being overpowered, everything is very balanced. Plus the maps with just amazing.
I mean, i could tell you, but it would all be personal opinion.

I think its fondly remembered for being the last good COD in the eyes of the fans, the end of an era.
**Speaking on the campaign:**

BO2 is seen as the best because of the fact it didn’t have a traditional storyline. It was ambitious in the way that you had 3-4 different endings dependent on the choices you made. 

Idk why they didnt keep doing that. Later games had different choices, yes. But not in the way that BO2 was and i wish they had done more like that.
MW2 was a broken mess of a multiplayer. BO2 had better graphics, better perks, better create a class, had a really amazing campaign and some of the best zombies maps of all time. You cant in good conscience say that MW2 was the best multiplayer when one man army STILL exists. Along with the UMP45 with stopping power, and the AA12. WaW was the most infested with hackers and had juggernaut, as well as a fairly basic zombies mode. BO1 is a close contender in my opinion but I prefer the futuristic mixed with the BO1 style in BO2. 

TLDR; MW2 is overrated, WaW was lacking in certain departments, BO1 is a close contender.
Because it has one of the best cod mps. It had good map selection (not as good maps as BO1 or Mw2 base maps though). Had good balance like MW3 did. Just was fun to play. Personally I think MW2, MW3, and MW19 mp are better than BO2s mp. I also think BO2 has one of the worst cod campaigns in the series up there with Vanguard, BO3, and Cod WW2s campaign. It's zombies was a huge step back from BO1s to me. Only map I enjoyed in BO2 was Mob of the Dead. But its MP alone carries it hard. Kind of  like how BO3 is carried by its fantastic zombies despite its mediocre mp and shit campaign.  It also was a big step up from BO1 for 3arc. It was 3arcs first great cod mp after WaW and BO1s not very good mps.
Mw2 was a broken noob tube and commando lunge filled mess with some good maps and a lot of horrible big f...king maps. Outside of terminal none of those mw2 maps compete with bo1 and bo2 maps. Bo2 had the best balance bo1 had the best maps. Though my favorite maps are from bo2. I didn't get into zombies until cold war. Never played world at War multi-player. I'm fine with people saying bo1 is better because bo2 and bo1 are 1 and 2 for me. I consider black ops 2 and bf3 the best fps games ever made. Bo1 eliminated quickscoping mostly which was fine I didn't learn quickscoping until bo2 but it also made smgs unviable as well. Who wants to use an smg when you have the famas being the most broken weapon in the game. In bo2 there was a counter for everything and any playstyle was viable. They balanced the dsr which was broken. They went a little too far on the pdw which was also broken.
League play integration too
You can have your opinion on the zombies but its important to point out that the vast majority likes the zombies A LOT
    True, but I'm giving my opinion, not theirs.
        Very important point, a point that alot of people look past lol
        Yes. Which is why i said what i said since op asked why bo2 is generally regarded as the best cod. In this context the majoritys opinion on the game is more relevant than yours
            You're out of line but you're right
            ![gif](giphy|twxoPjMpsijwPFBVqs|downsized)
            Lol
    At the time BO1 was considered to be a better zombies experience
You're wrong about something. The Campaign was *better* than many of the others. Custom loadouts, choices, different outcomes for most missions, two different time periods- it innovated in many ways.

The antagonist was one of the best we've seen in the series.
I think it's all the weapons. I was playing bo1 and bo cold war and neither have many of the guns you see in this one. 
It has the best campaign
this +nostalgia
Nah the first real camo grind was definitely BO3, cuz the best camos in BO2 was the ones you had to pay to get.

Not sure why I'm getting down voted it's the truth bo2 didn't even have a mastery camo and Bo3 did SMH🤓💀
The multiplayer also had boring maps, very few standout weapons and rather poor sound design and immersion. I think it was the best multiplayer if you were into the sanitized League Play experience, but that’s it
    Yeah, I loved Blops, but the thing about mw2 that made it my favorite was that everything was so busted that literally every weapon was viable lol.
Origins is the best zombies map, period. I get maybe not digging all of them but Origins man cmon that shit is too fun.
    I'm mostly a multiplayer guy, I play zombies casually so I'm not too into the easter eggs and whatnot. Its why buried is my favorite BO2 map. My favorite zombies are BO1 and CW.
        I can partially agree with CW, but it's still kind of broken and the last map was disappointing imo. But the first 3 dlcs were great, and Outbreak was cool-ish because it kind of gave the zombies community what it wanted with a "open-world campaign".
            I like forsaken, the Easter egg boss was kind of disappointing tho
            Cold War is just the most fun survival zombies to me. It’s always fun to pop open Die Maschine or Firebase Z.
Oh i miss the pick 10 create a class so much. I played Cold War these days , i think it is pretty fun , but the wild cards doesnt feel that good , perk greed just seems like the best option 90% of the time, and you dont need to sacrifice grenades or secondary to have it 

Also , why the hell cant i have a shotgun+melee/pistol combo without wasting my wildcard ? Who the hell made that decision. Having LMG/Sniper with a shotgun ? Alright no problem, now having a Shotgun with a pistol? No , too broken , needs wildcard
I don’t think it’s better than BO1 or close
How much GB is Black Ops 2 on PC?
    Around 15.
You mean before streaming was popular? Plenty of people played pre 2011 it just wasn't as popular as it is today where you can make a living playing video games
But that isnt realistic lol it's like every other shooter.. a few bullets should indeed kill the target
    Nobody cares about realism in cod bro
        Clearly, not even the creators
            Different markets dawg, there are a solid few milsims if you'd rather. Cod just really isn't one.
            yea no shit, if you’re looking for realism in call of duty you’re a dunce
                Bet you loved all the black ops
Was thinking about playing BO1 and 2 campaigns when they likely drop on Game Pass
    Great! I highly recommend them. They’re two of the best campaigns in COD in my opinion.
Zombies wasnt really good bc it only had 3 good maps
    MOTD and Origins are in almost every zombies fans top 5 and Buried is the perfect casual map.. yet you think bo2 wasn't good? lol
It was fun being able to build your loadout and I wished they brought it back some more.
I would have agreed, but I truly feel that BO1's hit detection is trash and it keeps it from being that GOAT. If they had refined that then yes, it would have been the best 100%
    I understand where you’re coming from, I just got back on the game for the first time in forever. Definitely had issues with shots on people not registering. After a few games you adjust to the hitbox and I started doing better. Hitbox could be better but if you play the game a lot you get used to it, I’ve been playing it most nights
BO1 is also very good.  I believe that BO2 is the most balanced and that’s why it’s number 1 but BO1 is great in its own way and pretty close even with the bad hit detection.
    can’t beat the sound tracks
        BO1 and WAW menu music is so nostalgic for me. Reminds me of all the fun playing them as a kid.
            Exactly, when I loaded it up a few days ago I had the biggest smile when I heard the multiplayer lobby soundtrack. Gonna load up some mw2 later and reminisce some Campaign.
I love black ops 1. Although alot of the maps aren't good and there's only a few viable guns.
    Yeah the regular maps are limited, with the DLCs; the maps are amazing. Sadly there’s not much luck finding any lobbies as most people have new accounts and don’t want to pay $15 and not find any matches.
I agree, BO2s MP is the only thing that makes it the best cod.  It’s like they took BO1 and made it less clunky and more balanced.
Mw2 was definitely the best for quickscoping, plus faze and optic were a huge thing on mw2 too
I really enjoyed black ops 1 (blops 2&3 zombies was great tho). But yeah mw multiplayer was always better imo
    Black ops for zombies but mw multiplayer allll day
Honestly it's mostly this. Three years ago it was Black Ops 1. And before that it was MW2, then CoD4...
Nope, actually. I mean, yes- nostalgia isn't a small thing, but the Campaign was excellent, Zombies was enjoyed by most, and the multiplayer was nearly perfect. Balance was strong, map designs were great, aesthetics were well-done, progression and challenges were well-done, microtransactions were fair, sound design was pretty good, Theater Mode was included, no SBMM, League Play was a decent and well-done attempt at a more competitive experience, Lobby Leaderboards, Emblem Editor, I could go on.

Campaign innovated in multiple ways and did many unique things, setting it apart from many of the others. Great antagonist, split time periods, custom loadouts and bonus objectives, multiple choices and outcomes for multiple missions, side missions, etc.
    I agree that they put more thought and effort into the games back then. The campaigns had real meaning and weren't near rehashes. The maps and zombies were more thought out as well.
That makes more sense, when COD went to shit was when everyone started playing.. mostly kids
Why is it always nostalgia? Cod4, waw and bo2/bo1 are by far the best cods ever made.
    Because it's mostly nostalgia that makes you think that way. Objectively were those games **better** than what we have today? Well, I think that depends on the player. I lean towards yes but that could very well be nostalgia-driven. Were the games more well made than the ones today? Again, it's subjective.
        Cod4, waw and bo2 are 100% better and more well made then any modern cod imo. People love to go on about how mw2019 had good graphics and good gun sounds all that shit but imo it doesnt matter if the core gameplay and every map is absolute dog shit. Your right tho it could be nostalgia playing a part but i honestly feel those 3 games are better than anything cod has put out these past few years, look at infinity ward mw2019 and mw2 are some of the worst cods ive played, i still have faith treyarch can deliver but im pretty much done with cod these days.
    cod4? nah
        why not
I have been playing COD since Finest Hour. I remember playing COD 4 and first playing online..my mind was blown. I played all the games after that for countless hours. COD 4 is still the best imo. The simplicity and elegance combined with legendary maps really tested your skill. You didn’t have any real tweaks you could get besides perks. Black Ops is my number two
    You said it, simple…elegant…and legendary maps. No bullshit. Balanced perk system (some may argue this) simple kill streaks, it’s a true test of skill amongst players. Oh man and the C4 in this game is just too fun.

Black Ops might be my number 2 as well, the maps + the DLC maps, HC S&D with ghost pro, ninja pro, and a spy cam with a silenced galil, gtfo some of the most fun and competitive games I’ve ever been in. Oh and high rolling competitive gun game matches were the shit!
Cod4, waw and bo2 are goated mw3 was ass
    Specialist kill streak and infected were top tier
    I really didn’t like MW3
nah
I played all the cods before it and I still think bo2 was miles better
    Tell your crew we have work for them.
Yeah I guess it would have been a lot of peoples first game, and that compared to the cods that came after would have looked amazing. I don’t even remember the campaign but I remember thinking it was bad compared to previous cods
Ah yes a great game regarded for making good changes compared to the previous iteration is “overrated”
While the zombies was amazing, it did not elevate zombies to become the main selling point. World at war made zombies what it was and black ops 1 built on top of that. Zombies would have been in future treyarch games regardless. I can see that people would of bought it just for zombies though, but again only because black ops 1 made it a standard thing and people were expecting it
    No doubt WAW started something beautiful and BO1 was legendary as well. Maybe I just jumped on the hype train later than others, but I feel like BO2 was when you started getting a lot of your EE enthusiasts, people digging deeply into the lore, etc. it felt to me like zombies became pretty much a separate entity entirely, although I can completely see people feeling that way even before BO2.
        I get what you are saying, but yeah again I feel that the dlcs for black ops 1 started that with maps like ascension, call of the dead and shangri-la all containing cool complex EEs and story. I think it is because a lot of people on the internet these days started out (or at least really got into cod) at that era
Yeah I think that’s the main thing. Keep seeing people saying how good the campaign was, but even the og CoDs (1,2,3 etc were better imo)
Chicom CQB wasn't bad and I'm going to die on that hill.
    Some guns weren't great but they were still fun and usable. The executioner pistol is my favorite example of bad but still alot of fun.
        Man, those things would garner a lot of rage, especially if you used them Akimbo. I think the KAP-40 was the best of the pistols, maybe tied with the Five-Seven and Tac-45.

Honestly, now that I think about it, all the secondaries were quite good if you used them within their effective ranges. Lots of 2-3 shot kills.
            I loved using secondaries in BO2. They were all honestly really good and unique in there own ways but none were ridiculously overpowered.
Campaign was nothing compared to blops 1 and anything that came before that tho. Not aimed at you, but I think a lot of people forget or don’t even know that cod was 99% focused on campaign before og modern warfare came out
    I too prefer BO1’s campaign by a small amount but Raul Menendez was a far more memorable villain than Dragovich. You can’t say there wasn’t a lot of focus on this campaign since you were given the opportunity to create-a-class and have multiple choices throughout, along with side missions. BO2 was Treyarch’s most ambitious campaign by far
I actually liked transit, idk why it gets so much hate (not the best map obviously but still great)
I enjoyed black ops2 multiplayer because I played it with friends, but other than that idk I never really thought it was that great. Had better experiences on all the other CoDs
    I mean it is only just an opinion. Bo2 isn’t my favorite cod either but I can easily see why people think it’s the best.
True, but I'm giving my opinion, not theirs.
    Very important point, a point that alot of people look past lol
    Yes. Which is why i said what i said since op asked why bo2 is generally regarded as the best cod. In this context the majoritys opinion on the game is more relevant than yours
