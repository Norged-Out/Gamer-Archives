[[Anyone think they should come out with an expanded version of Nuketown]]





It just seems kind of a waste. To be clear, I'm not sure how much of the extra map is rendered, nor how hard it'd be to get it usable. It just looks like they had a full map made and then just went with the super close-quarters portion of it. 
    I hate Nuketown, but if they made this version I'd play it! 
        same here.  this change might actually make the map playable and a bit more strategic.  typical nuketown strategy now:  

1)spawn, run forward, throw grenades

2)spawn, run upstairs, snipe out window

3)spawn, stay back and spam the trigger into the other spawn
            You're forgetting 4) Spawn more forward and inch, turn around and kill people. 

Freaking spawns flip so much on this map. > . >
                That's because you have people pushing the spawn. 
When my group of 4 play, we don't go pass the middle. If our green dot goes past, we just turn around for the flip. 
                    If you have ps3 you have a new player that is more than capable of doing that. Add me: highonammo
                        pls reply me
            My experience goes more along the lines of 

Spawn, Run forward, get enough kills for carepackage, throw a semtex grenade in front door, my entire team runs into house blowing up and gets me booted. 
                Hardcore player I see
                    yes sir..the only way to play this game. Core is just too kiddy stuff. I cant stand using 2 clips to kill someone, or 3 shots of a sniper rifle in the chest, or 2 head shots with the FAL to take someone down. 
            Oh so it's like pretty much every other map in this game? 
                I get your point, but it feels like Hijacked if they removed everything except the central sauna area. 
    They really seemed to go the extra mile in with detail in this game. [Firing Range](http://imgur.com/TetQDw3) is another great example.
    I'd really like to explore Masons house (mailbox for one of the unused houses has Masons name). 

They should also put the house from Arrested Development out in the distance.
        Mason's and woods' names are on the mail boxes of the two playable houses. At least in black ops 1 they were. 
        Pics or it didn't happen.

    But if they didn't include these sardine can maps, nobody would buy their games! /s
Pre-order MW4/BO3 today for an exclusive map Nuketown XXL to play with on release!

Now they don't even have to work much to give us a pre-order incentive.

Thanks guys...
    Dont forget letting everyone else have it free after 5 months.
        To be fair, we got it free, just had to preorder. So you basically got nuke town for 5 months by just agreeing to preorder. It's not some scam
            I had to pay 5$ to preorder 
        Five months is pretty long, plus you get it free anyway, so what's the big deal?
            Its not a big deal, but it was supposed to be an exclusive. I have no problem with it being free.
                I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
                    It's perfectly fine.
                        This is the nicest I've ever seen people act on this subreddit
                            Yeah, it's pretty crazy how mean people are here.  And I'm a child, so not all children who play CoD are mean and immature.
                            Ironic name is ironic.
                Exclusives hurt online communities by breaking up player-base, *especially* on PC, when the community is so small compared to the other consoles.
                    As a PC player who bought the season pass, I can relate.
                        Remember when we got DLC for free for early cods? Wasn't that great? I forget if it was cod4 or mw2
    Then they can completely yank it from all playlists a couple weeks after the game releases. 
The exterior portion of nuketown is beautiful. I'd like a more open that makes use of all those buildings around the street. I'd also like to go to those flagpoles. 
    [It looks almost like one of the map from CS:GO](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120928173456/cs/images/2/2a/BankMapcsgo.png)
i think it would be a good map if the expanded it. right now its fun, but i dont care for it that much just cause the spawns are fucked. 
    90% of the spawns in this game are fucked. Especially since the last patch I'm always getting shot in the back again. I wish they'd just get it right.
        I agree with you but as far as "good spawns" go. This Call of Duty has been better than  the other call of duty games I have played. Which is why I usually play demolition or domination, the spawns stay the same for demolition and  you can tell when spawns will  flip for domination.
            This cod has been the worst for ffa and tdm spawns, especially on small maps. I remember in older cod games, I could spawn and get my bearings, then move out to a position where the enemy would likely be. In this one it's spaw-YOU'RE GETTING SHOT AT SHOOT BACK NOW OR DIE-TOO LATE YOU DIEDSPAWN-DIE RUSH OR DIE!

                Bad kid is bad
                    Can we please stop making immature comments like these in this subreddit?
                        Ok, let's elevate the level of discourse surrounding retarded hypothetical suggestions for a video game. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN
                            Nah that was funny, dude. I lold
                    What?
            i get super annoyed at all the spawn killing in objective modes where the spawns never move
                I'll probably get downvoted but spawn traps are a legitimate strategy. When I play with a stacked team I  do it. I hate it when I'm solo and  only one member from the other team is trying to spawn trap and  my whole team  stops the objective just to try and kill one player... Fucking holy shit it annoys me. It's one player just go around him. Ignore him run away and go towards the fucking objective. I swear I will be the only one going for the objective.
                    The point of the game is to have fun, not die over and over again because you arent playing with 5 friends
                        Eh I just play tdm to have fun.
    Nuketown spawns aren't really fucked, it's just a tiny map and the second your team spawns they push forward to the other side fast which causes a split.

The map is too small to stand at one side for an extended period and camp, it favours more mobile players.
Nukeville anyone?
    Next Nukecity
        Isn't that just Aftermath?
I have never given this any thought to be honest, I think it's a great idea!
    And add an underground section that would represent bunkers.
It would make SnD a whole shitload more playable... thats for sure.
I'd prefer the current Nuketown but with an underground bunker accessible by the two buildings in the backyards. I like how in Hijacked it has the tunnel, whereas in Nuketown you just have to run into the middle of the chaos. The tunnel provides a protected flanking route.
    A bunker would be super cool. Kind of like the engine room in hijacked. I love jumping down the hatch and sprinting to the other side of the boat. Hardly anyone does it, and you're less likely to be naded, c4'd or sniped as you try to flank.
    great idea
    Yeah..you can see the cars underground in the garages..give me access to get down there 
    I personally feel the tunnel in Hijacked is very pointless. "Flanking" doesn't seem to be a viable strategy in that map for me. By the time I've cleared the tunnel, the spawns have already changed 6 times over.
        It's very, very useful in objective modes at least. In Demolition, you can use it to sneak up behind the enemy and plant at B.
            Oh right, totally didn't think about objective based games as I play TDM almost exclusively.
    Dat chaos is why i love that map. Give me a evo with rapid fire and my opponent will have a bad time

            god, this subreddit is childish.
                what did it say?
When they announced the Nuketown Zombies map I thought for sure they'd have to open up the rest of the neighborhood in order to make it a full size zombies map, but they didn't.  A real lost opportunity IMO.
I think something like the day and night versions of the beach map in WaW would be interesting.  People would go nuts if Nuketown changed but a Nuketown 2 would be kinda cool.
    Makin / Makin Day
        Thanks,  too lazy to look it up 
It would make the stand off, dual nature of the left of the map completely out of place. Instead of a north south map, it would be an east west map. They would have to completely redesign the center of the current map.
    Which wouldn't be hard. Change where the vehicles are, and suddenly there is an open middle path, but the sight lines aren't too long. Removes the fences on the backyards, and suddenly you have every other 3-path CoD map.
        Exactly what I have said about most of the maps on this game. There are 3 choices; left, right, center. Granted, it's very dumbed down, and there are exceptions (I think the new maps do a really good job breaking that trend), but by and large everything is a box shaped map with left path, right path, and center path. Hijacked being the #1 culprit.
            This is what ruined BO2 for me. It took going back to BO1 to realize how bad exactly the stock maps on BO2 are. 
                It's like this on every game now, save battlefield 3 (gasp! I've spoken that which must not be spoken). But it isn't so much pathways as it is a small sandbox level, to an extent. Halo (double gasp!) does the same thing now, though, so it isn't like CoD is the only game erring like this.
Hell, might as well just play Cul De Sac from Homefront.
    That's actually what I was thinking of! Very fun game to play for a while. The online pass thing kind of ruined it for me though. 
        That and the whole "online not working very well"... but yeah.

Would feel more balanced, use of all the buildings could sort of be like Bloc from CoD4.
So many extra sightlines and choke points.
Yes.
This would make the map bearable
I concur
this looks cool, and i'd be happy to play it as long as it's a separate map and doesn't replace the original nuketown entirely. however, it would be kinda silly to have two different versions of the same map in the same game.
    Makin?
I might actually play this map then. 
Yes, as long as I can go in and out of atleast two more houses.
It'd be good for multi team also.
Yes yes yes! Tired of these close quarters 
I bought the Hardened Edition thinking this is what Nuketown Zombies was going to be like
    As did I, I was sadly disappointed. 
its a level climax, they honestly created it just to have close combat. Thats why the game is soo addicting, think of how high jacked is now. Nuke Town was a huge level and still is with its close combat.

I like being a few feet away from the opposing team. Its like playing a game of deadly dodge ball (bullet).

I like the climax mix up of big levels and then getting tossed into smaller levels. It keeps the game cool. 

So honestly I'd like to see nuke town kept the way it is. 
I think they should come out with an expansion version of the map but after the Nuke dropped. That way it's not just the same map with more room to move around, but a completely new environment.
While everyones talking about Nuketown im just over here wanting Shipment to come back.
That ruins the whole purpose. NO.
I think it would be too big,  the whole point of Nuke town is it's close action, elbows and knee style fun,  if you want space use cargo.  I love/hate nuke town for it high  speed action.  
    The idea isn't to replace Nuketown, just offer a different variant once in a while. I think the game would be more interesting if it wasn't the same maps all the time. It would add some flavor to the game months after the release to keep seasoned players interested. It would be an added bonus if we didn't have to pay for it, but we all know that's not happening. 
        See If they expanding it, to me it would become the same as the rest.  I which they added some proper hight to a map,  They made tower/skyscraper or what ever the new map is, but it's still only one 1/2 stories. bring back some Unreal style hight,  get some real crow towers in.
    High speed action? Since it was put into normal map rotation all I see is people camping there spawn with LMGs and target finders. When it was in the mosh-pit series there was no camping pure action!
        Yer, fair point a lot of camping,  but the map is so small, If i'm killed by one, after I spawn I can normally get a grenade or like over to the patched they where camping at and take them out, with a nice revenge bonus as well. 
        [deleted]
            That is all I play. Which is worse. 
for Multiplayer, yes it would let snipers/LMGs to be more effective and have some more lines of sight. For zombies, heck yes Nuketown is so small for zombies and it's hard to run trains. More open areas will be very useful.
Why not. Lets re-use a map four times and charge for it!
    New DLC announced! "Hiroshima" where we give you all the nukes! 4 New nuke town variations for just $19.99!
Yes, absolutely.. 

COD4 promod has an expanded version of nuketown.
Make the bomb shelters an extra playable part giving an extra level to the game
They already have it on mods
Looking at this I'm imagining that this map would be the most hectic domination game ever if the the flags are going along the street
Woah.  I'm chriso.
This is why CoD needs a map editor like Halo's Forge mode.
Is love this version. Also, on vertigo, if you could go on the floor below the one available. But this would be a great map, and also more cars to explode
Give me Nuketown in MP as it is portrayed in Nuketown Zombies. 
Yes. also, let us use the whole deck in Carrier.
I'd be excited to play it!
This is what I was really hoping for with Nuketown zombies. (That and being able to go into the bomb shelter)
Yes! Its too small
The current one isn't so much "Nuke Town" as much as it is "Nuke De-sac"
YEEESSSSS!!!
That would be fucking awesome!
As long as they keep the original in rotation Im down.
Great. Also, make this playable in ground war.
Um not no but, Fuck No!
that would require basic programming and entry level QA.

The most successful and profitable product (of ANY category conceivable) is apparently not equipped to handle such a task.

So, let us indulge in getting ignored and told that we are fault for something not even yet conceived, in order that they may continue with bullshit closed-game circuits to boast of a game that is broken for the other 99% that fund their lifestyle.
cum....cum everywhere
Or even just being allowed to go in the bus would be cool.
Less buildings/houses to reduce campers and maybe add a park/playground area? 
yes please. 
Someone has made this on COD4 PC. It's quite fun.
I'm looking at that image and for some reason I feel like I'm looking at an aerial view of the cul-de-sac from "Ed Edd 'n' Eddy".

I also agree with the expanded version of Nuketown.
They kind of made a big deal about the whole area and not just the small part that we have when they put out the trailers. I like the idea of expanding it, but the o ly place i have seen it expanded was on a COD 4 PC modded game
PC Modding Community: Make this happen! :D (I assume modding is possible? I'm not sure about anything post-WaW for PC cod)
Nukecity.
I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS FUCK
No. They've done enough with this map.
Yeah why dont we replace everything with nuketown!
*No*
    I actually agree with your sentiment, I too am getting tired of so many small choke maps. I had just saw this picture of Nuketown and realized how it looked like it was actually made to be bigger, and decided to share. 
They do it's called havana 
Yes. The map is literally just a cul de sac and war pew pew kaboom UAV inbound
I hate Nuketown, but if they made this version I'd play it!

When my group of 4 play, we don't go pass the middle. If our green dot goes past, we just turn around for the flip. 
            If you have ps3 you have a new player that is more than capable of doing that. Add me: highonammo
                pls reply me
    My experience goes more along the lines of 

Spawn, Run forward, get enough kills for carepackage, throw a semtex grenade in front door, my entire team runs into house blowing up and gets me booted. 
        Hardcore player I see
            yes sir..the only way to play this game. Core is just too kiddy stuff. I cant stand using 2 clips to kill someone, or 3 shots of a sniper rifle in the chest, or 2 head shots with the FAL to take someone down. 
    Oh so it's like pretty much every other map in this game? 
        I get your point, but it feels like Hijacked if they removed everything except the central sauna area. 
Mason's and woods' names are on the mail boxes of the two playable houses. At least in black ops 1 they were. 
Pics or it didn't happen.

            Stop masturbating while browsing reddit.
                No.
                One does not simply stop masturbating.
To be fair, we got it free, just had to preorder. So you basically got nuke town for 5 months by just agreeing to preorder. It's not some scam
    I had to pay 5$ to preorder 
Five months is pretty long, plus you get it free anyway, so what's the big deal?
    Its not a big deal, but it was supposed to be an exclusive. I have no problem with it being free.
        I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
            It's perfectly fine.
                This is the nicest I've ever seen people act on this subreddit
                    Yeah, it's pretty crazy how mean people are here.  And I'm a child, so not all children who play CoD are mean and immature.
                    Ironic name is ironic.
        Exclusives hurt online communities by breaking up player-base, *especially* on PC, when the community is so small compared to the other consoles.
            As a PC player who bought the season pass, I can relate.
                Remember when we got DLC for free for early cods? Wasn't that great? I forget if it was cod4 or mw2
I agree with you but as far as "good spawns" go. This Call of Duty has been better than  the other call of duty games I have played. Which is why I usually play demolition or domination, the spawns stay the same for demolition and  you can tell when spawns will  flip for domination.
    This cod has been the worst for ffa and tdm spawns, especially on small maps. I remember in older cod games, I could spawn and get my bearings, then move out to a position where the enemy would likely be. In this one it's spaw-YOU'RE GETTING SHOT AT SHOOT BACK NOW OR DIE-TOO LATE YOU DIEDSPAWN-DIE RUSH OR DIE!

        Bad kid is bad
            Can we please stop making immature comments like these in this subreddit?
                Ok, let's elevate the level of discourse surrounding retarded hypothetical suggestions for a video game. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN
                    Nah that was funny, dude. I lold
            What?
    i get super annoyed at all the spawn killing in objective modes where the spawns never move
        I'll probably get downvoted but spawn traps are a legitimate strategy. When I play with a stacked team I  do it. I hate it when I'm solo and  only one member from the other team is trying to spawn trap and  my whole team  stops the objective just to try and kill one player... Fucking holy shit it annoys me. It's one player just go around him. Ignore him run away and go towards the fucking objective. I swear I will be the only one going for the objective.
            The point of the game is to have fun, not die over and over again because you arent playing with 5 friends
                Eh I just play tdm to have fun.
Isn't that just Aftermath?
It's very, very useful in objective modes at least. In Demolition, you can use it to sneak up behind the enemy and plant at B.
    Oh right, totally didn't think about objective based games as I play TDM almost exclusively.

    god, this subreddit is childish.
        what did it say?
Thanks,  too lazy to look it up 
Exactly what I have said about most of the maps on this game. There are 3 choices; left, right, center. Granted, it's very dumbed down, and there are exceptions (I think the new maps do a really good job breaking that trend), but by and large everything is a box shaped map with left path, right path, and center path. Hijacked being the #1 culprit.
    This is what ruined BO2 for me. It took going back to BO1 to realize how bad exactly the stock maps on BO2 are. 
        It's like this on every game now, save battlefield 3 (gasp! I've spoken that which must not be spoken). But it isn't so much pathways as it is a small sandbox level, to an extent. Halo (double gasp!) does the same thing now, though, so it isn't like CoD is the only game erring like this.
That and the whole "online not working very well"... but yeah.

See If they expanding it, to me it would become the same as the rest.  I which they added some proper hight to a map,  They made tower/skyscraper or what ever the new map is, but it's still only one 1/2 stories. bring back some Unreal style hight,  get some real crow towers in.
Yer, fair point a lot of camping,  but the map is so small, If i'm killed by one, after I spawn I can normally get a grenade or like over to the patched they where camping at and take them out, with a nice revenge bonus as well.

    That is all I play. Which is worse. 
You're forgetting 4) Spawn more forward and inch, turn around and kill people.
