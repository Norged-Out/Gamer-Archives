[[Is black ops 2 zombies worth it solo]]


So I have black ops 3 all the dlc and I really enjoy the zombies but I’m wondering if black ops 2 zombies is worth it if I’m only playing zombies?


I loved playing it solo. Mainly because I’m not very sociable and like to listen to music/have a film on whilst playing. 

Much more of a challenge trying to do Easter eggs and high rounds but not impossible (mostly)
    Music and zombies is a vibe
Are you playing on PC or console?? If you're playing on PC look up plutonium because these games never go on sale and plutonium is the only thing keeping these older cods alive tons of good fun
    bruh i tried downloading plutonium for bo2 ended up buying the disc from a pawn shop
    just bought bo2 and all dlc for 55€  from steam
        huge waste of money
            i dont care about plutonium
        they do go on sale just very rarely

                    Nah he's right
                        Damn right I am fuck that company
                            yeah fuck activision they suck I forgot they’re selling their 10 year old game for full price it’s okay to steal if they themselves steal from us, it’s just that most of the time I don’t support stealing software

    I wouldn't go that far, in recent months I struggle to find any decent zombie servers on plutonium that arent either insanely over modded or without super high ping or that has more than 0 players on it. Even before the influx of new players recently on steam finding decent matches on plutonium is hard
        What I'm in a game with 3 people on dinner survival RN it's great
            Cherry picking the one match that suits your specific taste. I was playing plutonium on stream for a few weeks, and I stated in the original post it was in recent months that I noticed the servers and players on plutonium were drying up. This may be different with the holiday influx as I have not been on plutonium in a few weeks. For several days straight I would hop on and see maybe one server worth playing on but with zero or one players on it only.
        Wdym overmodded ? 90% of modded server are only to show the zombie count and stuff like that. Also I live in North america and I modt servers are below 100ms
            They have extra perks, perk limits removed, free bonuses at set kill intervals, virtual banks, sectioned off maps etc. There are only a few vanilla or close to vanilla servers under 100ms ping that will have players on it. Usually I can only play town or  nuketown as anything else gets ruined by additional mods. Sometimes I would spend 10-15 minutes on stream even looking for a server with any players on it, there was almost always only one server anyways with players and if it was full I was out of luck. Luckily with the recent holiday influx bo2 steam has decent online players for a little while.
                I know I’m a year later, but by any chance do you know if I can play normal zombies, without mods, by myself? Because I’ve seen people saying that you can’t play solo, but this post confused me.
Yes, and not only for zombies
I'd say yes.

    I just got plutonium. Where do you actually download a copy of black ops 2 though? Was interested in maybe playing some bo2 zombies with friends.
        Their site , they have a dowload for the full game.
It is!!!!!
    Can you do the Easter eggs solo?
        Never tried ee in bo2, i was too young all i wanted was to kill zombies haha
        I'm pretty sure you can do the origins EE solo, but I think you need at least 2 players for the others. The maps are still very fun to play imo, but if you're mainly wanting to do Easter eggs then it might not be a good fit for you.
        None of them are possible solo except for Origins.
            Transhit is possible solo
                I was waiting for this reply lol, it technically is but really isn't.
        If u get it on pc u can get a mod which makes all the easter eggs solo-able
        For die Rise you need 4 people. For shang you need 4 peeps. Buried! Oh I played the shit out of that.bits fun. But hard.
Yes but I think cold war would be better unless you are looking for an older style
If you enjoyed BO3 zombies, then you should buy BO2.

Some of my fondest memories playing zombies came from BO2. Tranzit is a lovable mess of a map, Nuketown Zombies is a cool twist on a familiar multiplayer map, Die Rise has a cool wonder weapon and a perk that hasn’t been featured in any other map, Mob of the Dead is probably the best zombies map, Buried is extremely creative and quirky, and Origins is a classic (but BO2’s Origins is practically the same as BO3’s).

Overall, yes, if you love Zombies, then please get BO2. There is still much more to the franchise that you haven’t experienced. While I consider BO3 to be the best zombies game, BO2 is also insanely good and should not be discounted.
    Thank you very much but another quick question. Is black ops 1 worth it just for five and call of the dead?
        That’s a tough one for me. Both maps were remastered on BO4. I would watch some gameplay videos of each map on both games to see what you prefer. BO4 made a lot of people upset with the change in the perk system, but BO1’s graphics are somewhat outdated. I would recommend buying one of these games because these two maps are great.

My gut is telling me to refer BO4 to you since it’s on newer generation consoles and has better graphics and more maps you haven’t played, but BO1 is a classic so I would recommend just watching some YouTube play throughs of both maps on each game.
BO2 is the best game for solo in my opinion. Especially Mob.

    >I personally think they're going to remaster all the bo2 maps in 3archs next game.

Keep having faith my friend
If you’re only going for zombies, don’t. Origins is already remastered. I feel like they’ll remaster the rest. But I’d you’re going to play MP, zombies, and the campaign, then yes, I’d recommend it. Even if you decide to get it for cheaper price from G2A
    I know origins is in black ops 3 but I really like buried.
        Is recommend getting a key for the game from G2A, and a key for any DLC Yoj wanna get from G2A, as well. You’ll save some money
            At this point just pirate the game. Never buy a key from sites like G2A. The online is dead anyway and it’s a 10 year old game so just pirate it
                > The online is dead anyway

BO2 Zombies is still active on PC.
                    I bought BO3 and saw only 2 maps that were a little active (shadows and DE), so I assumed BO2 would be the same.
                Or use plutonium.
                Sites like G2A are legit for buying for the most part at least what's the concern?
                    Legit huh? Most keys there are stolen. It’s a gray market reseller. Not the place I’d really call “legit”. If you’re gonna give those people any money then just pirate instead. 

You can buy from there if you’re willing to take the risk, and it does work most of the time, but you can’t complain if your game is revoked by steam.
                        I said legit to buy from for a reason. Pirating isn't necessarily the same thing depending on the game also. I and many others never gotten games revoked by steam although, I don't buy games from g2a anymore but yeah just unlikely to happen.
if you're on PC its free on plutonium
Yes. Die Rise the funnest map I played. Hard to get going but sure is fun. Never done the ee. All the maps are awesome. It's bo2. Go for it.
Not at all, you can just get bo3 custom maps for all the bo2 maps
If it's on sale yes, I did just that for PC this past summer with all the dlc. I say it's totally worth it. When the game dropped I was never that crazy about zombies. Now I love MotD.
YES, but bot tranzit...
always
god i hope they don’t try to remaster buried and butcher it
Only mob and origins have good modern ee’s, buried has a good one too but tranzit and die rise have the worst ee’s ever. Amazing, fun, well designed survival maps but horrible ee’s
    Ok thanks buried is one of my favourite maps but I haven’t played it in so long.
Yes
Yes. 1000% yes.
If you buy it, skip Nuketown and Die Rise, they really aren't worth the money.  Definitely Mob, Buried and Origins tho!! Those maps are all awesome!
I love it
2 days ago the players count on PC was around 1k (Steam version). And i still manage to find good lobbies unlike BO3 where modders are everywhere. So yes BO2 is still fun and worth buying it.
    If I buy BO2 on steam, can I play zombies by myself? Because I’ve seen posts of people saying that you can’t, but I’m not really sure.
Yes
    I do it all the time on PC and 360
Yes, and if you're having a hard time you can go to custom matches and set it to easy for a more casual experience
dont buy/get bo2 in general its trash.
Yes as long as you buy MOTD, Buried and Origins. Best maps to play solo and lots of replay-ability.
I don't see any reason to play BO2 unless you're playing zombies!.. best zombies out there I think we'll it's has the most maps I enjoy on one game
who is the person you play as in solo
Music and zombies is a vibe
