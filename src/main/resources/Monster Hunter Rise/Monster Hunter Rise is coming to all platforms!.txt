[[Monster Hunter Rise is coming to all platforms!]]





Yay even more platforms to not have cross play with
    Yeah are they going to have cross play with the PC version then? So now Switch is left alone?
        No. No crossplay at all
does this mean the sales were great? if yes, happy for them :)
    I think it means, or also means, that their next console interation is taking longer than anticipated, and they want to get console gamer money sooner.
        No, I'm sure this was always planned.  They just clearly didn't want to release Sunbreak on other consoles until it was finished, and so they didn't want to release Rise on them until not too long before that.
        Feels dumb. Should've just released it with pc. Oh well, i don't got a console anyways but I still felt bad for a console player without any monster hunter
            Yeah, I'm not saying it's good or bad, and do feel for MH fans that don't have a switch/PC having time have waited this long. I just think this is the reasoning why they're doing this at all.
                People kinda expressed this right from the start from switch base rise.

            Hence the "or *also* means" in my comment.
I would be more hype if it was sun break dropping and not base rise. You can't pay me to run through those rampage missions again.

        Yeah the post I saw said sunbreak will be released spring 2023, so not too long after rise comes out.
            But why not day 1? It’s not like Sunbreak is still in development.
                Takes time to optimize. Plus most people won’t go straight into Sunbreak anyways.
                    That’s not a really a good reason to not have it available from launch considering they already have the PC port to base it off of.
                        Having it at launch doesnt make any sense given every other platform had to wait as well.
                            That makes zero sense as to why it’s not launching same day on PS/Xbox. The other platforms had to wait because Sunbreak was still in development. That’s not the case anymore.
                                No, it makes perfect sense, again your not understanding.

Where does it say Sunbreak has been fully optimized and ready to go day one on next-gen hardware? Sometimes you have to actually put some relevant thought into your brain processing information. Just because you say it should be fine doesn’t mean a thing. Have some common sense.
                                    There’s little reason for it not be able to be up and running. They already have a working version of Sunbreak running on PC’s. PS5 and Xbox use x86 architectures, just like PC’s. It’s just a matter optimizing the settings for the consoles, which they already have to do anyway for base Rise. Additionally, the Windows version *is* just the PC version, with some minor changes to support a different launcher.

The only logical reason that they delayed Sunbreak is so they can launch it with all of the title updates in place.
                    True, but rise it self progression wise is pretty small
                They're probably planning to release console Sunbreak with all Title Updates included at launch.
                Sunbreak is still in development
                    And yet it’s still available on Switch and PC.
                        And yet they are still developing it
                            And yet, they don’t have a good excuse for not launching it on other platforms right away.
                                Yea they do.  They probably just want to port it to the other consoles once when it's all finished instead of having to update it every title update.  Just one and done is easier.
                                    Not really. The content is being developed to be released periodically on two platforms already. It doesn’t make much sense to hold off on releasing it on two more functionally identical ports at the same time.
                        And yet your not understanding why theyre not doing that when everyone else is lol.
    I don't see why sunbreak wouldn't be buyable on these platforms day one
        Cause that's endgame dlc. You and alot of ppl asking this must be new to MH franchise. Base first, endgame dlc later
            But *why?* what is the reason for endgame dlc releasing later?
                You mental? You think these games are FREE?
                    I’m not saying it should come with the base game at no extra cost, I’m just saying it should release at the same time.
                        OK simple fix to you ppl asking this. Did sunbreak dlc come at launch on switch?
                            Oh my god are you stupid, I’m talking about the ports, obviously since sunbreak was made after base rise they couldn’t release at the same time on the original console.

But now both of them are already made, so there is no reason to not port both the base game and sunbreak at the same time.
                                Once again, you think these games are FREE
                                    No, what the fuck are you talking about?
                                    I think you really need to actually read what he said. He clearly asked what was the reason that Monster Hunter Sunbreaker wasn't also releasing at the same time as the base game due to it already being out for Switch and Steam. He's not asking for them to put Sunbreaker out for "free" on game pass.

(which btw it isn't free, we pay for game pass and Microsoft pays companies a large amount of money to get them on their service.  I.E. your logic is flawed from the jump and you should really learn the correct definition of free)

He's simply asking why can't they release them both at the same time and allow the user to buy one or both at the same time instead of having an artificial delay.
                                Yes their is, is your comprehension level low cause it shows.
                        No, it shouldnt. Dont Fortnite our Monster Hunter. It is what it is and we like it lol.
                            What the fuck does Sunbreak releasing at the same time have to do with Fortnite
                    No?
                So they don't have to update it for every title update.  They can just port it once and be done with it
                I'm new to monster hunter, could a new player jump right into it or do they need the gear and training provided by Rise? 

Also, it doesn't matter why. The company obviously had a reason and they don't have to explain it. Companies sole goal is to profit. You really think if they could, they wouldn't? You can stomp your feet all you demanding why, but they won't tell us and it doesn't matter. Play Rise or don't. Plus it gives excitement for other players to have something to look forward to after the bite off Rise.
        Prob because people would then maybe skip the final boss of base rise
            Don’t you have to beat teostra in order to unlock sunbreak? If so then you’d be increasing your HR passively while playing through sunbreak and would unlock allmother and valstrax automatically.
                Idk I got rise on release so I was well over the hr you need to be. I just heard someone say they recently finally did the final boss of base rise after doing sunbreak or something along those lines.

Edit: just looked it up and you can do sunbreak after thunder serpent narwa.
                    Ok yeah I just googled and apparently you only have to beat normal narwa, so my point stands but you’d also have to kill chameleos, kushala, and teo first.
                        No? You just need to be hr7 and beat narwa.
                            That’s exactly what I said
                                You said you'd have to kill the elder dragons
                                    Oh ok I worded that badly, in the comment before that I said that you would unlock allmother and valstrax passively while playing sunbreak, after googleing it and discovering that you only need to beat normal narwa to unlock sunbreak i elaborated that you would also unlock the MH2 elders passively.

So I was correctly myself and saying that you *didnt* need to kill the MH2 elders to unlock sunbreak.
                                    So my point stands that you would unlock all the base rise endgame content by playing sunbreak, it’s just say you’d be able to start sunbreak earlier than I thought.
                You have to beat allmother narwa to unlock Sunbreak so you still have to go through basegame rise and the elder rush until HR50/the urgent for HR50
                    Nope, only Thunderserpent at HR7
                You have to beat Thunderserpent Narwa at HR7.
        Maybe they whant to create a "hype" for it
            Yeah probably
    Well, this is for the new players that haven’t played the game yet, to have some time to experience the base game first.  
And they’re only releasing the expansion a few months later, a lot less time than we had to wait.
    There are ~~two~~ three required Rampages you need to do. The first one that is also a tutorial, and then Ibushi's rampage quest.

You are being very dramatic.
        Still about an hour of my life I'll never get back
        And the apex
            Maybe Apex Arzuros? The others are not part of campaign progress, and their rampage quests only unlock them as non-rampage hunts.
                Yes, that's the one I was referring to
        I am being a little dramatic no need to take my comment so serious. Relax
    its such a weird and awful decision too. like i didnt play that much sunbreak and i was semi-excited. ok im ready to fully go into the grind of sunbreak, but wait actually its just rise and you have to wait multiple months to play sunbreak. seriously? that actually killed my excitement
        Didnt they delay world and ice borne pc release after releasing on consoles.. i can say i played hundred of hours on both, having to restart multiple playthroughs.
    So if sunbreak dropped day one you wouldn’t have to do the mandatory rampage quests? I am confused.
This is great love this but Im already at endgame on switch so cross save or cross play so I can play with my friends....... plz
    I feel you. I have well over 600h in Rise/SB on Switch, and having to play from the beginning is a bit tiresome.
On the other hand, I bought it on PC and the increased framerate is incredible, plus I can mod in things I already farmed. No such luck on consoles though.

EDIT: clarity
    but 60fps :( im so conflicted
    Thinking the same thing but I doubt it as I can’t see Nintendo having anything to do with other platforms
        Nintendo hasn’t been opposed to cross play or cross save in the past.
        They already said in a interview they would look at cross save or cross play in future games..... so unfortunately not rise
        Whether it’s cross platform or not is up to Capcom. Nintendo has nothing to do with that
            Nintendo does have to agree but they tend to be cool with cross saves.
    If they couldn't make cross save available for PC there's no chance of it happening for consoles. No hard feelings but you guys need to get over it.
It's already on Windows via Steam, are they gonna put it on the Microsoft store or something?
    Yes thats what it means
    Now we can pirate it
        I don’t know that much about piracy, why does steam stop it from being pirated?
            It doesn’t lol
        You can already, though I'm pretty sure you can't play multiplayer with it. Not sure about event quests, but I think they require you to be online too to download them the first time, so they'd be impossible to get too.
Ah for fricks sake, I only recently got into Monster Hunter, bought Rise last week during black friday - at least more people will be able to play it now, it's great that less and less games are platform exclusive these days
....ok? I'd be glad for crossplay/save, but I'm staying with switch thank you very much
    More people get to play it. If you took a moment to think about more than yourself, you wouldn't question it like that.
        Actually that makes sense
    sorry but how is this mean crossplay?
        There is no crossplay or cross save
I would love to have it on a system them at runs better. But I’m not redoing 700+ hours. I’m just not
[deleted]
    I agree, the only thing that is keeping me from considering it on another platform entirely is to redo all that hunting.
I know there won't be crossplay, but I would have loved it if they at least managed cross-progression. I'll probably wait until Sunbreak is out before considering starting from the start again. I wonder if this means MH6 is taking longer than expected, or if they are planning to announce a second massive expansion to this installment (like a Zenith rank or whatever they had in the Frontier days)
    2024 is the 20th anniversary of the franchise. They're probably waiting until then for MH6.
i wish there's cross save. i want to try the gamepass.
With no cross play :/
I'm not going from Sunbreak to nonexpansion for full price. Thanks though.
    I’m going to gamepass it too.
        I don't touch gamepass. It encourages a future that is very bad for consumers.
            Sony that you?
                Nope, just a gamer.
When I saw *all* platforms I was really hoping I'd be able to play it on my Nintendo 3DS or Kindle tablet. but I guess all platforms was a lie
yow guys! im so confused. isnt Windows and steam the same? both running on a PC.
    Windows and Xbox PC store I would guess, opposed to Steam.

They're basically treated as separate platforms. So if you play Deep Rock Galactic on Steam for example, you can't cross play with other PC players using the other version.

Some games do have cross play but like you I was surprised to find out how separated they are.
        But at least with Deep Rock you can transfer your save file from gamepass to Steam.
            Yup. I did that the other day. Rock and stone!
        So will this have crossplay between steam and windows/gamepass?
            That I don't know I'm afraid.  Quite possibly not unless they announce something.
                The reason is Steam has it's on server infrastructure to connect people for peer to peer play. Which is a feature all games can use because it's one of the benefits they get through the cost of being on Steam(30%). Same with Xbox app with gamepass on PC.

Games that are truly cross platform have there own account and server systems. Like the new COD.
    Window means Microsoft Store. It’ll be on Gamepass for PC as well
        Thanks OP!
I just hope there will be a crossplay/save BCS that would make people more interested

    Casual MH player detected
Crossplay/cross saves aside, I’m just glad more people can play this amazing game now. Nice work Capcom
Been waiting on world 2 for nearly 5 years but this is very welcome news. Will pick this up and probably play it to death. Had over 500 hours in world.
    *MH6
        No one knows but mhw was their best selling title so we can be pretty confident that a second is on the way.
            Well, still Rise wasn’t called World Portable despite mhw being the best selling title. 

Technically speaking world is MH5 while Rise is MH5 Portable, the fifth generation, so the next game, which **is** MH6 because it will be the sixth generation, won’t be called World again. It either will be called Monster Hunter 6 or has a different sub title.
                I would think the reduced production values were the reason rise wasn't called World portable. I guess we will find out next year either way.
Sadly, no 3DS... probably cause the eShop is closing down, cause I cant think of any other reason, lol.
    Look at the monster hunter games on 3ds and then look at Rise.
        I was just being sarcastic 😃
    Rise was prototyped on 3ds (mainly the wirebugs were tested in a dev build of Generations). If it were planned, it would have launched on it.
YES!!!
Fucking yay......
As I painfully grind these final 6 levels to get anomaly level 181 and that fucking Bloodening Jewel, a voice inside me cries: NO! Fuck you Capcom. Take your stupid console version and shove it. I'm NOT doing all that shit again, ESPECIALLY NOT WITHOUT THE QOL MODS ON PC.
I honestly struggled to enjoy it on switch. I forced myself to finish sunbreak then went back to dauntless so I'm more than happy to pick up up on my xbox :)
So happy it isn't cross-platform because I definitely don't want to play with computer players
    Bro its a co-op game. It's not like they're gonna spawn camp you or anything. The only advantage they have is the ability to type and spam "noob" in chat faster.
        Wait until you realise that they can mod the game to make the entire quest unfun 😱
            Wait until you realise that 99% or more of the PC players won't do anything that would affect your gameplay.
            I have 600 hours in PC. I have ran into one player who did this. Did one hunt and kicked him from our lobby. Easy.
            Even if they one shot the monster, it takes like 2 minutes to get back into another hunt. It's not a big deal.
                You're so correct it isn't a big deal that the experience of how the game is meant to be played is ruined because of a computer player
ps5? no, just let us have MHW2
    Quick, nerd react this man
    It’s not gonna be called World 2 you complete clown
    Clown
Love stealing exclusives from switch
    “Timed” exclusive. 
Nintendo paid to have it be an exclusive for a certain time.
Do you think this means it will one day be cross-play??
    I really hope so but I'm not sure I can see it happening.

They said cross play/save wasn't something they could implement at the time back in Oct 21 for the PC release.   I'm hoping with these new releases it might inspire them to do it.
    (I haven’t seen this myself, but people have said that) Capcom has stated they want to have crossplay/cross save in future games, but they can’t yet.
        They sure can do it - they don’t want to. It’s not like cross play/save is new technology, even small indy games like Hades offer cross save. Hell even Witcher 3 gets cross save with the next gen update - for 7 year old game.

It’s pretty clear that they don’t want to do cross save.
            [deleted]
                Well I’m not saying it’s as simple as flipping a switch, but you need to understand that it’s not a problem about not being able to do it when indy game devs can do it and even CD Project Red makes it happen **seven years** after release and for free. They simply don’t want to do this. Or are you trying to imply that Capcom isn’t capable of something other games are doing for half a decade? Their devs are capable of it, just look at that black magic being the performance of Rise on switch. 

And the game being out on every platform wasn’t a surprising decision, it probably was planned since the game started its development.
    They've tried to implement it, but failed cause the game wasn't built with it in mind. MH6 and all other games going forward will probably keep that in mind and make sure to make crossplay possible.
        Witcher 3 gets cross save with its next gen update, a 7 year old game. Capcom tried shit to implement it, they simply don’t want to do it.
            There's a 99% chance that future games will have it. If they didn't want it they wouldn't have made the community poll.
😭😭😭😭 I’m not restarting
I just don't wanna have to pay for it a second time and redo all the missions again
You can already look at and preorder it on digital stores, and it’s $40 for the base game. Makes sense, because it’s technically almost a 2yo game, and the expansion is launching only a few months later. It’s not a bad deal to double dip.
Another anomaly investigation level 200? No thanks
But happy for those who haven’t play mhr yet
    Ir will be anomaly 999 eventually. Happy grinding 😃
Wait, I just bought it on windows (steam) like 2 weeks ago....Or, h-h-haven't I ???
Monster hunter on game pass? That's new, I hope they make sunbreak also playable. I have mhr on steam but not the sunbreak due to high price. I would like to experience sunbreak for sure as I have game pass account.
I can't wait for the switch release of the PS5 release!
They need to add cross play damnit
Well, I can say that I’ll be buying it again for PS5 and promptly plopping another few hundred hours into it. Them monsters be lookin’ good.
Instant pre order for me, also hopefully it comes with sunbreak included. Cant wait to play it on my ps5. I played the switch version(havent finished sunbreak) and it runs well but finally i can play 4k 60 fps online with friends who have a ps console(some dont want to buy the switch). I hope it does have cross cloud save that way i dont have to replay the main game and jump straight to sunbreak.
I’m hoping this could mean additional paid story DLC of some kind in the near future, but I won’t hold my breath.

As cool as a new Monster Hunter game would be I feel like Rise+Sunbreak didn’t have enough Monsters between the two releases, and I’d like them to wait on a sequel, so they can expand and polish any sequel that may be in the pipeline further.
i wonder if theyll add crossplay
Yay 3rd platform I get to start again on.. they need cross save
I have a ps5 now and wish I can play rise on that instead but I'm not gonna restart all progress.....
W
.....but it's been on PC????
    It’s on Steam, not Windows. There is a windows game store you can buy games in.
From what I've gathered Rise for PS and Xbox will release with TU10. I think, without knowing for sure, that Sunbreak added more moves for weapons. Are they included from start with TU10 or do we have to wait for Sunbreak?
it was horrible to play on switch lite, i was soo close to getn a full switch to be able to play it im so glad i waited! will prolly get on ps5 instead of xbox x.
Fml, just got it on switch a few days ago after waiting for it to come to Xbox for years now, games really really fun but now Ive just got a foul taste in my mouth knowing I could’ve played it at 60fps with voice chat and more friends
Can't wait to not be able to transfer over my save from the Switch and have to start over again because Capcom's Portable Team have their heads up their asses.
As someone who only played mhwi on console, not many things can make me happier than this news. 

I was so upset it was exclusive to the switch and PC. Hope it's fully optimized though, not just a copypaste port though, as I know the switch has some limitations.
I have a question for those who have this on the Switch.

I already have the game on the Switch however I never got to it. I really want to boot it up and play but I want to play it on my PS5. My question is about finding any matchmaking when the time comes for help or assistance. 

Would the better option be to play now on the Switch or play at the same time as others on Playstation when its released so when similar quests come up I’ll have a better chance at finding help. Any thoughts?
Yeah are they going to have cross play with the PC version then? So now Switch is left alone?
    No. No crossplay at all
I think it means, or also means, that their next console interation is taking longer than anticipated, and they want to get console gamer money sooner.
    No, I'm sure this was always planned.  They just clearly didn't want to release Sunbreak on other consoles until it was finished, and so they didn't want to release Rise on them until not too long before that.
    Feels dumb. Should've just released it with pc. Oh well, i don't got a console anyways but I still felt bad for a console player without any monster hunter
        Yeah, I'm not saying it's good or bad, and do feel for MH fans that don't have a switch/PC having time have waited this long. I just think this is the reasoning why they're doing this at all.
            People kinda expressed this right from the start from switch base rise.

            Sunbreak is still in development
                And yet it’s still available on Switch and PC.

                                Not really. The content is being developed to be released periodically on two platforms already. It doesn’t make much sense to hold off on releasing it on two more functionally identical ports at the same time.
                    And yet your not understanding why theyre not doing that when everyone else is lol.
I don't see why sunbreak wouldn't be buyable on these platforms day one
    Cause that's endgame dlc. You and alot of ppl asking this must be new to MH franchise. Base first, endgame dlc later
        But *why?* what is the reason for endgame dlc releasing later?
            You mental? You think these games are FREE?
                I’m not saying it should come with the base game at no extra cost, I’m just saying it should release at the same time.
                    OK simple fix to you ppl asking this. Did sunbreak dlc come at launch on switch?
                        Oh my god are you stupid, I’m talking about the ports, obviously since sunbreak was made after base rise they couldn’t release at the same time on the original console.

But now both of them are already made, so there is no reason to not port both the base game and sunbreak at the same time.
                            Once again, you think these games are FREE
                                No, what the fuck are you talking about?
                                I think you really need to actually read what he said. He clearly asked what was the reason that Monster Hunter Sunbreaker wasn't also releasing at the same time as the base game due to it already being out for Switch and Steam. He's not asking for them to put Sunbreaker out for "free" on game pass.

(which btw it isn't free, we pay for game pass and Microsoft pays companies a large amount of money to get them on their service.  I.E. your logic is flawed from the jump and you should really learn the correct definition of free)

He's simply asking why can't they release them both at the same time and allow the user to buy one or both at the same time instead of having an artificial delay.
                            Yes their is, is your comprehension level low cause it shows.
                    No, it shouldnt. Dont Fortnite our Monster Hunter. It is what it is and we like it lol.
                        What the fuck does Sunbreak releasing at the same time have to do with Fortnite
                No?
            So they don't have to update it for every title update.  They can just port it once and be done with it
            I'm new to monster hunter, could a new player jump right into it or do they need the gear and training provided by Rise? 

Also, it doesn't matter why. The company obviously had a reason and they don't have to explain it. Companies sole goal is to profit. You really think if they could, they wouldn't? You can stomp your feet all you demanding why, but they won't tell us and it doesn't matter. Play Rise or don't. Plus it gives excitement for other players to have something to look forward to after the bite off Rise.
    Prob because people would then maybe skip the final boss of base rise
        Don’t you have to beat teostra in order to unlock sunbreak? If so then you’d be increasing your HR passively while playing through sunbreak and would unlock allmother and valstrax automatically.
            Idk I got rise on release so I was well over the hr you need to be. I just heard someone say they recently finally did the final boss of base rise after doing sunbreak or something along those lines.

Edit: just looked it up and you can do sunbreak after thunder serpent narwa.
                Ok yeah I just googled and apparently you only have to beat normal narwa, so my point stands but you’d also have to kill chameleos, kushala, and teo first.
                    No? You just need to be hr7 and beat narwa.
                        That’s exactly what I said
                            You said you'd have to kill the elder dragons
                                Oh ok I worded that badly, in the comment before that I said that you would unlock allmother and valstrax passively while playing sunbreak, after googleing it and discovering that you only need to beat normal narwa to unlock sunbreak i elaborated that you would also unlock the MH2 elders passively.

So I was correctly myself and saying that you *didnt* need to kill the MH2 elders to unlock sunbreak.
                                So my point stands that you would unlock all the base rise endgame content by playing sunbreak, it’s just say you’d be able to start sunbreak earlier than I thought.
            You have to beat allmother narwa to unlock Sunbreak so you still have to go through basegame rise and the elder rush until HR50/the urgent for HR50
                Nope, only Thunderserpent at HR7
            You have to beat Thunderserpent Narwa at HR7.
    Maybe they whant to create a "hype" for it
        Yeah probably
Well, this is for the new players that haven’t played the game yet, to have some time to experience the base game first.  
And they’re only releasing the expansion a few months later, a lot less time than we had to wait.
There are ~~two~~ three required Rampages you need to do. The first one that is also a tutorial, and then Ibushi's rampage quest.

You are being very dramatic.
    Still about an hour of my life I'll never get back
    And the apex
        Maybe Apex Arzuros? The others are not part of campaign progress, and their rampage quests only unlock them as non-rampage hunts.
            Yes, that's the one I was referring to
    I am being a little dramatic no need to take my comment so serious. Relax
its such a weird and awful decision too. like i didnt play that much sunbreak and i was semi-excited. ok im ready to fully go into the grind of sunbreak, but wait actually its just rise and you have to wait multiple months to play sunbreak. seriously? that actually killed my excitement
    Didnt they delay world and ice borne pc release after releasing on consoles.. i can say i played hundred of hours on both, having to restart multiple playthroughs.
So if sunbreak dropped day one you wouldn’t have to do the mandatory rampage quests? I am confused.
I feel you. I have well over 600h in Rise/SB on Switch, and having to play from the beginning is a bit tiresome.
On the other hand, I bought it on PC and the increased framerate is incredible, plus I can mod in things I already farmed. No such luck on consoles though.

EDIT: clarity
but 60fps :( im so conflicted
Thinking the same thing but I doubt it as I can’t see Nintendo having anything to do with other platforms
    Nintendo hasn’t been opposed to cross play or cross save in the past.
    They already said in a interview they would look at cross save or cross play in future games..... so unfortunately not rise
    Whether it’s cross platform or not is up to Capcom. Nintendo has nothing to do with that
        Nintendo does have to agree but they tend to be cool with cross saves.
If they couldn't make cross save available for PC there's no chance of it happening for consoles. No hard feelings but you guys need to get over it.
Yes thats what it means
Now we can pirate it
    I don’t know that much about piracy, why does steam stop it from being pirated?
        It doesn’t lol
    You can already, though I'm pretty sure you can't play multiplayer with it. Not sure about event quests, but I think they require you to be online too to download them the first time, so they'd be impossible to get too.
More people get to play it. If you took a moment to think about more than yourself, you wouldn't question it like that.
    Actually that makes sense
sorry but how is this mean crossplay?
    There is no crossplay or cross save
I agree, the only thing that is keeping me from considering it on another platform entirely is to redo all that hunting.
2024 is the 20th anniversary of the franchise. They're probably waiting until then for MH6.
I’m going to gamepass it too.
    I don't touch gamepass. It encourages a future that is very bad for consumers.
        Sony that you?
            Nope, just a gamer.
Windows and Xbox PC store I would guess, opposed to Steam.

They're basically treated as separate platforms. So if you play Deep Rock Galactic on Steam for example, you can't cross play with other PC players using the other version.

Some games do have cross play but like you I was surprised to find out how separated they are.
    But at least with Deep Rock you can transfer your save file from gamepass to Steam.
        Yup. I did that the other day. Rock and stone!
    So will this have crossplay between steam and windows/gamepass?
        That I don't know I'm afraid.  Quite possibly not unless they announce something.
            The reason is Steam has it's on server infrastructure to connect people for peer to peer play. Which is a feature all games can use because it's one of the benefits they get through the cost of being on Steam(30%). Same with Xbox app with gamepass on PC.

Games that are truly cross platform have there own account and server systems. Like the new COD.
Window means Microsoft Store. It’ll be on Gamepass for PC as well
    Thanks OP!
Casual MH player detected
*MH6
    No one knows but mhw was their best selling title so we can be pretty confident that a second is on the way.
        Well, still Rise wasn’t called World Portable despite mhw being the best selling title. 

Technically speaking world is MH5 while Rise is MH5 Portable, the fifth generation, so the next game, which **is** MH6 because it will be the sixth generation, won’t be called World again. It either will be called Monster Hunter 6 or has a different sub title.
            I would think the reduced production values were the reason rise wasn't called World portable. I guess we will find out next year either way.
Look at the monster hunter games on 3ds and then look at Rise.
    I was just being sarcastic 😃
Rise was prototyped on 3ds (mainly the wirebugs were tested in a dev build of Generations). If it were planned, it would have launched on it.
Bro its a co-op game. It's not like they're gonna spawn camp you or anything. The only advantage they have is the ability to type and spam "noob" in chat faster.
    Wait until you realise that they can mod the game to make the entire quest unfun 😱
        Wait until you realise that 99% or more of the PC players won't do anything that would affect your gameplay.
        I have 600 hours in PC. I have ran into one player who did this. Did one hunt and kicked him from our lobby. Easy.
        Even if they one shot the monster, it takes like 2 minutes to get back into another hunt. It's not a big deal.
            You're so correct it isn't a big deal that the experience of how the game is meant to be played is ruined because of a computer player
Quick, nerd react this man
It’s not gonna be called World 2 you complete clown
Clown
“Timed” exclusive. 
Nintendo paid to have it be an exclusive for a certain time.
I really hope so but I'm not sure I can see it happening.

They said cross play/save wasn't something they could implement at the time back in Oct 21 for the PC release.   I'm hoping with these new releases it might inspire them to do it.
(I haven’t seen this myself, but people have said that) Capcom has stated they want to have crossplay/cross save in future games, but they can’t yet.
    They sure can do it - they don’t want to. It’s not like cross play/save is new technology, even small indy games like Hades offer cross save. Hell even Witcher 3 gets cross save with the next gen update - for 7 year old game.

It’s pretty clear that they don’t want to do cross save.
        [deleted]
            Well I’m not saying it’s as simple as flipping a switch, but you need to understand that it’s not a problem about not being able to do it when indy game devs can do it and even CD Project Red makes it happen **seven years** after release and for free. They simply don’t want to do this. Or are you trying to imply that Capcom isn’t capable of something other games are doing for half a decade? Their devs are capable of it, just look at that black magic being the performance of Rise on switch. 

And the game being out on every platform wasn’t a surprising decision, it probably was planned since the game started its development.
They've tried to implement it, but failed cause the game wasn't built with it in mind. MH6 and all other games going forward will probably keep that in mind and make sure to make crossplay possible.
    Witcher 3 gets cross save with its next gen update, a 7 year old game. Capcom tried shit to implement it, they simply don’t want to do it.
        There's a 99% chance that future games will have it. If they didn't want it they wouldn't have made the community poll.
Ir will be anomaly 999 eventually. Happy grinding 😃
It’s on Steam, not Windows. There is a windows game store you can buy games in.
No. No crossplay at all
No, I'm sure this was always planned.  They just clearly didn't want to release Sunbreak on other consoles until it was finished, and so they didn't want to release Rise on them until not too long before that.
Feels dumb. Should've just released it with pc. Oh well, i don't got a console anyways but I still felt bad for a console player without any monster hunter
    Yeah, I'm not saying it's good or bad, and do feel for MH fans that don't have a switch/PC having time have waited this long. I just think this is the reasoning why they're doing this at all.
        People kinda expressed this right from the start from switch base rise.
[deleted]
    Hence the "or *also* means" in my comment.
Yeah the post I saw said sunbreak will be released spring 2023, so not too long after rise comes out.
    But why not day 1? It’s not like Sunbreak is still in development.
        Takes time to optimize. Plus most people won’t go straight into Sunbreak anyways.
            That’s not a really a good reason to not have it available from launch considering they already have the PC port to base it off of.
                Having it at launch doesnt make any sense given every other platform had to wait as well.
                    That makes zero sense as to why it’s not launching same day on PS/Xbox. The other platforms had to wait because Sunbreak was still in development. That’s not the case anymore.
                        No, it makes perfect sense, again your not understanding.

Where does it say Sunbreak has been fully optimized and ready to go day one on next-gen hardware? Sometimes you have to actually put some relevant thought into your brain processing information. Just because you say it should be fine doesn’t mean a thing. Have some common sense.
                            There’s little reason for it not be able to be up and running. They already have a working version of Sunbreak running on PC’s. PS5 and Xbox use x86 architectures, just like PC’s. It’s just a matter optimizing the settings for the consoles, which they already have to do anyway for base Rise. Additionally, the Windows version *is* just the PC version, with some minor changes to support a different launcher.

The only logical reason that they delayed Sunbreak is so they can launch it with all of the title updates in place.
            True, but rise it self progression wise is pretty small
        They're probably planning to release console Sunbreak with all Title Updates included at launch.
        Sunbreak is still in development
            And yet it’s still available on Switch and PC.
                And yet they are still developing it
                    And yet, they don’t have a good excuse for not launching it on other platforms right away.
                        Yea they do.  They probably just want to port it to the other consoles once when it's all finished instead of having to update it every title update.  Just one and done is easier.
                            Not really. The content is being developed to be released periodically on two platforms already. It doesn’t make much sense to hold off on releasing it on two more functionally identical ports at the same time.
                And yet your not understanding why theyre not doing that when everyone else is lol.
Cause that's endgame dlc. You and alot of ppl asking this must be new to MH franchise. Base first, endgame dlc later
    But *why?* what is the reason for endgame dlc releasing later?
        You mental? You think these games are FREE?
            I’m not saying it should come with the base game at no extra cost, I’m just saying it should release at the same time.

                Oh my god are you stupid, I’m talking about the ports, obviously since sunbreak was made after base rise they couldn’t release at the same time on the original console.

But now both of them are already made, so there is no reason to not port both the base game and sunbreak at the same time.
                    Once again, you think these games are FREE
                        No, what the fuck are you talking about?
                        I think you really need to actually read what he said. He clearly asked what was the reason that Monster Hunter Sunbreaker wasn't also releasing at the same time as the base game due to it already being out for Switch and Steam. He's not asking for them to put Sunbreaker out for "free" on game pass.

(which btw it isn't free, we pay for game pass and Microsoft pays companies a large amount of money to get them on their service.  I.E. your logic is flawed from the jump and you should really learn the correct definition of free)

He's simply asking why can't they release them both at the same time and allow the user to buy one or both at the same time instead of having an artificial delay.
                    Yes their is, is your comprehension level low cause it shows.
            No, it shouldnt. Dont Fortnite our Monster Hunter. It is what it is and we like it lol.
                What the fuck does Sunbreak releasing at the same time have to do with Fortnite
        No?
    So they don't have to update it for every title update.  They can just port it once and be done with it
    I'm new to monster hunter, could a new player jump right into it or do they need the gear and training provided by Rise? 

Also, it doesn't matter why. The company obviously had a reason and they don't have to explain it. Companies sole goal is to profit. You really think if they could, they wouldn't? You can stomp your feet all you demanding why, but they won't tell us and it doesn't matter. Play Rise or don't. Plus it gives excitement for other players to have something to look forward to after the bite off Rise.
Don’t you have to beat teostra in order to unlock sunbreak? If so then you’d be increasing your HR passively while playing through sunbreak and would unlock allmother and valstrax automatically.
    Idk I got rise on release so I was well over the hr you need to be. I just heard someone say they recently finally did the final boss of base rise after doing sunbreak or something along those lines.

Edit: just looked it up and you can do sunbreak after thunder serpent narwa.
        Ok yeah I just googled and apparently you only have to beat normal narwa, so my point stands but you’d also have to kill chameleos, kushala, and teo first.
            No? You just need to be hr7 and beat narwa.
                That’s exactly what I said
                    You said you'd have to kill the elder dragons
                        Oh ok I worded that badly, in the comment before that I said that you would unlock allmother and valstrax passively while playing sunbreak, after googleing it and discovering that you only need to beat normal narwa to unlock sunbreak i elaborated that you would also unlock the MH2 elders passively.

So I was correctly myself and saying that you *didnt* need to kill the MH2 elders to unlock sunbreak.
                        So my point stands that you would unlock all the base rise endgame content by playing sunbreak, it’s just say you’d be able to start sunbreak earlier than I thought.
    You have to beat allmother narwa to unlock Sunbreak so you still have to go through basegame rise and the elder rush until HR50/the urgent for HR50
        Nope, only Thunderserpent at HR7
    You have to beat Thunderserpent Narwa at HR7.
Yeah probably
Maybe Apex Arzuros? The others are not part of campaign progress, and their rampage quests only unlock them as non-rampage hunts.
    Yes, that's the one I was referring to
Nintendo does have to agree but they tend to be cool with cross saves.
It doesn’t lol
Sony that you?
    Nope, just a gamer.
Yup. I did that the other day. Rock and stone!
That I don't know I'm afraid.  Quite possibly not unless they announce something.
    The reason is Steam has it's on server infrastructure to connect people for peer to peer play. Which is a feature all games can use because it's one of the benefits they get through the cost of being on Steam(30%). Same with Xbox app with gamepass on PC.

Games that are truly cross platform have there own account and server systems. Like the new COD.
Well, still Rise wasn’t called World Portable despite mhw being the best selling title. 

Technically speaking world is MH5 while Rise is MH5 Portable, the fifth generation, so the next game, which **is** MH6 because it will be the sixth generation, won’t be called World again. It either will be called Monster Hunter 6 or has a different sub title.
    I would think the reduced production values were the reason rise wasn't called World portable. I guess we will find out next year either way.
Wait until you realise that 99% or more of the PC players won't do anything that would affect your gameplay.
I have 600 hours in PC. I have ran into one player who did this. Did one hunt and kicked him from our lobby. Easy.
Even if they one shot the monster, it takes like 2 minutes to get back into another hunt. It's not a big deal.
    You're so correct it isn't a big deal that the experience of how the game is meant to be played is ruined because of a computer player

    Well I’m not saying it’s as simple as flipping a switch, but you need to understand that it’s not a problem about not being able to do it when indy game devs can do it and even CD Project Red makes it happen **seven years** after release and for free. They simply don’t want to do this. Or are you trying to imply that Capcom isn’t capable of something other games are doing for half a decade? Their devs are capable of it, just look at that black magic being the performance of Rise on switch. 

And the game being out on every platform wasn’t a surprising decision, it probably was planned since the game started its development.
There's a 99% chance that future games will have it. If they didn't want it they wouldn't have made the community poll.
People kinda expressed this right from the start from switch base rise.
Takes time to optimize. Plus most people won’t go straight into Sunbreak anyways.
    That’s not a really a good reason to not have it available from launch considering they already have the PC port to base it off of.
        Having it at launch doesnt make any sense given every other platform had to wait as well.
            That makes zero sense as to why it’s not launching same day on PS/Xbox. The other platforms had to wait because Sunbreak was still in development. That’s not the case anymore.
                No, it makes perfect sense, again your not understanding.

Where does it say Sunbreak has been fully optimized and ready to go day one on next-gen hardware? Sometimes you have to actually put some relevant thought into your brain processing information. Just because you say it should be fine doesn’t mean a thing. Have some common sense.
                    There’s little reason for it not be able to be up and running. They already have a working version of Sunbreak running on PC’s. PS5 and Xbox use x86 architectures, just like PC’s. It’s just a matter optimizing the settings for the consoles, which they already have to do anyway for base Rise. Additionally, the Windows version *is* just the PC version, with some minor changes to support a different launcher.

The only logical reason that they delayed Sunbreak is so they can launch it with all of the title updates in place.
    True, but rise it self progression wise is pretty small
They're probably planning to release console Sunbreak with all Title Updates included at launch.
Sunbreak is still in development
    And yet it’s still available on Switch and PC.
        And yet they are still developing it
            And yet, they don’t have a good excuse for not launching it on other platforms right away.
                Yea they do.  They probably just want to port it to the other consoles once when it's all finished instead of having to update it every title update.  Just one and done is easier.
                    Not really. The content is being developed to be released periodically on two platforms already. It doesn’t make much sense to hold off on releasing it on two more functionally identical ports at the same time.
        And yet your not understanding why theyre not doing that when everyone else is lol.
You mental? You think these games are FREE?
    I’m not saying it should come with the base game at no extra cost, I’m just saying it should release at the same time.
