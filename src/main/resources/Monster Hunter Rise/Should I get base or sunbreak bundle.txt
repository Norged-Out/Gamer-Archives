[[Should I get base or sunbreak bundle]]


I’ve been debating on getting rise and now that it’s on sale I’ve decided to get it, on the psn store it’s on sale for 75% off but there’s a bundle for rise and sunbreak for 67% off (which is twice the price of the base game)
For context I’m Australian so the base game is $15 and the bundle is $30

Is sunbreak worth the extra price?


If you know that you'd love the game, get the bundle.

If you don't know, get the base and get the DLC when you know you love the game/

the DLC is basically the real game, the base game is an introduction to the game mechanincs
I put 80 hours into the base game. I put 2000 hours into Sunbreak. Don't just buy the tutorial.
Yes. I suggest getting the bundle. Sunbreak doubles the content of the base game. It is just that worth it.
Honestly the game is nothing without sunbreak, definitely get it
the base game is super boring but the dlc is the total opposite
Base Rise is on the worst side of Monster Hunter games, and Sunbreak pushes it to one of the best. I'd get the bundle.
    The worst? What?
        I've played all the games since Tri, and base Rise really falls short, even not considering the state it was in at launch. Just an opinion though.
            I honestly don't know, i think world was a little worse, then it's obviously an opinion so i do not understand the down vote on my comment
                That downvote wasnt me-
                    Sorry i wasn't accusing you, I just don't like people that when someone is discussing just keep up voting or down voting
Get the bundle
Go for the bundle, you wont regreat it
The bundle is absolutely worth it! Sunbreak is were the game realy comes to life. New mechanics, new skills, new systems to interact with, about 150% of the base game's content & a very large endgame for anyone that's interested in it.
Bundle it up man.
If you you think you'd enjoy the game get the bundle, that's where all the good content is and the grind. If u never played it the game I'd suggest just getting the base game and see how u feel about it and then  get SB
Base rise's endgame is pain. Definitely bundle.
Absolutely worth the extra price.
Definitely. 
It's where the meat is and you definitely want to get all the cool new moves. 
Sunbreak
