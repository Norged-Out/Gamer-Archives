[[How much Hp do monsters have in Rise]]


In world Masterrank or G-rank monsters typically had anywhere between 10K to 30K HP excluding endgame bosses, arch temps and some rare event quests. However from the gameplay I've seen on Rise it seems that these monsters must have at least anywhere between 70-150K hp because I've seen hunters do like 400-700 dmg with one strike of the LS or 4-7K dmg with greatswords in HR and MR

[Level 120 Afflicted Pyre Rakna-Kadaki has 87 750 HP](https://youtu.be/IKWhLpV6fME?si=SNW7_Ni17AqvZ_As)

Judging how we're on lvl300 now and special investigations gives an even further boost to hp, I wouldn't be surprised if some monsters had 200k+ hp by now
Monsters generally have more hp in Rise/Sunbreak but the hunters also deal way more dmg. Some end game hunts like special investigations will have like 150k-200k for solo and 300k-400k for 4 players. But again hunters deal way more dmg
    Also, with the exception of the Risen elders, those monsters have qurio spots that deal a fixed percentage of damage when burst.
Don't know Don't care. Just hit the damn monster and hope to god it dies
Meanwhile, my LBG comfort build hits 20-25 per Pierce 2 bullet feels weak. ðŸ¤£ HP is too high IMO. Just makes hunts longer, not harder.
    Either you hit the low bowgun hz of the monster or there is a problem with your build.
        Mind sharing a build? Haha so I can see the problem ðŸ¤£
            Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Xi_M2oD2E&t=168s) by AngBata11. He deals 27-31 damage per tick of rfp2. I used that vid as an inspiration for my build. With my build using the primordial malzeno lbg, I can deal 38-41 damage per tick of rfp2 on rathian's head. Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Sx-oKtK_8Xk) for proof.
                But that's rathian. I can also deal 40s with him. Elder dragons though 20-25.
    Oof, bowguns were ripped in Iceborne especially pierce and spread. Every speedrunner was rocking an LBG or HBG seems like Rise really only focused on buffing LS and downgrading everything else(except GS which has counters for some reason???)
        iâ€™m pretty sure bowguns are the strongest weapons in rise/sunbreak (in terms of damage output)
        What do you mean buffing LS? LS mv for helmsplitter and iai slash was nerfed in sunbreak. Although LS is still strong because of sacred sheathe but the weapon is not as strong as it was in Rise. Another thing, bowguns are still strong in Sunbreak especially elemental lbg with the deriliction skill.
        But I have a comfy build - bloodlust 1 is my only sacrifice. Every other skill are just vanilla attack up, crit etc. And I have evade extender ðŸ¤£

Though I've seen some elemental build that hits for 100+ per tick. That would be crazy DPS.
        I've played the Great Sword in every Monster Hunter game and while the Great Sword does have a counter, unlike the Long Sword (which has 4 counters in Rise!) you don't even get it until you're nearly at the end game of Sunbreak, you can't spam it as it takes 2 Wire Bugs to use it (only one of the counters the Long Sword has uses Wire Bugs, it also uses 2 but can do 1000+ damage easily), is one of 2 good Wire Bug moves the Great Sword has (with the other being given at basically the start of base Rise), you still take damage when you use it, but it's reduced damage like it is when you use the tackle that great sword has and you can still be stunned out of it.

Basically unlike most of the Long Sword's counters, if you don't time it and just spam it you're in for a world of pain. Luckily if you time it right, the monster will really feel it as if timed right the counter hit (which is a True Charge Slash you can charge up to level 3 like you can with the regular True Charge Slash) get something like a 30% - 35% attack boost. I've seen it hit for over 11K damage on a sleeping monster.
        Bowguns weak? The only melee that can even remotely compare to them in term of damage is great sword with the absurdly strong strongarm stance, or elemental charge blades with ridiculously high element phial numbers.
        Light bowgun is still overpowered as hell in Sunbreak. All of the ranged weapons are still the best weapons in the game, nothing has changed.
    Nah, only investigation over 270 are boring, but the other content its fine, i do all sub 10
        Can you share your build? Currently at the 220 range with lbg and similar dmg to top comment 20-30 per tick on rfp2. Most 4 mans are 15-20 mins for a single monster investigation.
            Yeah let's hear the builds of these masters hahaha
            Other content Is non investigation, i mean, i do all sub 10, the non investigation content. 
Ofc is impossible to do Monster with 250k hp sub 10 ðŸ˜‚
don't know the specific but an Anomaly lv101 Rathian have almost as much hp as Iceborne Fatalis
    Yes, but the hunter is so much stronger, my LS hit for 5k.. on iceborne thats impossible
        Oh my. My hammer must feel like a kiss compared, that makes my first hit doing 30 feel awful
I'm in a super tanky, farming prime malzeno spread + shield HBG build, an I'm doing around 40 damage a pellet to weak spots. Easily 250 plus a hit, and I will burn through 5-6 stacks of spread 3 to solo a monster. So anomaly lvl 100 probably has around 80k hp? I guess that's not including the detonation, buts it's also not counting missed pellets or bad hit zone pellets. So yea, 80k is probably close enough.
for anomaly there's set core&part HP/dmg modifiers per afflicted level: [http://mhrise.mhrice.info/quest/anomaly\_difficulty\_0\_0.html](http://mhrise.mhrice.info/quest/anomaly_difficulty_0_0.html) (swap out the last 0 in the link for other numbers to see other monsters)
