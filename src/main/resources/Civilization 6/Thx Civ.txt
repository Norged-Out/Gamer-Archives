[[Thx Civ]]





Mind sharing the seed?  Iâ€™ve never gotten an encircled capital, might be fun for a challenge!
    Play as Pachacuti.
        I thought if you changed civs then you wouldnâ€™t necessarily start in the same location, even thought itâ€™s the same seed?
    yes please
Build an Encampment and ~~kidnap~~ rescue a settler or capture a city.
    Honestly the only play that I can think of lol
You should settle the deer
    I always hate having to sacrifice a resource but it's probably your best bet
        Settling on resources doesn't sacrifice it in civ 6
            Really?   Good to know.   Tile yield is lost tho??
                Nope. If you settle on maize for example it gives you the extra gold per turn. It even gives you strategic and luxury resources If you settle on those. The only downside is that you can't build an improvement on it later.
                    That is awesome.  Thanks for info!
                    what? It even tells you that the bonus resource will be destroyed. Only luxury and strategic are not destroyable
                        No, it only destroys the feature if there is any, such as woods, rainforests, or marsh. It doesn't destroy the resource.

Go ahead and try settling on a maize tile. Maize gives 2 gold. Maize never spawns on any feature, so you'll never get the popup of "this will be destroyed". And you'll notice your city center also ends up getting 2 extra gold per turn instead of just food and production.

Or try settling on a deer hills grassland tile (1 food, 4 production). Deer give 1 production. Deer also only ever spawn in forests, which also give 1 production. If you were to settle on a deer hills tile, you'd get the popup that the forest would get destroyed. Your city center yields would end up being 2 food, 3 production. It should have become 2 food and 2 prod if settling on bonus resources destroyed them alongside the feature, but it doesn't, hence the 2/3 city center (and why people talk up settling on deer hills tiles so much, they give 3x as much production as if you settled on a 0 or 1 production tile).
                            ok, i am probably just stupid then, thanks!
                it does. settling a forest removes the 1 production. however settling a hill doesnt
    nah settle the moutain
    They did, didnâ€™t they?
        Iâ€™ll be honest I didnâ€™t even notice there was a second picture
            No problem, I was so confused, I was like are my eyes deceiving me??
Marked himself "Safe from Barbarians" in 4000 B.C.
Skill issue ðŸ˜¹
    Thatâ€™s what happens when you donâ€™t move your warrior forest
At least no one can get in

*or out*
here is the map seed: 280314628, Map type:  Terra

Enjoy it!
    How'd it go?
    Any game modes or anything?
Sadly that would look like a pretty good start for the other USA leader
    Worthy of Trump? That'll teach him to make America great again! /s
        Fuck trump
            I canâ€™t get it up looking at *that*. â€¦

To add insult to injury, it also gave a bonus resource that relies on woods lol
This is a good start if youâ€™re planning a war game. Pop an encampment down on the north side of the mountain range and pump out the units. Go conquer the map.
This isnâ€™t â€œcompletely horrible. Just set your encampment outside and your warriors will be built there. Your capital is basically gonna be uninvadedable
Lay thine eyes upon the mysterious city between the mountains, oh may the gods protect it and the titans forge it to glory.
Switzerland moment
Shouldâ€™ve named it Gondolin
    I was hoping someone else saw it
At least thereâ€™s no plantations?
At least it has fresh water
I thought it was Portugal at first and I'm like nice coastal start. Great. Thanks. Lmao
You will build tall. This is an order
+6 city center
I mean you cant lose a domination vicory (i think)

And here we go with another shitposter that will not provide any playable seed (with hundreds of requests)...

    Seed is apparently 280314628, Map type: Terra
        noted
I guess you wont lose your capital ever
Wow...
How did that happen ðŸ˜…
Next time play the incas
Send it!
Hahaha yeah I had a seed like this, I ended up resetting because I couldnâ€™t do anything
Go for a war victory. No way your capitol gets captured lol
This is no big deal! Just wait for turn 200 something and research military engineers for mountain pathways
On the positive note, your capital has the best starting tile in the game.
Iâ€™m curious to know what happens if you produce a unit in this city without an encampment. Does it stack with current warrior? Does it spawn outside the mountains? Does the game not let you build it?
oh sh\*t
Thatâ€™s the Czech Republic right?
:D
I was in a similar situation. There were mountains and water everywhere, and in the only passage Rome attacked me
Play it out, coward.
This is the safest city Iâ€™ve ever seen
LEGENDARY START LOCATION
Yields?
I need this seed
GONDOLIN HAS BEEN REBUILT
Wholy science batman
Play as Pachacuti.
