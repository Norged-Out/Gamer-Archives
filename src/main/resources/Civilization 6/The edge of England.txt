[[The edge of England]]





I see that no one has built anything there.
    WAIT A MINUTE.

IS THAT A FARM??

IS THAT A LIGHTHOUSE????


**LIES!!!!**
    There's a scout holding position.
I thought you guys may find this interesting. This is a real life picture.
    Cliffs of Dover üïäÔ∏è
        This is actually in dorset ‚Äî about 100 miles up the coast. Its a beautiful place. This is the old harry rocks.
            Old Harry rocks.... Hilarious!
                Wait til you find out his wife is the one next to him
Shame the white cliffs are effectively a useless natural wonder
    Not if you grab the Terra Mirabilis mod. On a Archipelago map now I love them.

CLIFFS OF DOVER
Two tile natural wonder. Appears as Cliffs. Yields +3 Culture, +1 Food, and +1 Gold. Harbors receive minor adjacency bonuses from Cliffs for any Civilization that owns at least one of these tiles.
        Would that conflict with any other natural wonder mods
            Hmm possibly, but I've had no issues. it's probably the best natural wonder mod out there. I used it with another natural wonder and that worked OK.
LOVE that it does this. Wish more landmasses could be this considerate and chic

Its a uncompleted giant puzzle piece
Looks like a great spot for a golf course
This is why some people called it Albion, right?
How does this have anything to do with CIV 6?
    It looks like the edge of the map near the Arctic.at least that's what I thought.
