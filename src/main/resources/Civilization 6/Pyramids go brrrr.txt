[[Pyramids go brrrr]]

I mean if you ever been to Cairo and seen the pyramids this isn't so far from  the truth
i love when theres one tile of desert
I love this post so much.
Isn't that tower in the background the one that fries people or something?
Memphis has one!
Youâ€™ve never been to Memphis, haha.
Vegas laughs
Looks like the sequel of the tyranny of King Washington, that Assassin's Creed III DLC
To be fair though, that would be sick AF. Wouldnâ€™t mind waking up to that sight everyday. Just cross your fingers that no Brendan Frazier Mummy situation crops upâ€¦ shiiiiiiiiiiiit ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
