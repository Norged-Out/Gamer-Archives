[[The usual Civ game]]





The only thing that would make it better would be if one of the horses turned into a tank halfway through.

Unit upgrade, if you will.
    That unrealistic, you need to be on your border first.
        You conquer the first city and make it your border.
Hahaha accurate
Domination victory ahead
    Pikes, crossbows and Renaissance walls on the horizon.  Maybe a few archers out exploring.
lol

At least in current versions of the game your tanks aren't going to be defeated by a spearman or a caveman with a club anymore :D
    CIV IV looks like a mobile game and the diplo victories makes no sense at all. They ruined it. 

CIV V is the best it gets.
        4???
            5
                2
        Alpha Centauri is the best It gets.

Me leading my AI allies into battle
As someone from vienna i can confirm thats how the husars beat the ottomans
Every single game!
On their way to invade former allies because they have oil. ‚ÄúIf we succeed we‚Äôll ALL be tanks!‚Äù
    Charge!!!!!!!
This is hilarious üòÇ nice one OP
There should be a button somewhere to modernize/standardize your military which would obviously price-scale but then automatically upgrades all units to the modern era or replaces them with whatever specified unit.
    Bingo!!! Better macro tools to save time.
This is me trying to win a diplomatic and/or science win but it turns into a domination win around turn 375/500.
    Going to invade a former ally who has oil.  "If we win we will *all* be tanks!  Charge!!!!!
So we were watching tanks and helicopters‚Ä¶ THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED
Only enough gold to upgrade a couple of cavalry units and knights
Accurate.  Well played OP.  Well played.
Russia is getting desperate
Needs a few random spearmen or something who never got upgraded
Where is the little Diplomat of civ1 ? üòÉ
You ever see a city and think "absolutely fucking not"?
Average hoi4 game

That's just standard Imperial Guard deployment
What is this video from?  Looked for it ages ago.
In civ6 when I only have 3 oil. Those 3 tanks will lead the whole army!
literally WW1
u/savevideobot
When the light cavalry gets more advanced upgrades than other units.
