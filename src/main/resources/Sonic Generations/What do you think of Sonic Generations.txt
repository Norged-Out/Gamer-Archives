[[What do you think of Sonic Generations]]





It’s game with literal no downsides besides the length. No required level grinding, collectibles are optional, good level design and controls.

In my top 5 Sonic games. One of the absolute bests, especially among the 3D games.

        Hi thank you for taking the time to reply to the post., I'm dad.
I guess it’s my fourth favorite 3D Sonic despite only 25% of it being 3D. And the fact that I basically consider it obsolete now that Mania exists
    Thank you for taking the time to reply to the post.
I REALLY do not like it, don't get me wrong I've tried ***(I 100%ed it 4 times*** (5 times when I get around to reviewing it) with the hopes of it finally "clicking") but just can't. The concept is cool don't get me wrong, but I just cannot enjoy this game for more than 1 act at a time because it is incredibly boring in my opinion. The shortcuts are very cut out for the player in the sense that a lot of the times there is no player-driven experimentation in the levels leading to the shortcuts but just alternative routes which generally don't feel very risky to pull off or rewarding to explore(excluding Chemical Plant Act 2 and one or two more) which are fun.  The filler in the side character levels is also very boring and literally all of classic sonic...I think his levels are ok but I cannot stand how terribly he controls compared to his 2D counterpart, SG Classic has no weight to his spindash or jumps... similar to modern sonic who just feels off in my opinion. I do think Generations has the most refined boost gameplay with rings and such being your boost filler.  I don't think I have ever opened Sonic Generations with the intent of playing a classic level...ever.Boring supersonic fight and also the ranking is a legit joke... it's basically you get an S rank if you don't die, I've finished levels walking around looking for red rings and have gotten S ranks with 9 minutes on the clock..seriously?

Speaking of the red rings they're placement is generally very lame in my opinion being very in your face to the point that I got all Rooftop Run red rings for Act 2 in my FIRST TIME PLAYING THE LEVEL, will say though it is awesome how it unlocks art and music which can be played during levels which is sweet for a big fan like myself to see the artwork of some of my favorite levels. I'm not going to knock the story since I don't really think that's fair due to what the game is. For me, Sonic Generations is a very boring and bland game that when playing through its acts just makes me want to play the actual games those levels were originally a part of. I do think also there was a lot of missed opportunity with the levels. I'm not a boost hater but just think Unleashed is the best boost game.  Music is good though!

Sorry if this seems all over the place but I was just writing this off the top of my head and if this is your favorite sonic game that is awesome but personally for me, I just have never been able to get into it.
    Okay, everyone has their opinions and well, it is not one of my favorite sonic, I like it but it is not one of my favorites, but hey, a great opinion, complete, thanks for taking the time to answer the post.
        Thanks I appreciate it, yeah not trying to knock anyone at all who thinks its the best I just cannot get behind it myself. Whats yours?
Fun game. Too reliant on memorization. Not hard enough. Not long enough.
