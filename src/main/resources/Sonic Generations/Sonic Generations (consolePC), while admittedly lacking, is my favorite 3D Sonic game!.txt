[[Sonic Generations (consolePC), while admittedly lacking, is my favorite 3D Sonic game!]]


Together with *Sonic Colors*, *Sonic Generations* (console/PC) later showed the general public that Sonic still had the capability to deliver great to awesome titles on a consistent basis. *Generations*, in particular, is my favorite 3D Sonic game for a number of reasons. Despite the massive hype I had for the story back in the day, I remember being mildly disappointed in the game for its story or lack thereof. The only major players are Sonic (Classic and Modern), Tails (Classic and Modern), and Eggman (Classic and Modern), with the rest of Sonic's cast having only guest appearances in the opening and ending cutscenes as well as being specific characters you save upon completing a stage. Even then, the fact that the story has a basic structure of running through every zone and saving your friends makes the story more approachable for both newcomers and casual fans so that they don‚Äôt need to rely on the full canon just to understand what's going on -- Sonic's friends are also utilized better in the side missions so that's a plus. As far as gameplay, this is the first of many times that Classic Sonic returns as a past version of Modern Sonic to bring back the old style of gameplay for the 20th anniversary. While a good attempt at the time, his gameplay physics are not completely accurate to the Genesis games with Sonic not being able to maintain momentum when spinning down inclines. On the plus side, his Spin Dash got a wicked upgrade with it being mapped to the X/Square button (though you can still do it the old way) and one to several presses of it sends Sonic rocketing away. Regardless of any ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù, Classic Sonic's gameplay still flows great especially once you‚Äôre able to equip power ups and shields via the Skill Shop purchases. On top of that, his levels are full of multiple routes and methods to explore the area to either get a better time or collect the Red Star Rings for extras. 

Modern Sonic, on the other hand, is the most refined version of the Boost formula to date; whereas Unleashed and Colors lacked balance in terms of the 3D vs. 2D dynamic in the stages, Modern Sonic‚Äôs stages in this game have struck a balance between brisk 3D boosting and slower, more methodical 2D platforming. Having Modern Sonic‚Äôs stages switch to 2D may seem a bit redundant given the presence of Classic Sonic, but the stages themselves are fun to play regardless and even offer the same multiple routes exploration tactics as their Classic counterparts. Although I like this game's take on both playstyles, I do feel that Modern Sonic is my preferred style as its gameplay feels most refined and it's no wonder people have developed so many stage mods for him in the PC version. The graphical quality of the game is also amazing with many of the stages from older games as well as Planet Wisp benefitting from HD graphics. While *Unleashed* is still the best-looking Sonic game overall, I still have a soft spot for this game since it has, in my opinion, the best Modern Sonic model and the character bios/model viewers in the Extras allows me to view and even reference everyone's modern designs for drawings. As far as music, both Sonics also benefit from different musical styles with Classic Sonic having techno-based remixes while Modern Sonic has more rock and percussion-based remixes. My favorite stage remixes would have to be Green Hill (Modern and Classic), Chemical Plant (Modern), Speed Highway (Classic and Modern), and Crisis City (Modern).  This is also the only game in the Meta Era where the Chaos Emeralds even matter to the story as you must defeat the Rival Battles or regular Boss Battles to collect them. The bosses are great reiterations of past confrontations with Metal Sonic, the Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos, Shadow, Silver, and Egg Dragoon. Sadly, the final battle against the new enemy, Time Eater, is nowhere near as good as some past Super Sonic fights from a design standpoint since it involves essentially boosting to win. In spite of a lackluster story with a mediocre final boss, *Generations* remains my most replayed 3D Sonic game simply for its replay value along with the refined 3D and 2D gameplay.

Rating: 9.8/10

Rank: A+


It's one of the best Sonic games ever.

The only thing I feel it lacks is a winter-based zone, though there is a third-part mod which adds a new zone, called Shivery Mountainsides, which tries to emulate the ambient of the Alps. It's a very polished masterwork and could easily be part of the original game.
    Too many city levels. Could have easily dropped Speed Highway for Ice Cap.  Or done any other combination with 3 & K.
        Ice cap zone from Sonic 3 had the dopest music
            ‚ÄúHAD‚Äù üò¢
                It's terrible now üò≠
        Speed highway was definitely the most iconic from sonic adventure also the boarding would've then been repeated between ice cap and city escape. Rooftop run or crisis city I would say could've been replaced.
        That's why people do mods on the pc
    Yes they should have dropped rooftop run as there were already 3 city levels for cool edge.cool edge was so good in unleashed
Crazy how they perfected this game and then couldn‚Äôt carry it forward. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt know what they were doing in this game
    I think its more they may have felt they peaked or achieved everything they wanted from the boost formula, so they sidestepped with lost world into something new. I think lost world is pretty comprehensive in concept, just needed more time to polish and some level designs were straight frustrating. When finicky old sega saw lost world (and Boom) didnt do too great, they said ‚Äúquick, make something safe and marketable‚Äù and made sonic team go back to the boost formula. Problem is, they gave ST no time to develop and we got the half baked Forces ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    Once you reached the top, the only way to go is down üòî
Admittedly lacking is a prerequisite for 3D Sonic games, unfortunately.
    This is like the one 3d Sonic game that doesn't really apply to.
        It lacks story and content, but if you're on PC, Sonic Generations has BY FAR the best modding scene of any Sonic game.

I've constantly played the game until 2018 without ever getting bored, then moved on, and still new mods are coming out every day.

Skyth's Ray Traced Sonic Generations, anyone?
            Most Sonic games are short and the ones that aren't as much are padded with gameplay that isn't as good as the main Sonic gameplay.
If It were a bit longer or had more stages It would be perfect, i know they were going by 1 stage per mainline Game but that way the Game is way to short
    you can finish it in under 2 hours. As much as I love the game, thats kind of criminally short.
Literally my favorite game of all time!
    it would appear the current Saudi Prince is in agreement.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abdullah_Al_Saud (yes this is actually him)
        There are multiple Saudi princes. To reiterate, this is not the Crown Prince.
            actually, it *is* the crown prince.

that's what makes this so special. We know the crown prince is super into dota, which this account shows.

definitely him.
                Sorry to burst your bubble... But he isn't. This guy's name is Abdullah bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.

The Crown Prince's name is Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.
                    impossible for it to be that guy.  He's most likely dead. 

he's been in prison since 2018. this account is still active to this day. People still see him in dota, he still makes purchases, comments, etc.
Literally second only to Frontiers for me. Goated game.
Its a great one! The best 3d sonic game in my opinion since the Adventure games. It delivered!
This whole thing is wrong!

The Rank should be an S
    Well, with Generations' ranking, Forces would probably be an S too
Generations is absolutely the best boost game
Watching the trailer for the first time was one of the most exciting moments of my life. Such a fantastic game + concept of bringing both of them together. Good times ..
My younger brother got this game for Xmas and it was the first st sonic game me and him ever picked up. This was my shit in 2012 and I played this game constantly as a kid.
It's not a 3D Sonic game, it's a 2D Sonic game with 3D segments. Half the game is Classic Sonic, and about half of the Modern Sonic half has 2D gameplay.
    Yea I don't get that. I mean I get that Modern Sonic from that point onwards had 2d segments in other games. But it's super redundant to see them in 3d stages when Classic style gameplay also exists. Imagine fully 3d Gen level design.
        Yeah, it'd be awesome, but nooo, Sonic Team got *lazy* and didn't wanna design fully 3D areas.
            I wouldn't say it was laziness. It was an anniversary title and with classic sonic they wanted to replicate the gameplay style of the classic games. It makes sense.

As for 2D sections in the boost stages. I kinda they're a neccesity. Because of how the boost formula works they have to make the level reach a reasonable length whilst still delivering a game on time and ensuring you aren't just holding down boost and winning (cough sonic forces)

I'm am adventure fan so no doubt they CAN make fully 3D levels but I don't think the boost formula is suitable for it. Theres really only so much you can do before it becomes just boosting and drifting through a horde of X enemies or just reaction based events.

I think sonic adventure 1 and 2 handled the 3D sonic gameplay perfectly because the adventure formula was suited for full 3D exploration and monuverability using the momentum based physics and wasn't as reliant on going ridiculously fast through a corridor style level. Speed was earned not given and I think that's the biggest issue of the boost formula. Getting a best time or S rank is rewarding sure but the sense of speed itself is not. Since "go fast" is tied to one button.
                Fair enough. And the Boost formula has its roots in 2D with Rush.
            I just think that even now, 12 years later? Yea? The issues Sonic team has lies in how they fundamentally look at the series. Cause as good as Frontiers, it still uses some of the same crutches older game also had. I mostly look at Sega since more often than not it's their meddling that causes a lot of these rushed and unpolished issues and solutions. But still. What can ya do?
If you've got this on Steam, have you tried the Classic Sonic Improvement mod? Completely changes classic sonic's feel to be at least 90% accurate, including the drop dash and super peel-out
While not my all time favourite 3D sonic game it is absolutely up there. I remember unboxing sonic generations for my birthday in 2012 and playing it up until midnight doing all the side missions. Out of all the boost formula games I believe it has the best gameplay (sorry unleashed, love you too), my only real quarrels are with classic Sonic's physics, but in all fairness the OP spindash makes up for it. And of course the lack of a fleshed out story. Generations is a good example you don't need a story to be fun however the aspect of a good story is what pushes games like adventure to the S rank for me.

Sonic generations is still an amazing game despite those flaws.
This is probably the game (more than even Mania) that I would have loved DLC for. I had a lot of fun with the game and it genuinely felt like the devs did in making it. Music track's and option to change them was great. Was good fun seeing classical versions of modern levela and modern versions of classic levels. Same for the music themes.
i have this game for the 3DS , it was my first sonic game ever , and i love it w all my heart despite how mundane it is compared to the rest of the titles in the franchise
    The 3DS version is terrible imo
        its pretty boring but it was enough for 9 year old me
This is my first and favorite Sonic game. My only issue is with it is that there isn‚Äôt enough of it.
FAV GAME
this was my only sonic game I've ever played, and it's now one of my most favorite games of all time along with wind waker (1st place) and cult of the lamb (3rd place)
    Good list!
Best seller for 12 years.
Fr. I absolutely adore generations
Just console, with PC mods this game is bursting with endless fun
generations is my #1.  theres no nonsense, just high-speed FUN
It‚Äôs my favorite Sonic game period.
My favourite 3D Sonic game (though I do think you can make a strong case for Adventure 2as well) and my third favourite in the series behind Mania and 3 & Knuckles. While I wish it was a little longer, this game demonstrates the appeal of a short, very replayable campaign backed up by some of the strongest level design in the series. I‚Äôd honestly have welcomed DLC for this game.
I wish they kept the boost formula because there was still room to grow. I have an idea for a new boost game:
*Sonic vs. Pest Control*

The story is simple. Dr. Eggman has built robotic copies of Sonic's friends and has placed them in charge of guarding several zones each, sort've like the robot masters in Mega Man. This robot team is called Pest Control, and their job to is to ensure that each zone they guard is reconstructed to the doctor's desire without interruption from Team Sonic. 

The gameplay includes:

- Badniks that aren't fodder. Perhaps most badniks you encounter can fly and need to be taken out with a ranged-weapon, like in a 3D shoot'em up game. Thus, eliminating the ability to bulldoze through every enemy. Some land-based fodder badniks are still around, but they're purposely set up like bowling pins so you can bowl through them and get STRIKES! 

- Every zone is original. One of the zones is Floral Caverns, a long-sinced abandoned system of caves that once housed botanically-advanced beetles that 
bred new types of flowers (perhaps they're responsible for the razor-shaped flowers in Green Hill Zone?)

There are abandoned homes, gardens full of amazing plants, and a ruined university dedicated to botany. 

- The small hubs from *Sonic Unleashed* are back, and there's more to do now. There's a shop where you can buy clothes using score points you earned from a completed level, and there are food stands and places to sit down and enjoy your meal as you taken in the scenery. You can also find one or two of Sonic's NPC friends walking around, doing things in the hub. You can play minigames with them, just like the ones in Generations (but better). 

- Each boss battle with a robotic clone (up until the final battle with Eggman) is actually a rival competition. Battles with Metal Sonic are racing competitions, battles with Titanium Tails are dogfights, battles with Brass Knuckles are fistfights that take place inside a small dojo, and battles with Rose Gold are trading card fights. 

- Destroyed badniks drop components, which you can collect and give to Tails so he can build new gadgets, such as the Ring Dash Bracelet.
I feel like people ride this game‚Äôs meat too hard too often. Yes, it‚Äôs a good game, and you‚Äôre justified to like it, but I have my fair share of problems with it.

1: Modern Sonic. He‚Äôs just not fun. It‚Äôs smalls segments of him boosting through 3D areas, followed by hilariously bad 2D sections. Furthermore, why so much 2D? That‚Äôs Classic Sonic‚Äôs whole purpose, to represent the 2D styled games, whereas Modern Sonic is supposed to represent the 3D, and yet I find myself playing more 2D than 3D.

2: The story. It‚Äôs barebones and honestly wasted. It‚Äôs a simple enough story, that‚Äôs not an issue. What is the issue is that we don‚Äôt get much involvement of the stage locations outside of the first two. Then there‚Äôs the plotholes:

- How do the Eggmen make it out of the timeless white void of nothingness? How? Eggman is supposed to be around for Lost World, and Robotnik is supposed to be around for Mania. So then, how did they escape?

- Why is Crisis City here? Weren‚Äôt the events of Sonic 2006 erased from existence? If Solaris was erased, then Iblis wouldn‚Äôt exist either, thus there‚Äôd be no Crisis City. If Solaris does exist, then reality would be stuck in the state that it was during the whole ‚ÄúEnd of the World‚Äù segment for the Last Story. They‚Äôre supposed to no longer exist, but apparently they do, somehow. This is where the whole ‚Äúdid Sonic 2006 really happen?‚Äù bs started, and I 100% blame Generations. 

3: The final boss was atrocious. The other bosses were great, but how did we go from the Nega Wisp Armour in Colours, one of the best bosses in the series, to the Time Eater in Generations. How? I don‚Äôt even know what the song is that plays during this boss outside of the constant ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a homing shot!‚Äù crap.
    If you're a "I play for the story" guy then I wouldn't recommend the game yeah but I also feel that people overreact on the "modern has too much 2d"

Sky Sanctuary, Crisis City and ü§¢Planet Wispü§¢ are the main outliers, the rest have a tremendously small 2d section which is nothing when the bombastic 3d arrives, most notably in Green Hill, City Escape and Rooftop Run
        It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want 2D in Modern Sonic. But if you‚Äôre gonna centre an entire half of the game to only 2D, the other half better have more 3D than 2D, not have stages that are so imbalanced.

Also, I play for both the gameplay and the story.
            Yeah as I said, not all stages have imbalanced 2d sections but the complaint is more than understandable
    I completely disagree with 1 because IMO this is the best Modern Sonic has played. Sure I'd like more 3D, but the 2D sections are also really good except for Planet Wisp, so they never bothered me unlike Colors which is 10% 3D or Unleashed which is extremely slippery and hard to control and probably needed _more_ 2D.

2 and 3 are, like, if you're playing a Sonic game for the story or the final boss then you're a fan of the wrong franchise. Not major points of complaint.

Edit: I'm not saying these _shouldn't_ happen, of course not. I'd LOVE to see a Sonic game with a masterpiece of a story or a mind-blowing final boss. But so far, they haven't leaned into those aspects, so you'd be disappointed with almost any Sonic game.

My favorite gameplay, my favorite Sonic game. The equation is simple, really. Mods can add levels, but they cannot fix bad physics or bad gameplay, those are hardcoded.
I hope someone makes a mod that expands the hub to have a much lower area that houses blank slates for modded levels
It's fine. I'm not huge into the boost era of games but I think this was the best from it. For 3D Sonic, SA1 is still far and away my favorite.
It's in the top 5 of my favourite games. I got it for my 10th Birthday and made some mods back in the day.
Fun times
Only thing that brings it down for me is the story
I‚Äôm playing the 3DS version but I have skill issue and is stuck on Radical Highway Act 2
You reminded me of my goal to get my Xbox version of generation to 100%. I stopped because i don't know how to get achievements that require Xbox live. I played all the levels and I couldn't get it. Is it even possible? (I played on Xbox One tho)
Did anyone ever try the 3D TV stuff for this?
    Yeah, gimmicky. 3D was infantile, there's a reason it faded back into obscurity. Maybe some day.
The game's great, but not perfect \^\^;

* Modern stages should have remained solely in 3D, with no 2D segments. Classic stages are already 2D, so even if 2D was used in Modern Sonic games, there should have been an "exclusivity".
* The game is bloated with side missions, which to me, grind it to a halt. I would have prefered more stages.
   * **Advance 1**: Casino Paradise
   * **Advance 2**: Music Plant
   * **Advance 3**: Cyber Track
   * **1 (Game Gear)**: Bridge Zone
   * **Rush**: Water Palace
   * **Rush Adventure**: Haunted Ship
      * Jet, Wave, Storm, Big, Marine and Omega should have been rescued.
* The final boss is a chore \^\^;
It was actually one of my first sonic games!
Always thought it was a shame that it wasn't released for the Wii
I still have that game installed on my Series X. It always will be.
I loved it on my PS3, but the pc port is very under optimized and runs badly.
    Is it? I remember running it 40-50fps 1366p with integrated graphics back in 2013
One of my fave things to do in it as modern sonic is drifting around corners before hitting the edge; where you become a ball that flexes and bends as you turn.

You really get the feeling of the speed and force of your turn, rather than just sticking out your hand like forces did.
It's one of my favorites too
I just wish I could play it on my PS5
I'd love a port of this for Switch üò≠
IT IS THE GOAT
This is my second favorite, behind Colors.
For me, Generations was a fav of mine for YEARS, but as of a year ago, Frontiers has officially taken its place, I love it so much <33
I wouldn't really consider it lacking because it did what it set out to do. Be a celebration of the series' history! Only way it could've been better for me is if they had a Sonic Adventure/Adventure 2 style instead of lumping it in with Unleashed/Colors Sonic. But I'm fine with how it is, and on PC it's even better lol. People have imported pretty much all the Sonic levels you can think of -- including all of Unleashed
I love sonic generations
Best modern sonic game after the adventure series for me. I think the only thing it lacks is the storyline. Also, I feel the Chaos boss could've been extended a lot more for how stunning it looked.
incredibly based, Generations is 1000% the best boost game gameplay-wise
Honestly, same! The modding community on PC makes it even better, it‚Äôs like the game never ends! In that regard it‚Äôs like the Skyrim of Sonic games.
Played it all the time until my Xbox red ringed, what I would give to play it again
I desperately want a Sonic Generations expansion pack. Even years later I‚Äôm still not tired of the concept. I want more zones and bosses and characters and story and everything!
Too many city levels. Could have easily dropped Speed Highway for Ice Cap.  Or done any other combination with 3 & K.
    Ice cap zone from Sonic 3 had the dopest music
        ‚ÄúHAD‚Äù üò¢
            It's terrible now üò≠
    Speed highway was definitely the most iconic from sonic adventure also the boarding would've then been repeated between ice cap and city escape. Rooftop run or crisis city I would say could've been replaced.

I think sonic adventure 1 and 2 handled the 3D sonic gameplay perfectly because the adventure formula was suited for full 3D exploration and monuverability using the momentum based physics and wasn't as reliant on going ridiculously fast through a corridor style level. Speed was earned not given and I think that's the biggest issue of the boost formula. Getting a best time or S rank is rewarding sure but the sense of speed itself is not. Since "go fast" is tied to one button.
        Fair enough. And the Boost formula has its roots in 2D with Rush.
    I just think that even now, 12 years later? Yea? The issues Sonic team has lies in how they fundamentally look at the series. Cause as good as Frontiers, it still uses some of the same crutches older game also had. I mostly look at Sega since more often than not it's their meddling that causes a lot of these rushed and unpolished issues and solutions. But still. What can ya do?
its pretty boring but it was enough for 9 year old me
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want 2D in Modern Sonic. But if you‚Äôre gonna centre an entire half of the game to only 2D, the other half better have more 3D than 2D, not have stages that are so imbalanced.

Also, I play for both the gameplay and the story.
    Yeah as I said, not all stages have imbalanced 2d sections but the complaint is more than understandable

Most Sonic games are short and the ones that aren't as much are padded with gameplay that isn't as good as the main Sonic gameplay.
actually, it *is* the crown prince.

that's what makes this so special. We know the crown prince is super into dota, which this account shows.

definitely him.
    Sorry to burst your bubble... But he isn't. This guy's name is Abdullah bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.

The Crown Prince's name is Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.
        impossible for it to be that guy.  He's most likely dead. 

he's been in prison since 2018. this account is still active to this day. People still see him in dota, he still makes purchases, comments, etc.
I wouldn't say it was laziness. It was an anniversary title and with classic sonic they wanted to replicate the gameplay style of the classic games. It makes sense.
