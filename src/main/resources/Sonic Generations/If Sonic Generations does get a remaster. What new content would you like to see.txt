[[If Sonic Generations does get a remaster. What new content would you like to see]]





More stages like the ones from the 3ds or just stages from other games like unleashed, 06 or maybe even black knight. Also a playable shadow I think that might be a given but yes maybe like an episode shadow like in forces of also customization like in colors ultimate but with more stuff
    What are the chances of new stages based on Forces and Frontiers? Probably not gonna happen, but it would be neat
        Levels from Lost World, Forces and Frontiers would be great as a post game bonus since they take place after generations.

Like a "You defeated Time Eater, now you have access to the future", but like not being canon that Sonic visits the future.
            I’ll be honest, I completely forgot about Lost World. But hell yeah, a new postgame would be awesome
        I'd be all in on a level based on Sonic Advance, especially 3
        The Forces stages are boring and repetitive and Frontiers are stages taken from Sonic's memories, using Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, Chemical Plant and Speed Highway as a base, many of which are already in Generations. Unless they put the ones they put in update 3, I don't see the point.
            Damn, executed for telling the truth.
            They could re-imagine the levels for the game, applying the level design mentallity from generations. 

A Sunset City level from Forces with good level design would actually rock. And the Cyber City from Frontiers is different enough from Speed Highway to be able to stand on it's own, specially if they take it more from the Final Frontier version of it. Same with Lost World.
    Also a level from sonic cd rats not just a boss
    > Also a playable shadow

Yes, the game whose core conceit is that the modern version of the title character meets his younger self should indeed have a section that focuses entirely on Shadow /s

Though I'd allow it if it also came with Classic Shadow stages that are literally unplayable due to Classic Shadow just being stuck in a cryotube.
        >Though I'd allow it if it also came with Classic Shadow stages that are literally unplayable due to Classic Shadow just being stuck in a cryotube.

To be honest yes. Same for Shadow in Superstars, If he is an near unplayable gag character you you control him sleeping in his cryotube would it be hilarious enough to justify it.

&#x200B;

Tho on that note. If Shadow were to get any focus I at least would not make it exclusive to Shadow but give some love to all Sonic Rivals.
        Comment aged like milk oof
            Can't get them all right.
    DAMN STRAIGHT MY BOY!!!!
    YESS SIRR!!! Exactly as I was thinking about all the 3ds stages ported, IN 3D VISUALS, and new stages as well as you said...AND THE GAME IS CONFIRMED LET'S GO BOIS!!!🔥🔥🔥#SonicxShadowGenerations
Realistically speaking, Metal Sonic as a skin for Classic Sonic and Shadow as a skin for Modern Sonic would be pretty cool

Unrealistically speaking, more stages would be pretty neat, like Collision Chaos, maybe some 8-bit stages or Advance stages
    id say its like a dlc, with shadow replacing classic sonic's side of gens.
If they are going to put real money on to it, I would like more playable characters - even if just skins with more abilities. Also new stages. Go wild.

Ideally, they could make and Episode Shadow or a Episode Silver with more stages, to explain more of the story and even work out some stuff from the lore - why is Crisis City there? Why they are fighting Sonic?

A reworked story made around the levels in the base game and the new ones, written by Flynn would also be great. If budget is a problem they could take the MoSTH approach and make it comic style.
    Iirc the lore was that the void space was pulling from Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism, it does explain why Crisis City and an antagonistic Silver are there, as it's implied at the end of 06 that though the whole game retconned itself, Sonic and Elise still remember the events of the game
        > Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism,

Meta Era Shadow is the reason. His personality was butchered from Free Riders and is still *somewhat* here to *this day.*

 Meta Era Shadow doesn't care about his promise to Maria, hates humans, hates Sonic, has no friends, Team Dark only exists as a means to an end (not born from actual friendship) and he's just a massive edge-lord. If you want a good semblance of how Shadow *should be,* look at Heroes, Sonic Battle, 06 and Sonic Prime. 

He's very closed off but not incapable of friendship, he respects Sonic (even though he rarely shows it) and values humans because of his humanity and promise towards Maria.
            True facts. Lol so yeah there's an explanation for Shadow being a dick; it's just not covered by the "Sonic's memories" clause
            His past doesn’t drive him anymore since he moved on, but yeah.
                Yeah, he put the past behind him but that shouldn't make him just give up on Maria's promise imo.
        >Iirc the lore was that the void space was pulling from Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism

But Sonic shouldn't remember those things due to the timeline reset.
            Tbf it's vague about if he does or not. At the end of the game, we see him run by the Soleanna Festival of the Sun like he did at the start, and for a moment, he stops and smiles down at Elise. This could imply that the two of them still remember the events that had been erased, thus canonizing Crisis City and Silver as memories in his mind
                I mean, him going to soleanna could just him going there for the festival. The same reason why he went there at the start of 06.
                    True true. Like I said, it's pretty vague and open ended. But, if it's true that he does remember, then Crisis City and Silver being in Generations makes sense
            Sonic and Elise are outside of time when they pressed delet on Solaris, so their minds went unaffected.
                Literally at the end of 06, Elise doesn't even remember Sonic.

https://youtu.be/r8HU5f8XG6w?t=37m18s

Seeing as Elise doesn't remember Sonic and the events of Sonic 06, neither does Elise.
    What's MoSTH? I know its "of Sonic the Hedgehog" but what is the M? And how would comic style change budget or whatever?
        Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog
It was a free Steam visual novel they released on April Fools day last year. I highly recommend it.
            I'm stupid. Sorry.

Thanks tho,but I know that game already.
I want more Classic characters to appear, even if they’re just more sentient props that encourage Sonic it feels wrong to have only Tails and Eggman. Not even Knuckles.
More stage, Improved physics of classic Sonic
    I thought the physics were pretty good. May not be that accurate but fitted the stages and he could go really fast
icecap zone!
    Still can't believe they didn't use icecap and went with Sky Sanctuary. Like there's already two versions of icecap in two games, Classic could have been S3&K version while Modern is the Adventure version with the avalanche at the end. And if the music was that much of an issue, they have the prototype soundtrack. Then again, S3&K pretty much barely ever gets acknowledged as is.
Combine all levels in both the Wii and 3DS versions.

Add Classic Knuckles and Classic Amy (was going to say Classic Team Chaotix too, but due to Knuckles Chaotix not being canon, I left them out)

Add The Hooligans as a classic boss

Playable Classic & Modern Tails

More stages representing other Classic and Modern games not repped yet
    There was a Wii Generations?
        Yep.
            Mind sending me a link? I've never seen this before
                Sonic Generations released on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, alongside the 3DS version. I don't think a Wii or Wii U version ever released officially.
                    It was planned initially for the Wii but due to the console’s hardware they had to tone it down and create another game. Hence Sonic Colors was developed.
                        Well that's pretty interesting, considering Colors ended up in the final version for Generations. Either way, no Wii version of Gens.
    Knuckles' Chaotix is canon
        Not to the Classic timeline.
        There's only one timeline now. Tailstube confirmed that the game is canon 
Surprisingly a new take on the generations vibe. Instead of just classic and modern in their own levels; mix it up with both sonics crossing over into the others gameplay in the background as the story progresses.

Eg. Imagine you're modern sonic running through emerald hill, suddenly a rift opens up as it gets unstable and you see classic sonic running and copying what you're doing briefly. You then see a wall up ahead that seems impassable and suddenly it collapses with no reason; you run to the end and finish it.

Cut to you playing classic sonic running through emerald hill and suddenly a rift opens up as it gets unstable and you see modern sonic running and copying what you're doing briefly. You see a badnick blocking the way so you attack it and kick it into a rift that closes as you pass buy; a muffled sound of it hitting a wall plays and you finish the level.

&#x200B;

Stuff like that. With the levels getting more and more unstable until classic and modern levels start merging, crumbling and eventually the other sonic starts crossing over into the modern levels and vice versa. Levels merging like Chemical Highway, Palmside Hill or Labyrinth Palace until reality starts warping enough that you end up in newer locations; eventually ending up in levels for games that aren't even released yet; hopping between dimensions like sonic prime, sonic boom and the movie sonic inspired levels until you fight the final boss.

Pretty much either eggman or a new villians and it ends with tails (who was absent for a while during the story) arriving with some help, talking about how he found these Hyper Emeralds that were trapped in another reality, only accessable due to how reality is breaking; giving us a hyper sonic battle where you swap between classic and modern gameplay and the two sonics. 

All to a new remix of Doomsday and Open your heart as a mashup.
    Fuck me, your last bit sounds ***awesome.*** Sadly, I Know Sega won't do it. :/
Playable Tails (or merely having him ***actually participate in the plot***) is a must. Also, some new stages from not just *Unleashed* but later games would be nice... then again, how would they make the timeline work?
Thats the biggest question I have. Colors added barely anything new but also wasn't available on any platform but the Wii. Generations is playable on everything but the switch, and still completely looks the part. Hell the Xbox version has a 60fps patch for Series S/X to boot. So what can they upgrade/change??

More levels I highly doubt, playable characters like Shadow would be cool but nothing too major. Customization was pretty lackluster in Colors. Genuinely don't know what to expect. 

Just hope the Squirrel dev team doesn't have their hands on it like they did with Colors Ultimate.
    >Generations is playable on everything but the switch

It can't be played on PS4 or 5 anymore because they removed ps now
        Ahh well "could" then.
    Complete do away with most of the baked lighting and redo the visuals to be in line with a modern video game
    The only reason Blind Squirrel butchered it was because they were pressed for time. Let them cook, and maybe they can make something truly great.
        There was plenty of evidence the Dev team had no clue what to do. This wasn't just SEGA.
            Yes like there's even proof they could've improved the cutscenes, but just didn't.
I swear this is like the 5th time I see someone bring up a Generations remake today. Is there some new rumours that I missed?
    A leak for the next State of Play very heavily implied that there’s something Generations-related in the works, or at least a game with Sonic and Shadow.
        Ah I see, very cool
            Apparently did the same company that runs Sonic SuperStars website also obtain the domain " https://sonicxshadowgenerations.com "
    State of Play leak for the 31st including some of it's content, and an hour ago it just so happened to get announced. So the leak is likely correct.
I've said this before, but dead characters should have been in the white space. We could have Tikal instead of Omochao as the guide (nobody likes Omochao), Gamma and Emerl could come back, you could set up an Episode Shadow since Maria, Gerald and the Biolizard would be there - really, there's endless possibilities.

Plus, have more Classic characters. Classic Amy and Knuckles are obvious, but the Classic Chaotix, Mighty, Ray and Honey, Team Hooligan, Metal Knuckles and Tails Doll would have been awesome to see.
Some extra stages based around the more recent titles (Forces, Superstars, Frontiers, etc.)

Improved physics for the classic stages.

Alternate characters for each playstyle (Classic Tails and Shadow).

Drop the thing of having to clear a mission from each area just to play the boss of the era.
I want the missions to be entirely optional this time.

Would also be neat to have more unlockable concept art and music
A playable shadow
    Now i just image shadow wielding a red Kanata and i can't let that image out of my mind, so i want to share that thing with everyone else
        Hey wait didn't that happen before what was is... Sonic and the black knight?
            It wasn't a red katana as far as I remember
Stages from the portable games. Game Gear, Game Boy Advance, DS. (That will mean a second level from Colors)

As well as console games originally left out. CD, Shadow, Storybook
just more new content period.
Add some new levels even if just from the 3ds version

More playable characters

Expend the story a bit with maybe episode shadow and episode silver explain why they are here and why they are fighting sonic because that really didn't make sense
Rework time eater boss fight
Drop dash, new voice acting, and better writing. I feel they could improve on the story more.
Handheld stages. Sonic Rush music was awesome and hearing remastered versions would be nice. Realistically, they'd add stages from forces, frontiers and either lost world or boom. It would be nice to have mania and superstars separate for 2D levels.
I just want them to FIX THE BUGS in the PC version

The game literally crashes on launch half the time. The online mode constantly crashes. The Time Attacker achievement is completely broken. 

How Sega got away with this port is beyond me
More levels. Like actual levels. I love this game to death, but its too short.
Some stages based off of frontiers
Honestly, I don't really think this Sonic game out of **ALL** the other ones needs a remaster, but if it does get one, then:

\- New Playable Characters

\- More Stages(DLC?)

\- Soundtrack Swapping(EX: Possibly swapping the remix of City Escape to the original)

\- Better Story(although it is just a remaster)

That's all I can really think of.
Give me a mephiles boss fight
    It'd be cool to include more final bosses, like how Perfect Chaos was in og Generations. The Biolizard, Neometal Sonic, Solaris,
        I saw a lot of people talking about an episode shadow so why not add mephiles but a tag team Solaris boss fight would be awesome
Keep the base Game intact and add more content, the only problem i had with generations is that its TOO DAMN  SHORT

Maybe more Challenges, make the other hedgehogs playable, more stages and two acts for classic Sonic and two for modern Sonic?
Would love to see more levels from Sonic CD. It was cool to have the Metal Sonic boss fight, but there’s way too many good stages from CD to exclude from the game and they made a mistake to not include them the first time.
All i hope is that sega wont let another inexperienced team do the remaster ngl.
Both Console and 3DS levels, bossfights(especially Biolizzard) but also a sonic CD level that isn't just fight Metal, Sonic Spinball and Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. And a boss corresponding to each game that is shown in the level. Or change it so each level is like a corrupted amalgamation of each game instead Green Hill zone you get aspects of all the zones from the first game and so on.
I would definitely like to see some of the 3DS stages. The Radical Highway remixes are too good to stay on that console.
More classic characters.
Stages from games that got left out. The lack of any Advance trilogy stages in the 3DS version of Generations baffled me. Music Plant Zone or Highway 99 would be a lot of fun.
Cd stages.
It's a reMASTER, not reMAKE, they probably wouldn't put more content in there, just improve on controls and graphics if anything lol. 

Missions being optional would be good though.
If it’s a remaster then there will be no big new stuff, only minor things.


Maybe faster load times.
3 new zones for the original 3 eras and a new era with 12 new zones .
maybe an updated story with more context and better voice acting plus more playable characters. Also, i would add maybe future levels like ( sonic can peers into the future with time mested up )
    I can see it now tho, a specific DLC for PARADOX levels. Scrapped stages that were planned but scrapped for one reason or another.
        for real and then at the end a tease of a new game / villain
Anything better than sonic colors “ultimate”
What a lame choice to remaster...
double the levels the game currently has, as well as playable shadow and an updated story, even if the story is still mid just get flynn to write it
a difficulty nerf for Time Eater
I've heard alot of people saying it'll include new Shadow content (which makes sense given the movie release), so it'd be cool to see an almost 'Shadow Generations' bit, with a collection of Shadow-exclusive stages. Radical Highway, Westopolis, Sky Rail, Final Chase. Hell, it could even have some additional stages from the games he's playable in, like Heroes and 06. I'm not saying it would include the same amount of stages as core Generations - maybe just 3 or so to   serve as a companion piece to the Dreamcast era.
If this rumor ends being true, Generations is an odd choice to me to remaster. But, I never played the original, so I guess maybe more stages and characters?
1.I wish the Avatars would be brought back and put into Generations. No story significance in the slightest, just something fun to play as at the ass end of the game. Because it's going to be hell in a hand basket trying to mod characters into the game, again, so I just want the Avatars introduced as a fun thing on the side.

2. More stages. I'm looking specifically at Mushroom Hill Zone for this, we missed out. Mushroom Hill would've been absolutely stellar on PC.

Edit: better yet...

1(ALT). Make the game easier to mod. I'm talking models in .DAE or .FBX format.
Gay sex
Playable shadow along with his own stage and boss (maybe westopolis from 05 and the biolizard from SA2)
Apparently it's real as of 20 mins ago
Actual new content that makes the remaster worth it. The original one is great already and Imo doesn't need a remaster. 

This is what would make me want to buy it

1. 3DS stages done right (Act 2 being 3D and the stages being actually fun)
2. Good Classic physics, the OG Gens classic phys are actually decent, but they could be better
3. Let me play as the characters I've saved, or atleast let me play as the rival characters.
4. Options to play through every stage as either Classic or Modern Sonic post-completion of the stage
5. Complete overhaul or removal of missions
6. Something that makes 100%ing the game worth it
7. Stages from newer games 
8. Finally, and least likely, Adventure Sonic and an ACT 3 for every stage

I loved Gens, so I pray to god if they do it, it's not a fucking cash grab "duh huh hey look fans it's the same game from 13 years ago with nothing new or different golly gee ahyuck"
Improve the graphics and delete planet wisp. The game is fine the way it is other than that.
There are two zones that I really want them to add.

Route 99 from advance 3

and Sunset Heights.

Advance 3 was one of the first sonic games I ever played and I just want a 3d version of that zone man...

As for Sunset Heights. It's a cool concept and I really wanna see it better realized honestly
Secret rings, the boss fight vs Djinn
if it does happen, hopefully they learned a thing or two from colors ult
tbh if they did something like this I’d rather just see a sequel with new stages, and maybe some sort of outfit swap, like how Superstars does it but you can unlock them rather than having to buy them lol
I bet it’s just a cheap port that’s completely unnecessary
SONIC RUSH LEVELS BABY BRING EM BACK DONT LET EM B DS PORTS, OR FUCK IT HAVE THE ENTIRE 3DS LEVEL POOL ADDED TO IT
DLC. Just like, a few stage packs, 5-10 bucks each with new remastered stages using the previous assets.
Levels from Mania, Forces, Superstars, Frontiers and Dream Team, obviously. 

And side missions based on the handheld games
DLC levels that aren't just a Pinball minigame

This game has so much potential for DLC levels and it sucks that's all we got
the ability to use the friend abilities in stages
On a related note, i can't believe Sonic 06 is nearly two decades old ..
Idk
More stages. Also did not really like the hub world but i doubt they would change it.
I want it to come with the 3DS game. Or better yet turn the 3DS levels into console versions.
Lost World, Forces, and Frontiers levels then a secret world with Knuckles Chaotix, Shadow, then Mania for like a “mainline spinoff” world
More playable characters and the 3DS stages added.
Probably another challenge mode with races against the other Sonic like Metal in Colors Ultimate

A couple bonus accessories like in Colors Ultimate

Maybe a revamped trophy room and such for more collectibles

Removal of the lives system (best change in modern platformers ngl)
I'd love to see the game on modern consoles, but I'm extremely worried if they bring the Remaster to pc, they're gonna take down the og steam version and we'll lose years of mods that improve the game more than any Remaster ever could

That being said, I'd love to see a stage from Mania appear! More stages in general, more unlockable music, characters, improved graphics, ect.

And make that damn time eater fight playable
I wanna play as my guy knuckles, unlikely I know, but damn I want to
Basically, I like to see it be like Generations+, with new stuff from games that weren't represented before, and the games since.

Not just the obvious stuff like stages from Lost World, Mania, Forces, Frontiers, Dream Team or any of the other games since Generations, but also stuff people were asking for at the time like stages from the handheld games and such.

Also, a stage from CD rather than solely a boss.

You could even do a think like they did with Mario Kart 8 and just keep adding content to it for as long as they can think of new stage ideas.
Realistically speaking, I don't expect more than the barest minimum, similar to Colors Ultimate, but hopefully with less bugs on launch this time. For some people, perhaps "playable on Nintendo Switch" will be a sufficient enough selling point. 

If they want ME to buy it, it's going to need to be a substantial addition. The obvious one to me would be to add new stages from Lost World, Forces, & Frontiers that unlock after beating the original story. But there's tons of potential stages to add that were missing the first time, or from the 13(!) years since release. A framing campaign for them wouldn't even necessarily be required, but it would be nice. 

I dunno Colors Ultimate set the bar somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, so my confidence in even what I just described is low to put it mildly. It's just that this one is even more beloved than Colors, and they're kinda gonna be competing against what the existing PC modding scene has had years to build up. So it's going to take that much more to impress me. 

Hopefully I am proven wrong come Wednesday.
They do what they didint on the colours remaster add both version levels i want both console and handheld level and boss fights
Dragon roooooooooooooooad
Studiopolis/Speed Jungle Zone. It would be so cool
Realistically, stages from the gba games 8 bit games wii games and 06 more music from the later games 
Unrealistically: Jaleel White voicing classic sonic boom stages racing game stages 2d versions of modern sonic bosses 3d version of classic sonic bosses
Stages from the games since then.
3ds stages.
Old models and voices that you can swap.
Playable Metal Sonic. Colors Ultimate was going to implement that, but time restraints prevented that.
I hope that it’s actually a remaster, and not a half-hearted cash grab. 


Psh, could you image if Sega remade a game, but instead of making it better it was a glitchy mess?
It's incredibly unlikely, but cutting down (if not removing) a lot of the 2D sections in the modern Sonic stages would do a lot for me. This is partially sparked by how the 2D section in City Escape act 2 just doesn't feel like it fits properly, and brings down what I think is otherwise a good remake of a level.
instead of having one level to represent each game, have 3, making 12 levels in total, another thing better sound design, because generation's sfx feel weak, also implementing gameplay elements from previous games, like black knight's sword gameplay or the werehog, to really feel like we're going back in time
Merge it with the ds version, better physics, rtx, classic knuckles 
So, understanding that Zippo is sketchy, he claims the remaster will be in Hedgehog Engine 2. 

Since Frontiers and Superstars both use that engine, would it not be pretty simple to add those three as playable characters for both classic and modern stages?
For modern and classic sonic to be playable in each other's levels after beating the game. If modders can do it so can Sega
Longer GUN Truck chase
Please do not try to “improve” the visuals by adding ugly filters and fucking up the lighting. The original game still looks good to this day.

I do not expect any new playable characters, but of course I would love to see it.

New unlockable music would be great. Just go all out and add hundreds of tracks.

Cosmetics could be cool. Hopefully better than Colors Ultimate.

Since they have the models ready to go, maybe add Classic Knuckles and Amy to the hub world when playing as Classic Sonic.
A true story and a final battle that is more than, "touch the button now".
Realistically, Classic Sonic with drop dash, Shadow playable, a few more songs available like Fist bump, Undefeatable & Studiopolis, and being able to play other retro games than Sonic 1.
Most stages and remastered versions of the 3DS stages
And extra generation including levels from games released after Generations like Forces and Frontiers would be sweet, but asking a lot.  Same for unifying the versions and including at least some of the 3DS stages.  (Or an emulated 3DS version.)

I’d settle for a reworked Time Eater boss.  Especially if it hits as hard as the Frontiers Super Sonic bosses.
Add better remixes of certain unlockable songs, the ones in the original we're a bit crap, and fix the planet wisp act 1 track too
ADD DREAMS OF AN ABSOLUYION TO THE PLAYLIST 

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIGHT SILVER WITHOUT MY DREAMS OF AN ABSOLUTION BLESSING MY EARS
A short epilogue with level based on secret rings, black knight,lost world,mania,forces,frontiers, and superstars and maybeeeee the gamegear quadroligy
Swap Planet Wisp with literally any other Colors level (or add one of them as an extra stage). Planet Wisp wasn't a bad level, but it felt like a blend of Green Hill and Chemical Plant, while levels like Starlight Carnival or Asteroid Coaster would have been great for some world variety
For the love of all hell and gods around the universe. If this game does not have online race multiplayer or 2player race like sa2 im going to shoot my sonic plushy with a 22. Mark my words.
Amy and kunckles meets their classic self
not be taken off steam
if im being realistic, new levels
There is actually rumor of sonic generations popping up in the state of play (for Sony I think?)
I’d like levels that acknowledge the Advance and Rush games.
redesign Classic Sonic to be the AOSTH/Mohawk Sonic or ad an option to change his design, have stages from the newer games, have it be around 30$-50$ and have the Switch version be the 3DS version.
    oh and if the remaster is true then are they gonna delist the original game on Steam or are they gonna delist it on Xbox as well?
I dont think it needs one. I'd rather something new.
Very unrealistic but I’d love to see the stages and bosses from the 3DS version, preferably done better and actually in 3D for the modern stages
An actual Mephiles boss fight, some stages from the Gamegear.
shit.
This is in brief, and in more detail what other comments write, or what is in Colors ultimate.
Ice Cap Zone without prototype music
Better final boss
Not expecting much. 

Hopefully at least get new unreleased artwork and design docs and more tracks in the bg music list. 

Guess that fabled scrapped co-op mode would be nice
Improved classic Sonic, Im fine with the way it is but it would be nice to see him more accurate to the genesis, also I want jungle Joyride in the game, obviously not happening but I can dream
Tbh, I think they would just have Infinite rival fights, Playable Shadow, and a new whisp, but that’s it.
Sonic BOOM
Off topic but good GOD I hope they don’t delist the og generations if this is real. That is like mine and a lot of people’s worries for this game. A whole LOT of mods and the work that were put into them are gonna go down the drain if it happens.
Give the option to create own levels to remake maybe other old games like sonic unleashed and good mod support.
Being optimistic here, but hopefully new stages based on more recent Sonic titles.  Hell, maybe bring in the stages and bosses from the 3DS version.
I really hope they don't remaster this game. They should put their money into unleashed or heroes instead
Preferably no remaster. Gens still looks okay by modern standards, is available on Steam, and has a pretty active/cracked modding community there. I don't see the point in releasing a remaster only to probably delist the current version
Mecha Cream & Trip
I don't care. I just want it to be not shit
More characters.
Not remaster, need dlc with new world
I have no faith in new content after Colors Ultimate
Dont care for new stages.The games after Generations are too recent.Planet wisp in generations was already pushing it.I just wand a hd version of the 3ds stages and bosses(the actual bosses,like Egg emperor,not the rival races).
I've seen this idea get shared a few times, but an extra "era" that pulls from Lost World, Mania, and Forces. A stage from each, an Infinite rival fight and a Hard Boil Heavies boss fight. The probability of this is insanely low because it'd be a lot of work for just a remaster that most likely won't be full price, but it'd be cool.
A spin dash for modern Sonic that you can buy from the shop.
New cutscenes. Sonic doesn't push Amy like that
Lots of comments about adding playable characters. That would require so much money and dedication to making each level suitable for the different styles ie. flight, glide, hammer. We already kno Sonic Team never gets enough time to produce what's expected of them since the 90's. Let's applaud anything they do for the next few years and try to ask for more after another successful title or two.
A gallery with concept arts and a pinball mini game. Heck, I am daring today, maybe even one Game Gear game!
Stages and bosses from the 3DS version.

And new stages and bosses from other games.
3D Versions of the Advance Series Stages
Probably gonna be attacked for this

I want new proper remodel for Perfect Chaos if it does appear again

No im not saying i dislike how sonic generations did it not at all!
I just miss that perfect chaos is just pure water without that darker armor and radiation green spikes out of its back ;-;
Different costumes in the collection room. Low poly Dreamcast models, riders gear, maybe some gamegear titles
i hope if they do add shadow, they give him better animations

His high speed animation in sa2 looked great, like he was weaving and pushing off his feet to move faster. recent games and even generations he just lazily glides and his boost is just a float. I wish they would fix it
something i’ve always wanted was a new anniversary style game like generations, highlighting all the stuff that has happened since sonic gens (sonic gens was 1 through colors, so maybe a second one would highlight sonic lost world and onwards) 

i think there are a few ways this could work into a remaster:

-a couple DLC stages
-DLC stages from games left out? (non-mainline games like Shadow and storybook games)
-more character trophies in the gallery
-more songs in the gallery
New zones, better physics for classic sonic and customizable clothes like Sonic Colors Ultimate.
Dare I say it… Chao’s
The sonic boom redesigns 
(Please don't harm it's just a joke)
New levels based on games not represented l.
Levels and bosses from the 3ds version.
New music tracks added.
New trophies in the trophy room.
Shadow campaign.
New characters at sonics birthday party.
New jet the hawk rival battle.

All of this might not happen but these are things I've dreamed of since I was a kid, I hope at least one or two of this happens. ^_^
Probably new zones from Lost World, Mania, Forces and Frontiers
    Would be so weird to get levels from Frontiers seeing as it’s the current game that recently finished its dlc. I also don’t see how it would work since Frontiers is open world
Only way I'll be excited for this is if they add the handheld stages to it. Otherwise, I really don't see why they would choose Gens over any of the other games that aren't anywhere near as accessible. Not to mention I'm gonna have to get that bloody No Damage achievement again ><
Ideally? New stages. Probably won’t happen tho. Realistically, I’m expecting new character(s) and that’s about it. Word on the street is that it’s using Hedgehog Engine 2, so it isn’t too far fetched for them to port the Frontiers characters to it.
New levels is the most important thing.
Eggman stages, come on he caused the entire Sonic Generations storyline and we have 2 Eggman stages(said 2 if we count planet wisp where he has a base there).
Better physics on the Classic Sonic levels, include the 3DS levels, Casino Night becoming a real stage, and a revamp of the Time Eater fight (for god's sakes Sonic Team, make your boss fights fun!)
More stages and bosses, a "dark mode", Live And Learn on the music soundtrack, and customizable costumes for both modern and classic Sonic.
Playable Rivals?

Like, Metal Sonic should be a clone of Classic, Shadow can be a clone of Modern, while Silver could be Modern, but with a few tweaks. (Staying in the air for a longer period, producing a shockwave when you stomp, etc.)
Just more levels. The game is great, it’s just way too short.
sonic
Am I the only one that finds it weird they’re remastering a game that remastered levels? Don’t get me wrong, I loved Generations, but I don’t want a remaster of it. The current game still looks good and I can still easily play it.
I’d love to get a remaster of SA1/2 instead so much more.
More of an acknowledgment of Storybook beyond a throwaway line
New stages... especially from the Advance series, such as Secret Base, Music Plant and Cyber Chase, and bonus points if we get Studiopolis from Mania

All in all, new stages would be cool, especially if it can lead to less gimmicky side missions...
Honestly sick of standalone remasters and remakes

Bring back collections of remasters 

I want a sonic 3d collection
An unlocked skill cap that isn't just 100.

You've have to work for it of course, like it could be the reward for completing the game 100%.
Alot of sand and desert type areas
Well if they were to put actual money and effort into extending the game would I love to the them do what the 3ds version failed to and honor Sonic's handheld legacy by making all new stages for the gamegear, GBA, PSP and DS Sonic games.

But on a more realistic side do I hope we at least get the explanation were Classic Tails suddenly came from that was cut from the original release due to time constrains.
The other Sonic Cast playable.
If Sega messes this up, I will never buy another Sonic game ever again. Period. This game is the best Sonic game of all time, and if they can’t get their act together and do this masterpiece right, then they wont be getting a second chance from me.
I think its funny that you think SEGA would personally add more "content" to a Sonic game. If anything they're just gonna make an Encore Mode and say its new content which it isn't. All they do now is nothing but rehashing.
 this feels kind of lazy? if its true their making another Sonic generations instead of making an orignal game, just seems like we're getting another lazy mediocre sonic game again instead of trying something new
Strip clubs
More stages; gameplay with silver, shadow, metal sonic and knuckles; customization of the characters; alternative different endings
What are the chances of new stages based on Forces and Frontiers? Probably not gonna happen, but it would be neat
    Levels from Lost World, Forces and Frontiers would be great as a post game bonus since they take place after generations.

Like a "You defeated Time Eater, now you have access to the future", but like not being canon that Sonic visits the future.
        I’ll be honest, I completely forgot about Lost World. But hell yeah, a new postgame would be awesome
    I'd be all in on a level based on Sonic Advance, especially 3
    The Forces stages are boring and repetitive and Frontiers are stages taken from Sonic's memories, using Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, Chemical Plant and Speed Highway as a base, many of which are already in Generations. Unless they put the ones they put in update 3, I don't see the point.
        Damn, executed for telling the truth.
        They could re-imagine the levels for the game, applying the level design mentallity from generations. 

A Sunset City level from Forces with good level design would actually rock. And the Cyber City from Frontiers is different enough from Speed Highway to be able to stand on it's own, specially if they take it more from the Final Frontier version of it. Same with Lost World.
Also a level from sonic cd rats not just a boss
> Also a playable shadow

Yes, the game whose core conceit is that the modern version of the title character meets his younger self should indeed have a section that focuses entirely on Shadow /s

Though I'd allow it if it also came with Classic Shadow stages that are literally unplayable due to Classic Shadow just being stuck in a cryotube.
    >Though I'd allow it if it also came with Classic Shadow stages that are literally unplayable due to Classic Shadow just being stuck in a cryotube.

To be honest yes. Same for Shadow in Superstars, If he is an near unplayable gag character you you control him sleeping in his cryotube would it be hilarious enough to justify it.

&#x200B;

Tho on that note. If Shadow were to get any focus I at least would not make it exclusive to Shadow but give some love to all Sonic Rivals.
    Comment aged like milk oof
        Can't get them all right.
DAMN STRAIGHT MY BOY!!!!
YESS SIRR!!! Exactly as I was thinking about all the 3ds stages ported, IN 3D VISUALS, and new stages as well as you said...AND THE GAME IS CONFIRMED LET'S GO BOIS!!!🔥🔥🔥#SonicxShadowGenerations
id say its like a dlc, with shadow replacing classic sonic's side of gens.
Iirc the lore was that the void space was pulling from Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism, it does explain why Crisis City and an antagonistic Silver are there, as it's implied at the end of 06 that though the whole game retconned itself, Sonic and Elise still remember the events of the game
    > Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism,

Meta Era Shadow is the reason. His personality was butchered from Free Riders and is still *somewhat* here to *this day.*

 Meta Era Shadow doesn't care about his promise to Maria, hates humans, hates Sonic, has no friends, Team Dark only exists as a means to an end (not born from actual friendship) and he's just a massive edge-lord. If you want a good semblance of how Shadow *should be,* look at Heroes, Sonic Battle, 06 and Sonic Prime. 

He's very closed off but not incapable of friendship, he respects Sonic (even though he rarely shows it) and values humans because of his humanity and promise towards Maria.
        True facts. Lol so yeah there's an explanation for Shadow being a dick; it's just not covered by the "Sonic's memories" clause
        His past doesn’t drive him anymore since he moved on, but yeah.
            Yeah, he put the past behind him but that shouldn't make him just give up on Maria's promise imo.
    >Iirc the lore was that the void space was pulling from Sonic's memories, and while it doesn't explain Shadow's antagonism

But Sonic shouldn't remember those things due to the timeline reset.
        Tbf it's vague about if he does or not. At the end of the game, we see him run by the Soleanna Festival of the Sun like he did at the start, and for a moment, he stops and smiles down at Elise. This could imply that the two of them still remember the events that had been erased, thus canonizing Crisis City and Silver as memories in his mind
            I mean, him going to soleanna could just him going there for the festival. The same reason why he went there at the start of 06.
                True true. Like I said, it's pretty vague and open ended. But, if it's true that he does remember, then Crisis City and Silver being in Generations makes sense
        Sonic and Elise are outside of time when they pressed delet on Solaris, so their minds went unaffected.
            Literally at the end of 06, Elise doesn't even remember Sonic.

https://youtu.be/r8HU5f8XG6w?t=37m18s

Seeing as Elise doesn't remember Sonic and the events of Sonic 06, neither does Elise.
What's MoSTH? I know its "of Sonic the Hedgehog" but what is the M? And how would comic style change budget or whatever?
    Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog
It was a free Steam visual novel they released on April Fools day last year. I highly recommend it.
        I'm stupid. Sorry.

Thanks tho,but I know that game already.
I thought the physics were pretty good. May not be that accurate but fitted the stages and he could go really fast
Still can't believe they didn't use icecap and went with Sky Sanctuary. Like there's already two versions of icecap in two games, Classic could have been S3&K version while Modern is the Adventure version with the avalanche at the end. And if the music was that much of an issue, they have the prototype soundtrack. Then again, S3&K pretty much barely ever gets acknowledged as is.
There was a Wii Generations?
    Yep.
        Mind sending me a link? I've never seen this before
            Sonic Generations released on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3, alongside the 3DS version. I don't think a Wii or Wii U version ever released officially.
                It was planned initially for the Wii but due to the console’s hardware they had to tone it down and create another game. Hence Sonic Colors was developed.
                    Well that's pretty interesting, considering Colors ended up in the final version for Generations. Either way, no Wii version of Gens.
Knuckles' Chaotix is canon
    Not to the Classic timeline.
    There's only one timeline now. Tailstube confirmed that the game is canon 
Fuck me, your last bit sounds ***awesome.*** Sadly, I Know Sega won't do it. :/
>Generations is playable on everything but the switch

It can't be played on PS4 or 5 anymore because they removed ps now
    Ahh well "could" then.
Complete do away with most of the baked lighting and redo the visuals to be in line with a modern video game
The only reason Blind Squirrel butchered it was because they were pressed for time. Let them cook, and maybe they can make something truly great.
    There was plenty of evidence the Dev team had no clue what to do. This wasn't just SEGA.
        Yes like there's even proof they could've improved the cutscenes, but just didn't.
A leak for the next State of Play very heavily implied that there’s something Generations-related in the works, or at least a game with Sonic and Shadow.
    Ah I see, very cool
        Apparently did the same company that runs Sonic SuperStars website also obtain the domain " https://sonicxshadowgenerations.com "
State of Play leak for the 31st including some of it's content, and an hour ago it just so happened to get announced. So the leak is likely correct.
Now i just image shadow wielding a red Kanata and i can't let that image out of my mind, so i want to share that thing with everyone else
    Hey wait didn't that happen before what was is... Sonic and the black knight?
        It wasn't a red katana as far as I remember
It'd be cool to include more final bosses, like how Perfect Chaos was in og Generations. The Biolizard, Neometal Sonic, Solaris,
    I saw a lot of people talking about an episode shadow so why not add mephiles but a tag team Solaris boss fight would be awesome
I can see it now tho, a specific DLC for PARADOX levels. Scrapped stages that were planned but scrapped for one reason or another.
    for real and then at the end a tease of a new game / villain
oh and if the remaster is true then are they gonna delist the original game on Steam or are they gonna delist it on Xbox as well?
Would be so weird to get levels from Frontiers seeing as it’s the current game that recently finished its dlc. I also don’t see how it would work since Frontiers is open world
