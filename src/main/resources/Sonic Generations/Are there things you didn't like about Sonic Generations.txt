[[Are there things you didn't like about Sonic Generations]]


[deleted]


- story is just pathetically nothing, i understand it'd be hard to make a story around this plot but i still wish it was more interesting.

- final boss is one of the worst in the series 

- classic sonic doesn't talk even though classic tails and eggman do. would've been nice to have Jaleel return.

- light speed dash doesn't work on any rings

- (more so forces doing) but making the classic and modern characters being separate being rather than art styles. 

- half the stages are city themed.

- wish the animation in the cutscenes were better and less robotic (still waiting)
    >final boss is one of the worst in the series

I would argue the Egg Dragoon also lacked polish. You can't freely move left & right like during the Shadow & Silver bosses (or, hell, even the Daytime bosses from Unleashed). You have to awkwardly use the sidestep.

And the way it transitions from the running section to the free-falling section and vice-versa is also pretty awkward.

I swear, there was one cutscene that had sonic animated with squash and stretch, and then never again.
    I’d rather have time Eater than another fucking Nega wisp clone
the game is too short there should have been way more levels crisis city could have been switched out for kingdom valley the old ports of the game had better levels and the DLC is a major disappointment all they made was some casino dlc instead of adding in more levels and the story sucks and finally it has the worst super sonic boss fight
There wasn't more.

-A lot of the remixes I find worse than the original songs

-Classic Sonic controls really badly to me

-S ranks are incredibly forgiving

-Light speed dash being limited to specific lines of rings

-The final boss
2d sections in the modern stages when we had an entire Sonic dedicated to 2d
    We need 3D sections for Classic Sonic
        Id actually be interested in this. More momentum based, angles determin jump angles, etc.
        You mean Sonic (whatever the fangame was called?)
            Utopia?
                No, it was a 3D remake of the classic games, with several zones.
                    Sonic Robo blast?
Story is non existent (though since the last game was colors, we may of been spared)

Levels are pretty short 

Way too easy to get S ranks

Final boss sucks

Planet Wisp kinda sucks too. It starts off good, but once you hit the factory and it becomes a 2D stage where you have to slowly go up, it kills its chances at being great
    Planet Wisp is going to be the only stage I skip when I replay it. Tropical Resort from the DS version was a lot better.
    I definitely agree with S ranks are too easy and the planet wisp comment I spent 14 minutes beating planet wisp with classic sonic and got an A rank
- A bit too short.

- Not the most emotionally engaging campaign (but what can I expect from writing during the 2010s?). Heck, not enough funny writing or banter between most of the cast either.

- Classic Sonic’s not exactly controlling like his actual 2D games.

- Light-speed dash only relegated to specific trails of rings limits Sonic’s freedom of approach.

- Final Boss wasn’t really engaging to battle with in hindsight.

- Cast could’ve had some more screen-time and narrative interactions in the plot. Most of it’s just Sonic, Tails and Eggman (Classic and Modern)

- In terms of legacy, it’s where Sonic Team started adopting bad habits in the form of constantly recycling Green Hill (or its assets) in every major release after this game.

(At the very least, the game makes up for it with its high replay-ability despite its length, in contrast to something like Sonic Forces)

(Also, there was never really any explained logical story reason behind something like Shadow and Silver fighting Sonic in their rival battles, other than just being a nostalgia boss fight. A cutscene explaining what was happening would’ve been nice.)
The Minigames
They shouldn't have made classic sonic mute, I understand not being about to get his OG VA back but I think most would've preferred a sound alike.
Story is virtually non-existent. It needed to be written by people with an understanding of the lore of the series. It was also a real mistake to keep Eggman away from the plot for as long as he is, he should've been front and centre constantly taunting and goading Sonic.

Final boss is a confused mess where it's unclear what you're supposed to do, all the while listening to various supporting cast members shout "That look's like a homing shot" or "be careful Sonic".

Vector's music mission is just a really bad mission.

Otherwise the game is fine. Solid gameplay, decent level design, controls well. Sure, Classic Sonic isn't a 1:1 recreation of the Mega Drive titles, but the levels work for how he does play.
Lack of playable characters. It would have been a 10 for me if you could at least play as the characters you saved.
Other than the final boss (which surprisingly a lot of people seem to not like either), I think the entire game was downright really enjoyable. The weird story I can get behind, but honestly, I didn’t think it was that bad.
Dialogue and writing is really bad, and I didn’t like how every modern Sonic level was like 50% 2D
How it made the majority of the cast nothing more then cheerleaders for Sonic
It is a very short game, not a huge drawback for me at all because I rarely finish long games to begin with but it might be for others.

Also, this is nitpicky territory but I'm not a super huge fan of Classic Sonic being speechless. I understand why they did it, but idk. Maybe it's just because I grew up with the old DIC Sonic cartoons!

To anyone reading these comments who hasn't played the game, I'd still highly recommend Sonic Generations. It's a classic (no pun intended) and when it came out it blew me away.
    Also, a lot of these comments are saying that the story was bad, but for what it was (a 20th anniversary tribute game) I feel like it didn't need that big of a story. I probably would've liked it less if it had a huge story like a lot of the modern Sonic games do lol
It’s my favorite game of all time, but even I’ll admit that the final boss was pretty garbage lol
The egg dragoon boss

Classic controls

Planet wisp 2(Took me 10 minutes to beat it becausr of the last wisp part)

The final boss

Statue codes take super long to type in (that one is minor)
Classic Sonic looks worse, feels worse and sounds worse than the stuff it's based on and it makes half the entire game bad.   
It started the whole thing where Classic Sonic is a "younger, smaller and mute" version of Sonic which I find weird and personally just don't accept.
Classic sonic stages feel like shit and the camera looks really weird.

After the nostalgia effect from my first playthrough (i 1k gamer scored that game in two days after getting it for xmas on 360 in college) wore off kinda realized that game wasn't that great, and definitely unoriginal.

But on pc it's the best platform for mods
I didn't see the appeal, but I played it last year and haven't been a sonic fan for that long so that's probably why, Classic Sonic felt horrible after being so used to the 3&K/Mania physics, and stage design was horrible after Death Egg Robot
This is probably a controversial opinion but I don’t really care for Classic Sonic
Yep. I don't like the game. It's not *bad*, I guess (a lot of people seem to love it), but it's just not for me. As a guy who grew up with Adventure and no other Sonic game, I prefer exploration that is broken up by action stages, not non-stop mostly running in straight lines. Frontiers was a godsend.
classic sonic just feels off to control but that is really the only problem in my opinion.
Nothing. It’s the perfect game imo
    s+ game.
Way too short. You hardly get any time to enjoy it.
- modern sonic Control terrible ( I have this problem with colors and forces)
- classic didn’t control much better
- the level design is just ok
-some of the bosses are drawn out and confusing ( just me tho)
Classic Sonic's physics are pretty jank.
Yea
Maybe the skills part like some abilities for example super sonic should be something you can already do with the press of a button is now something that needs to be added to as a skill
"That looks like a homing shot!"
The story was pretty bad
Story is missed potential, Final boss is bad, S ranks are too easy, there’s no main theme for the game to associate it with (like open your heart, reach for the stars, I’m here, wonder world, I am all of me, etc)
That one Vector mission where you have to home attack the beat back and forth
The Game Is Over All Fine But Really Plain In A Lot Of Parts, And To Short
Classic Sonic. Also the final boss was terrible
Classic sonic is inferior to modern sonic
Final boss is one of the worst boss fights in the entire series. I've had multiple playthroughs where I'll get all S ranks and red star rings, but not even do the final boss to beat the game cuz it just is not fun.
The only thing I didn’t like was Planet Wisp, both 2d and 3d
Looking back, I honestly think it would've been better if Classic versions of characters weren't brought back, and the other playable characters would've been just been the rest of the normal cast.

Keep the story of Eggman using the Time Eater, but have every stage playable by characters that actually have a unique playstyle, which would also do a better job of celebrating the franchise's history.
The classic sonic model and the fact he didn’t talk. I just wish it had the more sonic cd animation look, or hell it would’ve been a cool chance to put a 2D sonic in a 3D background. Also Sonic could talk in the classic games. Making him mute was dumb imo
\- Garbage final boss

\- Story is basically non existent and could of been explore a whole lot more

\- Way to short, I beat it in one afternoon, begging to end
Yeah

It ended
No Advance trilogy levels.
- It's too short.

- The Time Eater is a bag of dicks.

- The story is as existent as the Twin Towers.
I feel like it was too short
The premise of this game was absolutely *begging* for DLC. Reimagining old levels from previous games, there's so many more games to choose from. 

Could've had DLC levels from side games with unrepresented side characters standing outside them, all with more missions, etc.
\- The writing of the whole Boost serie is painfull to me  
\- Why did the wisp stick around when the whole point of the previous games was to let them return home ?  
\- Silent classic Sonic
Wished classic sonic could talk. Also more screen time for him as well. More climax would be good as well. Everything seemed to happen at the end. I just wanted more classic sonic really.
Yeah, my PS3 version had serious controller input lag.
The “Story”
Besides half the levels being cities (which imo is understandable with how they selected the levels via poll)

Super modern sonic not being able to boost without instantly losing all their rings is dumb and makes him the worst feeling normal level super sonic I have ever played

The story basically being just an excuse to throw together a bunch of iconic levels

The utter uselessness of the additional characters

The shadow boss isn’t nearly hard enough, even in hard mode
You can't use Super Sonic in Boss and Rival battles, and they drain the rings twice as fast.
-Lack of a story

-the final boss

-S rank is too easy

-Planet wisp
Because they had the fans vote on the levels, it feels like we got a bunch of stages representing the "cool" moments of each game instead of more iconic ones. As a result, we ended up with two Green Hill type stages and four city themed levels (seven, counting boss fights). I wish we got a more rounded selection of stages that better represented each individual game (Colors is a game about amusement parks in space, but they picked the one stage that isn't a theme park, for example. And we didn't even get a casino level outside of a tiny minigame DLC)
It's too short
About the only thing I truly disliked about this game was one Red Ring in Modern City Escape.  One where you have to make a high jump and "thread the needle" to get one out in the open.  I had to restart the level so many times just to get that one Red Ring.  Absolutely hate it.
How terrible the controller support is on steam
Too short and not enough levels

Barley a story

Very strange direction for the final boss fight
Final boss, story, planet wisp... I hate planet wisp, the fact that its too short, they could've had at least 2 zones from each game to lengthen out the game like.... ..... Angel Island.... Green forest.... Maybe add some story book levels....
Dull level select (the white void
Absurdly short and padded out with bland side missions.

Terrible dialogue, though not as bad as Colors, thankfully.

Other than that, everything else was pretty good.
My Xbox broke and my steam version isn’t working anymore so I guess the fact that I can’t play is what I don’t like
mostly just nitpicks:
the ranking system is kinda meh.
planet wisp act 2 has too much 2d especially the end.
classic sonic is fun but he can have some improvements like the physics and speed.
the story could have had some great moments but instead was just "we need to save our friends and bring back color to all these worlds, including crisis city a fucking city of fire, yea we don't care it's hell".
there should have been more dlc with more music tracks to collect and original levels.
classic sonic not being actually blue instead of a grouse light blue.
classic sonic not being able to speak but classic tails and eggman can.
the characters don't recognize any level like green hill or even the later levels.
no 3d hub world instead a 2d structed hub.
the bub world not changing after 100% completion.
the final boss is boring and the music is forgettable.
the game doesn't look as nice as sonic unleashed.
no customizable sonic costumes (ik sonic frontiers and colors ultimate came out after this but i would be nice to have).
when u play the versus mini game i wish the other modern sonic was classic sonic (or vise versa), i just think it would be perfect and it be cool to see classic sonic in a more 3d space.
no cgi cutscenes (also the case for alot of other games after this tho i wanna point out sonic frontiers kinda has cgi cutscenes but not the same style of the advertisements).
the camera doesn't move around in stages like in unleashed.
the drift isn't bad but i think it's more fun to have the unleashed drift because it makes it more challenging.
there isn't enough abilities like the sweep from unleashed and 06 or bounce from sa2.
and there isn't any dialogue in the levels when u fist play them on story mode.

but some of these are mods u can simply put on with the hedgehog modloader, and i still really love generations over all, there's just some things that make it not so pefect
most of the classic stages after sky sanctuary and the dumbass final boss
Final boss gameplay. Short.
planet wisp, final boss is garbage, lack of story, you can pretty much S rank the entire game in one shot
Ending
Planet Wisp sucks ass and it fell off so fucking hard in the modern stage. Less 2D, more 3D.
Planet Wisp
Classic Sonic’s physics are mid and his levels are boring
1. Story lacks. Could have been way better considering the writers are responsible for one of the darkest cartoons around.

2. Level design is NOTHING compared to Unleashed. There’s barely any paths that split off from the main.

3. The 3DS version has new zones. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem but barely anyone owns a 3DS and most people probably haven’t heard mushroom hill since Sonic and Knuckles.

4. Graphics. It was 2011. Sonic Unleashed’s graphics were better.

5. Super Sonic is useless. His rings drain twice as fast and he gains no speed (to my knowledge). Unlimited boost? Who needs that when there’s such a surplus of rings that you never run out anyway?

6. These cutscenes… really? Both CGI and regular. The CGI was better in ‘06, let alone Unleashed!

7. I have a problem with Classic Sonic in a modern game, like the problem I have with Modern Sonic in classic fan games. It doesn’t fit at all.

8. Why can Classic Tails speak? Classic Sonic can’t.

Nonetheless, however, I did love this game. (Except I sort of haven’t played it since I got to the final boss and couldn’t figure out how to beat it)
Sooo many things man! I can't count them all! But my biggest disappointment is that we got a boss battle for cd and not a full stage! That's just disappointing
I haven't played the game in full so I can't really criticize anything fairly. Except for one thing, Sonic Youth does not play during the final boss which is a shame.
Most (if not all) of the 3d levels are atleast 40% 2d
 Biolizard wasn't in the PC version.
Only thing I hate with a passion is the controller issue where it'll disconnect at random during gameplay and I'd have to restart my game, I managed to fix it with the hedgemodlauncher but it shouldn't have been an issue to begin with. Or maybe this was a modding issue.
first sonic i played

s+ in my book
>final boss is one of the worst in the series

I would argue the Egg Dragoon also lacked polish. You can't freely move left & right like during the Shadow & Silver bosses (or, hell, even the Daytime bosses from Unleashed). You have to awkwardly use the sidestep.

And the way it transitions from the running section to the free-falling section and vice-versa is also pretty awkward.

We need 3D sections for Classic Sonic
    Id actually be interested in this. More momentum based, angles determin jump angles, etc.
    You mean Sonic (whatever the fangame was called?)
        Utopia?
