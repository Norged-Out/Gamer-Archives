[[Is Sonic Generations as good as people say]]


honestly I really don't think Generations is as "amazing" as people say. 
-the progression system was bad (boss keys)
-the levels really take a nos dive in terms of quality near the end (planet wisp
-the final boss was bad
what do you all think of the game?


Aside from planet wisp (at least the Classic version of it, the Modern version has grown on me a bit), it easily has the best level design of any post-3&K Sonic game (before Mania existed). Also... was I one of the few who actually liked those optional challenge things you do for Boss Keys? Yeah, I can understand not liking the fact that you have to do some of them to progress (even though it's only 9 out of a possible 90), but I kinda liked how they offered some extra stuff to do outside of main content, and (for once in a Sonic game) there were way more *good* optional missions than there were bad, at least in my opinion.
    The boss key stuff wasn't as intrusive as the medal collecting from Unleashed or the animal stuff in Lost World (and even that wasn't as bad as the medal collecting), but it does feel like a pointless diversion. It's quick and doesn't take very long, but it feels like a pointless thing to make players do.
    Its the opposite for me. The Classic version of planet wisp has grown on me (though I won't say its great solely because of the obnoxious use of the wisps) while modern is still pretty meh once you get to the 2d segments.
    I liked the challenge acts, getting optional content from it like artwork and music was cool. But having to play at least 3 in each section to progress felt like a chore
Most people that praise Gens don't praise it for most things besides the Level Design formula that managed to completely merge the Adventure and Boost aspects, and, most importantly, Classic Sonic. Though on a serious note. Due to it's lack of "Boost 2 Win" or it being drunk on platforming like Colors [Wii] (Still can't see why people praise it so much), It appeals to a lot more people. Thus, it's praised more. Story-wise, it leaves a lot to be wanted. But overall, it's actually worth it. Plus, if you bought it on PC, you must know of the modding community for it .
For the most part, I'd say yes, Generations is great. Classic Planet Wisp is gonna annoy some people, and the Time Eater is a trash final boss, but Generations as a whole is easily the best designed 3D game of the franchise IMO. 
I thought Planet Wisp and the final boss were bad. I personally don't like Seaside Hill but that's not a hill I'm willing to die on as far as thinking people will agree with me-- for the most part the level design is great and it shows. I think the 2D part in a few of the Modern Sonic levels definitely slowed down a few areas in the game... Crisis City had a pretty garbage 2D level, and even though I liked it over all I thought the Speed Highway level was kind of slow in a couple areas (but I think you can mostly get around those if you boost a lot and jump more). It's been a while since I've played any of the classic levels but I remember them being pretty decent. I can only really remember the ending of Classic Sonic's Crisis City level as being kind of annoying for me. Rooftop run for Modern Sonic is so fast and seamless for me it's crazy! I liked some of the optional missions but I hatted the one with the giant Chopper where you had to run on water.

All in all I think Generations was a good game, definitely one of the best as far as level design. The mods are also fun.
It's the best Sonic has ever been.
I'd argue that Crisis City is also pretty bad, so yes I agree that the levels drop in quality after you beat Seaside Hill (though they pick up a bit with Rooftop Run)
    I disagree. While seaside hill is the best level in the game, they took one of the worst designed levels in the entire series, crisis city, and made it actually kinda fun to play.
        The level is fine until it goes to 2D. Then it goes to complete and utter shit and is almost as bad as Planet Wisp.
            Ohhhhh yea. No reason for it to be 2d.
    I originally hated crysis city but after a few runs I began to appreciate the 3D platforming. 
Revisiting it, I've grown to love it more. Sure the story wasn't much, but the level design was fantastic. It's one of my all time favorite Sonic games. 
From pure gameplay and graphical standpoint(on PC at least) Generations is great, one of my favourites. Plot is non-existent, sure. Planet Wisp and the final boss suck, sure. But other levels are great (one of my favourites being Crisis City for trying to speedrun) and felt really organic, levels, while being somewhat short, didn't feel short (unlike some other boost game that came out recently). Boss keys are a non-issue to me, but I do see how these can break the pace. The level design is one of the best in the boost series (although Unleashed daytime levels are somewhat more fun to blast through). Drifting and short-hop are also something I really like using(and was really bummed to see them gone in Forces and be replaced with...even more automation). Even Classic Sonic levels don't feel like a chore. So yeah, I consider it a very good game.

Also 60 FPS with FxPipeline graphics is just the definitive Modern Sonic experience. Also mods. They're great too. 
I have no idea why everyone thinks the level quality drops off. I have a blast with all of the last 3 levels.
Gameplay wise your basically just gonna play it for the modern stages
From a level design perspective it's the best 3d sonic game and the most consistently good 
the most heat sonic game
Roger Craig Smith tells about change the video game from the bad Sonic Frontiers game to the good Sonic Generations game for Xbox Series X backwards compatible.
Aye I agree
It is but the final stage is so bad because is it a good idea or not and the content is kind of tedious but fun
I like you because of the boost mechanic
Well I think it's all good
I meant it

        Ohhhhh yea. No reason for it to be 2d.
