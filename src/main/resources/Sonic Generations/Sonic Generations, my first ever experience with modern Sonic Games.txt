[[Sonic Generations, my first ever experience with modern Sonic Games]]


I was never a really big sonic fan, I only played the original sonic the hedgehog game back when I was a kid, like 5 or 6, and I never got around to playing any of the modern games.
A couple of months ago, one of my friends which is a huge sonic fan, gifted me sonic generations to play. I was finishing another game so I said maybe later.
Two weeks ago when that game was finished, I took a look at my library and saw Sonic Generations and I Said why not. 
So I installed it and started the game. 

When I started the game, I got hooked. I really liked the idea of the two generations of sonic colliding and being in one place. According to my sonic nerd friend, this game was the celebration of sonic 20th birthday. 

When the first stage started, I got greeted with a classic sonic stage, but with 3D models. The mechanics was easy to learn, run, jump and spin dash. The spin dash is really satisfying. It took me while to figure out the stage lay out and how to get through it. I really enjoyed it. 

After the initial cutscene with modern Sonic, when the act 2 stage started, I got introduced to the boost mechanic, and I LOVED it, OH my God it's so fun. Combined with the homing attack, it was one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had In a video game. And when you get the short cuts right, my God it feels good. 

After that, I started every stage with Act 2, tried to learn the route the first time through and going for the best time the next time. 
One complain I have with the game, is That it decreases your lives when you restart a stage, like why is that a thing? And when you run out of live you can't restart. It was so annoying. I fixed that with the hedge mod manager which my friend told me to install. 

One other complain that I had, was the goddamn controls, and I'm not talking about the control when you're run at the speed of light, I'm talking about the normal walking control, it's super slippery that most of the times I just fell out of the platforms cause sonic just couldn't stand in one place. 

Back to the things I liked. The games itself is pretty short, about 5-6 hours for the main story. But the replay value is incredible. You can replay every stage to beat you past record and go through the massive amount of challenges in both act 1 and 2. It's fun to go back to it. 
The level design is really good. You can find shortcuts and get the top route to get the best time, and if you miss them you'll be sent to the bottom which is slower and will get you more time to finish the stage. 
The music in some stages are absolute bangers. Crisis City, Highway Speed, Rooftop run are my favorites. 

The bosses were okay, I liked the Egg Dragon, but I absolutely hated the Time Eater, probably one of my least favorite boss fights of all time. 


Overall, it was a really fun and satisfying experience. I'm probably gonna start playing more sonic games now thanks to this game. I'm open to suggestions on which ones to start first. 

8/10


Very fair review. I'm not sure if you only have PC but Sonic Unleashed is a game with the same kind of 3D levels as Generations so they're very fun. There is alot if questionable stuff in the game besides those stages so it isn't as tight an experience as Generations and it isn't on pc. There is a very famous mod called the Unleashed project in Generations that adds all the Unleashed levels to the gsme which many prefer but I personally don't.

Sonic Adventure 1 is probably the best suggestion, it isn't exactly the same gameplay but going fast and mastering levels is just as fun. There's also a must have mod for the game but not going to go into that all rn. It is the first 3D Sonic game so some would say it's very dated but I think it still holds up for the most part
    I played Sonic Adventure 1 so much on the Dreamcast. Second the suggestion. 

For a 2D game, Sonic Mania is actually decent. It does feel more like a fan made game, though.
        Never seen Sonic Mania feeling like a fan game tobe said like a flaw. Personally I don't think Mania is as good as a classics because he reuses alot of zones, the game doesn't have a strong identity
            I think the reuse of zones is what makes it feel like a fan game to me and kind of hurts the replayability. Although my kid and I have raced in that game so many times and definitely justified the purchase.
                Fair enough, that makes sense. Though I'm pretty sure the fans that made Mania wanted to do a full original game but Sega wanted mostly old zones
    Thanks, and yeah I play on pc. I have heard about unleashed from my friend. Will probably get an emulator for it. And tbh I've never heard about the mod, will look into it.

I've seen people suggest sonic adventure 2, probably because it's less dated than 1, but I'll look into 1 as well
Unleashed Day Stages are the closer gameplay type to Generations but I'd say each Sonic game has its own things to appreciate.
Always glad to see people new to the franchise enjoy a Sonic game! Yeah Time Eater is awful, I think it’s pretty unanimously agreed to be the worst part of that game. And yeah, Generations has some of the best level design in the franchise.

I’d recommend Sonic Adventure 2, especially if you can get it on Gamecube or Dreamcast (Steam/PS3/360 port is playable but is noticeably glitchier then other versions). The stages in that game are especially replay-able, you’ll have to perfect your routes through the stages if you want to get A ranks. Graphics are dated but if you can get past that the story is excellent, it knows when to be goofy and when to be serious. There’s also a side mode called the Chao Garden, it’s a pet simulator with a surprising amount of depth, and you upgrade your pets with crystals and animals you find by exploring the main game’s levels.
    Unfortunately I can't really get my hands on a GameCube nor a dreamcast, will probably have to play the steam version. Graphics was never really a concern for me so I'll probably be fine. And I've never heard about the pet simulator thing, that sounds fun
For some reason 2nd time trying to play this i got like 1 fps. (Not a too old machine). :(
    Damn, that's sad. I'm not an expert but there's a mod for the game that lowers the graphics, that might help
