[[Does anyone think that Sonic Generations is too easy]]


Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but does anyone agree that Sonic Generations is a bit too easy? I mean, you can just boost in Modern levels and get an S or A easily. In the classic levels, you can get hit and get an S. 


Honestly, I kinda like having easy S ranks to get. As much as I love Sonic Adventure 2, it's a bit of a blow to the self esteem when you pull off every trick in the book, don't take a single hit, cure all the world's diseases and then find yourself slapped in the face with a C rank for your efforts. With Generations, I can easily pretend I'm good at the game.
    Agreed. I had to play City Escape (from SA2) way too many times to get an A rank. I played SA2 mostly to get Chao Garden stuff, but in Sonic Generations, it actually was pretty satysfing to get a S rank.
    Getting hit in SA2 doesn't actually affect your rank at all. You get points for collecting rings but the rings you keep at the end don't add to your score. Personally, I loved the challenging ranks in SA2, as actually having to put in some effort to get the highest rank was very rewarding when you finally achieved it. Some levels were perhaps a bit too anal about how well you have to do, but most are fair, whereas every level in Gens is a cakewalk that you can easily S rank so long as you don't die and don't dawdle. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
Getting all the red rings adds some well needed challenge to the game.

Unleashed had the best ranking system, Adventure 2 was just stupidly difficult 
It's easy, short, but it's also incredibly fun. There's nothing more satisfying than keeping the speed up for the whole stage, even if it doesn't get you anything in the game itself. And the remastered stages for Classic just complete the whole thing. I think if the rank requirements were raised it could add some challenge. Is there a mod for that?
Yes it is, you don't even need to take any shortcuts in order to get S rank. Boss battles in "hard mode" were not very challlenging as well. Unleashed was better for me when it comes to ranking
Yeah, I feel that it was the easiest game in the series to 100% complete. Would have also benefited from something like a chao garden for replayability.
Also it's a shame they didn't use the hidden trophy room collection better.
Yes, I feel exactly the same. The ranking system in Generations is so lenient there might as well not be one. You have to create self-imposed challenges, usually with the online leaderboards, in order to actually have a satisfying challenge with that game. Still love Gens since it's the game that got me back into the series, which I guess means that I appreciate that it was easy, but the low difficulty hurts the replay value quite a bit.
Yes, it's insultingly easy. I was looking forward to something more akin to Unleashed.
    LOL, you think THAT'S insultingly easy? Play Sonic Forces, that game is the DEFINITION of insultingly easy and it's 10 times easier.
        Yup. Played it blind in 4 hours.

Glad I waited until it was $10.
            Which one are you talking about, Generations or Forces?
                Forces.
