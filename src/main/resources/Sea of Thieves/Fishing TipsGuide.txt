[[Fishing TipsGuide]]


Not mine but sharing the info!

INTRODUCTION

Here's a PSA for anyone who needs help. Fishing is very vague, and is sometimes unclear. This is completely fine, however there are some things the game just doesn't tell you at all. So, me and some other people are gathering as much information as we can, so everyone can have fun fishing. Enjoy!

~HOW TO FISH

To equip bait to your line, hold the fishing rod, and then go to the Item Radial. Where it says "More" there will be another option, "Bait"

To fish, wait till a fish bites on, then pull the rod the opposite direction of the fish. Keep fighting it, and then eventually it will get tired out and you can reel it in. Repeat the process.

~FISH TYPES

Splashtails, Pondies, and Islehoppers don't need bait.

Splashtails are anywhere.

Pondies are ONLY in freshwater (Devil's Ridge. Pan next to the pond)

Islehoppers are ONLY around islands.

Plentifins are ONLY in the Shores of Plenty. Use worm.

Wildsplashes are ONLY in the Wilds. Use worm.

Ancientscales are ONLY in the Ancient Isles. Use leech

Devilfish are ONLY in the Devil's Roar. Use grub

Battlegills are ONLY around Skeleton Ships and Skull Forts. Use grub

Wreckers are ONLY around Shipwrecks. Use worm

Stormfish are ONLY in the Storm. Use leech

~ISLEHOPPER INFO

NOTE: with very few exceptions, schools of only one subspecies of Islehoppers can be found at each large island.

Stone Islehopper: Cannon Cove, Crooks Hollow, Sailor's Bounty, Shipwreck Bay, Sharkbait Cove, etc.

Moss Islehopper: Wanderer's Refuge, Marauder's Arch, Thieves Haven, etc.

Raven Islehopper: Discovery Ridge, Sharkbait Cove, etc.

Honey Islehopper: Crescent Isle, Sunken Grove, Plunder Valley, Kraken's Fall, Discovery Ridge, etc.

Amethyst Islehopper: Devil's Ridge, Crooked Masts, Smuggler's Bay, Snake Island, etc. (night time only)

You must be fishing in the sea within the title card range of an island to catch them

Thanks to @Alien8theBunny for this info on Islehoppers!

~FISHING TIPS

There are 5 types of each fish, and for MOST fish, the first three seem to be increasingly rare, while the 4th one is the "Super Rare" one, and the 5th one is the glow-in-the-dark nighttime exclusive one.

Cooked fish & food is worth more, burnt is worth less.

Wiggle the rod around to reel faster.

You can reel while the fish is struggling to get a small bit of progress, but it is risky. You can only turn it 1/4 turn before it snaps if the fish is not tired.

Use the right bait or you'll just catch Splashtails, with some exceptions.

Sell fish & cooked meat at Seaposts.

You don't need bait to catch trophy fish; they're just rarer versions of the respective normal variants

Unlock different fishing rods for each set by catching & selling different fish. Check the tool shop to see them all.

More hard-to-find fish are worth more. I got a Trophy Sun Wrecker, cooked it, and it sold for 4.8k. OUTDATED; Sun Wrecker value was swapped with Snow Wrecker value.

When you can't grab a fish, check if your food is full.

~COOKING TIPS

All the fruits heal you different amounts.
Bananas: 10%
Coconuts: 20%
Pomegranates: 30%
Mangos: 50%
Pineapples: 100% (2)
Pineapples can be eaten twice.

Cooked food gives more health, prevents food poisoning, and fills your regen bar. The regen bar will drain itself, but fill your health if you stop taking damage for a couple seconds.

Fruit doesn't cook. It only burns. It's good for a quick heal, but doesn't give a regen bar.

When meat is cooking, it will go from completely pink, to completely brown. If there's any large pink sections, put it back on the pan.

When a fish is cooked, the skin will go brown and the eyes will go milky. Even if they change color, (ex. Red fish to Blue fish) wait until they go brown.

Sell cooked meat to the Hunter's Call to get a commendation for each animal. You even get a tattoo for the animals, and a Merrick & Derrick themed face paint for the monsters.

Pretty much every single campfire that was in the game now has a frying pan over it, if you have to cook a bunch of stuff, see if you can find one.

Caged animals die from less hits, so if you go hunting, bring some animal crates.

~CONCLUSION

Remember, please, Upvote posts you like so more people can find them. Otherwise it will sink to the bottom of the forums and in this case, we'll have another 1000+ posts saying "how do I catch a fish?"

I'll be adding to this post every now and then, when info is discovered, changed, or proven untrue.

EDIT: Thanks for the silver!!!

EDIT: Thanks for Gold!!!


Megalodon takes forever to cook and i got dced before i could sell it to find out what its worth.
    I got 150 gold for a cooked one.
        Yeah I think the prices are a bit low but I dont think they should be that much higher. And kraken meat is also 150.
            Can you eat it? Or is it solely to sell? Doesn't seem worth even bothering to cook and sell for 150 gold.
                Sell it for the commendation, there's new tattoos for these.
        I think the sell prices are too low and not rewarding enough. It feels like the cargo run prices before the 2x update all over again. I was hoping they would learn from that.
            It's easier to catch fish tho... And you can sell up to 5 at a time, assuming the highest sell is 150 (for cooked meg and kraken) it's 750 gold, which is around the same as intact merchant supplies or a standard captain chest.
                Yes but takes five minutes to cook all that, plus has to be dropped at a seapost
                    Yes and it also takes time to go get a loot on an island and deliver it where it's due. 

Alternatively, you can go to a sea post with friends, one does the cooking, the other ones fish. And fill the loot in a barrel, it'll give you less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2100g an hour without accounting for the rare fish or the trophies. Indeed 2100g isn't that much but it's low effort so it's only fair. 

And come on, fish can't be as valuable as magical skeleton skulls or rare hidden treasures
                        Not saying that. Specifically saying Kraken and Meglodon meat aren't enough.

The shadow storm one sells for over 2k. Now I know that's a rare one, but c'mon. Kraken and Meg need to be more, especially for how long they cook.
                            >less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2

Did find both cooked and uncooked meg/kraken meat in a wreck. So it's not awfully hard to come by if you're hunting wrecks now days.
                                That's... Nice to know but kinda lame. Kinda nice too I guess
                                    Agreed. Fought both meg and then 20 min later kraken came by knocking.. after all that and me and my bud find the same prize in a wreck.
    Trophy fish take forever too
        The quickest way is to fish for Pondies. Even trophy fish typically reel in after one go
    How do you fish the meg? And when do you get the option to collect its meat?
        You use huge chunks of metal rounded into balls.  


I'd advise shooting it out of the cannons on your ship into it's face.
        When you kill it some chunks will float up like treasure.
        I fished it with cannons and the harpoon and it drops meat when it dies.
        Rather than actually looking and battling either, you can get meg and krak meat from shipwrecks. Much easier to obtain.
    Yeah I ran a timer to verify mine just now and it started to get cooked at 1:40 seconds and golden perfection just after 2 minutes or so
    All the comments here makes me unsure if you actually can fish the Meg or if ppl are just trying to be funny. 😅
        You can cook the meg. After he is killed he then drops his meat.
    Takes two minutes. Set a timer, check your navigation and horizon, come back, done. Multitasking makes it go faster :). Its about 150 each and can only be sold when cooked as far as ive seen. Would be nice if it were a bit more. 4 peices for a meg at 150 each isnt worth it tbh
When food becomes fully cooked, it releases a larger puff of smoke in addition to the color change. It's very noticeable, even from relatively far away.
    The frying noise also changes too.
        Yeap! I pointed this out to my buddies last night. It’s pretty subtle, but a good indicator if you’re in poor lighting.
    Except you can't see this if you're cooking something outside over a campfire during nighttime, I've found.
Do skull forts have to be active for battle gill to spawn
    I caught a battlegill at an inactive fort. Make sure you're using the right bait.  
I see people saying yes, but I know damn well I wasn't at an active fort lol.
        Same here,. Trophy at that
    Yes
        No wonder I couldn't catch one.
    I believe so. 
That’s how I’m catching mine
    You can also catch them near skelly ships.
Mods should pin this
    This [price guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFPHixsB09AlKbwhGpRF8YUuhOxppufaiva-EGOXRMw/edit?usp=sharing) lists the value of every fish except the muddy wildsplash, the bonedust plentifin, and the forsaken devilfish. Cooked, trophy, and both prices are included. Thank you to everyone who helped to complete this guide.
        [Here's my price guide, it's got some of the rarer fish on it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0pLJse935yF258N_Jt0a4Q41a6U1uRlWloH9LFzic8/edit?usp=sharing). All values are for cooked fish. Feel free to use my numbers for your guide :)
            How do you get the shadow stormfish?
                It seems like each fish has 3 common varieties, one rare variety, and one that shows up only at night time.
                    Well I've done 1 at night and 1 in each of the 3 zones while in a storm. Now I need a shadow but I have no clue how to get it.
        Just to help out:

Raven Islehopper cooked is 525

Stone Trophy raw was 90, cooked 135.
        You may have been trolled
    THIS IS LEGENDARY!  Thank you so much! back to the hook now

    My man, ty!
    Pondies can also be caught at mermaids hideaway and in the shores of gold. I personally prefer shores as I don't get messed with. Can catch enough Pondies to completely fill every page of both barrels, and rowboat in a hour or two with a full gally.
Stupid question: How do you get the fish off the line once you catch it?
    It'll pull it up and you should be able to hold action button to take it. If it doesn't prompt make sure you don't have inventory full or other fish or food.
    With the same key for picking things up, etc, make sure you don't carry food with you, since the fishes count as food and it doesnt let you collect them if you already carry 5 bananas, or any other food
    Make sure your inventory has an empty slot
Daft question but how do you get bait ? 😂
    In barrels around the world
        Do you know where the Hunter's Call guy is?
            Someone from Hunter’s Call is at each of the tiny seapost islands around the map.
            There's a different one at every outpost. If you wanted to see Merrick specifically, I believe he is at Stephen's Spoils.
                Couldn't find anyone at the outpost, unless it's an existing NPC.
                    There are no Hunter call NPCs in outposts, they are in the seaposts.
                        Yeah, mixed sea posts and outposts, my bad. The Stephen Spoils one is accurrate though.
                    [deleted]
                        Thanks.
    And you can pull bait straight out of the water
        How?
            Not
Note: if you catch a fish but your inventory is full, you can put the rod away (fish and all) to sort out your inventory and when you pull the rod back out the fish will still be there
Megaladon meat takes 2m to cook, 3m to burn
Thank you
    No prob..enjoy
I recommend using your in-game stopwatch to time your food. That way, you can do other things on your ship besides wait for the food to cook.

&#x200B;

I've found that regular fish take about 45 in-game minutes (45 real-life seconds) to cook, and big fish take around 120 minutes.
    I've played with the timing a little, you don't have to wait for the food to change colour once you've cooked it long enough to move from raw to undercooked to well done. If you time it carefully from the moment you hear the pan start to sizzle, you can remove foods after the following times for highest efficiency:

* Regular fish = 40secs
* Trophy fish = 1min 30secs
* Regular meat (pork, chicken, snake shark) = 1min
* Megalodon = 2mins
* Kraken = 2mins

If you use the stove on the boat, it's easy to see three patterns rising up from the food. First it's very steamy, that's raw. Then the steam goes and you get thin wisps of smoke, that's underdone. Third, the smoke rises like a pillar, that's perfectly cooked. The moment you see that pillar of smoke rise, you can pull the food off and it's perfectly cooked, no matter how long the second colour change takes to fade in.
        Thanks!
    >120 minutes

        In game minutes.
@Alien8theBunny is the world star motherfucker who found all of the islehopper locations if I remember correctly.
    *wipes tears* Yer me best mate!

Seriously though, thanks. It means a lot to see this. But for me, it's not about the glory, it's about the grind!
        NP you made progression easier for a lot of people so I thought you should be highlighted.
            I couldn't hoard the information for myself (and crew) and still say I live by the code. Article 6 specifically says to share my knowledge 😂
                Aye. I think you actually replied to one of my posts on the forums which is how I knew.
                    Probably, I've been trying to get more active in the community
                        Up until now I've gotten all the Islehoppers in the correct location, but not the Raven one. Discovery Ridge has Honey and Shark Bait Cove has Stone, so... Where are the Raven?
A guy said he found his on Old Faithful Isle.
PS: I found one there too! The guy was KapamxD
                            Raven are there, but are extremely rare spawns. It's my current theory they can spawn on any of the big islands woth their common cousins.

In my experiment, I found one Raven in the hour I spent at Crescent, one Raven in the two hours at Old Faithful. It's a random chance for those buggers. I made a nice chart after double checking my results, it's floating around here somewhere...
I wasn't sure if the completely brown was cooked or if it would change its name, cause i found Smokey Ancientscale on a ship wreck; turns out nope :p
    The name doesn't change? It did in pioneers
        It doesn't on launch server :o even when charred black
            Damn, that sucks. Made it much easier to keep track.
                I just cook till it looks tasty :3
Thanks for this!
Say I have 3 fish on me. How do I cycle thru the fish I am holding in my hand?
    If you have a hot key for the food items hit it again and it will cycle through your foods.
        Well that should have been obvious. That works thanks.
    On computer press whatever hotkey you have for fruit like banana I have set for B so I just hit B a few times
    Unfortunately you need to use the inventory system in the start menu to do it. As far as I know there isn't a fast switch for food. It becomes troublesome when PvPing while holding raw meat.
        Have food bound, press the bound key
            This is the single best QoL improvment. Binding food to Dpad. Not tripping over your thumbs to get food out is so much easier. :)

Good suggestion, will make him much happier.
                I never even thought to try hitting it again after the food gets pulled up. Thanks for the advice!
Are battlegills only around active skull forts?
    Yup :)
    And skelly ships
Has anyone found use for the W key? Or for that matter, any reason to not hold S the whole time? Seems like no detriment when going left/right to just hold S.
    None that I have seen. I pull it back the entire time.
    when its going straight u hold s
    I might be imagining things, but it seems like you reel in faster when you press W.
Thanks so much ! I was trying to catch one for like 20 minutes but I couldn't figure out how to do it haha
No one has mentioned this, but you can actually reel in while the fish is fighting! Just need to watch how much your rod is shaking.
    Be careful not to break the line
Got an idea: The hunters call should have missions where they tell you about legendary fish and where they have been “last spotted” they should give you advice on what bait NOT to use so that you still have some thing hard about it. Th fish should be worth A LOT of gold and it should be enormous like really really big like maybe you need two people or something maybe use the row boat.
A lot of people are saying Battle gills have to be caught at active forts. I know dang well I caught one at an inactive fort, and it's pretty hard to mistake it for an active one. (Pirate Legend here, been playing long enough to know I wasn't confused.)

Has anyone else caught one at an inactive fort? It may be WAY more uncommon to catch them when the fort is inactive, but I definitely did get one while it was inactive.
    I’ve caught one not even at a fort and was bewildered. Looked around and turns out a skelly ship was passing close by in the distance. Could have been the case for you
    I spent over an hour in a inactive skull for and I couldn't find a single Battlegill. But i can confirm that Skeleton ships passing by did the job for me
No kraken meat?
    There is kraken meat. Not sure on the cook time though sorry.
        It takes a bit longer than meg meat based on what my friend told me earlier.
Are the regional specific fish only found in open sea or can you also get them near islands or in ponds?
    You can find them near islands :)
where and how do we sell fish?

&#x200B;

edit: also what does the bar do that fills up?
    Sell at sea ports. Bar is overheal that refills lost health slowly over time
        Cool thanks!!
In the middle of making a huge guide...hesitant to make it editable out of fear of trolls, but lemme know what you think/what you'd improve! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9ST4kjG9DNDu3bpia3VfnPbD0QgqhfGTS-nmAy6irw/edit?usp=sharing
    Hey nice! Very similar to [mine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFPHixsB09AlKbwhGpRF8YUuhOxppufaiva-EGOXRMw/edit?usp=sharing) feel free to take the info from mine and add it to yours.
        Thank you very much! Going on a Pondie expedition today- time to get some data :')
    Think your missing old fish bones at the bottom of the list
I caught a battle gill in the devils roar.. fetchers rest I believe it was.. it was a green one..
While it doesn't have quite the detail here, if you dig into the Hunter's Call section of the Reputation menu, it tells you what bait each fish likes and gives pretty obvious hints where to find each one (though not the subspecies). Refer to this if you want approximate info and don't want to look at a guide in the middle of a session.
Are umbers that much rarer? I'm having a hard time finding any
    Yes
        You had any luck with em yet?
Does tye skull fort have to be active to catch the battle fish?
    [deleted]
        Many people have confirmed that they caught battlegills at inactive forts, so this is not accurate.
            No, these people may have been confused on whether a skeleton ship was in the distance or not. You cannot catch them at inactive forts unless a skelly ship is nearby
        I don't think this is true. I was definitely at a very INACTIVE fort and caught a battle gill. It may be way more uncommon to get them, but I know I was at an inactive fort, because I was staring at the fort cloud in the distance while I was fishing.
Do you reel in with a button or do you have to reel in controller busting RDR2 style?
    RT on xbox
Does the distance of the cast matter?
What does it mean when you're wiggling the rod to reel faster?

Are you just shaking it back and forth while reeling in?
Kind of stupid question, but how do I find the other islands islehoppers spawn at? I can’t find a pattern between the islands and don’t really know how to find the “etc” part
Does selling cooked meats and fish in an alliance provide xp and gold to all alliance members?
    Yes. All members in your crew will receive the same rewards as each other. Whereas those in your alliance, will receive 50% of that amount in rep and gold.   
Though to take note of, Alliance members will not get credit towards commendations and and gold received isn't split but rather mirrored to everyone
Going to get buried. But I’ll mention it anyways. If you forget the bait rules or are too lazy to find a guide the commendations say exactly what kind of bait each fish likes. Nice to be able to check on the fly if you forget
    Good to know!  Also, if you have some bait on hand you can look in your inventory (by using a barrel) and when you mouse over the bait it will tell you what fish it is good for.
Does anybody know where to find raven islehoppers, I've fished on discovery ridge and sharkbait cove and never found any, only stone islehoppers
    They are very rare spawns and I believe they can spawn at any large island. You only need luck or patience
    I found mine at Old Faithful Isle
    They seem to be most common on Crescent Isle and Old Faithful Isle, according to u/Alien8theBunny. I got one in the later, thanks u/KapamxD
        Not most common there at all 😂. Extremely rare, and those just happen to be places where I caught 1 in the hour I spent there
        Yeah I've also caught one at The Sunken Grove and Smugglers' Bay, I'm almost certain it can be fished up at any big island at this point. Though I'll probably be focusing on getting them for commendations on an island with Amethyst Islehoppers cause during the day I can catch the Raven Islehopper while i wait for night
u/Northdistortion \- Can You please give me brighter explaination of how to Islehoppers? :(
    Go to one of the islands listed next to the Islehopper's name. As soon as the game says "Sharkbait Cove" or where ever you're going at the bottom of the screen, you're within range of the island to get that particular fish. Just start fishing off your boat out at sea away from the island (so you're out of skele cannon range) and you'll snag one quick enough. You might have to sift through a few Splashtails on the way.
        Thanks, still I don't get the spawn part. They spawn randomly, not 1 subspiecies per random island... This information isn't real oO
Where can you cook? Only at those campfires on islands?
    On you ship as wel. There's a new cooking station
Where do I deliver the food?
    Trading posts.
        Seaposts I believe.
    Seaposts, not outposts.  Seaposts are those tiny rocks in the middle of the ocean with a dock and a vendor selling 3 discounted items.  Merrick and fam are on the dock at each seapost which is where you sell cooked and uncooked fish and meat for gold and hunter’s call rep.
Thats a big and good one, thanks! Will be very helpfull :)
Thank you, this is great
This is so helpful. I wish I could give you at least gold but here’s my upvote
Am I crazy? What button do you hit to collect the fish once you catch it? I hold it up when I click and it casts again and the fish isn't there.
    X button on console.....maybe you lost the fish (fish got away)
        He holds the fish up and the prompt says to collect the fish but it doesn't say what button and nothing but clicking works. Do they appear in your inventory?
            You have too much food in your inventory. Remove stuff then you can grab it.
                Thank you, that was it
Not tried the update yet. Do you have to cook the fish to sell them?
    no but worth more cooked
where do you find the shadow stormfish?
    It’s just absolutely super rare and random. Worth 5.6K!
Saved
Is there a native hot key for pulling out the fishing rod?
    Haha just found it on my own, it's K
caught me a trophy stormer tonite. cooked that shit perfectly
>Caged animals die from less hits, so if you go hunting, bring some animal crates.

So, can we buy animal crates now individually, or still throw down a few quests to get them that way?
I wish there was a way to add slack to the line, I lost a trophy fish yesterday cause it pulled straight ahead and snapped the line even though I wasn't reeling.

Also if your fishing around rocks or a dock, if the fish crosses these it will snap the line so it's better to fish in open water away from obstacles
    When a fish in pulling straight ahead you need to hit ''S'' to pull up. Took me a while to figure that one out.
        What's that on controller though cause I'm using Xbox
            Down on the joystick
                Thank you I'm a dumb
Is the xp to gold ratio the same as other factions? because that could take a while to rank up in the higher levels
You can use right click/left trigger to pull bait or the hook out the water immidiately If you notice it's a fish you don't necessarily want.
WTH! I lost the glow-in-the-dark nighttime exclusive one, I think (Black with green glow). Before I knew it was WASD instead of the mouse for control.
For later cam
So with the regen bar and fishing it looks like they have taken a lot of ideas from RDR2
I'd give this man an award if a wasn't broke
Anyone know if there's anything in particular you have to do to find Forsaken Devilfish? Haven't found a single one and been trying to get them all.

&#x200B;

Edit: Scratch that, just saw your post about the 'super rare' colour. Guess that'll be the one!
Your fruit health percentages are a bit off. It's more like 20%/30%/40%/50%/100%

Proof:
https://imgur.com/a/LJF2YdU
    Its possible they were changed before the update went live
        To be clear, I literally just made those images from the live version of the game with a lot of self drowning
I'm almost positive I caught a wildsplash last night with leeches, is it possible to catch these fish with bait other than the recommended ones here or do I have sea madness?
Battlegills aren’t showing at forts?
Edit: using grubs, still none biting
    Has to be an active skull fort.
Does it only count Items you personally sell or does your crew count towards your progress?
    Just like everything else, the whole crew gets credit for anything the crew turns in.
Great guide matey! 
If I could just add to the "how to fish" section. There is a sweet spot in regards to the direction you are pulling and when you hit it the rod stops vibrating and creaking completly. It's worth noting that it's not always in exactly the opposite direction that you think it should be, so move the rod around to find it. I find fish further away need the rod to be up high for example. This, in my experience, tires the fish out a lot quicker and lessens the chance of a line breaking.
Does anyone know whether Battlegills spawn near the skelly ships that dont fight you around the map? Or only when you are in an engagement with one (when the music is playing)?
    Battlegills do spawn near any skeleton ship regardless of engagement. I chased after one for an hour with a row boat, the area that counts as around the skeleton ship is quite large. Though i'd recommend just going to an active skull fort, it's a lot easier
        Thanks mate, appreciate it. Ill give either a go when im next on then :D
Good post man. So I haven't touched the game for awhile and was thinking of coming back.

It's a silly question I'm sure, but is fishing a reasonable way to play solo and make money? 

I played solo the last times I played and its a bit overwhelming. The actual sailing and combat with other players doesn't interest me as much as interacting with the beautiful environments here.

Would it be a waste of time to just sail, go fishing and turn around to sell the fish for cosmetic items and whatnot?
How are you all catching fish!  I'm having the hardest time. Spent about four hours last night and didn't catch a one. What am I doing wrong?  I pull against it but my line always breaks. I've only gotten to reel once and then the fish broke free after I started pulling left and right again.
    You pull the opposite way the fish is going and pull back on the line so he can’t break free by going forward. If your line is breaking you are either reeling too much while he’s fighting or pulling the same way as the fish.
    >Not sure if you know this but there are actually 3 different directions you have to fight the fish; left, right, and up. It sounds like you could be missing the "up" direction. If you're on PC you just need to press "S", if you're on Xbox I'm not sure but probably just pull the joystick back toward you.
        Yup! That was it. I was only seeing/reacting to the left and right direction, not the back and forward direction. Finally read through all the comments and figured it out. Hopefully I'll catch something tonight!
What am I doing wrong that fish keep breaking off? I am not reeling them in when it happens. Ill be fighting them by pulling the opposite direction but then I can hear the rod creak and my screen shakes and so I stop fighting it but the screen keeps shaking more and eventually the fish gets away. Does that just happen sometimes? It has been happening to me most of the time it feels. I have even tried to lean my rod in the direction they are going to give it some "slack" or something but it doesn't help. Is there no way to prevent it then?

Question, is there any way to drop food in my inventory?

I had all skits filled with raw food and was forced to just eat it in order to empty a slot. Any idea on how to drop or discard food? All I can do is stow.
Has anyone else seen a purple glowing fish in devil's roar? What fish is that?
    It's very likely you saw the Amethyst Islehopper, They tend to spawn in the water surrounding the islands during nighttime
[deleted]
    Read the post
Fish go through a light brown and dark brown then burnt. Is the second brown the right one?
    Look for a dark brown color with white eyes. You will have a good amount of buffer between that stage and burnt

Hey, I remember this!

I'm currently working on a more detailed version of my Islehopper findings, and will be posting it around here soon. The islands are all the same (add Amethyst at Mermaids Hideaway and Ravens popping up randomly).
    Good stuff..great work
        Thanks man. I grew tired of false information being spread so I figured I would set the record straight
Anyone please have tips on catching Forsaken Devilfish? I've gotten every other variant. Is there some specific condition they appear under? I've tried while volcanoes are going off, no volcanoes, night, day, everything. Anyone have any luck getting more than one in the same spot maybe?
    My tips for catching the Forsaken Devilfish is to do it off of Morrow's Peak Outpost dock, the water there is very nice and consistent so you can see the fish better. Other than that, the fish is very rare, it took me around 2-3 hours to see it (but I spent most of it at Roaring Traders). The fish has a very yellow color with orange fins. It's also worth nothing you do not need to be fishing in boiling water at all for any devilfish.
        I finally caught the little bastard at Morrow's, though this is the second day after fishing at Roaring traders for 2 hrs, then Morrow's for 4, and then Forsaken brink for another 2.. second day caught it in 15-20 mins at Morrow's. Don't think I ever spent so much time on a cosmetic item that has literally no real impact on the game at all, but the Ashen Rod looks so damn cool, makes my friends jealous lol. Thank you though!!
Wow Meg takes a long time to find and kill. Then takes even longer to F-in cook and the 3 pieces are worth a combined 450 biggest rip off since I started the game
Has anyone found Raven islehoppers? I've used the locations in this post so far, probably 25-50 casts each spot and still nothing.
    The Raven Islehopper, as far as I've discovered while I'm working on commendations, can be fished from any big island. Though I'd recommend trying at an island that has Amethyst Islehoppers, since the only islehopper you'll see during the day time, will be a Raven one, albeit very rare. The Raven Islehopper is black in color with a blue belly. Since the only other fish you'll see during the day is Splashtails, it'll be easier to know if it's the Raven one since there is no black variant splashtail.
Here is a completed Islehopper list:

Stone Islehopper: Cannon Cove, Crooks Hollow, Sailor's Bounty, Shipwreck Bay, Sharkbait Cove, Fetcher's Rest

Moss Islehopper: Wanderer's Refuge, Marauder's Arch, Thieves Haven, Lone Cove, Ruby's Fall, Ashen Reaches

Raven Islehopper: Any Big Island, Very Rare (Excluding Outposts/Forts)

Honey Islehopper: Crescent Isle, Sunken Grove, Plunder Valley, Kraken's Fall, Discovery Ridge, Devil's Thirst

Amethyst Islehopper: Devil's Ridge, Crooked Masts, Smuggler's Bay, Snake Island, Old Faithful Isle, Mermaid's Hideaway, Flintlock Peninsula (night time only)

Places confirmed to have caught a Raven Islehopper (by me or author): Discovery Ridge, Sharkbait Cove, Old Faithful Isle, The Sunken Grove, Smuggler's Bay

I'd also like to give a tip that if you're gunning for the Grade V Islehopper commendations, fishing for Amethyst during the night and the chance at Raven during the day is a recommended option.

I've found 2 Big Island systems that are relatively close to each other and have the 4 Subspecies (excluding Raven Islehopper):  
Marauder's Arch, Old Faithful Isle, The Sunken Grove, Shipwreck Bay (The Wilds)  
Smugglers' Bay, Crescent Isle, Lone Cove, Cannon Cove (The Shores of Plenty)

Happy Fishing
If you reel while you're fighting the fish it will tire out much faster, just pulsate until the screen starts to shake and be careful not to pull the wrong direction while reeling.
> Bananas: 10% Coconuts: 20% Pomegranates: 30% Mangos: 50% Pineapples: 100% (2)

Bananas are 20% - five bananas will completely heal you - and coconuts are 30% - same as the old bananas, three will almost completely heal you. Someone else posted that pomegranates are 40% and mangoes are 50%, and that seems to jive with my experience.

    You need to wait for the line to go limp. Also, if you are too far away from the edge and your line touches it, it will break as well. Lastly, make sure you are pressing the correct button to reel in because one of them cuts the line (I believe it is right trigger reel and left trigger cut). Not insinuating you haven't thought of it, just wanted to make a thorough response! Good luck!
    When the fish bites, pull your fishing rod in the opposite direction of the moving fish. After a while it gets tired and you can begin to reel it in. For example, if the fish goes left, pull to the right and vice versa. You can reel before it tires but the line snaps if you reel too much. Hope that helps
        Don't forget the fish can go up, so you pull down. It can be kind of confusing because it might look like they're going left or right, but really it's up
Can you link the source, please? Thank you for posting
    From playing on the insiders + other insiders mentioned in the post.
    Insiders forum
Pretty much just copy and paste the insider guides here lol
    I mean most people here are not on the insider forum so its great that he shared it here now that the update is live.
        Wasn't denying it, was stating that the guides we are about to see will be from the help of the insider folks which is a great idea.
I've found that if you start reeling right at the end of the last struggle and hold it, you can get a fish in (almost) guaranteed 2 tries. It takes some practice, but It goes so much faster cuz you're cutting out any input delay. The only exception is trophy fish occasionally.
There are some really good apps to use when cooking food in Sea of Thieves. The one I use is called Sea of Thieves Cooking Timer, you can get it on the app store for free.
I got 150 gold for a cooked one.
    Yeah I think the prices are a bit low but I dont think they should be that much higher. And kraken meat is also 150.
        Can you eat it? Or is it solely to sell? Doesn't seem worth even bothering to cook and sell for 150 gold.
            Sell it for the commendation, there's new tattoos for these.
    I think the sell prices are too low and not rewarding enough. It feels like the cargo run prices before the 2x update all over again. I was hoping they would learn from that.
        It's easier to catch fish tho... And you can sell up to 5 at a time, assuming the highest sell is 150 (for cooked meg and kraken) it's 750 gold, which is around the same as intact merchant supplies or a standard captain chest.
            Yes but takes five minutes to cook all that, plus has to be dropped at a seapost
                Yes and it also takes time to go get a loot on an island and deliver it where it's due. 

Alternatively, you can go to a sea post with friends, one does the cooking, the other ones fish. And fill the loot in a barrel, it'll give you less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2100g an hour without accounting for the rare fish or the trophies. Indeed 2100g isn't that much but it's low effort so it's only fair. 

And come on, fish can't be as valuable as magical skeleton skulls or rare hidden treasures
                    Not saying that. Specifically saying Kraken and Meglodon meat aren't enough.

The shadow storm one sells for over 2k. Now I know that's a rare one, but c'mon. Kraken and Meg need to be more, especially for how long they cook.
                        >less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2

Did find both cooked and uncooked meg/kraken meat in a wreck. So it's not awfully hard to come by if you're hunting wrecks now days.
                            That's... Nice to know but kinda lame. Kinda nice too I guess
                                Agreed. Fought both meg and then 20 min later kraken came by knocking.. after all that and me and my bud find the same prize in a wreck.
Trophy fish take forever too
    The quickest way is to fish for Pondies. Even trophy fish typically reel in after one go
How do you fish the meg? And when do you get the option to collect its meat?
    You use huge chunks of metal rounded into balls.  


I'd advise shooting it out of the cannons on your ship into it's face.
    When you kill it some chunks will float up like treasure.
    I fished it with cannons and the harpoon and it drops meat when it dies.
    Rather than actually looking and battling either, you can get meg and krak meat from shipwrecks. Much easier to obtain.
Yeah I ran a timer to verify mine just now and it started to get cooked at 1:40 seconds and golden perfection just after 2 minutes or so
All the comments here makes me unsure if you actually can fish the Meg or if ppl are just trying to be funny. 😅
    You can cook the meg. After he is killed he then drops his meat.
Takes two minutes. Set a timer, check your navigation and horizon, come back, done. Multitasking makes it go faster :). Its about 150 each and can only be sold when cooked as far as ive seen. Would be nice if it were a bit more. 4 peices for a meg at 150 each isnt worth it tbh
The frying noise also changes too.
    Yeap! I pointed this out to my buddies last night. It’s pretty subtle, but a good indicator if you’re in poor lighting.
Except you can't see this if you're cooking something outside over a campfire during nighttime, I've found.
I caught a battlegill at an inactive fort. Make sure you're using the right bait.  
I see people saying yes, but I know damn well I wasn't at an active fort lol.
    Same here,. Trophy at that
Yes
    No wonder I couldn't catch one.
I believe so. 
That’s how I’m catching mine
You can also catch them near skelly ships.
This [price guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFPHixsB09AlKbwhGpRF8YUuhOxppufaiva-EGOXRMw/edit?usp=sharing) lists the value of every fish except the muddy wildsplash, the bonedust plentifin, and the forsaken devilfish. Cooked, trophy, and both prices are included. Thank you to everyone who helped to complete this guide.
    [Here's my price guide, it's got some of the rarer fish on it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0pLJse935yF258N_Jt0a4Q41a6U1uRlWloH9LFzic8/edit?usp=sharing). All values are for cooked fish. Feel free to use my numbers for your guide :)
        How do you get the shadow stormfish?
            It seems like each fish has 3 common varieties, one rare variety, and one that shows up only at night time.
                Well I've done 1 at night and 1 in each of the 3 zones while in a storm. Now I need a shadow but I have no clue how to get it.
    Just to help out:

Raven Islehopper cooked is 525

Stone Trophy raw was 90, cooked 135.
    You may have been trolled
THIS IS LEGENDARY!  Thank you so much! back to the hook now
My man, ty!
Pondies can also be caught at mermaids hideaway and in the shores of gold. I personally prefer shores as I don't get messed with. Can catch enough Pondies to completely fill every page of both barrels, and rowboat in a hour or two with a full gally.
It'll pull it up and you should be able to hold action button to take it. If it doesn't prompt make sure you don't have inventory full or other fish or food.
With the same key for picking things up, etc, make sure you don't carry food with you, since the fishes count as food and it doesnt let you collect them if you already carry 5 bananas, or any other food
Make sure your inventory has an empty slot
In barrels around the world
    Do you know where the Hunter's Call guy is?
        Someone from Hunter’s Call is at each of the tiny seapost islands around the map.
        There's a different one at every outpost. If you wanted to see Merrick specifically, I believe he is at Stephen's Spoils.
            Couldn't find anyone at the outpost, unless it's an existing NPC.
                There are no Hunter call NPCs in outposts, they are in the seaposts.
                    Yeah, mixed sea posts and outposts, my bad. The Stephen Spoils one is accurrate though.
                [deleted]
                    Thanks.
And you can pull bait straight out of the water
    How?
        Not
No prob..enjoy
I've played with the timing a little, you don't have to wait for the food to change colour once you've cooked it long enough to move from raw to undercooked to well done. If you time it carefully from the moment you hear the pan start to sizzle, you can remove foods after the following times for highest efficiency:

* Regular fish = 40secs
* Trophy fish = 1min 30secs
* Regular meat (pork, chicken, snake shark) = 1min
* Megalodon = 2mins
* Kraken = 2mins

If you use the stove on the boat, it's easy to see three patterns rising up from the food. First it's very steamy, that's raw. Then the steam goes and you get thin wisps of smoke, that's underdone. Third, the smoke rises like a pillar, that's perfectly cooked. The moment you see that pillar of smoke rise, you can pull the food off and it's perfectly cooked, no matter how long the second colour change takes to fade in.
    Thanks!

    In game minutes.
*wipes tears* Yer me best mate!

Seriously though, thanks. It means a lot to see this. But for me, it's not about the glory, it's about the grind!
    NP you made progression easier for a lot of people so I thought you should be highlighted.
        I couldn't hoard the information for myself (and crew) and still say I live by the code. Article 6 specifically says to share my knowledge 😂
            Aye. I think you actually replied to one of my posts on the forums which is how I knew.
                Probably, I've been trying to get more active in the community
                    Up until now I've gotten all the Islehoppers in the correct location, but not the Raven one. Discovery Ridge has Honey and Shark Bait Cove has Stone, so... Where are the Raven?
A guy said he found his on Old Faithful Isle.
PS: I found one there too! The guy was KapamxD
                        Raven are there, but are extremely rare spawns. It's my current theory they can spawn on any of the big islands woth their common cousins.

In my experiment, I found one Raven in the hour I spent at Crescent, one Raven in the two hours at Old Faithful. It's a random chance for those buggers. I made a nice chart after double checking my results, it's floating around here somewhere...
The name doesn't change? It did in pioneers
    It doesn't on launch server :o even when charred black
        Damn, that sucks. Made it much easier to keep track.
            I just cook till it looks tasty :3
If you have a hot key for the food items hit it again and it will cycle through your foods.
    Well that should have been obvious. That works thanks.
On computer press whatever hotkey you have for fruit like banana I have set for B so I just hit B a few times
Unfortunately you need to use the inventory system in the start menu to do it. As far as I know there isn't a fast switch for food. It becomes troublesome when PvPing while holding raw meat.
    Have food bound, press the bound key
        This is the single best QoL improvment. Binding food to Dpad. Not tripping over your thumbs to get food out is so much easier. :)

Good suggestion, will make him much happier.
            I never even thought to try hitting it again after the food gets pulled up. Thanks for the advice!
Yup :)
And skelly ships
None that I have seen. I pull it back the entire time.
when its going straight u hold s
I might be imagining things, but it seems like you reel in faster when you press W.
Be careful not to break the line
I’ve caught one not even at a fort and was bewildered. Looked around and turns out a skelly ship was passing close by in the distance. Could have been the case for you
I spent over an hour in a inactive skull for and I couldn't find a single Battlegill. But i can confirm that Skeleton ships passing by did the job for me
There is kraken meat. Not sure on the cook time though sorry.
    It takes a bit longer than meg meat based on what my friend told me earlier.
You can find them near islands :)
Sell at sea ports. Bar is overheal that refills lost health slowly over time
    Cool thanks!!
Hey nice! Very similar to [mine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFPHixsB09AlKbwhGpRF8YUuhOxppufaiva-EGOXRMw/edit?usp=sharing) feel free to take the info from mine and add it to yours.
    Thank you very much! Going on a Pondie expedition today- time to get some data :')
Think your missing old fish bones at the bottom of the list
Yes
    You had any luck with em yet?
[deleted]
    Many people have confirmed that they caught battlegills at inactive forts, so this is not accurate.
        No, these people may have been confused on whether a skeleton ship was in the distance or not. You cannot catch them at inactive forts unless a skelly ship is nearby
    I don't think this is true. I was definitely at a very INACTIVE fort and caught a battle gill. It may be way more uncommon to get them, but I know I was at an inactive fort, because I was staring at the fort cloud in the distance while I was fishing.
RT on xbox
Yes. All members in your crew will receive the same rewards as each other. Whereas those in your alliance, will receive 50% of that amount in rep and gold.   
Though to take note of, Alliance members will not get credit towards commendations and and gold received isn't split but rather mirrored to everyone
Good to know!  Also, if you have some bait on hand you can look in your inventory (by using a barrel) and when you mouse over the bait it will tell you what fish it is good for.
They are very rare spawns and I believe they can spawn at any large island. You only need luck or patience
I found mine at Old Faithful Isle
They seem to be most common on Crescent Isle and Old Faithful Isle, according to u/Alien8theBunny. I got one in the later, thanks u/KapamxD
    Not most common there at all 😂. Extremely rare, and those just happen to be places where I caught 1 in the hour I spent there
    Yeah I've also caught one at The Sunken Grove and Smugglers' Bay, I'm almost certain it can be fished up at any big island at this point. Though I'll probably be focusing on getting them for commendations on an island with Amethyst Islehoppers cause during the day I can catch the Raven Islehopper while i wait for night
Go to one of the islands listed next to the Islehopper's name. As soon as the game says "Sharkbait Cove" or where ever you're going at the bottom of the screen, you're within range of the island to get that particular fish. Just start fishing off your boat out at sea away from the island (so you're out of skele cannon range) and you'll snag one quick enough. You might have to sift through a few Splashtails on the way.
    Thanks, still I don't get the spawn part. They spawn randomly, not 1 subspiecies per random island... This information isn't real oO
On you ship as wel. There's a new cooking station
Trading posts.
    Seaposts I believe.
Seaposts, not outposts.  Seaposts are those tiny rocks in the middle of the ocean with a dock and a vendor selling 3 discounted items.  Merrick and fam are on the dock at each seapost which is where you sell cooked and uncooked fish and meat for gold and hunter’s call rep.
X button on console.....maybe you lost the fish (fish got away)
    He holds the fish up and the prompt says to collect the fish but it doesn't say what button and nothing but clicking works. Do they appear in your inventory?
        You have too much food in your inventory. Remove stuff then you can grab it.
            Thank you, that was it
no but worth more cooked
It’s just absolutely super rare and random. Worth 5.6K!
Haha just found it on my own, it's K
When a fish in pulling straight ahead you need to hit ''S'' to pull up. Took me a while to figure that one out.
    What's that on controller though cause I'm using Xbox
        Down on the joystick
            Thank you I'm a dumb
Its possible they were changed before the update went live
    To be clear, I literally just made those images from the live version of the game with a lot of self drowning
Has to be an active skull fort.
Just like everything else, the whole crew gets credit for anything the crew turns in.
Battlegills do spawn near any skeleton ship regardless of engagement. I chased after one for an hour with a row boat, the area that counts as around the skeleton ship is quite large. Though i'd recommend just going to an active skull fort, it's a lot easier
    Thanks mate, appreciate it. Ill give either a go when im next on then :D
You pull the opposite way the fish is going and pull back on the line so he can’t break free by going forward. If your line is breaking you are either reeling too much while he’s fighting or pulling the same way as the fish.
>Not sure if you know this but there are actually 3 different directions you have to fight the fish; left, right, and up. It sounds like you could be missing the "up" direction. If you're on PC you just need to press "S", if you're on Xbox I'm not sure but probably just pull the joystick back toward you.
    Yup! That was it. I was only seeing/reacting to the left and right direction, not the back and forward direction. Finally read through all the comments and figured it out. Hopefully I'll catch something tonight!

Look for a dark brown color with white eyes. You will have a good amount of buffer between that stage and burnt

Yeah I think the prices are a bit low but I dont think they should be that much higher. And kraken meat is also 150.
    Can you eat it? Or is it solely to sell? Doesn't seem worth even bothering to cook and sell for 150 gold.
        Sell it for the commendation, there's new tattoos for these.
I think the sell prices are too low and not rewarding enough. It feels like the cargo run prices before the 2x update all over again. I was hoping they would learn from that.
    It's easier to catch fish tho... And you can sell up to 5 at a time, assuming the highest sell is 150 (for cooked meg and kraken) it's 750 gold, which is around the same as intact merchant supplies or a standard captain chest.
        Yes but takes five minutes to cook all that, plus has to be dropped at a seapost
            Yes and it also takes time to go get a loot on an island and deliver it where it's due. 

Alternatively, you can go to a sea post with friends, one does the cooking, the other ones fish. And fill the loot in a barrel, it'll give you less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2100g an hour without accounting for the rare fish or the trophies. Indeed 2100g isn't that much but it's low effort so it's only fair. 

And come on, fish can't be as valuable as magical skeleton skulls or rare hidden treasures
                Not saying that. Specifically saying Kraken and Meglodon meat aren't enough.

The shadow storm one sells for over 2k. Now I know that's a rare one, but c'mon. Kraken and Meg need to be more, especially for how long they cook.
                    >less money for each fish but you'll have plenty and you can make a lot of money (minimum 70g for around 2 minutes of cooking) that's 2

Did find both cooked and uncooked meg/kraken meat in a wreck. So it's not awfully hard to come by if you're hunting wrecks now days.
                        That's... Nice to know but kinda lame. Kinda nice too I guess
                            Agreed. Fought both meg and then 20 min later kraken came by knocking.. after all that and me and my bud find the same prize in a wreck.
The quickest way is to fish for Pondies. Even trophy fish typically reel in after one go
You use huge chunks of metal rounded into balls.  


I'd advise shooting it out of the cannons on your ship into it's face.
When you kill it some chunks will float up like treasure.
I fished it with cannons and the harpoon and it drops meat when it dies.
Rather than actually looking and battling either, you can get meg and krak meat from shipwrecks. Much easier to obtain.
You can cook the meg. After he is killed he then drops his meat.
Yeap! I pointed this out to my buddies last night. It’s pretty subtle, but a good indicator if you’re in poor lighting.
Same here,. Trophy at that
No wonder I couldn't catch one.
[Here's my price guide, it's got some of the rarer fish on it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0pLJse935yF258N_Jt0a4Q41a6U1uRlWloH9LFzic8/edit?usp=sharing). All values are for cooked fish. Feel free to use my numbers for your guide :)
    How do you get the shadow stormfish?
        It seems like each fish has 3 common varieties, one rare variety, and one that shows up only at night time.
            Well I've done 1 at night and 1 in each of the 3 zones while in a storm. Now I need a shadow but I have no clue how to get it.
Just to help out:

Raven Islehopper cooked is 525

Stone Trophy raw was 90, cooked 135.
You may have been trolled
Do you know where the Hunter's Call guy is?
    Someone from Hunter’s Call is at each of the tiny seapost islands around the map.
    There's a different one at every outpost. If you wanted to see Merrick specifically, I believe he is at Stephen's Spoils.
        Couldn't find anyone at the outpost, unless it's an existing NPC.
            There are no Hunter call NPCs in outposts, they are in the seaposts.
                Yeah, mixed sea posts and outposts, my bad. The Stephen Spoils one is accurrate though.
            [deleted]
                Thanks.
How?
    Not
Thanks!
In game minutes.
NP you made progression easier for a lot of people so I thought you should be highlighted.
    I couldn't hoard the information for myself (and crew) and still say I live by the code. Article 6 specifically says to share my knowledge 😂
        Aye. I think you actually replied to one of my posts on the forums which is how I knew.
            Probably, I've been trying to get more active in the community
                Up until now I've gotten all the Islehoppers in the correct location, but not the Raven one. Discovery Ridge has Honey and Shark Bait Cove has Stone, so... Where are the Raven?
A guy said he found his on Old Faithful Isle.
PS: I found one there too! The guy was KapamxD
                    Raven are there, but are extremely rare spawns. It's my current theory they can spawn on any of the big islands woth their common cousins.

In my experiment, I found one Raven in the hour I spent at Crescent, one Raven in the two hours at Old Faithful. It's a random chance for those buggers. I made a nice chart after double checking my results, it's floating around here somewhere...
It doesn't on launch server :o even when charred black
    Damn, that sucks. Made it much easier to keep track.
        I just cook till it looks tasty :3
Well that should have been obvious. That works thanks.
Have food bound, press the bound key
    This is the single best QoL improvment. Binding food to Dpad. Not tripping over your thumbs to get food out is so much easier. :)

Good suggestion, will make him much happier.
        I never even thought to try hitting it again after the food gets pulled up. Thanks for the advice!
It takes a bit longer than meg meat based on what my friend told me earlier.
Cool thanks!!
Thank you very much! Going on a Pondie expedition today- time to get some data :')
You had any luck with em yet?
Many people have confirmed that they caught battlegills at inactive forts, so this is not accurate.
    No, these people may have been confused on whether a skeleton ship was in the distance or not. You cannot catch them at inactive forts unless a skelly ship is nearby
I don't think this is true. I was definitely at a very INACTIVE fort and caught a battle gill. It may be way more uncommon to get them, but I know I was at an inactive fort, because I was staring at the fort cloud in the distance while I was fishing.
Not most common there at all 😂. Extremely rare, and those just happen to be places where I caught 1 in the hour I spent there
Yeah I've also caught one at The Sunken Grove and Smugglers' Bay, I'm almost certain it can be fished up at any big island at this point. Though I'll probably be focusing on getting them for commendations on an island with Amethyst Islehoppers cause during the day I can catch the Raven Islehopper while i wait for night
Thanks, still I don't get the spawn part. They spawn randomly, not 1 subspiecies per random island... This information isn't real oO
Seaposts I believe.
He holds the fish up and the prompt says to collect the fish but it doesn't say what button and nothing but clicking works. Do they appear in your inventory?
    You have too much food in your inventory. Remove stuff then you can grab it.
        Thank you, that was it
What's that on controller though cause I'm using Xbox
    Down on the joystick
        Thank you I'm a dumb
To be clear, I literally just made those images from the live version of the game with a lot of self drowning
Thanks mate, appreciate it. Ill give either a go when im next on then :D
Yup! That was it. I was only seeing/reacting to the left and right direction, not the back and forward direction. Finally read through all the comments and figured it out. Hopefully I'll catch something tonight!
Thanks man. I grew tired of false information being spread so I figured I would set the record straight
I finally caught the little bastard at Morrow's, though this is the second day after fishing at Roaring traders for 2 hrs, then Morrow's for 4, and then Forsaken brink for another 2.. second day caught it in 15-20 mins at Morrow's. Don't think I ever spent so much time on a cosmetic item that has literally no real impact on the game at all, but the Ashen Rod looks so damn cool, makes my friends jealous lol. Thank you though!!
Don't forget the fish can go up, so you pull down. It can be kind of confusing because it might look like they're going left or right, but really it's up
