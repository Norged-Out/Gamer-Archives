[[Question about Reaper Bounties]]


Are they not really sought after? I'm a relatively new player but whenever I log in I make a beeline for reaper chests if I see any of the lights. I've returned like 10 now and I've never had anyone try to stop me, when I've been chased when carrying way less stuff aboard.
Just wonder if I'm maybe overvaluing them?


The regulars are not worth it. The golden chest are decent
    Regular are easy 25 doubloons, which can be converted to 3x the gold on double weekend. If you see one grab it, than on Gold weekend convert doubloons into gold (if you need gold )
        No way you are a legend of the sea of thieves and still pick up a reaper chest whenever you see it
            two reasons

1. attracts ships that want to PVP
2. if 1. fails, i collect 25 doubloons and move to next server.
                But so does a reaper flag
                    I always sail with reapers mark
                So you sail across the map for a reapers chest?
        Thanks for the hint. But I'm fine. I currently sit on 50mil gold and 28k dubloons
        iirc 25 doubloons is like 15k gold if you exchange a the right time.
            Yes, and thats les than 15 minutes of work as solo brigantine
                Who solos a brig?
                    I rolled one last night doing Merchant Alliance voyages. It's nice how fast they are running cargo but that's just about it because they're a huge pain in the nuts solo.
                    I do.  Sloop drifts too much, and I always seem to catch a northern wind while traveling northwest on choppy seas.  It's a constant fight to keep on course.  Brig tends to cooperate a bit better and I make better time.
                    I do, while two of my friends fish off the back.

In all seriousness, it can be done, and I do enjoy the rush of running a brig on my own while two clowns mess about, but truly running it solo can't be common.

That said, Brigs are way way way faster than sloops at crossing the map over a large enough timeline, so I could see somebody doing it for commodity runs.

I also heard of an absolute chad who would raise Reapers on a solo brig, then proceed to do PvE missions. 98% of the time people were too scared to go fight a Reaper brig, and when somebody did attack, he'd just die horribly and sink because he was ass at combat and running a brig solo.
                        Better than me,I'll stick to solo slooping
        Honestly if you go out of your way for 25 dabloons… never mind
They're alright, especially when you're new and don't have access to voyages with a better payout. But most of the people actively looking for PvP are looking for reaper emissaries with high grade flags. If I see a bounty slowly making its' way across the map, I just assume it's a newbie who's only got one shipwreck worth of loot. I wont bother with em unless I'm already close.

A big reason I think most people don't bother with them is that when they expanded the map for the POTC tall tales, the chests tend to spawn way the fuck out where nobody can be bothered sailing.
If I see one relatively close and I'm not busy with anything, I might go mostly because it's a guaranteed shipwreck. And I like wreck diving for fish and Gems for the Hunter's Call.

Once there, if I'm feeling adventurous and I don't see any Reapers around the Hideout, I might take the chest and other treasures and go straight there to sell everything.
When content was scarce and they just came out they were more sought after, especially the bounty sense it was 25k not 10k and can turn them into outpost
The only time people will go after you is if you have multiple reaper chests as server hoppers will think you completed a FOTD or that you’re stacking
If i log in and see one moving I'll go check it out to see who has one. I also don't see many reapers or others going for them. I wreck hop for supplies and fish and have left some bounties myself just because I was not near reapers to turn it in.
I just got my first Reaper chest. A 4 man ship was camping the hideout, I tried to go away but they were way more experienced. They caught up and ruined my existence.
What's a reaper bounty?
    There's 2 types of reaper chests you can find in sunken ships on a server. There's reaper bounty and reaper chests. 

Reaper chests can be identified by the red/green trails seen in the sky and a red icon on your ships map showing its location. 

Reaper Bounties can be identified by the all yellow trails seen in the sky and a yellow icon on your ships map marking its location. 

Reaper chests are worth base 25 Doubloons when cashed in to Reapers' hideout. Reaper chests are worth a base value of 10,000 Gold. 

Hope this helps.

EDIT: had to add missing information.
        Totally helps!  I knew there was stuff at those markers but never knew what!
We sometimes go for them if we are bored and near one anyway. 

But no, we don’t beeline towards one if we see it. But after all, we are merely humble merchants most of the time, so we never really even see the hideout up close which makes it not that great to go for them.
