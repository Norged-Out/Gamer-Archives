[[I somehow managed to deckshot on enemy ship then deckshot right back to my ship!]]





Dude the things you end up doing in this game is something else, seriously..
    I was looking for a DUDE comment, it was the first one, obviously
        Dudee.
            righteous, righteous!
            Dudette.
        Naturally.. lol
Blurbs after doing the impossible üòê

Meanwhile I go crazy when I get into a tuck
    [deleted]
        Let‚Äôs find out
            Step 1: tuck
Step 2: pull up pron
Step 3: go open mic while you're rubbing one out 

Enemy crew: O.o
        It's when you push it back between your legs and say ,"Look I'm a lady!"
Doesn't even bat an eye... too cool üòÜ
    I was freaking out internally but did my best to act like it happens everyday!
        I would have believed you that it happens every other day, but that commendation gave you away :p
        Where you solo slooping?
            Blurbs almost always solo sloops, hes been pvping since the beta
                Holy fuck. Gotta check that out now
                    He has a youtube guide on how to get good at pvp, its helped me out a lot
                        Checking it out later tonight
                What a pure chad.
        It was definitely smooth ngl.
        The first shot wasn't cool enough so you had to double down?
        Peeve would be proud. And probably call you a show off.
        Bro you got me with it, i was like "he's so calm this must happen all the time"
        How did you not pop off lol
        Wouldn't surprise me if this happens to you everyday lol
        Fuck practice this shit just happens
        It do
    He has probably walked away from so many explosions
Hey blurbs, just want to say thanks for making your youtube guides, i only started playing a few days ago and your vids have been immensely helpful. Cheers!
    <3
        Fucking legend
    Link to his channel please? Been looking to get back into this game and need a starting point

Edit: Thanks guys!
        Here's the link. But for the record it's the first thing that comes up if you just search the dudes name on YouTube...

https://youtube.com/c/Blurbs
        Here's my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/blurbs) and my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/blurbs)
            Any chance of you wearing lingerie on your twitch stream?
                Wut?
                You would have enjoyed Happyf33tz stream last night.
                I never imagined this thought would be in my head, yet here we are
                ToadPhd is up your alley.
        Here https://youtube.com/c/Blurbs
    I‚Äôm gonna be lazy and add to this by saying same.
Saw this clip earlier and was like what the actual shit Blurbs. I‚Äôm over here with only hitting 40% of my canon shots.

Been playing with people on your discord. Thus far been mostly a good group of mature players. Fun community!
    Glad to hear it!
yeah but have you gotten the silent barnacle set
    I'm more concerned about how/why there would be a noisy barnacle
        The *Silent Barnacle* and the *Noisy Barnacle* are good ship or tavern names, come to think of it.
            Those definitely just became taverns in my D&D setting!

Now my players will face the hard choice.

Go get a pint at *The Noisy Barnacle* or grab a tankard at *The Boar's Flame*
                "We choose The Noisy Barnacle"

"Okay, roll for initiative."
                Sounds preferable to "Grab an ale at *The Boar's Anus*"
            Would 100% sign up as a swabbie for the *Noisy Barnacle*, on land or at sea
    Just got mine
        still working on mine, I just want the sails
            I've bought all the wailing barnacle set, I'm grinding the silent set still
do u spam the key to grab stuff like the ladders and harpoons, or u just got that ungodly timing.
    I think the timing was on point but I do spam grab just to be safe!
    He already answered, but spamming is the best way to do it. Once caught your momentum is dead, and you will just get into the "let go, catch, let go, catch" cycle.

You can use a variation of this to bait people defending their ladders, Blurbs has a helpful guide on that too.
Blurbs doing what Blurbs does...
That's gotta be the best pirate I've ever seen...
    ... So it would seem...
Lol I was telling someone about this a couple days ago. Now time to send it to him.
"Don't worry I'll be back"

This man is literally the main character of Sea Of Thieves.
    He's Jack.
hurtin feelings over there hahahah sick
I saw the clip and your face and you looked familiar. Then I saw your username! Thank you for all the guides and advice blurbs! Flintlock sword gang
I can't land one of those without an explosion of excitement. You did 2, from pretty far away, and didn't blink.
Holy shit lmao
BLurbs hiii omg

thanks for all your tutorials, they really help at getting better
The guy running at you while you‚Äôre getting into the cannon thinking ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not getting away you son of a bitch!!‚Äù Had me laughing
how the fuck are you just so non-chalant about it?!  i'd be screaming lmao
Truly next level. Seen plenty of deck shots ,but this is the first deck and return deck. Whole lotta deck lol
    Man is his own fire control tower.
As if being THE tips and tricks guy for SoT wasn‚Äôt enough, I feel like every time a clip on this sub makes my jaw drop, it‚Äôs always fucking Blurbs. The permanently calm smooth talking attitude is just the sprinkles on top, too. 

Absolute lord.
Jesus christ its Jason Bourne!
So this is what a double decker looks like. And here I thought it was a bus.
That‚Äôs gotta be the best pirate I‚Äôve ever seen
Average sloop gameplay
Saw this happen on stream but I was making supper and didn't even realize how awesome the play was.
Legend.
zero reaction too, like you've been there before... lol
Reminds me of the scene in band of brothers where the one guy runs across the German camp to give a message to part of the company.....then proceeds to run back the exact same way.
Blurbs what are your thoughts about an arena type esport for SOT? It‚Äôs entirely possible, and I was just thinking about it the other day and thought it would be epic
You really helped me improve me and my friends pvp, we managed to two man take down a shitty galleon crew recently, real proud of that, thanks!
And this is how to solo sloop !
The excitement is . . . . ummm . . . wait where is the excitement?!
Fucking insane. My favorite streamer atm!!!
You have got the be the best pirate I ever heard of.
Must have been a golf champion in an old life
THAAT'S MILLIOOONS TO ONEEEEEE!!!
    i see someone appreciates GTAV speed running
        Finally, after 3 months...
Your permanent, half-lidded grimace of discontent perfectly captures the non-fun of this game.
    dude that‚Äôs just his RBF (Resting Blurbs Face) checkout flotsam solo PvP, he has so much energy you‚Äôd swear he‚Äôs a child playing the best game ever made‚Ä¶ may I ask why you‚Äôre on the SoT subreddit if you so obviously hate the game?
Pretty cool, but honestly I hate that this is a thing in this game. This kind of shit is exactly why naval battles barely ever happen.
You need some emotion, it‚Äôs like watching a robot haha
With a beard like that shouldn‚Äôt you be doing something productive ?
    Yeah because this comment is productive
You looked really excited about it
That first kill with the sword pissed me off. Sword is so broken right now
[deleted]
    Not that fun of a game to play by yourself. Not too hard to find an easy-going group to tag along with over the internet. I‚Äôd wait for a discount.
Paid actors!
Bro this is wild. Good stuff.
This was awesome!
impressed by harpoon grab
Didn't expect to see you when I opened Reddit but am pleasantly surprised
Holy heck, I bet you terrify Black Beard.
Mans is gaming
The amount of balls...
That must be a 1st
lol your excitement is infectious. sick shots
This would fit well in r/nextfuckinglevel
The only that should be going through your head while doing that is the pirates of the carribean theme song
u/rip-video
Didn't realize bucky played sea of thieves. The Winter Streamer
Idk how you were in range to grab that mid mast that looked crazy
Damn
Sheeesh blurbs that was awesome!
I think we were just witnessing was the Hungry Box of Sea Of Thieves
His whole mood is that it's just another casual day
I was waiting for his reaction, but this guy stayed as cool as a cucumber
as someone whos never seen this game, this whole sequence was made to look very normal by your reaction.
Woah
Check on the A.S. I worked at in college. The rest is just icing on the cake. He knew it was not coming.
How the hell do I get good at fighting and aiming the cannons
The seas are mine to command!
Smooothh
The boomerang
This called me bad on so many levels
That's some shit right there. Well done
Okay... consider me genuinely impressed
Now that‚Äôs a pirate..
What game is this?
    Sea of thieves
Sprinty John: You're mad!

u/Blurbss: Thank goodness for that, 'cause if I wasn't this would probably never work.
ALL THIS IN A SOLO SLOOP?!? JESUS!
How the hell did that first shot land. You weren't anywhere near the main mast when you grabbed the ladder!

I think you made a deal with the Rare Servers
calm down dude youre way too excited
That is the most amazing SoT clip I have ever seen. Fuck you!
[deleted]
That‚Äôs what we in the business call a pro gamer move.
And he did this without a sip of rum
Bro ur cracked
This is winning sea of thieves.
How much air control do you have?
If the video didn't exist, I would've never believed you.
This makes me want to play this game‚Ä¶. But I have no friends who own it or play it.


Would it be possible to enjoy solo?
god tier move, soly hucking fhit
What game is it?
I love your face like if you were watching a sea snails documentary,  no reaction.
I would‚Äôve been losing my mind
Wow
These are the people who make this game not fun
God gamer, pirate legend!
you play like an asshole....but damn do i respect the talent.
https://t.me/joinchat/NjhnTvDNWDczMmQx
Jesus Christ. It‚Äôs Jason bourne
My dude's over here redefining poker face. Pretty sure you can sue Lady Gaga at this point.
https://mega.nz/folder/aKISHTIK#ObJp4Fg2QoVMTdZGK36a1A
Now THIS is piracy!
Meanwhile me: -misses canon shot to the big ass island next to me while docked-
‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs on the ship. He‚Äôs on the ship.‚Äù

*Dude is totally emotionless in the streaming box while he murders countless pirates*
DUDE
Wow not even a single twitch on your face, completely deadpan
I wasn't sure if I was going to buy this game, if it was right for me, but this video is the best advertisement for a video game that I've seen in a long time. I'm sure I won't be able to do anything like this when I play.
That is bad ass.. not played in over a year.. need to get back at it
Oh, hey, im subscribed to your YouTube channel.
This is a very silly game
i've been playing for 3 days and i get scared when a ship is an island away. if someone did this to me i think i would be genuinely stunned
After these leapfrogs, we'll be riiiight back!
Okay! This is epic
Fucking Insane, you Legend
Ok, this is sick
That ‚Äòvisible excitement‚Äô üòÇ
This is exactly why i stopped playing SOT. How the fuk am i supposed to compete with that?
Your doing shit like this meanwhile I can't land a basic cannonball shot worth shit from that distance.
I see that you decided to become the anchorball. But how?
Legend of the seas
That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen
This is why this game is worth it
we really don't play the same game lmao
Just wow.  This is the greatest thing I've ever seen in this game.
Why am I not surprised it was Blurbs who did it. What a lord.
Someone get this man medical attention, he‚Äôs clearly sick.
Tell me you play in pc with out telling me you play on pc lol
jesus christ
Legendary pirate lord.
Captain Jack Sparrow:*i sleep*
This Dude:*real shit*
Blurbs, please be my mentor. I love this game, and long to be as good as you!
Wait you can fire yourself out, don't need help?
GG
not even a little, oh neet. He just looks so bored.
This guy is now my Sea of Thieves idol. How have I never heard of him?? I just got back into playing and after seeing this, looked him up and have been taking his pvp tips for solo slooping. Wish I knew about him before I let those pesky 10 year olds bully my solo sloop yesterday üòû
casually says ill be right back and lands on his ship xD
That is an absolute Chad move right there
30 seconds of sea of theives. Low key your a big reason i play at all. I havnt played a whole lot but seeing you in action drives me to want to do shit like that

I fought this man on the seas‚Ä¶ still no clue how my crew and I snuck out the win. Those shots are insane. What most of us struggle to do with hundreds of attempts he does back to backüòÇ
Wow
Get out of this casual game and go back to csgo retard
DUDE! That was fookin awesome!
You didn't utilize this opportunity to shout "YARRRRR HAR HAR HARRRRGH!" As you kobe yourself from full court?!
I can‚Äôt even fathom being that good at this game or any game for that matter
Brave Vanguard Sails üòçüòçüòç
