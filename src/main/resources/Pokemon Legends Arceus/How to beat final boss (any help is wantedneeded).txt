[[How to beat final boss (any help is wantedneeded)]]


Okay so I’ve been playing this game since the day it was released. However I’ve been stuck for months (read: over a year) on the part beating the last “noble boss” Arceus. I can’t even get his thing down 25% percent to have a continue battle when I die. Please I’m so frustrated and idk what I can do to win this battle


Arceus was the hardest by far, it took me weeks of dying to get it.
Definitely invest on charms to stay alive, you gotta dodge well, it sounds simple, but I know how hard it is, truly, it's about practicing and reading Arceus' attack correctly. 

And your balm finger will get tired... cause Holy moly he's not fun
    I honestly found Arcanine way more annoying due to the restrictive arena. I beat arceus fairly quickly by the time I got there, maybe 3-4 wipes.
    Wait, what are charms?
        The old lady between the training grounds and the galaxy building, by the well(?)

You can buy charms that get used up instead of an effect happening,  like getting poisoned, losing items, but important here, a charm that breaks, instead of you dying... I had 3 I think (4 lives) and beat it with probably 1hp left🤣

Be aware, they get expensive, not as much as satchel space...
            There was a charm that would give you extra hits and I’m only just now learning about it after I beat the game?!
                I had the shiny charm before I learned, you're not alone friend 🥲
            Arceus would have been so easy :<
Arceus is the hardest battle out of all of the boss battles in Legend's Arceus. What I did was I watched others do it first on Youtube before I did it. I failed a lot but after a few hours I was able to complete it on my own. Reaction timing is key.
Investing in as many survival charms as possible helps a ton, as well as the continue fight feature, as it lets you start from the last quarter you completed
It’s about pin point accuracy on dodges. The arrow attack goes 6 or 7 times. Once you get to 75 percent left more attacks are added. It’s a lot of fun honestly
Took me about 45 minutes of dedicated attempts but main takeaways I had were:

1)the mechanics of the fight are unforgiving but fair. If you learn the tells and timing of each attack, you can figure out what’s coming next. 

2)you need perfect or near-perfect dodge timing to not get hit, so practice makes perfect 

3)every time you have a pause in attacks or he’s switching attack patterns, throw balms. Learn how many you can throw safely through trial and error. 

4)DON’T GET GREEDY. Arceus WILL punish you for it. If you only land one balm, then you only land one. If you try to take another shot at him you’re gonna get hit and stunlocked. 

5)keep your forward progress every time you complete a section of the bar. Getting through it without dying is insanely hard, so just take the progress and keep working on it. 

6)keep your calm, it really is all about patience and persistence 

Hope it helps!
    Turn on audio for cues!
Get all the charms like others said, and try to learn the patterns. There's a timing to all its attacks. If you dodge too early you won't recover in time and will be hit, but once you learn the timing you can get through a lot of cycles easily.
I had to play this fight in docked mode and have the volume on. The sound cues really do help time the dodges correctly/accurately.
OP if you black out during the fight if you hit continue and keep progress it will be at the start of the last bar you were working on.
1. Buy Elden Ring 
2. Become Elden Lord
3. Redo boss fight  

Guaranteed to work 100% of the time!
    *60% of the time*, it works ***every*** *time*
I haven’t used survival charms yet! So thanks for that tip. If that isn’t gonna help me significantly I guess I should just give up at this point..
    Remember the charms stack, so buy all 5
    Definitely worth looking up a video if you haven’t yet. It’s all about the timing. It definitely wasn’t a Quick battle for me, but I was able to figure out to how reliably get off a hit or two without taking damage during the little meteor/shooting star type of attacks. It was enough to give me the patience I needed to see it through to the end lol.
Max out grit lvls on all ur mons and get them to lvl 85-90.

I best him with togekiss and unbrion only with my mons at those lvls and maxed out grit. 

If u can learn snore on any of our mons I heavly suggest it as it decreases both special and phisical attack in this game.
    My team are all lvl 98 and maxed out but I haven’t even been able to actually fight arceus. I will use learn one of them snore tho bc none know that move now!
        Ooohhh I thought u ment volo lol my bad. Yea arceus is a huge pain. Time ur jumps with his beams (not easy) his teleport is rough to. Also if u progress and die I wouldn’t click start over. I just clicked “continue from where u were” or whatever it says. I don’t think u can not take super effective damage from him cuz of judgment.
        U can relearn it from that lady in town (all the way in the back, red hair I think, buffieh, where there is a battling arena)  or in the move list. I forgot how for sure but u can go between them all whenever u want.
The two things i can think of would be to make sure you have all of the dmg reduction charms and to continue instead of trying again when you lose.
I didn't use the charms but I looked up the fight on youtube to know what happens. When I got killed I always choose my previous progress ain't no way I can do this fight without using my previous progress. He killed me couple times I prob spend around an hr there.. most of the times I'll just try to drop his hp at least one stage before getting killed..
