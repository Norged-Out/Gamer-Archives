[[I Made Pokemon Legends Arceus, But You Play As Pokemon!]]





Ok unironically imagine if you played as the Pokémon like this after sending them out
    My dream pokemon game is arceus, but when you throw your pokemon out to battle, you control the pokemon hack and slash style. It'll never happen, but I can dream.
        That's why I made this! 😁
            Easy now. Sure fire way to get nintendo on your ass. Especially if you end up on kotaku.
            Where can I play it
            Idk what kind of genius you are. But you are insane mate with your Megamind brain and coding.
                And my Mega Muk
            It's better than any pokemon game I've ever seen!
                Any fan made game, sure.
                    What Pokémon game has been good since red or blue?
                        Gold and silver.
                            Ruby and Sapphire
                                Pokemon colosseum
                                    This is a correct answer
                                    Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness
                                Diamond and Pearl
                        90% of them
                        Basically all of them.
                        all of them
                        How could you say something so controversial yet so brave?
            But now the question is, can you catch pokemon as the pokemon? Like giving your pet a pet.
                Pokeception
            I'd also like to play this....
            Where can i play this
            How can I download this?
        I've always thought a pokemon game in the style of Okami would be great! You could have an arena that opens up when a Pokemon gets sent out and you control the mon, the four face buttons act as your four moves, and you can run and dodge at will
            Exactly! It'd be so fun!
        There was a PC MMO that did this, although its pretty barren and dead.
            Can’t believe y’all sleeping on PokePark
            It was years ago wasn’t it, I recall it, sadly they didn’t progress the game further than the starting point but the concept was good
            Is that TemTem? That looked pretty cool (although I never did play it)
                TemTem was basically just a pokemon MMO game, gameplay was almost exactly like pokemon but you could play co op with a friend, really great game you should check it out if you happen to be a pokemon fan girl or anything like that
        Closest we ever got is PMD and Pokken
        Like normal pokemon game, but when you send out its pokken tournament
            Thats what I was gonna say.
        i would love a game like legends arceus but the combat is a real-time arena fighter, like pokken tournament (i’d prefer if it was like naruto ninja storm or demon slayer hinokami chronicles but pokken tournament is more likely, if you could consider any of them likely at all)
        Or something like the FF7 remake combat would be perfect
        Now imagine Pokémon like Cubone parry and dodge like  a Souls game.
        This! Ultimate game would be PLA + Pokken Battling.
        You send out your pokemon and then it just turns into an entire musou warriors game
        so, pokemon warriors?
        Same but with breeding as well
        There’s an official game like that Can’t remember what it’s called (not super smash bros) but it was kinda like tekken but with just Pokémon I was going to get it then found out it wasn’t all that great because it was missing the core of why we love the games the rpg/strategy type side to it but if they could make a game that polished up PLA graphics and frame rate issues and obviously go back to gyms and battling but have that games battle mechanics( I don’t even know if it played well just looks cool and adds more skill)
        I’ll raise you one.

Take super smash bros combat (up down left right + standard attack/power attack) and control the Pokémon. Just like squirtle, ivysaur, and Charizard. 

Most of the same types of Pokémon (bird for example) can have the same move type/animations (all bird Pokémon can use gust, and they all use it the same way) to keep from getting too crazy complicated.

It would be fucking awesome.
    Kindred fates is a kickstarter game that ls aiming to make something like this.
        Yup, backed it, looks cool
        I shall now start following this
        Ayo! I’m a big supporter of that game. My friend is the cousin of one of the main people working on it.
        I really, really hope it goes well, but I'm waiting until it's released before I drop any money. I've been burned one too many times on Kickstarter by over-promising devs that under-deliver, if they deliver a game at all.
        Thanks for shouting this out, definitely gonna be looking forward to the release!
        yeah that won't go well at all the instant Nintendo detects something pokemonesque in it
            I looked into it a bit so much of the stuff is just ripped from pokemon. At one point in the trailer they show the ui and its like identical even having the base stats ev iv system. They also claim they will have a release option for switch which I think will be interesting to see.
                Creature collectors are a genre dude, it's not just pokemon. Having similar ui and an IV/EV system is no grounds for "copying" let alone a lawsuit. The pre-legends arceus open world elements plus action RPG combat set it very far apart, and it doesn't even need it. Look at Temtem, a turn-based four-move double-battle creature collector with EVs/IVs and is on switch, and is very far removed from pokemon in its own way. I wish more people would understand the difference between ripping off and being in the same genre.
                TemTem is a game that's pretty blatant with it's Pokemon inspiration but it's doing fine legally. I'm sure Nintendo can't do anything about Kindred Fates even if they wanted to.
    Story pitch! 
We could be in Kanto.
The "professor type" is one of the researchers trying to clone mew.
He makes a ditto on accident. (the ditto is the player character) 

Tasks us with collecting the DNA of all 149 pokemon to help him with his project.(since mew is the progenitor of all pokemon) 

You just kind of gain them as transform options instead of full on catching them.

Once we get the 149 he tries to clone mew again. Makes mewtwo for the boss fight.
End scene 

Is it bad? Probably. Are pokemon plots ever good? Not really.
        > Tasks us with collecting the DNA of all 149 pokemon

*Very poor choice of words*
            Oh God no
                Arceus can't save you or your flair now
                Flair checks out.
                Easy Mode, go live in a daycare! :D
                    Gonna catch pokerus if you go with that strategy
                        Since I don't see any ill effects of catching it, sure, why not?

[Gotta Catch em all!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7lEZBxu3zo&t=2s) :D
                Well, the Player Character would be a Ditto sooo.........
                Well, if the main character of this is a ditto.. then the choice of words is pretty on brand.
            So... Basically you go to the pokemon daycare and go to work while other trainers come to have eggs.
            There is a section  of the internet very interested in this.
                Insert Vaporeon copypasta here.
            I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this
            The game starts with the researchers placing you in a daycare…
            Did you know that vaporeon is the easiest to collect?
            Very great choice of words…
            *Ditto exhaustedly unwraps the eighth lipstick of the day*
        Will I make this!? Probably 😁
        Good idea!
        Imagine a Pokemon Legend Clefairy
You play an alternative Bill in kanto as he is changed in a Clefairy on a quest to regain human form.
            No, don't share your ideas! They'll turn it into porn!
        > Is it bad? Probably. Are pokemon plots ever good? Not really.

Heyyy, I liked B/W and I'll die on this hill goddammit!
            Yeah, BWB2W2 had decent story and story progression

But generally, if someone plays games for the story, I wouldn't recommend them Pokémon 🙃
        Id play
        Main character gonna be busy at the day care center getting that DNA.
        Reminds me of cuboids.
        Ditto being a failed experiment from mew/mewtwo has been debunked so many times that I'm sick of the lore around it.
            When?
                Many times, and this video explains why

https://youtu.be/MuvGD5tC69o

The video even shows where the devs and artists did not even have that as a conclusive reason

While it's a fun idea, it is incorrect

Ditto wouldn't exist in so many places if it were true, plus, ditto existing in legends: arceus is further proof that it is just another pokemon.
    I've been begging for this for years. Make a regular pokemon game, but the battles are fought like Pokken tournament. Would be great.
        Either the gameplay would be incredibly shallow and/or fundamentally broken, or that game would have an insanely small number of Pokemon

Incredibly obvious why this isn't on the table
            "Incredibly obvious" is just because its gamefreak...
            I'd say 30 pokemon would be enough.
                yeah i agree tbh

doubt it'd do good financially tho
        Field phase but expanded to a full gamr
    That has always been my dream. 

Also, a fan project did this. Not sure if it's still going.
        Do you remember the name? I remember finding game similar almost 8 years ago on the internet but I could never find it again
            I believe the game is Pokemon Reloaded, still in development, but the beta is playable.
            Tried finding traces of my contact with the developers, but no luck. But I do know the name has changed a few times. 

Looks a lot like "pokemon mmo 3d", but now there's also an unreal version of it. Good graphics, but pokemon animations are a little lacking.
    I would be very cool 😎
        Nintendo has nuked so many “play as the Pokémon in real time” fan games. It’s depressing that they don’t just do it right themselves.
    Fan game Pokemon origins I believe was this. Didnt pan out because it was to big in scope for I think what was one guy. And lets be real had he gotten anywhere substantial Nintendo would have crucified him.
        Damn i remember the beta, pretty cool to play as a pidgey and growlith.
    This is the kind of game I've always wanted since I was a kid
    So like Mystery Dungeon Legends Arceus
    Even if you stayed in control of the trainer, calling out attacks that have delays depending on how strong.  Calling out dodge when enemies charging attacks.  Make me feel like ash in the anime
    Armored Core/ZotE/Virtual On, but with pokemon
    Kinda like Ni No Kuni
    This is what I thought arceus was going to be, you would play as pokemon in the fights and there would be dodgerolling etc. Basically pokemon souls

But no. BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
    I have wanted this since I got my Gameboy color.
    They'd probably have to scale the number of Pokemon down to like 30 to make them all balanced and fun but it would be awesome.
    With a battle style like Pokken Tournament
        I feel like Pokken was fun enough but free 3D movement without a locked camera would be better. Also I wouldn't want to go to an "arena" screen, having fights occur in the overworld with no transition screen is the future of Pokemon IMO.
    This has already been made, well as fanmade game anyways, Pokemon generations I think it's called
Time to become a Magikarp and just vibe.
    Oh Margikarp, he has some bear outbreak problems in the full video haha
        Relatable.
        :(
    Untitled Goose Game, just with Magikarp
        *Untitled Karp Game*
    Have you played Sekiro?
Dialga do be walking doe
    Dialga can do whatever he wants
        Especially walk
    Palkia walking to your house to explain why Pearl Clan is the best
        Palkia walking around like he got a big ol dumper
        >!i caught Palkia when i first interacted with him, so when the Pearl leader says shes 'talking to Palkia' after the fight it made me so unreasonably mad. My only train of thought was 'you're such a pick-me girl that you think my Palkia is talking to you ?' Girl. No. My Palkia.!<
            Look at it this way: this is literally their god who they referred to as a deity, and whose name now bears the current region name. I would shake hands with Jesus even if he’s walking around with a criminal tbh
    still better animation that swsh
Pokémon Mystery Dungeon has finally achieved its peak form. Please make my dreams a reality!
    Yeah, as soon as I saw Arceus's rendering of Pokemon I felt "this would be even more suitable for a PMD game".
    Yup. Exactly what I was thinking. Do want.
    I didn't even realize I needed it this bad until I saw this.
So pokepark 3? XD
    Actually pokepark 4 xD
        I was gonna say Mystery Dungeon, but yes, absolutely brand this as Pokepark 4 lmao

    He does love his diamonds
    Reminds me of the guy that gets fused with his Machamp in Detective Pikachu and just admires his muscles instead of freaking out like everyone else.
A few months ago, I made Pokemon Legends Arceus so Nintendo doesn't have to! But since Nintendo released their game anyway I needed to make mine better =D. lol I made a humorous video here for the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh7u7lJ7urg
    I remember seeing the original video- as a programmer myself I was very impressed by how much you managed to get done in such a short amount of time!
        Thank you :) yeah I had to update mine because Nintendo released theirs anyway 😂
            XD

Np!

You're a great programmer! Keep it up, man! :D
            I remember your post before! As a newbie programmer I am in awe at the sheer speed you were able to put something so epic together like this.
        Really makes gamefreak look lazy. They are!
    Loved both videos, just got my degree in computer science and they kept me going!
        Glad you enjoyed them and they motivated you! 😁

Oh and Muk
    So freaking awesome!
Imagine a Pokemon: Mystery Dungeon game designed like this
    Nah, if PMD were to change genres it would be a visual novel with elements from the Saw movie series
Cyndaquil: AHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAHHHHHHHHH GET THE FORK AWAY FROM ME
    The Muk gets him in the full vid 😁😂
        You know what Muk spelled backwards is…
            What your mom was gargling last night?
                Dirt? because she’s buried in it…?
            Yeah, snake.
            M-u-k s-p-e-l-l-e-d b-a-c-k-w-a-r-d-s.
I love how palkia looks like he's going to his parents room at 2am
    Yeah Arceus is right upstairs!
It's like Mystery Dungeon but Arceus
So, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon?
    Except it would be more fun.
I was hoping for a game like this, would work very well with the XC2 battle mechanics/controller layout.
    I love XC2! Yes something like that would be perfect for this
        The first time I played XC2 my immediate thought was “wow this would make an awesome Pokémon game”. Then I got sucked into XC2 and spent 200 hours playing the game haha. I hope they do another Xeno game with the blade mechanic. God that first playthrough was *so* much fun.
            Man, XC2 just looks so damn ugly, it's really hindering my experience.
    What is XC2 for xcom?
        Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I can’t recommend it enough, it’s a very unique game and the semi open-world rivals that of BotW. The developers of BotW actually had help from the XC2 team when developing the environments.
    XB1 combat is much better and way less bloated
Damn why the legendaries so angry
    They mean!
Arceus: I shall now send you forth into the world of Pokemon.  Come find all Pokemon, then seek me again.

Player: WHY DID YOU TURN ME INTO A POKEMON TOO?! 

Arceus:  Don't question God.  Just pretend it's Mystery Dungeon with less stairs and more chances of dying.
    Mega Muk
    For a brief second at the beginning of PLA, when looking up at the starters, the professor asks if we're okay, and it felt like the beginning of a PMD game because it looked like the starters were asking.
I need this 😱
    I wish I could release
Is there a way to play this?
    I wish but Nintendo would eat me =(
        just accidentally leak it
        F
            I know lol 😆
        Surely you'd just get a cease and desist? Which if you've already made the video, wouldn't matter, and then it'd be out in the wild and out of reach for Nintendos lawyers (like pokemon uranium)
        >!vore?!<
    I wish but I can't release =(
        it would be a shame if it leaked onto a rom site!
        Can't you just open source it somewhere and once it's out there is nothing they can do really lol!
        Not even as a patch?
            Patch of what? This isn’t a mod
                Shid my bad. I thought it was a PLA hack.
I love the Dialga/Palkia, just "nah fuck this i'm out"
    They chilling hard
This would be an awesome mistery dungeon
Mystery dungeon
This is rad af
    Muk =)
        Kum =)
I remember this roblox game
Why is every fan project better than every single official Pokémon game ffs?
Damn the new PMD looks amazing
If gamefreak actually made a game like this I think the entire internet would break
    Oh yeah internet confirmed would bandwidth overload and explode for sure
    As if Gamefreak would put in any level of effort into making something like this
So Pokemon mystery dungeon but its open world based and 3D?
Aaaand, cease and desist…
Cant wait for the Magikarp only run
    Oh yeah, my brother tried that. Didn't end well 🤣
...was that a Rayquaza?
    ;)
This looks amazing, really wish it could be played!
    Eventually I will post one of these videos and replace, and have a game link that replaces the characters and models. But I need a little more practice first!
Nintendo be like >:(.

Honestly my younger bro expected to see newer mystery dungeon or a remake of explorers of (time/darkness/sky) insted of gen 9.
I really wish the pokemon battles were this way. I know it would mean a complete overhaul of the battle mechanics of the series but it would just be so much fun to have to actually dodge and attack.
FUCKING GIMMIE HOLY SHIT
    I want too :(
What was that green thing near the end? Also, is the very end a real part of the game? If so, where?
    It's the secret final boss I made ;)
PMD Evolved :O
Open world mystery dungeon.?
Finally, Pokepark 3
this is literally what I want...
You know, I want to see a Mystery Dungeon game like this.
omg, yes!
    And it has Mega Muk =D
Sick
    Muk
Can I play as Spheal
    yes =)
I'd like to play as a Flareon.
I'm hoping that we get an official game like this. In the over world and shit, you're the trainer. In combat, you're the Pokemon. You can freely move around and use abilities and can hot swap to trainer to use items.
I almost thought this was an official video when I saw Charizard getting extra attention
    Hahaha 😂
Pokémon Legends: Mystery Dungeon
Palkia walking is a fucking gangsta
This is how I want Pokémon battles to be
Pokémon Mystery Dungeon without the "mystery dungeon" part
Can we get a mystery dungeon game like this please
Shut up and take my money
do you plan to release it somewhere?
Ive had this exact idea! You play as the trainer until you take your pokemon out, then it switches to them. And then each face button has its own dedicated attack with cooldown. Glad to see someone made something like that!
    Yep! I wanted this for a while so I made it myself :)
Aight place your bets people how long until Nintendo comes swinging with the cease and desist
Imagine rerolling yourself for a shiny
Looks better than anything gamefreak has done in decades.
This. I need this.
    I wish I could give :(
A bullet hell Pokemon game would be sick af.
    That's basically how I made the arceus fight 😂
The Poké Balls are broken, thay free mon. What would they do without thy Trainer.  (Elden Ring)
Dammnnn Pokemon Legends of Mystery dungeon looks awesome!!!
This is so cool!!
    Thank you :)
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky DX Leaked footage
    Shhhhhh
That's pretty rad dude. Good work
    Thank you :)
[deleted]
    And this version has a secret final boss 😁
        :O Whose the secret final boss?
            Secret final boss in the full video =D
Nice concept!
    Thank you =)
PMD be like
DLC of this would kick ass
    Yes especially Mega Muk, pokemon needs Mega Muk
Okay I'm sorry but Dialga and Palkia walking is just unreasonably funny to me for some reason
    They look very funny hahaha, but Palkia and Dialga are too cool not to include in this =)
Gotta be honest, I’d love to play as the Pokémon for this reason. I like Pokémon because of the creatures, I couldn’t care less about the trainers. I feel like if they blended strategy with a real time battle system, that’d be amazing.
    Playing as Pokemon was fun!
Literally cannot tell the difference between this and the actual game.
    Yeah its graphics are just as good
modders always find a way to make the original developers look like lazy talentless hacks lol
This is going to get taken down, isn't it?
Really wish they would've done live combat.  Similar to the anime so you still are the trainer.  Different attacks with different cast times/ delays.  Projectiles vs physical up close, AOE attacks, dodge call-out when you see enemy's charge attacks.  Biggest miss in the history of Pokemon.
    Took much work on Gamefreak’s part so we’ll never get anything like that
Cease and desist in 3...2...
I'm truly impressed.

The next evolution in battle mechanics I want to see is for us to become our Pokémon with 3rd-person camera perspective. Let us run around like how you've programmed. Let us dodge attacks and have to aim (with a lock-on mechanic as an option for people who want to use it).

It can still be turn-based. Or they can overhaul the battle mechanics so A, B, X, and Y correspond to each attack so we can make decisions in real time (there could be an in-game timer between attacks for us to have a chance to act, or we could alternate between realtime and turn-based by pulling up the standard attack menu, similar to how PLA let us swap Pokémon using ZR or by going into the party menu).

I just realized that all of these mechanics are already in PLA, so they'd barely have to change anything with how they work. It's just that they're all done through the player character and not by the Pokémon themselves.
Wow, I didn't know Nintendo released a Pokemon Rescue Team game!
Anybody else thinking mystery dungeon?
Come on Nintendo bring that hammer down!
how and where can you play this
It's the anime style story of a cyndaquil training to fight God and finally taking revenge against the plotters of his family's death..
    So he's gunna fight a Bidoof?
Not going to lie. I think it's time for pokémon to get a real-time battle system
Kinda looks like Pokemon UNITE!
    A little bit! but different camera angle
Can you send it me!!!??
Can you give a link to the thing? I very much want to do this, maybe I can become my parasect
Here comes the DMCA!
Is this like mod? Because I would hundred percent hack my switch to play this.
wher how do i get it and now
    I wish I could release =(
....aaaaaaaaand it's gone.
INFO: Why hasn't Gamefreak called you yet with a job offer? This is FIRE!
    Nintendo hire this man!
    And it has Mega Muk =)
making a good game 101
New mystery dungeon??
Nintendo should buy you out so you can finish the game for them, honestly.
Ah, so just Pokepark
You say a game where you can play as a Pokémon? It already exists and it is called PMD.
Solid.
Again, another case of a single person doing alone what a billionaire franchise can't.
    =) my game is a bit janky though with the controls / colliders lol
        So you just need more time and maybe a bit more money. Proportionally, you’re doing what a billion dollar company couldn’t be bothered to do.
            If TPC wanted to do this they probably could
Why does this look more fun than PLA
This looks horrible.
finally, furry simulator

something tells me companies having unlimited access to IPs is wrong, we should be able to make whatever
Pokemon mystery dungeon platinum hunters looking lit
Really enjoyed your video before, great job dude.
Arceus' attacks are giving me Gold morning vibes.
The way Rayquaza noodles himself around in the air lol
i would play this.
Hey I’ve seen this game before! The ability to control Pokémon in new though
Don’t lie, most of you are gonna Snorlaxx
I support this decision
elden ring has me thinking of this like a souls game where the bosses are legendaries and minibosses are pseudos
I want this bud as a soulsborne game it would be epic
Pokemon Legends Mystery Dungeon
Ah sweet, I was hoping for a new pmd game
I’m upvoting this as I cry looking at my database portfolio that’s severely lacking.
If Pokémon Mystery Dungeon were an action game
You should DM the people on this thread with a secret release. Including me of course.
wtf how that's awesome
Pokemon Mystery Arceus
0-----0 pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Give me now
    I wish I could =(
Yeah okay, Pokemon Dungeons would translate well into a 3D setting like this. Give me.
Ah, mystery dungeon
How? Where? Words need them
This is all I’ve ever wanted in a Pokémon game
So what you effectively have is a Ledgends style Mystery Dungeon game.
Mystery dungeon 3D
Can we get pokemon mystery dungeon in this style 😍
The PMD potential here tho
Always wanted an open-world game where you play as Pokémon

Thank you for delivering
Oh yeah uhhh about fan games…
I can't tell if this is Pokepark 3 or Mystery Dungeon 5
So... This is kinda the game i want, a pokemon game without turns you fight like the anime.... And no not pokken
I would love to see an actual Pokemon game like this. Imagine how epic that would be.
This looks like it'd be insanely fun..and equally infuriating
Wow. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/oxi348/its_2021_how_do_we_not_have_a_real_time_battle_rpg/) post a while back.  As you can see, several people poopoo'd the idea.  Now with Legends Arceus a HUGE success and now this, I wonder what people's thoughts are?

Personally, I couldn't go back to the old system.  If I can't at the very least sneak around and toss balls, bait and the like at pokemon as part of the next games, I'm not interested.
IMAGINE a mystery dungeon game with this style holy shit
Really neat! Did you use unreal engine for this?
Wait, how did you get Unovan Braviary and Charizard into the game? It looks so epic.
Bill's story comes to life
Lol this proves how much game freak is trash
With better graphics too wooow!
I’m getting Tournament of Power vibes.
So how many legal threats have you received from Nintendo?
This has always been a dream spin-off of mine. I think playing as Pokemon would be super fun!
Weren't you the guy who made the game before it released? I recognize it
So... pokemon mystery dungeon 3d
Fucking best stuff i ever heard from fanmade things
https://the-eye.eu/redarcs  -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/
Nintendo: Cool. This will cost you 3 million in copyright costs
I wish i have the tools and knowledge to do this kind of stuff. I have been imaging a Pokemon game like this for years
Beat the game as pokemon
I wanna mod arceus that turns all NPCs and the player character into Pokémon and turns all the Pokémon into humans
Nintendo: Agent 47 we have target for you.
Action Mystery Dungeon
There was an old Roblox Pokémon game like this. It was surprisingly really fun. Screw Nintendo was taking away the magnificent Roblox fan games
I'd be a prancing happy vulpix. Just doing vulpix things. Then I'd switch to Articuno, be a happy ice birdy flying around and race Zapdos but he cheats.
I wished there were more games were you could play as the Pokémons themselves. Mystery Dungeon games are not my style (Though I do enjoy them for the story, but the gameplay loop and harsh difficulty in the post game dungeon is not enjoyable for me), and Poképark is a bit limited, and only on Wii.
So this would play sort of like a bullet hell game? Avoiding barrages of attacks while getting your damage in? I'd play that
Pokémon mystery dungeon the legend of arceus
It reminds me that of that old DBZ quake mod.
Ah yes. My friend DMCA would love to meet yo- oh he's already there?
Imagine a pokemon game in pokemon natural habitat without human influances.
okay is this real?
I have been wanting this for soo long, a ni no kuni style pokemon battle system. You control them, and then its based on skill, a bit of luck for RNG, and would make nearly every pokemon viable. No more weak fully evolved pokemon, you can even fight using middle and base stages and still have a good shot, anime style. I truly hopw this will be a thing in the future, and for it to be well implemented. Gen 10 or 11 maybe (but I want gamefreak to take their time, too much pokemon stuff lately, which I appreciate but I think they should take time to really shake it up further).
Lucario casually dodging light speed attacks from the literal god of Pokémon
Jesus Christ, these graphics are so horrendous
Pokémon Legends: Mystery Dungeon
How about a 3d real time battle mystery dungeon. Dungeons could be more like zelda ones, though more action than puzzle. Only problem is there wouldn't be that many pokemon you could play as since it would be so time consuming to make models and gameplay for many.
This makes me think but imagine battles in Pokémon were more interactive and like initiating battle would be like pokken but you can catch the Pokémon... and if a trainer, they have more on their team... and you don’t have to beat the Pokémon 2 out of 3 to faint it... and so on. Also Pokémon attacks would be catered not towards the Pokémon but the moves they use. In the end, this feels more like a dream than reality
Can I play as Skuntank?
Imagine a Mystery Dungeon Game in 3D where you battle like in tekken. That would be so cool
This amazing. Do you have instructions on how you did it? (If you’re willing to share after all your hard work!)
yeah if only it existed
Watch it get taken down by Nintendo
I wish they did that so you can actually dodge it on command, pin attacks against each other, and use the environment to your advantage.
The new Mystery Dungeon looks great!
Man I haven’t gotten the game yet and thought this was a feature till reading the title lmao
is the game available? 👀
r/MysteryDungeon
Where do i play?
I want to be the rereregirock ÜN ÜN ÜN
dude i saw this game in a youtube video
Wouldn't Dialga float?
Ok, this is pretty cool. Feels like a progression of sorts from the Mystery Dungeon games.
Yeah I wanna see a Pokemon game like that arceus but the battles are like pokken which I saw earlier thatll be cool as hell but the gotta do moves for every POKEMON
Surprised I’m not seeing Kindred Fates being mentioned more in this thread.
Nice job! But enjoy the sue
As long as I can play as Scizor, rapid speed/teleport behind an innocent Buizel, say "Nothing personell, kid", and shank it with X-Scissor, I'm in.
DMCA soon
Pomemon legends: mystery dungeon.
You should open a website where people can bet in how many hours after publishing your videos the cease and desist follows up
Finally. I too can be a Paras, Carnivine, and or Rotom to annoy the player characters by spamming attacks at them as they try to capture another Pokemon.
This looks so beautiful. And it looks pretty well designed too!
I immediately recognized the music from One Piece D&D. I was very confused for a second but thank you for the serotonin!
Bro?
Pokemon: origin of the mystery dungeon
Honestly this would be the next logical step
It always feels like I'm controlling Sneasler directly unlike the other ride Pokemon.
I played this on Roblox 8 years ago
Honestly I was thinking about how Pokemon games really take it to the next level since they’re in to open worlds now. I always felt like the relationship dynamics between Pokemon and humans are the ones hindering open world in a pokemon universe. In the best open world games, your character can navigate, fight and move in all sorts of ways that allows the user to experience the world in how they want to. In Pokemon games, your character can’t do any of that. Your Pokémons do that stuff for you. You surf on them, they dive, you ride on them to fly. It took a drastic change in Legends where Pokemons may still be the ones navigating but at least you’re controlling the Pokemon. But for an open world Pokemon game to really take the next level. Maybe a Pokemon rescue in an open world setting would the way to go.
Inb4 Nintendo comes after this amazing creation.
Seriously impressive. Watch out for Nintendo Ninjas friend, this is *that* good
Can I have that PLEASE
bullet hell much?

srsly tho, thats so cool!
Can you spell cease and desist?
remind me some memories of that Chinese game in 3D as an action rpg where you are the pokemon...
This is just mystery dungeon
Yea it looks like shit
This is what the new Mystery Dungeon should be if they make another one!
Very cool but makes you feel less like a trainer
I feel like this is how Pokemon games should be
This is the game we really wanted.
Arceus: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*massive hyperbeam*
Pokémon Legends: Dungeon of Mystery
I’ve said for the longest time that you should play as the Pokémon and the controls can be a la super smash bros. and your moves are mapped to b+direction. A+direction could be for struggle moves. Then smaller Pokémon could have faster speeds and bigger Pokémon would be slower but pack bigger punches.
That's how i wanted legends actually
Soon to be nintendod for sure
This is why copyright laws need to change.
Wait until Nintendo sees this. Get ready for cease and desist lol!

All seriousness, great work. What engine do you use?
Mystery dungeon legends
So mystery dungeon?
Is it just me or are you using some assets from Halo?
*Nintendo has entered the chat*
Makes me want a mystery dungeon game in this style
What is happening at 0:12 seconds? Is that a pokemon?
Open World Pokémon Mystery Dungeon
This reminds me of that one game on Roblox
DMCA incoming
I badly want this now.
Here before the C&D
Sadly they gon sue yo a**
So if I have CFW...and you're nice enough to share.. is it possible?
Well that’s fuggin cool
It just turned into Yo-Kai Watch 4 lol
imagine legends arcues having no human characters. and it being a full on action rpg with pokemon like mystery dungeon but action.
So basically what I want PMD to be?
I wish so mutch that the next pokemon mystery dungeon is like that
Pokémon Dead by Daylight. But ur running from trainer trying not to get caught 😂😂😂
NINTENDO HIRE THIS MAN
Too bad silvally is unplayable cuz hes not even in hisui
Open world Pokemon Mystery Dungeon? That would be amazing, I hope they actually make that.
Charizardddd
So mystery dungeon
My prostate is throbbing in confusion.
Is this game available to play?
Reminded me of a similar fan project from a long time ago called Pokemon Generations.
I’d love a PMD game like this

You get a big roster of Pokémon you can choose for your character to be, gather a party and just use those hack and slash attacks on unsuspecting foes
Can I play this?
This is an awesome idea and is probably really fun to play, shame that is you release this it’ll go uranium (if you know you know) god Nintendo is really annoying sometimes, but I’m to invested in Pokémon to give up on them
This looks like it plays like a souls game
You made Pokémon Legends Arceus?

/s
Is this a mod?
Oh to play as Lucario
You ~~made~~ modified Pokemon Legends Arceus.
  that's pretty cool and downloading please
WHERE DO I PLAY THIS
Hmmm interesting concept for what could be a mystery dungeon type game.
Let me guess roblox?
    Unity :)
This isnt gonna happen. Too many characters
Playable Pokémon Battle Royale
NINTENDO HIRE THIS MAN
omg we need a spin off like this now
Quick! I'ma need a download link before the Nintendo lawyers descend from helicopters onto your roof!
Imagine, Pokémon dark souls
So...elden ring/dark souls in Pokemon?
whoa can you imagine the implications to this? like after you send out your pokemon you actually fight in a live action rpg setting like FF7 remake or kingdom hearts??? that would be insanely cool.
    Oh don't worry Pokémon mmo video coming on the horizon 😁
Legends Arceus but when you throw out Pokémon you control them like a real time Rescue Team battle, moving around and able to either do basic attacks or a/b/x/y for your four moves (maybe a similar, but more intuitive and less janky, aiming system as Pokémon Unite).
Come on nintendo and game freak, take notes. Heck just hire this dude
I know this only a handful of people will get this, but they need to make a Pokémon game with Phantom Dust style combat so bad.
I wanna play!
hi pokken tournament
Ya know, I always wanted to see Rayquaza vs Mewtwo. Seems like you wanted to see it too.
Anyone else getting Pokepark Wonders Beyond vibe from this?
sooo mystery dungeon?
cool. when is this gonna be the next pokemon mystery dungeon game?
When fan made is better than the multi billion company made.
you got to upload this on gamebanana
Nintendo is gonna shut this down watch
Where’s the pokemon FPS game that came out a few months ago lol
You have made a beautiful masterpiece. Please share how we can enjoy too 🥺🥺
u/savevideo
So, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Legends: Arceus: the Movie Film for Cinemas?
My dream pokemon game is arceus, but when you throw your pokemon out to battle, you control the pokemon hack and slash style. It'll never happen, but I can dream.
    That's why I made this! 😁
        Easy now. Sure fire way to get nintendo on your ass. Especially if you end up on kotaku.
        Where can I play it
        Idk what kind of genius you are. But you are insane mate with your Megamind brain and coding.
            And my Mega Muk
        It's better than any pokemon game I've ever seen!
            Any fan made game, sure.
                What Pokémon game has been good since red or blue?
                    Gold and silver.
                        Ruby and Sapphire
                            Pokemon colosseum
                                This is a correct answer
                                Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness
                            Diamond and Pearl
                    90% of them
                    Basically all of them.
                    all of them
                    How could you say something so controversial yet so brave?
        But now the question is, can you catch pokemon as the pokemon? Like giving your pet a pet.
            Pokeception
        I'd also like to play this....
        Where can i play this
        How can I download this?
    I've always thought a pokemon game in the style of Okami would be great! You could have an arena that opens up when a Pokemon gets sent out and you control the mon, the four face buttons act as your four moves, and you can run and dodge at will
        Exactly! It'd be so fun!
    There was a PC MMO that did this, although its pretty barren and dead.
        Can’t believe y’all sleeping on PokePark
        It was years ago wasn’t it, I recall it, sadly they didn’t progress the game further than the starting point but the concept was good
        Is that TemTem? That looked pretty cool (although I never did play it)
            TemTem was basically just a pokemon MMO game, gameplay was almost exactly like pokemon but you could play co op with a friend, really great game you should check it out if you happen to be a pokemon fan girl or anything like that
    Closest we ever got is PMD and Pokken
    Like normal pokemon game, but when you send out its pokken tournament
        Thats what I was gonna say.
    i would love a game like legends arceus but the combat is a real-time arena fighter, like pokken tournament (i’d prefer if it was like naruto ninja storm or demon slayer hinokami chronicles but pokken tournament is more likely, if you could consider any of them likely at all)
    Or something like the FF7 remake combat would be perfect
    Now imagine Pokémon like Cubone parry and dodge like  a Souls game.
    This! Ultimate game would be PLA + Pokken Battling.
    You send out your pokemon and then it just turns into an entire musou warriors game
    so, pokemon warriors?
    Same but with breeding as well
    There’s an official game like that Can’t remember what it’s called (not super smash bros) but it was kinda like tekken but with just Pokémon I was going to get it then found out it wasn’t all that great because it was missing the core of why we love the games the rpg/strategy type side to it but if they could make a game that polished up PLA graphics and frame rate issues and obviously go back to gyms and battling but have that games battle mechanics( I don’t even know if it played well just looks cool and adds more skill)
    I’ll raise you one.

Take super smash bros combat (up down left right + standard attack/power attack) and control the Pokémon. Just like squirtle, ivysaur, and Charizard. 

Most of the same types of Pokémon (bird for example) can have the same move type/animations (all bird Pokémon can use gust, and they all use it the same way) to keep from getting too crazy complicated.

It would be fucking awesome.
Kindred fates is a kickstarter game that ls aiming to make something like this.
    Yup, backed it, looks cool
    I shall now start following this
    Ayo! I’m a big supporter of that game. My friend is the cousin of one of the main people working on it.
    I really, really hope it goes well, but I'm waiting until it's released before I drop any money. I've been burned one too many times on Kickstarter by over-promising devs that under-deliver, if they deliver a game at all.
    Thanks for shouting this out, definitely gonna be looking forward to the release!
    yeah that won't go well at all the instant Nintendo detects something pokemonesque in it
        I looked into it a bit so much of the stuff is just ripped from pokemon. At one point in the trailer they show the ui and its like identical even having the base stats ev iv system. They also claim they will have a release option for switch which I think will be interesting to see.
            Creature collectors are a genre dude, it's not just pokemon. Having similar ui and an IV/EV system is no grounds for "copying" let alone a lawsuit. The pre-legends arceus open world elements plus action RPG combat set it very far apart, and it doesn't even need it. Look at Temtem, a turn-based four-move double-battle creature collector with EVs/IVs and is on switch, and is very far removed from pokemon in its own way. I wish more people would understand the difference between ripping off and being in the same genre.
            TemTem is a game that's pretty blatant with it's Pokemon inspiration but it's doing fine legally. I'm sure Nintendo can't do anything about Kindred Fates even if they wanted to.
Story pitch! 
We could be in Kanto.
The "professor type" is one of the researchers trying to clone mew.
He makes a ditto on accident. (the ditto is the player character) 

Tasks us with collecting the DNA of all 149 pokemon to help him with his project.(since mew is the progenitor of all pokemon) 

You just kind of gain them as transform options instead of full on catching them.

Once we get the 149 he tries to clone mew again. Makes mewtwo for the boss fight.
End scene 

Is it bad? Probably. Are pokemon plots ever good? Not really.
    > Tasks us with collecting the DNA of all 149 pokemon

*Very poor choice of words*
        Oh God no
            Arceus can't save you or your flair now
            Flair checks out.
            Easy Mode, go live in a daycare! :D
                Gonna catch pokerus if you go with that strategy
                    Since I don't see any ill effects of catching it, sure, why not?

[Gotta Catch em all!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7lEZBxu3zo&t=2s) :D
            Well, the Player Character would be a Ditto sooo.........
            Well, if the main character of this is a ditto.. then the choice of words is pretty on brand.
        So... Basically you go to the pokemon daycare and go to work while other trainers come to have eggs.
        There is a section  of the internet very interested in this.
            Insert Vaporeon copypasta here.
        I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this
        The game starts with the researchers placing you in a daycare…
        Did you know that vaporeon is the easiest to collect?
        Very great choice of words…
        *Ditto exhaustedly unwraps the eighth lipstick of the day*
    Will I make this!? Probably 😁
    Good idea!
    Imagine a Pokemon Legend Clefairy
You play an alternative Bill in kanto as he is changed in a Clefairy on a quest to regain human form.
        No, don't share your ideas! They'll turn it into porn!
    > Is it bad? Probably. Are pokemon plots ever good? Not really.

Heyyy, I liked B/W and I'll die on this hill goddammit!
        Yeah, BWB2W2 had decent story and story progression

But generally, if someone plays games for the story, I wouldn't recommend them Pokémon 🙃
    Id play
    Main character gonna be busy at the day care center getting that DNA.
    Reminds me of cuboids.
    Ditto being a failed experiment from mew/mewtwo has been debunked so many times that I'm sick of the lore around it.
        When?
            Many times, and this video explains why

https://youtu.be/MuvGD5tC69o

The video even shows where the devs and artists did not even have that as a conclusive reason

While it's a fun idea, it is incorrect

Ditto wouldn't exist in so many places if it were true, plus, ditto existing in legends: arceus is further proof that it is just another pokemon.
I've been begging for this for years. Make a regular pokemon game, but the battles are fought like Pokken tournament. Would be great.
    Either the gameplay would be incredibly shallow and/or fundamentally broken, or that game would have an insanely small number of Pokemon

Incredibly obvious why this isn't on the table
        "Incredibly obvious" is just because its gamefreak...
        I'd say 30 pokemon would be enough.
            yeah i agree tbh

doubt it'd do good financially tho
    Field phase but expanded to a full gamr
That has always been my dream. 

Also, a fan project did this. Not sure if it's still going.
    Do you remember the name? I remember finding game similar almost 8 years ago on the internet but I could never find it again
        I believe the game is Pokemon Reloaded, still in development, but the beta is playable.
        Tried finding traces of my contact with the developers, but no luck. But I do know the name has changed a few times. 

Looks a lot like "pokemon mmo 3d", but now there's also an unreal version of it. Good graphics, but pokemon animations are a little lacking.
I would be very cool 😎
    Nintendo has nuked so many “play as the Pokémon in real time” fan games. It’s depressing that they don’t just do it right themselves.
Fan game Pokemon origins I believe was this. Didnt pan out because it was to big in scope for I think what was one guy. And lets be real had he gotten anywhere substantial Nintendo would have crucified him.
    Damn i remember the beta, pretty cool to play as a pidgey and growlith.
This is the kind of game I've always wanted since I was a kid
So like Mystery Dungeon Legends Arceus
Even if you stayed in control of the trainer, calling out attacks that have delays depending on how strong.  Calling out dodge when enemies charging attacks.  Make me feel like ash in the anime
Armored Core/ZotE/Virtual On, but with pokemon
Kinda like Ni No Kuni
This is what I thought arceus was going to be, you would play as pokemon in the fights and there would be dodgerolling etc. Basically pokemon souls

But no. BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
I have wanted this since I got my Gameboy color.
They'd probably have to scale the number of Pokemon down to like 30 to make them all balanced and fun but it would be awesome.
With a battle style like Pokken Tournament
    I feel like Pokken was fun enough but free 3D movement without a locked camera would be better. Also I wouldn't want to go to an "arena" screen, having fights occur in the overworld with no transition screen is the future of Pokemon IMO.
This has already been made, well as fanmade game anyways, Pokemon generations I think it's called
Oh Margikarp, he has some bear outbreak problems in the full video haha
    Relatable.
    :(
Untitled Goose Game, just with Magikarp
    *Untitled Karp Game*
Have you played Sekiro?
Dialga can do whatever he wants
    Especially walk
Palkia walking to your house to explain why Pearl Clan is the best
    Palkia walking around like he got a big ol dumper
    >!i caught Palkia when i first interacted with him, so when the Pearl leader says shes 'talking to Palkia' after the fight it made me so unreasonably mad. My only train of thought was 'you're such a pick-me girl that you think my Palkia is talking to you ?' Girl. No. My Palkia.!<
        Look at it this way: this is literally their god who they referred to as a deity, and whose name now bears the current region name. I would shake hands with Jesus even if he’s walking around with a criminal tbh
still better animation that swsh
Yeah, as soon as I saw Arceus's rendering of Pokemon I felt "this would be even more suitable for a PMD game".
Yup. Exactly what I was thinking. Do want.
I didn't even realize I needed it this bad until I saw this.
Actually pokepark 4 xD
    I was gonna say Mystery Dungeon, but yes, absolutely brand this as Pokepark 4 lmao
    [deleted]
        **Poképark 4: The Search for Poképark 3**
He does love his diamonds
Reminds me of the guy that gets fused with his Machamp in Detective Pikachu and just admires his muscles instead of freaking out like everyone else.
I remember seeing the original video- as a programmer myself I was very impressed by how much you managed to get done in such a short amount of time!
    Thank you :) yeah I had to update mine because Nintendo released theirs anyway 😂
        XD

Np!

You're a great programmer! Keep it up, man! :D
        I remember your post before! As a newbie programmer I am in awe at the sheer speed you were able to put something so epic together like this.
    Really makes gamefreak look lazy. They are!
Loved both videos, just got my degree in computer science and they kept me going!
    Glad you enjoyed them and they motivated you! 😁

Oh and Muk
So freaking awesome!
Nah, if PMD were to change genres it would be a visual novel with elements from the Saw movie series
The Muk gets him in the full vid 😁😂
    You know what Muk spelled backwards is…
        What your mom was gargling last night?
            Dirt? because she’s buried in it…?
        Yeah, snake.
        M-u-k s-p-e-l-l-e-d b-a-c-k-w-a-r-d-s.
Yeah Arceus is right upstairs!
Except it would be more fun.
I love XC2! Yes something like that would be perfect for this
    The first time I played XC2 my immediate thought was “wow this would make an awesome Pokémon game”. Then I got sucked into XC2 and spent 200 hours playing the game haha. I hope they do another Xeno game with the blade mechanic. God that first playthrough was *so* much fun.
        Man, XC2 just looks so damn ugly, it's really hindering my experience.
What is XC2 for xcom?
    Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I can’t recommend it enough, it’s a very unique game and the semi open-world rivals that of BotW. The developers of BotW actually had help from the XC2 team when developing the environments.
XB1 combat is much better and way less bloated
They mean!
Mega Muk
For a brief second at the beginning of PLA, when looking up at the starters, the professor asks if we're okay, and it felt like the beginning of a PMD game because it looked like the starters were asking.
I wish I could release
I wish but Nintendo would eat me =(
    just accidentally leak it
    F
        I know lol 😆
    Surely you'd just get a cease and desist? Which if you've already made the video, wouldn't matter, and then it'd be out in the wild and out of reach for Nintendos lawyers (like pokemon uranium)
    >!vore?!<
I wish but I can't release =(
    it would be a shame if it leaked onto a rom site!
    Can't you just open source it somewhere and once it's out there is nothing they can do really lol!
    Not even as a patch?
        Patch of what? This isn’t a mod
            Shid my bad. I thought it was a PLA hack.
They chilling hard
Muk =)
    Kum =)
Oh yeah internet confirmed would bandwidth overload and explode for sure
As if Gamefreak would put in any level of effort into making something like this
Oh yeah, my brother tried that. Didn't end well 🤣
;)
Eventually I will post one of these videos and replace, and have a game link that replaces the characters and models. But I need a little more practice first!
I want too :(
It's the secret final boss I made ;)
And it has Mega Muk =D
Muk
yes =)
Hahaha 😂
Yep! I wanted this for a while so I made it myself :)
I wish I could give :(
That's basically how I made the arceus fight 😂
Thank you :)
Shhhhhh
Thank you :)
And this version has a secret final boss 😁
    :O Whose the secret final boss?
        Secret final boss in the full video =D
Thank you =)
Yes especially Mega Muk, pokemon needs Mega Muk
They look very funny hahaha, but Palkia and Dialga are too cool not to include in this =)
Playing as Pokemon was fun!
Yeah its graphics are just as good
Took much work on Gamefreak’s part so we’ll never get anything like that
So he's gunna fight a Bidoof?
A little bit! but different camera angle
I wish I could release =(
Nintendo hire this man!
And it has Mega Muk =)
=) my game is a bit janky though with the controls / colliders lol
    So you just need more time and maybe a bit more money. Proportionally, you’re doing what a billion dollar company couldn’t be bothered to do.
        If TPC wanted to do this they probably could
I wish I could =(
Unity :)
Oh don't worry Pokémon mmo video coming on the horizon 😁
That's why I made this! 😁
    Easy now. Sure fire way to get nintendo on your ass. Especially if you end up on kotaku.
    Where can I play it
    Idk what kind of genius you are. But you are insane mate with your Megamind brain and coding.
        And my Mega Muk
    It's better than any pokemon game I've ever seen!
        Any fan made game, sure.
            What Pokémon game has been good since red or blue?
                Gold and silver.
                    Ruby and Sapphire
                        Pokemon colosseum
                            This is a correct answer
                            Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness
                        Diamond and Pearl
                90% of them
                Basically all of them.
                all of them
                How could you say something so controversial yet so brave?
    But now the question is, can you catch pokemon as the pokemon? Like giving your pet a pet.
        Pokeception
    I'd also like to play this....
    Where can i play this
    How can I download this?
I've always thought a pokemon game in the style of Okami would be great! You could have an arena that opens up when a Pokemon gets sent out and you control the mon, the four face buttons act as your four moves, and you can run and dodge at will
    Exactly! It'd be so fun!
There was a PC MMO that did this, although its pretty barren and dead.
    Can’t believe y’all sleeping on PokePark
    It was years ago wasn’t it, I recall it, sadly they didn’t progress the game further than the starting point but the concept was good
    Is that TemTem? That looked pretty cool (although I never did play it)
        TemTem was basically just a pokemon MMO game, gameplay was almost exactly like pokemon but you could play co op with a friend, really great game you should check it out if you happen to be a pokemon fan girl or anything like that
Closest we ever got is PMD and Pokken
Like normal pokemon game, but when you send out its pokken tournament
    Thats what I was gonna say.
i would love a game like legends arceus but the combat is a real-time arena fighter, like pokken tournament (i’d prefer if it was like naruto ninja storm or demon slayer hinokami chronicles but pokken tournament is more likely, if you could consider any of them likely at all)
Or something like the FF7 remake combat would be perfect
Now imagine Pokémon like Cubone parry and dodge like  a Souls game.
This! Ultimate game would be PLA + Pokken Battling.
You send out your pokemon and then it just turns into an entire musou warriors game
so, pokemon warriors?
Same but with breeding as well
There’s an official game like that Can’t remember what it’s called (not super smash bros) but it was kinda like tekken but with just Pokémon I was going to get it then found out it wasn’t all that great because it was missing the core of why we love the games the rpg/strategy type side to it but if they could make a game that polished up PLA graphics and frame rate issues and obviously go back to gyms and battling but have that games battle mechanics( I don’t even know if it played well just looks cool and adds more skill)
I’ll raise you one.

Take super smash bros combat (up down left right + standard attack/power attack) and control the Pokémon. Just like squirtle, ivysaur, and Charizard. 

Most of the same types of Pokémon (bird for example) can have the same move type/animations (all bird Pokémon can use gust, and they all use it the same way) to keep from getting too crazy complicated.

It would be fucking awesome.
Yup, backed it, looks cool
I shall now start following this
Ayo! I’m a big supporter of that game. My friend is the cousin of one of the main people working on it.
I really, really hope it goes well, but I'm waiting until it's released before I drop any money. I've been burned one too many times on Kickstarter by over-promising devs that under-deliver, if they deliver a game at all.
Thanks for shouting this out, definitely gonna be looking forward to the release!
yeah that won't go well at all the instant Nintendo detects something pokemonesque in it
    I looked into it a bit so much of the stuff is just ripped from pokemon. At one point in the trailer they show the ui and its like identical even having the base stats ev iv system. They also claim they will have a release option for switch which I think will be interesting to see.
        Creature collectors are a genre dude, it's not just pokemon. Having similar ui and an IV/EV system is no grounds for "copying" let alone a lawsuit. The pre-legends arceus open world elements plus action RPG combat set it very far apart, and it doesn't even need it. Look at Temtem, a turn-based four-move double-battle creature collector with EVs/IVs and is on switch, and is very far removed from pokemon in its own way. I wish more people would understand the difference between ripping off and being in the same genre.
        TemTem is a game that's pretty blatant with it's Pokemon inspiration but it's doing fine legally. I'm sure Nintendo can't do anything about Kindred Fates even if they wanted to.
> Tasks us with collecting the DNA of all 149 pokemon

*Very poor choice of words*
    Oh God no
        Arceus can't save you or your flair now
        Flair checks out.
        Easy Mode, go live in a daycare! :D
            Gonna catch pokerus if you go with that strategy
                Since I don't see any ill effects of catching it, sure, why not?

[Gotta Catch em all!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7lEZBxu3zo&t=2s) :D
        Well, the Player Character would be a Ditto sooo.........
        Well, if the main character of this is a ditto.. then the choice of words is pretty on brand.
    So... Basically you go to the pokemon daycare and go to work while other trainers come to have eggs.
    There is a section  of the internet very interested in this.
        Insert Vaporeon copypasta here.
    I'm glad I wasn't the only one thinking this
    The game starts with the researchers placing you in a daycare…
    Did you know that vaporeon is the easiest to collect?
    Very great choice of words…
    *Ditto exhaustedly unwraps the eighth lipstick of the day*
Will I make this!? Probably 😁
Good idea!
Imagine a Pokemon Legend Clefairy
You play an alternative Bill in kanto as he is changed in a Clefairy on a quest to regain human form.
    No, don't share your ideas! They'll turn it into porn!
> Is it bad? Probably. Are pokemon plots ever good? Not really.

Heyyy, I liked B/W and I'll die on this hill goddammit!
    Yeah, BWB2W2 had decent story and story progression

But generally, if someone plays games for the story, I wouldn't recommend them Pokémon 🙃
Id play
Main character gonna be busy at the day care center getting that DNA.
Reminds me of cuboids.
Ditto being a failed experiment from mew/mewtwo has been debunked so many times that I'm sick of the lore around it.
    When?
        Many times, and this video explains why

https://youtu.be/MuvGD5tC69o

The video even shows where the devs and artists did not even have that as a conclusive reason

While it's a fun idea, it is incorrect

Ditto wouldn't exist in so many places if it were true, plus, ditto existing in legends: arceus is further proof that it is just another pokemon.
Either the gameplay would be incredibly shallow and/or fundamentally broken, or that game would have an insanely small number of Pokemon

Incredibly obvious why this isn't on the table
    "Incredibly obvious" is just because its gamefreak...
    I'd say 30 pokemon would be enough.
        yeah i agree tbh

doubt it'd do good financially tho
Field phase but expanded to a full gamr
Do you remember the name? I remember finding game similar almost 8 years ago on the internet but I could never find it again
    I believe the game is Pokemon Reloaded, still in development, but the beta is playable.
    Tried finding traces of my contact with the developers, but no luck. But I do know the name has changed a few times. 

Looks a lot like "pokemon mmo 3d", but now there's also an unreal version of it. Good graphics, but pokemon animations are a little lacking.
Nintendo has nuked so many “play as the Pokémon in real time” fan games. It’s depressing that they don’t just do it right themselves.
Damn i remember the beta, pretty cool to play as a pidgey and growlith.
I feel like Pokken was fun enough but free 3D movement without a locked camera would be better. Also I wouldn't want to go to an "arena" screen, having fights occur in the overworld with no transition screen is the future of Pokemon IMO.
Relatable.
:(
*Untitled Karp Game*
Especially walk
Palkia walking around like he got a big ol dumper
>!i caught Palkia when i first interacted with him, so when the Pearl leader says shes 'talking to Palkia' after the fight it made me so unreasonably mad. My only train of thought was 'you're such a pick-me girl that you think my Palkia is talking to you ?' Girl. No. My Palkia.!<
    Look at it this way: this is literally their god who they referred to as a deity, and whose name now bears the current region name. I would shake hands with Jesus even if he’s walking around with a criminal tbh
I was gonna say Mystery Dungeon, but yes, absolutely brand this as Pokepark 4 lmao

    **Poképark 4: The Search for Poképark 3**
Thank you :) yeah I had to update mine because Nintendo released theirs anyway 😂
    XD

Np!

You're a great programmer! Keep it up, man! :D
    I remember your post before! As a newbie programmer I am in awe at the sheer speed you were able to put something so epic together like this.
Really makes gamefreak look lazy. They are!
Glad you enjoyed them and they motivated you! 😁

Oh and Muk
You know what Muk spelled backwards is…
    What your mom was gargling last night?
        Dirt? because she’s buried in it…?
    Yeah, snake.
    M-u-k s-p-e-l-l-e-d b-a-c-k-w-a-r-d-s.
The first time I played XC2 my immediate thought was “wow this would make an awesome Pokémon game”. Then I got sucked into XC2 and spent 200 hours playing the game haha. I hope they do another Xeno game with the blade mechanic. God that first playthrough was *so* much fun.
    Man, XC2 just looks so damn ugly, it's really hindering my experience.
Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I can’t recommend it enough, it’s a very unique game and the semi open-world rivals that of BotW. The developers of BotW actually had help from the XC2 team when developing the environments.
just accidentally leak it
F
    I know lol 😆
Surely you'd just get a cease and desist? Which if you've already made the video, wouldn't matter, and then it'd be out in the wild and out of reach for Nintendos lawyers (like pokemon uranium)
>!vore?!<
it would be a shame if it leaked onto a rom site!
Can't you just open source it somewhere and once it's out there is nothing they can do really lol!
Not even as a patch?
    Patch of what? This isn’t a mod
        Shid my bad. I thought it was a PLA hack.
Kum =)
:O Whose the secret final boss?
    Secret final boss in the full video =D
So you just need more time and maybe a bit more money. Proportionally, you’re doing what a billion dollar company couldn’t be bothered to do.
    If TPC wanted to do this they probably could
Easy now. Sure fire way to get nintendo on your ass. Especially if you end up on kotaku.
Where can I play it
Idk what kind of genius you are. But you are insane mate with your Megamind brain and coding.
