[[Pokemon Arceus is one of the best pokemon games and I'm tired of pretending it's not]]


Arceus is such an underrated amazing game that does not get the credit it deserves. It is amazing, it Is like a zelda mixed with BOTW TURNED INTO A POKEMON GAME. The graphics are unique(in a good way, the game pushes away from the endless dialogue and skips to the pokemon. You feel as if your a real trainer and not just some random guy that has an already storyline set out for you. This pokemon game completely reinvented the catching system and replaced it with something 10x better. If it wasn't for Scarlet and violet coming out mere months later it could of been getting a dlc and more stuff added to it. But that Is the problem it acts as a place holder for scarlet and violet. If they  announced S/V like 2 months later it would have gotten more sales and probably more effort put into it, to some it all up game freak are idiots who don't care about the community and only care for money. I hope this all makes sense.


Wym pretend? PLA got praise from everyone. It's a popular opinion to like it.
    This post screams unpopular opinion: popular opinion
        The only entity who would probably think PLA isn’t popular is Nintendo/GF, because it didn’t sell as well as any other Pokémon game and ignores the fact it *can’t* sell as well because it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos.
            I mean it has sold 14 million units and it's only a single game (like you pointed out). Pretty sure the Pokemon Company (Nintendo, Gamefreak, Creatures) would all admit its incredibly popular. It still has the potential to beat the lifetime sales of a lot of Pokemon games.
                which means its technically the highest selling pokemon game.
            Sun & Moon only sold 16m, X & Y sold 16.5m, black & white 15.6m, diamond & pearl sold 14.5m, PLA sold 14.6m


So it seems to be right on par with a mainline game.
            So many people buy both copies. It's kinda insane, especially now when there is online trading that makes it way more feasible to get them all without the purchase of two.
                It is so crazy to me that people throw their money away like that.
                    Unless you have 2 kids and you're getting each of them their own Pokémon game. But as a purchase for yourself, yeah... it's confusing.
            >it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos

Does that actually make a difference to sales? It must be a tiny minority of people who actually buy both games in a pair.
                It's popular enough for them to make double packs of both games.
        That’s like a good chunk of the sub’s MO. Complaining about how unpopular their opinion is and conveniently ignoring the many comments/threads echoing the same thing. Sometimes it’s even the most popular opinion but they still act like their opinion is unpopular.
    Yeah everyone likes that game and talks about it constantly
        Legends Arceus, underrated gem?
            [deleted]
                B/W2 sold almost as badly. Was an "underrated gem" for a while, at least.
                    [deleted]
                        If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
                            To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
                                That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                                    Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                                    Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                                    I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.

                                I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                                    I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
                            I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
                                The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                                    At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                                    I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
                                Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
                                Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                                    Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                                    I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                                    Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
                            ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
                        That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
                            I'll be back in 10 years

                            Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
                            >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
                        midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
                    Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
                    I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
                If you release a game, eventually, somebody will call it an "underrated gem." It's a law.
            There's this little known gem called Red Dead Redemption 2 that I personally enjoy. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.
            Reminds me of my favourite hidden gem the witcher 3
                There's this lesser known sci-fi movie, you probably haven't heard of it, but I think Star Wars might just take off.
                hey guys have you heard of HeartGold and SoulSilver? I think they're the hidden gems of the Pokémon series.
                I just laughed so hard I had to turn off my music. Oh, what was I listening to? You probably never heard of it - some band called The Beatles.
                Geraldo???
            The last of us, underrated gem?
            r/tomorrow moment
    Yeah, in fact the biggest problem with the game is people wanted more. More graphics more story more depth etc.

        Very rarely, even in threads where people ask you to post unpopular opinions, are actual unpopular opinions posted when someone says they have an unpopular opinion.
            Unpopular opinion: good things are better than bad things
                Why would you even say that?!
                That's disgusting, take that back immediately.
                Those are fighting words, sonny. Best get to stepping now
            Oh they’re posted, they’re just downvoted to oblivion
        [removed]
            #are we yelling?!
                ###YES!
    exactly. so tired of this meme. its especially overused in this sub.
        #i agree with that !
    Yeahhh…I’m relatively confused by this post. Who in the hell ever told OP that Legends Arceus WASN’T a good game? OP is making it seem like this is a controversial opinion that somebody would disagree with.  🤨
    Exactly, downvote this OP.
        it's at 66% upvoted rn lol
            Wait, where do you see the ratios?
    I honestly only ever see Poke fans shitting on whatever is current, they'll all pretend to have been fans the whole time when public opinion changes.
    Exactly
    A lot of people absolutely hated the graphics when it came out and I am pretty sure a lot still hate it.
        I made [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s9culs/pokemon_2022_vs_oblivion_2006/) post about the game's graphics and even I think that asides from the graphics, the game is amazing.
    Idk here lately I've been seeing a bunch of "was it as good as we first thought" shit and people bashing it. I assume OP is in the same boat.
    Didn't it get a lot of shit in /r/gaming for the environments looking low effort and outdated for a new title?
        I imagine that was mostly from people who aren't fans of Pokemon exaggerating the issue. Graphics are overrated.
    There was a lot of continuation of Dexit, complaining about every game since SwSh not having the full dex.

Plus, a bunch of complaints about graphics (which I never understood, as it looked to me as the second most beautiful Pokémon game after the new Snap).

But... to agree, after SV came out, it was readily apparent that PLA was one of the best games with a capturing mechanic in the entire franchise.
    The *worst* I've heard people say about it is that it's good but could use some polish, which isn't saying it's bad just that certain parts could use work, which I honestly agree to.
    i didn't even play it yet but i still respect what it did and is doing pushing Pokemon forward. the game has been near universally praised from pokemon fans as a breath of fresh air for very good reason.
    I mean you say that, but I've seen plenty of people on this sub shit talking about how everyone only PRETENDS to like it and how it's a deeply flawed game.
    A lot of people, particularly outside the pokemon community, judge the game solely on its graphics.
    Good game but I didn’t like it that much tbh. Just didn’t feel like the Pokémon I grew up with and thats completely on me. Nostalgia and whatnot.
    >Arceus is such an underrated amazing game that does not get the credit it deserves.

Probably half the fandom (the largest fandom ever btw) agrees its the best one since the gameboy games, or at least the BW games. What is this man talking about?
        The gameboy games really aren't that good compared to newer gens, but I agree it's weird
    The title of this post screams "I live a performative life full of tepid takes."
    it is? I got mine super cheap because it was a used game and the employee told me it was unpopular so a lot of people returned it quickly
OP is acting like it’s some brave and controversial stance that Arceus was a good game lol.
    Starts an explaining for a very popular game "unpopular opinion, it is a good game" 

wait for all the free karma lol
        Why I left /r/gaming
            why i left every videogame-related sub
                Um...
                    Should we tell 'em?
    Yet it somehow made it to the top with all this traction lol
        Well people love to upvote their own opinion. Even if the post is low effort or pointless.
        This happens frequently on "unpopular opinion" subs
    Didn’t it get nominated for best switch game of the year?
    He's out here with the hidden indie gems
Buddy, why are you having a soapbox moment for a game that was very well received by most of the fans? Is your next post going to be about how “Mario Odyssey was a great game and an underrated cult classic!!”?
    Tbf OP is claiming things like "It's got great visuals."
        I'm maybe going to be shunned for this but Arceus doesn't look as good as it should. In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin but it's nowhere near what the switch is capable of. When it first came out I was disappointed with the graphics but as soon as I started playing it I fell in love and now that I've finished sandpapering my eyes while playing SV I'm not entirely sure why I was bitching in the first place. There were some other issues but overall it's easily my favorite pokemon game ever.
            Let's go pikachu/eevee has the best looking graphics of any 3d pokémon game
                Agree big time - such a gorgeous game! And some of Sw/Sh was beautiful
                Hmm, I'm conflicted. That game looked like the GameCube turned the saturation way up. It wasn't good graphics by any stretch of the imagination but also you're absolutely right that it was the most "pokemon" looking pokemon game.
                    I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
            I have never met anybody wholly satisfied with a 3D Pokémon game’s graphics, rightfully so. I don’t think you’ll be shunned
            [deleted]
                Exactly, I swear pokemon fans must be drinking some premium kool-aid bc pokemon Arceus looks like playstation 2 era, hot garbage. I loved the game.but damn I kept thinking how shitty all the textures looked. And I'm not even a guy who usually gives a shit about graphics or fps.
                    We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
                    It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
            > In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin

Nah, that belongs to LGPE.
                Somebody else said the same. I don't know if I agree. It was definitely the best before a drastic shift and I understand why people would say that but IMO the look of PLA or other fully 3d games.(SV, SW/SH wild area) is not detracting from what I wanted.
            Arceus was great, especially in light of SV (I thought SV was good, but had issues holding it back from being truly great). The main thing that dropped it below others for me was the reduced focus on battling and multiplayer interaction, though I at least appreciate their experimenting with new battle mechanics even if I felt like it still needed more polish (and the Pokedex grind was unbearable, should've lowered or changed a lot of the requirements needed for full completion).
                The number one thing that the Pokedex needs is hints. Saying "this little guy likes to walk around" or "it behaves different depending on if it is night or day" would be amazing. The fact that it's impossible to evolve some without luck or Google is insane.
                    That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
                    Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
                        I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
            > im going to be shunned for this

> says extremely popular opinion

arceus is fun but it looks worse than mario sunshine
            Bro the NPC look dead inside, the ouses face the same direction and the textures are copy pasted.
            No, I love that game. But it barely looks better than most Ps2 games. It’s not a stylistic choice, this is clearly just what Gamefreak is capable of doing with the limited amount time and resources they’re given.
        It weirdly has a mix of really great and just awful visuals haha I guess it just depends on what sticks out the most to people
        It kind of does depending on what you mean. The environments are very pretty. The rendering, textures, etc., less so.
    Guys, Mario 3D World might just be a good game. I know, brave for saying it, right?
    To be fair….this entire sub exploded when the game came out and everyone hated it.
        Except they didn’t. I was here, I remember.
            For the first month the entire sub was about “duck Thai shitty game with its shitty graphics and it’s shitty animations that they said were better and weren’t”
                that was sword and shield. legends arceus was mostly well received
    Yes it will be
        Alright I have to say it.

Water is an amazing beverage and everyone should be drinking it. I'm tired of pretending that water isn't as good as it is
Daring today, arent we?
    Next he’s gonna tell us Breaking Bad was a good TV show.
Underrated?  What are you talking about the game is literally loved by the fandom
    It's probably the most highly praised pokemon game in the last decade lol
> Arceus is such an underrated amazing game that does not get the credit it deserves.

[Pokemon Legends Arceus was a nominee for best RPG of 2022 at Game Awards.](https://thegameawards.com/nominees/best-role-playing)
What an obnoxious way of praising a game.
    And dumbest way of trying to farm karma, bc ain't no way OP somehow didn't know how well praised PLA is compared to BDSP and SV all over this subreddit, YouTube, literally any other social media app. They gotta be either trolling or karma farming atp.
    "It's like Zelda mixed with BOTW"

Whut
Underrated? All I hear is how good it is.
    The one thing I will concede is that the first 3 weeks after release was nonstop posts about how shit the graphics looked and how therefore the game was a failure. 

Since then the opinion has flipped, because it turns out HD graphics aren't all that important in a Pokemon game, whereas fun gameplay is. Which is also why the opinion on S/V has flipped as well.
        >  nonstop posts about how shit the graphics looked and how therefore the game was a failure.

From what I remember, people complained about the graphics and others just _assumed_ that they hated the game. When PLA came out there was A LOT of justified criticism of the game being made here but half the sub didn't want to hear anything about it so if you gave even the mildest critique about PLA you were A. Actively trying to destroy the game, B. Hate Pokemon, or C. Think the game was a complete failure.

In no world on r/pokemon were you allowed to say anything negative about PLA while also enjoying it. Nuance is dead and you can only hate or love everything.

I can see that still seems to be going on...
            [deleted]
                I think the flying while asleep is more for gameplay clarity. If a flying pokemon lays on the ground, then that signals that ground moves should hit that pokemon. 
If they don't want to buff ground moves in that way, then I can't think of a way to have gameplay and animations match up.
        >because it turns out HD graphics aren't all that important in a ~~Pokemon~~ game, whereas fun gameplay is.

It's always been this way, it just takes some people a while to get it.
            I wish they'd just stylize already instead of just doing whatever it is they're trying to do.
        I’ve been on reddit for over a decade and this happens with just about every Pokémon game that comes out.
        When I hear PLA being talked about on other subreddits and other websites the opinions are quite varied.  I've heard everything from highly positive opinions to "the graphics sucked and then everyone immediately forgot about it".

My guess is that a lot of people on the periphery of the fandom formed their takeaway opinion while things were still in flux and only the core fandom wound up converging on the opinion you see here today.  We're probably going to see posts like this long into the future as fans keep brushing up against people who formed their opinion solely from the initial controversy.
        No one is saying good graphics are important, they're saying good aesthetics are, which they are and in that sense pokemon arceus looks like garbage.
        Till date there are people still shitting on SV for having shit graphics, going from LA to SV, I would say SV looks cleaner in terms of graphics and they love to cite that as if PLA wasn't shat on during release for its grainy graphics.

&#x200B;

This community strangely loves to hate on the new thing while propping up the old ones.

&#x200B;

Edit: If we are talking are framerate drops in both games, PLA has its fair share, the noble boss battles and time distortions absolute tank my framerates without fail.
            I mean, most people shit on SV because they have extremely buggy graphics, not so much because it's not ultra high quality. 

I also prefer gameplay to visuals and don't usually mind simple graphics, but playing SV was sometimes very annoying. For instance, you can rarely sit back and enjoy watching a battle because the camera is always super zoomed in and you don't have a clear view of what's happening. I remember battling and all I could see was Tinkaton's arms.
                SV has definitely made me prefer a dynamic camera over one I control. Especially since some moves in the past would change the camera angle to make them look more powerful.
            I don’t mind subpar graphics but the bugs and shitty, unstable framerate in SV is what annoys me.
                Remember the Cherrim bug? And right after it was fixed, the game broke Cresslia as well? I was unfortunate enough to encounter both bugs which rendered my save unplayable in terms of progressing the game until they patched it.

Lets not pretend PLA was this shining star of a game, for its ups there are downs as well.
                    I’m not disagreeing there considering I disliked PLA more than any other Pokémon game I played, and this is coming from someone who played Pokémon Channel as a kid.
            PLA looks awful especially when you go on the water.
    #me too
Why were you pretending it’s not?
    I think the thread's statement is more about as if someone would claim "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DX is the greatest pokemon game etc.".. Same goes for Pokemon Legends since it's not a real main series game. From that perspective its obvious that it's a controversial take, because a tryhard pokemon fan has a main series game as the favourite, no?
    Because it isn't?  


PLA is overrated, I will absolutely devil's advocate against OP here.
        >PLA is overrated

The metacritic score for PLA is only 2 points lower than kirby and the forgotten land. Kinda crazy since its nowhere near the same level of quality but it's pokemon so I can't be surprised.
        It's okay if you don't like it but to say it's overrated is just incorrect.
            Is it good? Absolutely. Is it the best pokemon game in years? Sure. Is it overrated? 100%.

If it weren't a pokemon-branded game and was a standalone franchise, it would be  7/10 game.

The only reason it gets excessive praise is because it is being compared to Gamefreak's gameplay which hasn't seen a major tune up in 25 years.
                It probably wouldn't have even been a 7/10 game if not for the pokémon branding
                    I'm basing it off the standard online video game review scale. If I gave it a 6 I'd be calling it a bad game. I don't think it's bad. It's just not amazing.

If I were basing off a more real stat like percentiles, I'd say it's probably close to 60-70th percentile (bottom 40%) when it comes to AAA games.
                        Yeah, true
                Is it really, though? The new catching system was novel and fun, but even that got old and bland pretty quickly because once you figure the system out it's just the same "distract them, throw heavy ball at the back" every time. some of the sidequests were interesting, but that's just pretty much it.

The combat was a significant downgrade and turned the game into even worse of a glasscannon spam than any title before it. The actual content of the game offers 10, maybe 15 hours of gameplay? The rest is nonsensical busywork like "catch this pokemon 25 times" or "use that move 30" times.

PLA had some cool ideas, the implementation of them was underbaked and the rest of the game was just the video game equivalent of static noise.

'Twas a full price spinoff that offers less content and gameplay than most 20 dollar indie pokemon clones, while also having lower production quality.
                    Agreed. Refreshing to see someone who shares a similar opinion to mine. The catching mechanic got old quickly and the combat was shit. You could easily one shot Pokémon 10+ levels higher than you. 

One of my gaming pet peeves is pointless filler that you’re forced to do and this game was absolutely filled to the brim with it.

I usually keep my games especially Pokémon unless I absolutely know for a fact I’ll 100% never play it again and Arceus is one of the ones I sold. It was such a slog I could never bring myself to play it again.
I mean, it's not very accurate to compare it to BotW at all, but I do agree that it's a pretty good game.
    Tbh, if anything I'd say it's more like Pokemon's take on Monster Hunter than it is BotW. I mean, with the campsites, a central hub area you keep going back to, the map unfolding as you explore, etc. really makes it feel more like Monster Hunter. Especially with the fights against the Pokemon lords.

And this is coming from someone who's playes all three mentioned games.
    That's true! BotW came out 5 years prior on a previous console and still looked better.

But I agree, PLA is a pretty good game.
        I... meant in terms of gameplay. One is an openworld game and the other is more like Monster Hunter in its progression.
    It looks and feels similar to BOTW to me--the art style, the sound direction, the setting, the mechanics even down to the way the character runs. I think it was very "heavily inspired" if you want to be charitable.
        That’s definitely fair but just in overall delivery, Legends is a good, fun game. BotW is like GOAT tier
Legends: Arceus isn’t underrated at all.
Doing that thing where we pretend a really popular thing actually isn't? Why? For internet points?

Or just so you can insult Game Freak for making two different games with two different sets of design goals that happen to over lap in a few ways and instead of eating the downvotes you might get from what you actually wanna say that you have to Trojan horse it behind pretend that what is arguably the most beloved game from the previous gen is underrated actually?
Y r u pretending? Everyone seemingly loves it.

I personally don't care for it though
    Yeah people who stan Arceus honestly confound me. It was a change up to the formula and a step in the right direction, but the graphics made it laughably bad and hard to experience any immersion at all, the characters were so terribly uninteresting and poorly designed, the dialogue was pretty bad. I think much like SV there’s a good game hidden in there but it was not given enough time and should have never been released in the state it was.
        > the characters were so terribly uninteresting and poorly designed, the dialogue was pretty bad.

Deadass if Volo wasn't Cynthia 2 nobody would care about him as a character, this I genuinely believe.
            He so has objectively the coolest boss fight in any pokemon game, i don't like pla that much but I'll give em that. Although the fight at the end of sv is a very close second.
                I'd def give it to SV's, yeah
                    Respectabele, Mr toby fox did fantastic work on that Ost and it's unlike anything we've seen in pokemon before. If the DLC is more area zero and less main city then we're in for a treat.
        fr the gameplay loop was fun but it felt like a boring grind once it was time to go unlock the next area. didn't help that like two areas you unlock actually look unique. once i hit the credits I was cheering becuase that meant I didn't have to play the game anymore. friend of mine absolutely adored the game for the reasons I didn't like it so it's really just an opinions thing.
        For real. I didn't care for Arceus once I got past the first area.

The map was somehow both empty and had too many pokemon ready to murder me
            Yeah there's not really any cool hidden areas in the game in fact i can only think of one "hidden" area and it's the underground ice area, just makes exploration is this "open world" game feel unrewarding.
                Exactly. I have over 200 hours in BOTW because exploring is so fun in it.
            I got my hat and put the game away lol
        incredibly repetitive gameplay too. got bored by second area
        you summed up my thoughts exactly. Fun in concept, but needed more time in the oven to feel like a fleshed out game. And a fun concept does not make it a good game in reality.
        That sort of window-dressing doesn't break a game for me, and it's a shame it did for you.
    Love this thread
    Your comment is great. Taking about how everyone loves it and then immediately talking about how you don’t like it. Then endless comments hating on it. A self defeating comment.
        I'm not "everyon" and I'm baffled to see there's others that don't worship it
If you like it why pretend you don’t?
    OP is a child probably
        I forgot that Redditors could be a child or teenagers.
            Look at the general tone of the post lol
            60% of redditors are either children or assholes 

Or both
Bro, it starts to get tiring because every few days people say how "underrated" it is and everyone agrees. Then it was not underrated my man, everyone praises the game. I see no negative comments about it.
    PLA Sucks, there you go
    Then clearly you're not looking
        If I have to look for the nefative comments specifically, then they are in the minority. I see praise about the game without even looking for it. It is simply in every pokemon forum.
            I didn't mean you weren't looking specifically for negative comments. I meant you weren't looking at all. There's negative comments on this thread alone, before and after you stated your opinion. You made a claim that you never read one and yet they're right there for you to see. You don't have to look specifically for them. That's what I mean by you're not looking. Because they're definitely there, including in this thread
They really should've just made Arceus the blueprint goin forward. I wouldn't have minded at all.
    I would have stopped playing Pokemon if mainline games became Arceus-like with the awful battle system. I think it's cool that they wanna try new things in side games, I even think it'd be cool to keep that same system for future Legends games and make it that series's style, but I'm glad they don't touch the mainline series.
        I loved the speed of battling.  SV is so freaking slow.
    Leaving all the fans of the battling to dry, are we?

You see, Arceus is a fantastic Pokemon catching game, though the other aspects of Pokemon are ignored somewhat, namely the battling. This isn't a jab at Legends Arceus, I think having a Pokemon game solely focused on a single aspect of the series is a great thing. It just means that the people who fundamentally didn't like Legends Arceus won't like the later games.

One big reason I like Pokemon is the multiplayer battling, so axing that would greatly hinder my enjoyment.
    disagree. it is a wonderful game, for sure, but the way they changed up the way taking turns in battling works fundamentally changes the game, and not for the better. it's still a great game to play casually but it destroys the way the game is played competitively.
        They should've kept frostbite and splinter status at least
            i'd be cool with that tbh
        Agreed, the new battle system was alright for a bit but had several points in the game that were frustrating and not enjoyable. If they made another legends game, I would love to have the main series battle style added in. Even better would be a VGC doubles focus
            The perfect game to me would be a cross between PLA and S/V
                Hear me out, keep the exploration and catching of PLA, and the combat of POKKEN
                    Pokemon is one of the very few competitive turn-based RPGs, and you wanna turn it into every fighting game ever?
                        Pokken is in no way "every fighting game ever"
                    Valid
                    YES
                    The ideal would be to combine the turn based strategy combat of Pokémon with the action fighting game combat of pokken for the perfect battle system 

How would it even work you may ask? I have no idea, that’s not my job.
            The battles work for a single player experience. Having turn order be an extra thing to play around with is really cool.
                agree, for a single player experience it's fine. not so for pvp. that doesn't diminish the quality of the game though. it's still an excellent game... but the mechanics of battling are not ideal.
                I somewhat disagree - it didn’t really feel fair at times because the opponent would send in a Pokémon and they’d immediately get two turns before you could even select an action sometimes. It just made everything a back-and-forth especially for the end-game battles. There’s one in particular I’m thinking of, I’m sure you know which it is if you’ve played far enough. Also, one of Ingo’s battles pits you against 3 Alphas and you legitimately have to wait 5-6 turns before you can even do anything sometimes. It just feels like you just have to sit there and watch your Pokémon die without any chance to save it.
                    I liked the unfairness. It made the victory feel earned more. And it fits with the theme of how brutal nature is in this game. Like, theres no mercy in this games world. 

If I lose a battle I just rearrange my pokemons order. Theres also the fact you can switch in for free that kinda counter balances the mutliple moves.

Also its so satisfying when your enemy tries to kill you with strong style only for you to revenhe kill them with a strong style of your own.
            If they want to do a turn based system they can’t have hidden mechanics that change the turn order with no way of you knowing. Turn based systems have been around for decades but game freak somehow made a worse version. Just have each turn act individually and have any speed effects apply next turn.
        I think they did that because of how the world viewed Pokemon at this point in time. Like your town is terrified of Pokemon at first, so I think the whole turn thing was added in later, when the Pokemon leagues started to form. At this point in Pokemon's timeline, it's everyone for themselves, so the turn order change works for the lore
        Plus, unlike OP, I didn't feel like a trainer when I played it. Catching pokemon was always much faster without battling, so I barely ever battled and had zero connection with my pokemon by the end of the game because I was always catching much stronger ones than my current party.
        I disagree with you but fair opinion
        I'd say it's for the better in making outspeeding less important, with Agile giving a chance to get a hit in.

Pokemon competitive balancing has always been a train wreck  anyway.
            Doesn't it make out-speeding more important? If your Pokemon is fast enough, they can get two or even three attacks in a row. The most annoying thing to me was when I would send out a Pokemon and it would get knocked out before I even got to select a move.
    I would have. Game wasn't at all what I want Pokemon to be; not even a little.
        That's totally valid. I loved PLA, but I can absolutely see how some people would dislike it. Different people like different aspects of pokemon games. The catching and collecting aspect is what I enjoy most, so PLA suits my playstyle really well. But if trainer battles are what you enjoy, it's severely lacking.
            Took the words right out of my mouth, yep yep.
        Exactly how I feel. I would just go play Zelda if I wanted that
    The reason it's not is that Arceus and S/V were developed concurrently. Maybe the next games will incorporate more good PLA stuff.
    It's a very great game and honestly, top of all pokemon games for me but it's not a traditional pokemon game. Yes, there needs to be more, but it's not mainline. It's formula, while basically mainline (catch, some battling) is so different, it would turn off a lot of people. They need more games like it (and they can be in "modern times.")

Arceus isn't mainline pokemon and that's ok.
        Arceus is mainline Pokémon though
        arceus is mainline
        It's literally a mainline game according to everyone at Game Freak though? I hope you know you aren't the person who decides what is and isn't mainline lol
    No way! Pokemon running out in wild and humans being the one sneaking upon them, fits the time period and setting of PLA. But in modern time I can't buy that. It takes out a lot of fun from stumbling upon a rare Pokemon and hunting for a specific one in an area.
    YES ARCEUS SUPREMACY.
        10000%. Best game they’ve made since Heartgold and Soulsilver. One of the only main series games that feels like an actual reimagining of Pokémon tailor made for a modern console, as opposed to a port of Gameboy-era mechanics and gameplay
    Yep, it sucks that we've been acclimated to being fed the same game every one or two years, every new one being less polished and less dense than the previous one. I still have a good time playing every new game, but fucking hell was Scarlet/Violet a shitfest, even if you disregard the performance issues, which are quite literally impossible to disregard.

Arceus wasn't polished enough, kinda wasn't dense enough, but it was something new, something interesting that reimagined old mechanics, built new things around the core idea of "explore different places to find new monsters to catch". I really wish the license would take a step back and really try to go even further in that direction and surprising us.
    I’d really be fine with a main series game in PLA style - and then just make a new Pokémon Stadium with VGC rules and online battling where they can be easily transferred
    no, keep PLA away from the main series games,
    SV really just needed to use the PLA overworld system, improve the graphics slightly and throw the traditional battle system back in.
Can’t believe someone was brave enough to say it.

Every time I look up opinions on PLA, it’s just constantly talking about how everything about it sucks. But then OP came, and caused a revolution with this post. No more will people say that the Hisuian forms all suck, or that the catching is boring, or that the final boss is too easy!

Thank you, O Brave One!
You're acting as if this is some sort of a hot take, when all I hear people do is sing the game's unending praises.

You want some **ACTUAL hot takes?**

You mean an ACTUAL unpopular opinion that will actually make people mad? 

Legends: Arceus is PAINFULLY overrated.

Legends: Arceus' gameplay is deeply unbalanced. The catching mechanics are unique, but deeply flawed. Almost all pokémon can be caught in one or two ultra balls, without even battling them, if you use a berry. It's cool that there's so many unique items, but so many of them are useless. There's barely any battles between actual people, even though it would have been amazing to battle more immigrant trainers. The speed of the ride Pokémon made it far too easy to avoid conflict with actual wild threats. So far as the story goes, God literally Isekais you into the past, with a phone made in his image. That's just goofy. of the landscape design is good for exploratio, but in an Ironic, cruel twist, almost almost all of the iconic landmarks of sinnoh are reduced to tiny, linear paths, or just tiny caves and chambers.

The only details that I actually miss from the game are: 

1: the legitimately detailed, immersive sound design.

2: the more fast, streamlined battle animations

3: The unique artstyle, rather than SV's bad attempt at hyperrealism
    >Legends: Arceus is PAINFULLY overrated.

Pokémon in and of itself is painfully overrated. If took me quite some time to realize that. There's a hot take for you
I find it hard to agree with this because of how boring the progression is. I literally dropped the game after a couple story missions (like after Liligant) because I am not sitting there catching the same handful of mons over and over or hope they use a certain move etc. to level up my research. This game has the least engaging experience/progress grind in any game I've ever played, 'cause it's incredibly dull and boring but ALSO won't let you completely afk so you can't even really do it on the side *and* it's slow. It's like they scientifically engineered and distilled the worst possible way to design this.
    I feel like people were so blinded by the fact that it was “PoKeMon bUt BrEatH of tHe WiLD” that they didn’t notice how boring the actual gameplay loop is. I defy anyone who thinks this game is quality to replay it and tell me they’re not bored to tears with the “gameplay.”
        I preferred it actually, seemed better to be to be trying different kinds of battles and trying to catch different size variants to fill a page than literally just grinding and fainting pokemon repeatedly till I get the level I want

And when the page is complete you start seeing shinies
            I liked that mechanic of the game, but I wouldn’t call it a part of the core gameplay loop as you’re progressing through the story
                Nope, but I am more of a sidequest person and I happily just played around in the first area completing pages and lv100 pokemon would obey me long before I got to the heart of the story. That's why I liked it. I didn't need it to progress but I was rewarded for it anyway
        Comparing it to BOTW is really rude. BOTW is actually fun for hundreds of hours. Arceus only is for 20 max
        I totally disagree. I’ve gone back to PLA plenty of times to shiny hunt or grind out higher completion just because I enjoy that loop so much, but I’ve gone back to SV for reasons beyond a new update… maybe two or three times? At most? Even just reading this thread is making me want to boot it up, but I feel like there’s not even anything I could do in SV. Raids I guess? To get HMs for shiny hunts? But those are so laggy and slow… 

I’m not saying the game is flawless ofc, but all the issues I have with it apply to pretty much every other Pokémon game, so not really relevant to a comparison.

Also, the game isn’t really like BOTW at all. Never understood why people say that so much.
            If you shiny hunt you're not an average gamer and must have a lot of patience. You may enjoy the reward but I don't think the process can be called enjoyable. I completed the Pokedex because I'm a completionist, but I was kinda fed up with it near the end.
        People still struggle to accept Bore of the Walking was a bad game too. Good luck trying to get people to admit how repetitive PLA was.
            It’s weird cuz I thought botw was the most boring game I ever played. But I really like Pokémon legends lol
            You take that back
        played through it three times. Loved it more each time.
    You didn't get to the part where you have to actually afk for 40 minutes to 3 hours to get a time distortion to spawn so that you can fill the Pokedex and do the final battle.
    >hope they use a certain move

You could just use that pkm and its move. Thats the point, to get you to use and try out other pkm that you wouldn't otherwise have used.
Unpopular Opinion: *incredibly popular opinion*

2200 people upvoted this shit.
That's your opinion and it's fine. I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've like I still enjoy Sword and Shield more, but again, my opinion
Lotta good things going for the game. Love how catching Pokémon works and I also believe that is just how the Dex should always work. You capture multiple Pokémon to collect more data on the species which just makes so much sense for what a Pokédex is supposed to be: an encyclopedia to which you are contributing.

That being said… I’ve started the game twice and I can’t seem to maintain interest in it past the second area. As much as I like the game mechanically, it has pacing issues and doesn’t really incentivize progressing in a rewarding way. The rewards seem to just be more tasks rather than anything that feels meaningful to the player.
Disagree. True it's better than a few mainline games (low bar tbh with trash like X/Y and Sword/Shield existing), but I would disagree on "one of the best".

It gets repetitive after a while, I don't see the lack of story as a plus, the combat gimmick didn't do it for me (can even barely use it with the severe lack of trainers which btw is also a major negative), Exp. Share is still forced, shitty graphics in many areas, load times are too long, characters and dialogue were boring.

PLA was not that good and I'm tired of pretending it's not (I think that's the less popular opinion judging by the comments in this thread)
    It definitely could've benefitted with a bit more time in development (same goes for all Pokémon games as of recent) and a DLC as well. But alas that was never really going to happen as Scarlet and Violet came out in the same year. Which is a shame, because if they pushed Scarlet and Violet back (and worked on that too) we could've possibly of had a perfected Legends Arceus game, I mean we do live in a day and age of where games can be patched up with improvements. But as the last 3 mainline Pokémon games literally came out within the span of a year, it was quite clear it was going to get put aside whilst they focused on Scarlet and Violet.
    X/Y was bad? I take issue with that point.
ORAS was my favorite for years, probably because it was the first one I ever played, and I wasn’t expecting a modern Pokémon game to ever be better than ORAS, but arceus ended up becoming my new favorite, and one of my favorite games of all time in general
You must have been the only one pretending then
The people that say Arceus is like BoTW must not have played BoTW
I fully believe that once SV is done with there will be a heavier influence of Legends mechanics in the games, as well as Legends titles becoming more frequent. SV/PLA were in development roughly at the same time and I think GF were probably shocked by how much everyone loved PLA. 

There’s so much more storytelling they can do with this mechanic. IMO GF should turn HOME into a VGC stadium battle so that the Legends games can take over as single player main series games. (They will never do that lol but I can dream)
    So, to people that actually liked SV better, we're out of luck?

SV and Legends are gonna have to coexist, because a lot of people actually DID LIKE SV better. The open world was done better, the story was done better, and the idea of having multiple objectives in a game rather than just "lol complete the pokedex" was amazing.


Legends was fine. But I don't want it to be all that the main series offers. SV has its place, and is one of my favorite games. Legends is not. It's not a game that I will ever have the urge to boot up ever again once I was done with it.
        Same SV are one of my favorite pokemon game to date and I didn't even finish PLA it was very repetitive to me
    Well, numbers matter more to GF... and what game sold better again?
        What? That’s like saying every game will be chibi because BDSP did really well, sales wise. 

I’m not saying SV’s mechanics are bad, but they do seem to be wanting to shake up the formulas a lot more lately and having Legends be the *main* game of each generation may be the way to do that. 

SV sold really well, but the reception to them was less than favourable to the point where they had to address it. There is obviously going to be change to the way they do things behind the scenes going forward because that was a *lot* of backlash. Whether that change is good or not, but going with the mechanics and format of a game that sold very well and was acclaimed would be the smartest move. 

Of course this is all speculation, and whilst GF/Nintendo are number hungry, they also don’t want something like this happening again.
            I'm not saying they are completely number hungry, but they have a track record of not listening to feedback. We don't know what's in store for the future- but I'm not holding out that they would change anything without the sales numbers backing them up at this point.

We will have to see, but a lot of people will buy pokemon no matter the state it's in- that's simply the truth and GF knows that... After all, people still defend(ed) SV to this day. For the record, I think there will be more legends games- but we will have plenty more S/V or bdsp like games in the future. There will be no consistent changes to a strictly better formula.
            Idk if im in the minority on this one but I would be pretty dang happy if game freak decided to remake all the older games in the style of BD/SP

&#x200B;

I really like it a lot for pokemon.

Lol, whoopsie, I went against reddit sacred opinion. Forgot that y'all only want shit to look like BoTW
                I actually agree too, I wouldn't mind if they kept the art style of those games. My problems with those games were the fact they were just copy-pasted (arguably inferior too), but the art style was fine imo. Remakes of past hens with new content like ORAS would be lit.
        Ah yes, because they sold 2 rather than 1
            I feel like sales vs advertising spending is probably more important anyways. No idea which comes out ahead there
            Most people only buy one version of the games my dude.
    "There’s so much more storytelling they can do with this mechanic. IMO GF should turn HOME into a VGC stadium battle so that the Legends games can take over as single player main series games."       
     
Please stop 💀
        No?
            Yes?
                Either give a genuine response as to why I should “stop” or get lost.
                    Lol
                        incredible
Really no issue with you liking the game. Like whatever you want, but I don’t get how anyone could find the graphics appealing. It looks like they forgot to put shaders in with the lighting because all the shadows are just black. Genuinely Gary’s Mod has better lighting, and there are prettier games on the Wii.
    I love Arcaeus but the graphics are a downgrade compared to many games, even years old ports. I stick with it for the exploration and Pokemon, not the story or the graphics sadly.
    PLA got slammed for its graphics (and rightfully so) funny how it now looks amazing in comparison to SV though.
        I really don’t think that it does. Not to say that SV is some marvel of graphics or anything, but SV at least has lighting that isn’t just white light on flat colors.

Edit: this is also dismissing graphical glitches, of which the game has plenty. Assuming both games are running smooth I still think SV looks better.
A lot of mixed reception. It was the only Pokémon game I didn’t like. Just felt so lifeless.
    I could never go back to pla, it's just not really that fun at all. Great concept but as always poor execution, maybe a future legends game can actually be good who knows.
My favorite part was that i was now the predator in the tall grass.
Did you seriously just say zelda combined with botw?
Arcaeus is the first Pokemon game to make me feel motivated and invigorated to continue with the post game. Maybe I’m a casual but that’s okay.
“Tired of pretending it’s not” literally is constantly praised by the vast majority of Pokemon fans

Like???

You’re just karma farming at this point and it’s weird
Its overhyped...... the mechanics are REALLY bad in the game and the catch system is atrocious. 

Arceus was just a prototype to test out the better movement and control in S/V
    That’s your opinion and I respect it, but I also don’t believe you are 100% correct with that assumption. Yes, SOME mechanics in the game are not too polished. (Pokémon mounts are the biggest offender of this) Other mechanics like catching Pokémon have never been better. Instead of walking in grass, trying to find the Pokémon you want, opening your menu, and throwing a ball, catching is simplified to: find Pokémon, throw ball. And shiny hunting becomes very beginner friendly to those that want to try it, but don’t want to spend a good portion of their life finding a differently colored fictional animal due to the large amount of spawns everywhere around you. Unfortunately they removed overworld catching in S/V, however, they did speed up catching animations and raised crit catching rates to still keep a legends-like feel to catching Pokémon.
I feel like I like what it was trying to be more than it actually is. I love the concept of being in a past time and writing the first Pokedex by studying the Pokemon themselves and their environments. Thing is, the environments were so… barren. I live in a rainforest/mountain area and there’s a lot they could’ve done to make it seem less like a wasteland and more like a place you’d find critters. 
Also, that shader is hideous and it really jars me when I play it after something else… particularly Mystery Dungeon DX. It’s so unnecessarily harsh and it’s like that globally. A more refined lighting engine would’ve done wonders. 

I liked the catching system and didn’t mind the battling system, though it always seemed kinda skewed against the player in some ways. I haven’t finished the game mind you, but it’s odd to get almost destroyed by one Pokemon just to have them hit like a paper bag when you catch and use them. It is nice having that more or less seamless transition into it though. 

It felt more like a demo/proof of concept in some regards and honestly I wish another studio could take a crack at it.
Yeah I was really hoping with Scarlet and games going forward they would adapt the Safari Zone into a pokemon Arceus zone where you hide and throw balls and need to avoid being murdered by pokemon in the same was it works in Arceus just without battling.
"i like this game that everybody likes and im tired of pretending its bad"
I've never met anyone who didn't love Arceus so I'm kind of confused by what you mean.
    Well apart from today, I've met loads of people who hate on arceus and alot of other pokemon games because they drift away from the original style pokemon.
    Well apart from today, I've met loads of people who hate on arceus and alot of other pokemon games that drift away from the original style pokemon.
I think water is critical for the survival of the human race, and I’m tired of pretending that it’s not!
Such a cold take here. It was pretty well liked. 

Though I'll admit I still haven't finished it. Got bored with the story and the grind of finishing the dex.
It would be unpopular/wrong opinion if you said bdsp is the best game, but not the arceus.
My most quarrels with it are unreplayability, no battles, lack of challenge and repetitiveness. Like who the heck would like to catch 30 bibraels again just to progress in story, it was good game for what it was, but I wont touch it again.
Why were you pretending in the first place?
What's your next big unpopular opinion? The earth is round?
Karma farming 101: post a popular opinion as a 'hot take' and profit 

You suck dude
This game is not underrated, its fucking overrated. Glitchy graphics, terribly designed characters, vague and empty environment, repeatitive missions, silly storyline. The only positive thing is finally they did something new to gameplay, but new doesnt mean good, leaving aside “one of the best”
I'm glad you enjoyed it but I would drop Pokemon like it was hot if PLA became the standard coming forward. Hell, I don't want Breath of the Wild to be the blueprint for LoZ going forward, either--it was a fun game, but what they gained in gameplay they lost in writing, quite horrendously.  


Back on Pokemon, though--PLA is great if you're one such person who believes Pokemon is about capturing, as the original slogan would have people believe, but its battling system is pretty intentionally dumbed down from mainline. Put me to sleep. That isn't to say I don't think the mainline games could gain a ton from PLA! Don't get me twisted. Drowsy/Frostbite are a huge improvement over Sleep/Frozen, and Effort Levels are a way better mechanic than the EVs/IVs of standard.   


>You feel as if your a real trainer and not just some random guy that has an already storyline set out for you. 

Gamers try not to get upset about games having writing challenge (Impossible), I guess? No shade but this is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen anyone say about a game series, thank you for coming.  


Also I'm not sure what game PLA fans who say its graphics look good are looking at...game looks awful, lol. I'll take ScarVio's graphics over it any day, ignoring that SV runs like crap.
Now we need Legends: Celebi and Legends: Meloetta.
    gosh i'd be so down for a PL:M
    Legends meloetta when a pokemon who's ancient form is told to us about but never shown (kyurem) makes no sense man.
zelda is BOTW
I honestly feel like it might be overrated at this point, not underrated. I ended up dropping the game halfway through because the missions started getting repetitive, and the world felt barren and empty. I don’t think the same can be said about BOTW. Even in SV, despite the game being fundamentally broken, I genuinely feel compelled to explore the region and progress the story. Arceus definitely had more polish and ran far better, but it felt like it was lacking soul.
No, it's the best pokemon game.
fuckin crazy bro
Hope you didn’t burn yourself with that flaming hot take.
I don't like how PA played in some aspects but don't you think something like that would prevent me from playing and enjoying a revolutionary pokemon game.
Now you make me want a Zelda and BOTW crossover
Brother have you seen the amount of overwhelming love that game got? Literally one of the only Pokémon games that didn’t have the “low graphics” argument held against it because it was just that good of a game
It is not underrated lmao. People were blown out of the water by it, especially because it was so innovative from Gamefreak who plays it so safe they often regress.
I mean, this is not a hot take lol - at least, the part about PLA being a good Pokémon game isn’t.

The ‘hot take’ part of this post comes in when you’re saying the graphics are good, and when you’re saying PLA is like Pokémon’s BotW. The graphics are better than any other *Pokémon* game, but they pale in comparison to even Mario Odyssey’s graphics, let alone Breath of the Wild’s or MK8D’s. 

Also, PLA isn’t really like BotW. BotW was all about freedom; the ability to explore a vast, gorgeous world in any way and at any pace you chose to. PLA is about exploring small, kinda same-y areas with not much to do in them besides catching Pokémon. 

I feel like if they touched up the graphics, connected all the areas and massively fleshed out the battling (I understand that there’s a lore excuse for the lack of battling, but it’s easy enough to waive - just have a postgame where more people become comfortable with Pokémon and start assembling teams), PLA would easily take the cake as my favourite game in the series, and would probably rank up amongst my favourite games, period. As is, it still sits below BW2 for me.
    >BotW was all about freedom; the ability to explore a vast, gorgeous world in any way and at any pace you chose to

I feel like I'm the only person who thought this world was ugly, boring and filled with a bunch of nothing
ice cold take right here
>game freak are idiots who don't care about the community and only care for money. I hope this all makes sense.

Why should they care about the community when the community would just buy anything they put out? And how are they the idiots when they can put out shitty games and still sell millions? It seems to me the idiots are the customers. Yall continue to complain about gamefreak, but also continue to buy their games.
Who's saying it's not? Who's underrating it? Legends has been getting huge praise from what I've seen, and rightly so!
coldest take ever
Dude nobody pretends PLA sucks, what are you smoking?
“The game pushes away from the endless dialogue” lolll have you played it?
Great game but we can also admit that it was very lazy and lacking a lot.
Ok I agree this is one of the best, well made Pokémon games. But Jesus the dialogue and cutscenes are RELENTLESS. Like so so so much. I couldn’t do a second play through, I can only play cause I’ve beat it and can just do what I want😂 but yes it is FREAKING amazing
Underrated amazing game? If you criticize it (or any Pokémon game) you’re downvoted into oblivion lmao. 

It’s only really incredible if you aren’t aware of what other open world games on other platforms offer, as once you see what dev teams with half the size and resources of Gamefreak are capable of, you’ll wonder wtf is going on over there.
Everyone praises this game and it deserves the praise it gets for being different from the standard formula. It also sold fairly well. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it myself. But I must be a contrarian since I liked BDSP, games that everyone seemed to hate
Karma farmer. When the game released  this subreddit was filled with the same topic and everyone agreed
Yes I too love my speed stat not mattering, not being able to battle my friends and having to catch Starly 300+ times to unlock Arceus.
Breathing oxygen is essential to living as a human and I'm tired of pretending it's not
No one is pretending. Tbh I find it overrated, but I acknowledge that most people like it.
What do you mean under-rated???
No one's pretending wtf?
Cold take
I actually thought it was an experimental game where they would check how well-received some choices were, and boy did i like the catching mechanics. I'm actually disappointed that they didn't carry those over to S/V, since sneaking up on pokemon is a different skill in itself than just catching through battling.
Nobody is making you pretend it isn't one of the best Pokemon games, that's a pretty popular opinion.  


Easy clickbait though, huh?
Wtf you talking about? Arceus is well praised bro.
I find it interesting that so many posters came here to do one of two things (or hilariously both): 

1: Claim no one hates PLA.

2: Shit all over PLA, how it's overrated or just terrible for X reasons.

Having seen that, I agree with OP.
A lot of people really like PLA. Personally I think the game has tons of flaws but it was okay. I'd be down for more games like it as long as the main line games stay the same (well not the same but y'know, the same but better).
Huh? That game was well received and I’ve yet to see anyone disliking it
Legends arceus is fun for about 2 to 3 hours before you reach the point of "oh that's it?" And do nothing new for the rest of the game. Removal of abilities and moves makes teambuilding less fun and there's nothing to keep you busy once you've cleared post game because there's no real multiplayer support. Also the graphics aren't unique in a good way game just looks bad but that's to be expected from pokemon i guess.
Pokemon Arceus is one of the worst open-world games and I’m tired of pretending it’s not. 

Arceus is such an overrated dumpster-fire game that does not get the backlash it deserves. It is awful, it Is like an Assassins Creed mixed with ASSASSINS CREED ORIGINS in a Pokemon game. The graphics are unique(in a bad way, the game relentlessly  bombards you with endless dialogue until you can start catching the same pokemon 30 times. You feel as if you are some random guy that has an already storyline set out for you. This pokemon game completely reinvented the catching system and replaced it with something 10x better and asks you to catch 10x the amount of pokemon for no reason. If it wasn’t for Scarlet and violet getting rushed out mere months later it could of been a good game that wouldn’t have been rushed and lifeless. But that Is the problem it acts as a place holder for a good video game. If they  announced S/V like 2 years later it would have gotten more sales and probably more effort put into it, to sum it all up the Pokemon Company are idiots who don’t care about the community and only care for money. I hope this all makes sense.
It was universally loved both by critics and here. SV was such a massive disappointment to some people (not me personally) because they expected a lot of the Legends changes in that game.

I'm not sure what you have to "pretend" for. People were already requesting a Legends sequel in another region before SV came out.
Most of it was good except for battle mechanics. They were over-simplified and the whole fast/strong thing was weird.
If there wasn't so much talking, then I'd agree with you. But the sheer walls of text kill the game's replayability. Without that, what good is any game? You get maybe 60-120 hours out of it and that's it. Compare that to earlier pokemon games and Arceus just isn't as good. 

Don't get me wrong, I love it. There are so many improvements that it's unbelievable and I love all the mechanics. But the story has so much talking that I'd rather do literally anything except complete actual missions. I've fallen asleep several times while giving it a second playthrough
    Yeah, if anything, comparing it to BOTW does BOTW a disservice--PLA still has plenty of that hand-holdy dialogue, whereas BOTW barely has any that's mandatory.
    That was one of the big draws to me! I loved getting lost in the story and lore!
        The story was just an isekai. Like, if you played a Mystery Dungeon game...

It was the exact same story.
            PMD games usually have their own lore, not lore that spans over multiple games though.

And yes I made multiple comparisons to PMD during my playthrough.
        I'm really glad you enjoyed it and that many others seem to as well. For me personally though, once I've read the story once, I just wanna enjoy building new teams to play the game and enjoy the new mechanics
    I dont agree with the basis of this game not being replayable because of the dialogue. But even if I did agree with it having less replay value, thats a stupid thing to judge a ganes quality on. Like story games like last of us have low replay value cuz you can only experience the story for the first time once. But those arent bad games. 

Also, maybe just put more of a break between replaying the game.
    Pokemon fans not getting mad at the fact that RPGs have tons of dialogue challenge (impossible)
        Most RPGs don't have so much dialogue that it takes 30+ minutes several times throughout the game. It's a severe pacing issue.
PLA was good, but I still like sword and shield better :)
Every Pokémon game is good and always trying to improve in their own way. Except for the Sinnoh remakes.
    And Ultra, which went out of its way to get WORSE. At least BDSP was just the same thing as before.
        How was ultra worse? It had better story, better dex, better mc design and a whole extra mini story(trr)
            "Better story"? The story was GARBAGE next to SM. They weakened Lusamine so much she may as well have been a completely different person, and the entire story hinged on her, so everything else suffered as a result.
                Bruh atleast it was actually her this time and not just a puppet by some stupid hentai glass jellyfish from space
                    She was always herself. The jellyfish don't control people, you realize. She was still making her own decisions.
                        Aight, still ultra necrozma is cooler, and even if the story isnt better, the other stuff still stands.
                            Eh. A cool boss fight wasn't worth sacrificing depth of character. Even seeing my man Cyrus again wasn't enough for me.
Gonna play it next after violet
Underrated? Isn't this a popular opinion?
HUGE L
You can’t just stick the Joker’s “and I’m tired of pretending it’s not” meme onto any old opinion.

You enjoyed a game that was enjoyed by lots of other people and is generally well thought of. Accept that your opinion is not unusual or interesting.
You want a real hot take? I think Scarlet and Violet is way better.
I had all of Pokemon's main line titles on the switch and PLA was the only Pokemon game that I poured tons of hours.
I’ve never played it, but I feel like I need to with all the praise it gets.
    Do it. It’s worth it trust me. Just be warned, the paras are annoying as heck.
Isn't this common sentiment? Am I being bsmboozled?
counterpoint: it’s not and i’m tired of pretending it is
Your joking right? Arceus is possibly the most loved Pokémon game ever, and rightfully so
By far the best Pokémon game I’ve played
> it Is like a **zelda mixed with BOTW** TURNED INTO A POKEMON GAME. 

I'm so confused...

> **The graphics are unique(in a good way**

Well, they certainly are unique, sure.

What's with the victim complex? You don't need to hide the fact that you like PLA. Most people would probably agree with you...

> If it wasn't for Scarlet and violet coming out mere months later it could of been getting a dlc and more stuff added to it. But that Is the problem it acts as a place holder for scarlet and violet. If they announced S/V like 2 months later it would have gotten more sales and probably more effort put into it, to some it all up game freak are idiots who don't care about the community and only care for money. I hope this all makes sense.


jfc. This community is something else lmao
OP I'm not sure if people are gaslighting you or what because this subreddit and many others were shredding the game when it first released. I have no idea how people have changed their tune so much but yes, Arceus is a great game.
    Scarlet violet came out.
Not a hot take but yes
My only real complaint about Arceus was the story was too short. We should have seen more of ingo. More areas to explore. But again overall wonderful game.
Both is 1000 times prettier while being out 10 years before.

Arceus isn't a good AAA game.
Its great, in fact PLA is probably the only pokemon game on the switch I'd say is legitimately a good game, but its not underrated. I thought the general consensus on it was positive at the time of release, and that doesn't really seem to have changed all that much.
Not really underated considering that the community pretty much agrees that it's one of the best Pokemon experience's
Isn’t this the popular opinion
I just wish I hadn't gotten spoilers about you know who.
I do think it has a lot of rough edges, but they're rough edges that could be refined if the devs get more practice with the formula. The core conceit is solid, and I hope they add more stuff (like actually interacting with your pokemon when you let them out!!!) in future installments.

What really surprised me, playing S/V, was that it felt like S/V was the prototype for PLA, not the other way around. Despite both of them being "open world" and S/V technically being moreso, PLA felt so much deeper and more polished. I'm almost certain they were made by separate teams who maybe each started with the same early prototype engine.
Why would you have to pretend it's not?
BOTW without the immersive movement mechanics, interesting world design, and general freedom in regards to story progression. It's open world and has a light contrast in color, the only true similarities I personally see. The catching mechanics are interesting but the grinding required to complete Dex entries feels like a mobile game. The combat is intriguing but does not work for the already established ruleset of Pokemon; interesting ideas that break slightly in execution. Overall, it's the only pokemon game I was excited for and had to put down due to being underwhelmed. I'm not rejecting change, but the change has to be worth it.
It's Pokemon: Monster Hunter.
    But without the parts that make monster hunter fun (getting together with friends and hunting monsters)
        It has Bidoof and beanbags instead!

'whats your main?' 'I throw bags of Candy at Rathalos, it's probably just hangry, right?'
Why do you pretend that it's not? I don't understand. And it \*did\* get DLC.

What I hate is how people take all these needless shits on SV. You can talk up other games without these potshots. Good lord.
    >Why do you pretend that it's not?

Because it isn't. Overrated game.
It’s a way better game for DP fans than the actual remakes of those games.
    Honestly, not really. Aside from the other incredibly glaring flaws, the biggest issue with saying it's a good "remake" is the fact that Legends: Arceus reduces almost all of Sinnoh's iconic landmarks to linear paths or tiny caves and single chambers. The path to the summit of mt. Coronet is honestly insulting.
The catching mechanics were cool, but that's about as far as my praises for it go.
Is it really underrated? I thought it was really well received and that everyone found it very refreshing and fun.
I mean it was great, but I think it certainly isn't Pokémon. If that were the way the games would become going forward, it'd certainly make the games worse.

The game's art style and gameplay should remain to Legends games (and maybe remakes) only.
I had more fun finding and exploiting glitches. I found one where you can climb in some areas by holding a poke ball. 

I was shocked to see Ingo though. Emmett has got to be suffering without his twin. I can’t imagine the pain of not knowing what happened to your twin, nor where he is, or if he’s even alive. 

There’s also the possibility Ingo was Isakai’d by train to Hisui. If Emmett witnessed the accident… 

I was hoping to meet Emmett somewhere in Paldea. We still might with the DLC.
??? What you talkin bout? Literally every pokemon fan i have ever hear agrees that pla is the best pokemon game in years(personally inlike sv about the same)
Wished scarlet violet used the same graphics mechanics. Wished the devs for some reason would read this and take note. Wished someone gilded this. I donno. Where’s my jirachi…
Am I missing something? Have we not all been praising Legends for a year and a half?
Yep, it's what Pokémon should have been. It's one if my favorite gaming experiences.
I agree, legends arceus might be the most fun I've had in a Pokémon game ever.
Candy is good and I’m tired of pretending it’s not.
Wait did someone say it wasn't??? What happened where was I!?!?
I agree it’s one of the best Pokémon games mixing the monster hunter style open world with the charm of Pokémon really works
Lol no one disagrees with you my friend.
Right now it seems that Legends is in the same conversation as Platinum, Heart Gold, and gen 5 as the top tier of games, so I’m not sure there’s much pretending going on
It's poorly written, the open world feels lifeless and uninteresting, the new Pokemons are awful and the combat system is chaotic.

Surely it has some good ideas and it's far better than most of the recent games, but it's not a GOOD game, it's just mediocre, especially considering other games released on the same console in the same year
Still has a lot to be desired but its the most fun I've had in a while.  S/V was a step backwards.
Who the hell said it wasn't?
It’s hands down the best Pokémon in a very long time. However, that doesn’t make it a good game by modern standards
Literally no one is pretending it's a bad game. Who in the world have you been talking to?
The graphics are literal horseshit...
Finally someone said it. I never understood the lack of hype
It's way more fun that S/V
I have no idea why the entire is sub is hating you, everyone agreed legends arceus is “good”… nobody said it was one of the best Pokémon games, so I understand your point
I wish Scarlet and Violet had the same catching mechanics!
    It felt like the mechanic almost made it into the game, because in SV we can crouch, and you instantly get the same "hidden" mechanic activating when you do.
        But I can just throw a pokeball to catch a Pokémon. Took me a minute to catch a Pokémon is violet vs 10 second with one ball. Violet/scarlet just showed how much I don’t have time anymore to grind. Pla ruined shiny hunting in a good way. I can’t get past three house in scarlet, the plot is boring boring boring.
It's absolutely the best Pokemon game of the last decade.
Honestly the only pokemon game I will play going forward is one that is set up like PLA. I played scarlet and was hoping it would be more like PLA, but was sorely disappointed. (I wanted to play it blind hence not knowing ahead of time)
We need more legends games like with johto since it could reveal the pokemon that died in the tower before becoming the beast trio. Walking wake just doesn’t add up to it
    No shit? Do you not know what the word “paradox” means?
        But pats paradox forms are from prehistoric times. Walking wake is prehistoric but it seems like it shouldn’t have existed in that timeline in the first place. It would’ve have to go thru evolving it’s tails into ribbon like tails
            Mate, again, do you NOT know what the word “PARADOX” means?
                Mate, I GET WHAT IT MEANS. All I’m saying is that walking make makes no sense. It’s a prehistoric version of suicune in which it’s not possible since the pokemon who died in the tower are 3 different pokemon to say the least.
                    Mate, it’s doesn’t make sense BECAUSE ITS A PARADOX

You clearly don’t know what a Paradox is: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

IT

IS 

A

PARADOX

THATS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.
                        🙄🙄🙄
                            You post the emojis because you now learned what paradox means and why Walking Wake doesn’t make sense but still exists.

We also know these Pokémon are all imaginations made real.

LMAO
Easily the best new age game. Playing Violet after Arceus felt like a huge step back
[deleted]
    >The game really showed how little effort GF has to put into games and still get praise for their fans.

I thought this exact same thing
I played the first two generations of Pokemon when they came out and love them. Not sure why I never bought any of the other ones, probably just life getting in the way. 

Sword and shield brought me back into the Pokemon world and absolutely loved the games in my opinion the best Pokemon games ever made. Arceus veered off the path and I have absolutely no interest in that game. Everyone I know that bought Arceus said they regretted it. That put the nail in the coffin for me. 

I'm fine with them trying something new, but I have no interest if it doesn't stick to the original formula.
Wtf is that username dude?
It’s both one of the better Pokémon games and still not a very great game because the standard of quality for this series is abysmally low. Like, just to address some of the points made here:


>the graphics are unique


That’s a unique way to say that the game is ugly as sin. Repeated and low resolution textures, horrible lighting, pop-in everywhere you look, it’s just not a pretty game. 


>the game pushes away from the endless dialogue and skips to the Pokémon


The fuck it does. Sure, once you’re in one of the game’s explorable areas you can largely ignore the main objective and just wander around catching and battling, but once you’re ready to progress it’s the same slog of dialogue boxes and stilted animations. 


>you feel as if you’re a real trainer and not just some random guy that already has a storyline set for you


But, like, that’s literally the plot though. You get Isekai’d by God himself to complete a mission. I can support that the gameplay better makes you feel like a trainer, but in the context of the game you really are just some random guy with a destiny. 


>completely reinvented the catching system and replaced it with something 10x better


Agreed, but:


>if it wasn’t for Scarlet and Violet coming out mere months later it could’ve been getting DLC, more sales, and effort put into it


This assumes that there was ever long-term support for the game planned. Releasing S/V so soon after Legends without any major updates wasn’t some sudden development or mistake. It was always meant to be a side-game that’s just as rushed and undercooked as the main series games have been for the past several generations, and since y’all are largely so uncritical that’s what’ll keep happening.
Pokemon Arceus rekindled my love for Pokemon. Idk how but it did.
>I'm tired of pretending it's not

We are not friends anymore.
I hope this is a joke, haha.
The graphics of the people and Pokémon are good, nothing else looks good really. Items are different because those are just pngs, and hard to make them look bad. 

The story was pretty meh, not NEARLY as bad as Sword and Shield. 

The gameplay loop was good though, definitely the best part.

So it’s the best Pokémon game in a long time. Probably since ultra sun/ultra moon. But it’s really only carried by it’s gameplay loop.
It's very good and with some effort a sequal can be amazing.

Doubt we'll see that effort or a sequal
sunk-cost fallacy  
noun  
the phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more beneficial.
Legends Arceus was a breath of fresh fucking air. I hadn't played or had been interested in Pokémon since HG/SS but this game rekindled my love for the franchise. Yes, it wasn't perfect, but I adored it and it certainly was leagues and bounds better than Scarlet and Violet. There's not even a contest. 

All the changes it made to the gameplay were for the better and I hadn't had this much fun with a new Pokémon game since discovering Gold and Silver back in Gen II.

I'm way more interested in new Legends game than mainline game so I really hope this is not a one-time thing.
Okay but why the fuck is the world so empty looking? Where the trees at?
It is objectively the greatest and most authentic Pokemon experience out there. As far as games on the Switch go, PLA and LGPE are the two best overall experiences, PLA gives you a fantastic open world action RPG-style game, and LGPE checks all the boxes for those who want that old school/classic Pokemon experience filled with nostalgia.
it's defiantly much better than black/white and black 2/white 2 but that's not hard since they're the worst Pokémon games ever made
    Wow... that is a *scalding* hot take...
        Not really, I think he's just a straight up troll
        Well it was a cold take for about 7 years
        Well I’m not sorry for not liking a Pokémon game with terrible Pokémon designs, incredibly boring characters, boring story, way to many rival fights, and a terrible exp system
    Holy guacamole Batman, that is THE bad take of the day, and I’ve been on Reddit for a good amount today.
    *Dude.*

.....Sword/Shield was even worse than them.
        Sword snd shield wasn’t the greatest but at least it had some fun aspects to it unlike gen5
I'm am certain that nearly everyone saying "this is a popular opinion what do you mean" was also one of the people shitting on the game when it came out. I don't blame you for not realizing people's opinions have largely changed, because originally it was nothing but complaints for this game.

It is, however, foolish to call it a placeholder for S/V. PLA was never meant to be a main series game, it was a spin-off from the start, and was worked on by a separate team from the S/V team. Game Freak has been reusing concepts that sell more games since the beginning, they've always been profit driven, otherwise there wouldn't be a system in which you need to buy 2 games to 100% either of them.
I really like arceus If no one could tell
    Yeah congrats op, you're far from alone. That doesn't make it underrated
    You also seem to be living in your own world where apparently everyone is pretending it's a bad game..... Weird.
Totally agreed. Legends: Arceus is easily the best mainline game since at least B2W2, and is also the best Pokémon game on Switch, IMO. It’s a huge shame that it didn’t get 2022 to itself, and some additional DLC + updates. SV/Gen 9 had zero business being rushed out in 2022. SV never should have been released any earlier than Spring 2023 at the absolute earliest.
I really do hope that it wasnt just a flash in the pan, with as much praise as it got id be surprised if they didnt make more moving forward. Im hoping for a Legends Johto.
I know all pokemon games have a repetitive nature to them gameplay wise, but thats one thing keeping me from wanting to play PLA. Hearing about how you need to catch so many of a certain pokemon, and the back and forth from the main town is what turns me away. I haven’t watched much gameplay, nor read that many posts about it though. I may try it if i’m able to buy a used copy at a decent price. Having skipped PLA i personally view S&V as one of my favorite gens minus the performance of course. Gen3, Gen9, Gen 7 being my top 3.
I dont think anyone has said otherwise.
Why are you acting like everyone hates it? It's a loved and appreciated game throughout the community! I personally haven't played it but would lige to if I got the chance. I assume you just feel the need to have a special and unique opinion, if that's not the case, oh well, if it is, please stop.
They just need to take the base of that game build on. work with Sony and micro to release it on all consoles. giant world like elden ring, but for pokes like ark type. 1st/3rd person cross play, online offline session. I know I’m asking a lot but fans are being depraved
It's really good. Could have been the best if they finished it.
I see people give Arceus shit and I get so confused. It runs on the switch now, cmon cut it some slack.

But for real. When I got Sword I stopped playing halfway through. I was so bored! I got Violet for free through my work, but I haven’t played it once (waiting for performance packages or ANYTHING).  The DP remakes were strictly okay from a nostalgia sense.

Arceus though… I played it consistently all the way through, I beat it, didn’t 100% it, but it was the first time in a long time where I was like damn this was made with passion from somebody here. It introduced new forms which were fun, new mechanics, and it was just overall a fun experience.
 I don’t understand who you’re talking to. 

Everyone here loves it.
Game freak openly disrespecting their community ? :o
Also, you're the only one to say it's bad, pretending or not.
I wish it sold more copies..!
Why’re you all up in arms, most people agree that this is one of the better games and the only people who didn’t like it in the community were people who didn’t enjoy that type of gameplay and seemed very knowing that it’s a subjective take and not one that actually impacts the quality of the game.

The big complaints were about the lackluster graphics, like no one complained about the Pokémon models, because they were great, but people complained about the world graphics because they were very lackluster and could’ve been much improved on with the amount of income pokemon generates.
Best modern Pokémon game that's for sure, leagues better than SS and SV
Is Legends Arceus the new gen 5 now??
if you say so man
>	the game pushes away from the endless dialogue

I might be crazy here but that’s the exact opposite feeling I get from the game. I feel like whatever I’m doing I keep getting interrupted by some nonsense NPC with some crappy dialogue/cutscene. Might be wrong though since it’s been a while since I’ve played the game, which reminds me I’ve yet to finish it ( I was on the second or third zone I think ).

I got Violet on a sale and I’m hoping i like it better than Arceus.
PLA is the first Pokemon game for me that made catching Pokemon rewarding and fun.
It’s a good game with lots of new and neat mechanics, but the boss fights was terribly boring. Easy game to get into though but personally I prefer the classic kind of game with more battles and gym leaders.

This was the first Pokemon game my wife played since Pokemon Red version on gameboy, and now we are both playing Pokemon Violet together. 😊
This post screams unpopular opinion: popular opinion
    The only entity who would probably think PLA isn’t popular is Nintendo/GF, because it didn’t sell as well as any other Pokémon game and ignores the fact it *can’t* sell as well because it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos.
        I mean it has sold 14 million units and it's only a single game (like you pointed out). Pretty sure the Pokemon Company (Nintendo, Gamefreak, Creatures) would all admit its incredibly popular. It still has the potential to beat the lifetime sales of a lot of Pokemon games.
            which means its technically the highest selling pokemon game.
        Sun & Moon only sold 16m, X & Y sold 16.5m, black & white 15.6m, diamond & pearl sold 14.5m, PLA sold 14.6m


So it seems to be right on par with a mainline game.
        So many people buy both copies. It's kinda insane, especially now when there is online trading that makes it way more feasible to get them all without the purchase of two.
            It is so crazy to me that people throw their money away like that.
                Unless you have 2 kids and you're getting each of them their own Pokémon game. But as a purchase for yourself, yeah... it's confusing.
        >it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos

Does that actually make a difference to sales? It must be a tiny minority of people who actually buy both games in a pair.
            It's popular enough for them to make double packs of both games.
    That’s like a good chunk of the sub’s MO. Complaining about how unpopular their opinion is and conveniently ignoring the many comments/threads echoing the same thing. Sometimes it’s even the most popular opinion but they still act like their opinion is unpopular.
Yeah everyone likes that game and talks about it constantly
    Legends Arceus, underrated gem?
        [deleted]
            B/W2 sold almost as badly. Was an "underrated gem" for a while, at least.
                [deleted]
                    If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
                        To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
                            That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                                Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                                Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                                I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.
                        [deleted]
                            I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                                I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
                        I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
                            The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                                At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                                I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
                            Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
                            Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                                Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                                I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                                Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
                        ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
                    That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
                        I'll be back in 10 years

                        Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
                        >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
                    midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
                Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
                I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
            If you release a game, eventually, somebody will call it an "underrated gem." It's a law.
        There's this little known gem called Red Dead Redemption 2 that I personally enjoy. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.
        Reminds me of my favourite hidden gem the witcher 3
            There's this lesser known sci-fi movie, you probably haven't heard of it, but I think Star Wars might just take off.
            hey guys have you heard of HeartGold and SoulSilver? I think they're the hidden gems of the Pokémon series.
            I just laughed so hard I had to turn off my music. Oh, what was I listening to? You probably never heard of it - some band called The Beatles.
            Geraldo???
        The last of us, underrated gem?
        r/tomorrow moment
Yeah, in fact the biggest problem with the game is people wanted more. More graphics more story more depth etc.
"pokemon player stop pretending to be marginalized for liking games with a morbillion sales and tons of praise on the very forums you're complaining on" challenge

    Very rarely, even in threads where people ask you to post unpopular opinions, are actual unpopular opinions posted when someone says they have an unpopular opinion.
        Unpopular opinion: good things are better than bad things
            Why would you even say that?!
            That's disgusting, take that back immediately.
            Those are fighting words, sonny. Best get to stepping now

        #are we yelling?!
            ###YES!
exactly. so tired of this meme. its especially overused in this sub.
    #i agree with that !
Yeahhh…I’m relatively confused by this post. Who in the hell ever told OP that Legends Arceus WASN’T a good game? OP is making it seem like this is a controversial opinion that somebody would disagree with.  🤨
Exactly, downvote this OP.
    it's at 66% upvoted rn lol
        Wait, where do you see the ratios?
I honestly only ever see Poke fans shitting on whatever is current, they'll all pretend to have been fans the whole time when public opinion changes.
Exactly
A lot of people absolutely hated the graphics when it came out and I am pretty sure a lot still hate it.
    I made [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s9culs/pokemon_2022_vs_oblivion_2006/) post about the game's graphics and even I think that asides from the graphics, the game is amazing.
Idk here lately I've been seeing a bunch of "was it as good as we first thought" shit and people bashing it. I assume OP is in the same boat.
Didn't it get a lot of shit in /r/gaming for the environments looking low effort and outdated for a new title?
    I imagine that was mostly from people who aren't fans of Pokemon exaggerating the issue. Graphics are overrated.
There was a lot of continuation of Dexit, complaining about every game since SwSh not having the full dex.

Plus, a bunch of complaints about graphics (which I never understood, as it looked to me as the second most beautiful Pokémon game after the new Snap).

But... to agree, after SV came out, it was readily apparent that PLA was one of the best games with a capturing mechanic in the entire franchise.
The *worst* I've heard people say about it is that it's good but could use some polish, which isn't saying it's bad just that certain parts could use work, which I honestly agree to.
i didn't even play it yet but i still respect what it did and is doing pushing Pokemon forward. the game has been near universally praised from pokemon fans as a breath of fresh air for very good reason.
I mean you say that, but I've seen plenty of people on this sub shit talking about how everyone only PRETENDS to like it and how it's a deeply flawed game.
A lot of people, particularly outside the pokemon community, judge the game solely on its graphics.
Good game but I didn’t like it that much tbh. Just didn’t feel like the Pokémon I grew up with and thats completely on me. Nostalgia and whatnot.
>Arceus is such an underrated amazing game that does not get the credit it deserves.

Probably half the fandom (the largest fandom ever btw) agrees its the best one since the gameboy games, or at least the BW games. What is this man talking about?
    The gameboy games really aren't that good compared to newer gens, but I agree it's weird
The title of this post screams "I live a performative life full of tepid takes."
it is? I got mine super cheap because it was a used game and the employee told me it was unpopular so a lot of people returned it quickly
Starts an explaining for a very popular game "unpopular opinion, it is a good game" 

wait for all the free karma lol
    Why I left /r/gaming
        why i left every videogame-related sub
            Um...
                Should we tell 'em?
Yet it somehow made it to the top with all this traction lol
    Well people love to upvote their own opinion. Even if the post is low effort or pointless.
    This happens frequently on "unpopular opinion" subs
Didn’t it get nominated for best switch game of the year?
He's out here with the hidden indie gems
Tbf OP is claiming things like "It's got great visuals."
    I'm maybe going to be shunned for this but Arceus doesn't look as good as it should. In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin but it's nowhere near what the switch is capable of. When it first came out I was disappointed with the graphics but as soon as I started playing it I fell in love and now that I've finished sandpapering my eyes while playing SV I'm not entirely sure why I was bitching in the first place. There were some other issues but overall it's easily my favorite pokemon game ever.
        Let's go pikachu/eevee has the best looking graphics of any 3d pokémon game
            Agree big time - such a gorgeous game! And some of Sw/Sh was beautiful
            Hmm, I'm conflicted. That game looked like the GameCube turned the saturation way up. It wasn't good graphics by any stretch of the imagination but also you're absolutely right that it was the most "pokemon" looking pokemon game.
                I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
        I have never met anybody wholly satisfied with a 3D Pokémon game’s graphics, rightfully so. I don’t think you’ll be shunned
        [deleted]
            Exactly, I swear pokemon fans must be drinking some premium kool-aid bc pokemon Arceus looks like playstation 2 era, hot garbage. I loved the game.but damn I kept thinking how shitty all the textures looked. And I'm not even a guy who usually gives a shit about graphics or fps.
                We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
                It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
        > In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin

Nah, that belongs to LGPE.
            Somebody else said the same. I don't know if I agree. It was definitely the best before a drastic shift and I understand why people would say that but IMO the look of PLA or other fully 3d games.(SV, SW/SH wild area) is not detracting from what I wanted.
        Arceus was great, especially in light of SV (I thought SV was good, but had issues holding it back from being truly great). The main thing that dropped it below others for me was the reduced focus on battling and multiplayer interaction, though I at least appreciate their experimenting with new battle mechanics even if I felt like it still needed more polish (and the Pokedex grind was unbearable, should've lowered or changed a lot of the requirements needed for full completion).
            The number one thing that the Pokedex needs is hints. Saying "this little guy likes to walk around" or "it behaves different depending on if it is night or day" would be amazing. The fact that it's impossible to evolve some without luck or Google is insane.
                That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
                Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
                    I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
        > im going to be shunned for this

> says extremely popular opinion

arceus is fun but it looks worse than mario sunshine
        Bro the NPC look dead inside, the ouses face the same direction and the textures are copy pasted.
        No, I love that game. But it barely looks better than most Ps2 games. It’s not a stylistic choice, this is clearly just what Gamefreak is capable of doing with the limited amount time and resources they’re given.
    It weirdly has a mix of really great and just awful visuals haha I guess it just depends on what sticks out the most to people
    It kind of does depending on what you mean. The environments are very pretty. The rendering, textures, etc., less so.
Guys, Mario 3D World might just be a good game. I know, brave for saying it, right?
To be fair….this entire sub exploded when the game came out and everyone hated it.
    Except they didn’t. I was here, I remember.
        For the first month the entire sub was about “duck Thai shitty game with its shitty graphics and it’s shitty animations that they said were better and weren’t”
            that was sword and shield. legends arceus was mostly well received
Yes it will be
    Alright I have to say it.

Water is an amazing beverage and everyone should be drinking it. I'm tired of pretending that water isn't as good as it is
Next he’s gonna tell us Breaking Bad was a good TV show.
It's probably the most highly praised pokemon game in the last decade lol
And dumbest way of trying to farm karma, bc ain't no way OP somehow didn't know how well praised PLA is compared to BDSP and SV all over this subreddit, YouTube, literally any other social media app. They gotta be either trolling or karma farming atp.

Whut
The one thing I will concede is that the first 3 weeks after release was nonstop posts about how shit the graphics looked and how therefore the game was a failure. 

Since then the opinion has flipped, because it turns out HD graphics aren't all that important in a Pokemon game, whereas fun gameplay is. Which is also why the opinion on S/V has flipped as well.
    >  nonstop posts about how shit the graphics looked and how therefore the game was a failure.

From what I remember, people complained about the graphics and others just _assumed_ that they hated the game. When PLA came out there was A LOT of justified criticism of the game being made here but half the sub didn't want to hear anything about it so if you gave even the mildest critique about PLA you were A. Actively trying to destroy the game, B. Hate Pokemon, or C. Think the game was a complete failure.

In no world on r/pokemon were you allowed to say anything negative about PLA while also enjoying it. Nuance is dead and you can only hate or love everything.

I can see that still seems to be going on...

            I think the flying while asleep is more for gameplay clarity. If a flying pokemon lays on the ground, then that signals that ground moves should hit that pokemon. 
If they don't want to buff ground moves in that way, then I can't think of a way to have gameplay and animations match up.
    >because it turns out HD graphics aren't all that important in a ~~Pokemon~~ game, whereas fun gameplay is.

It's always been this way, it just takes some people a while to get it.
        I wish they'd just stylize already instead of just doing whatever it is they're trying to do.
    I’ve been on reddit for over a decade and this happens with just about every Pokémon game that comes out.
    When I hear PLA being talked about on other subreddits and other websites the opinions are quite varied.  I've heard everything from highly positive opinions to "the graphics sucked and then everyone immediately forgot about it".

My guess is that a lot of people on the periphery of the fandom formed their takeaway opinion while things were still in flux and only the core fandom wound up converging on the opinion you see here today.  We're probably going to see posts like this long into the future as fans keep brushing up against people who formed their opinion solely from the initial controversy.
    No one is saying good graphics are important, they're saying good aesthetics are, which they are and in that sense pokemon arceus looks like garbage.
    Till date there are people still shitting on SV for having shit graphics, going from LA to SV, I would say SV looks cleaner in terms of graphics and they love to cite that as if PLA wasn't shat on during release for its grainy graphics.

This community strangely loves to hate on the new thing while propping up the old ones.

&#x200B;

Edit: If we are talking are framerate drops in both games, PLA has its fair share, the noble boss battles and time distortions absolute tank my framerates without fail.
        I mean, most people shit on SV because they have extremely buggy graphics, not so much because it's not ultra high quality. 

I also prefer gameplay to visuals and don't usually mind simple graphics, but playing SV was sometimes very annoying. For instance, you can rarely sit back and enjoy watching a battle because the camera is always super zoomed in and you don't have a clear view of what's happening. I remember battling and all I could see was Tinkaton's arms.
            SV has definitely made me prefer a dynamic camera over one I control. Especially since some moves in the past would change the camera angle to make them look more powerful.
        I don’t mind subpar graphics but the bugs and shitty, unstable framerate in SV is what annoys me.
            Remember the Cherrim bug? And right after it was fixed, the game broke Cresslia as well? I was unfortunate enough to encounter both bugs which rendered my save unplayable in terms of progressing the game until they patched it.

Lets not pretend PLA was this shining star of a game, for its ups there are downs as well.
                I’m not disagreeing there considering I disliked PLA more than any other Pokémon game I played, and this is coming from someone who played Pokémon Channel as a kid.
        PLA looks awful especially when you go on the water.
#me too
I think the thread's statement is more about as if someone would claim "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DX is the greatest pokemon game etc.".. Same goes for Pokemon Legends since it's not a real main series game. From that perspective its obvious that it's a controversial take, because a tryhard pokemon fan has a main series game as the favourite, no?
Because it isn't?  


PLA is overrated, I will absolutely devil's advocate against OP here.
    >PLA is overrated

The metacritic score for PLA is only 2 points lower than kirby and the forgotten land. Kinda crazy since its nowhere near the same level of quality but it's pokemon so I can't be surprised.
    It's okay if you don't like it but to say it's overrated is just incorrect.
        Is it good? Absolutely. Is it the best pokemon game in years? Sure. Is it overrated? 100%.

If it weren't a pokemon-branded game and was a standalone franchise, it would be  7/10 game.

The only reason it gets excessive praise is because it is being compared to Gamefreak's gameplay which hasn't seen a major tune up in 25 years.
            It probably wouldn't have even been a 7/10 game if not for the pokémon branding
                I'm basing it off the standard online video game review scale. If I gave it a 6 I'd be calling it a bad game. I don't think it's bad. It's just not amazing.

If I were basing off a more real stat like percentiles, I'd say it's probably close to 60-70th percentile (bottom 40%) when it comes to AAA games.
                    Yeah, true
            Is it really, though? The new catching system was novel and fun, but even that got old and bland pretty quickly because once you figure the system out it's just the same "distract them, throw heavy ball at the back" every time. some of the sidequests were interesting, but that's just pretty much it.

The combat was a significant downgrade and turned the game into even worse of a glasscannon spam than any title before it. The actual content of the game offers 10, maybe 15 hours of gameplay? The rest is nonsensical busywork like "catch this pokemon 25 times" or "use that move 30" times.

PLA had some cool ideas, the implementation of them was underbaked and the rest of the game was just the video game equivalent of static noise.

'Twas a full price spinoff that offers less content and gameplay than most 20 dollar indie pokemon clones, while also having lower production quality.
                Agreed. Refreshing to see someone who shares a similar opinion to mine. The catching mechanic got old quickly and the combat was shit. You could easily one shot Pokémon 10+ levels higher than you. 

One of my gaming pet peeves is pointless filler that you’re forced to do and this game was absolutely filled to the brim with it.

I usually keep my games especially Pokémon unless I absolutely know for a fact I’ll 100% never play it again and Arceus is one of the ones I sold. It was such a slog I could never bring myself to play it again.
Tbh, if anything I'd say it's more like Pokemon's take on Monster Hunter than it is BotW. I mean, with the campsites, a central hub area you keep going back to, the map unfolding as you explore, etc. really makes it feel more like Monster Hunter. Especially with the fights against the Pokemon lords.

And this is coming from someone who's playes all three mentioned games.
That's true! BotW came out 5 years prior on a previous console and still looked better.

But I agree, PLA is a pretty good game.
    I... meant in terms of gameplay. One is an openworld game and the other is more like Monster Hunter in its progression.
It looks and feels similar to BOTW to me--the art style, the sound direction, the setting, the mechanics even down to the way the character runs. I think it was very "heavily inspired" if you want to be charitable.
    That’s definitely fair but just in overall delivery, Legends is a good, fun game. BotW is like GOAT tier
Yeah people who stan Arceus honestly confound me. It was a change up to the formula and a step in the right direction, but the graphics made it laughably bad and hard to experience any immersion at all, the characters were so terribly uninteresting and poorly designed, the dialogue was pretty bad. I think much like SV there’s a good game hidden in there but it was not given enough time and should have never been released in the state it was.
    > the characters were so terribly uninteresting and poorly designed, the dialogue was pretty bad.

Deadass if Volo wasn't Cynthia 2 nobody would care about him as a character, this I genuinely believe.
        He so has objectively the coolest boss fight in any pokemon game, i don't like pla that much but I'll give em that. Although the fight at the end of sv is a very close second.
            I'd def give it to SV's, yeah
                Respectabele, Mr toby fox did fantastic work on that Ost and it's unlike anything we've seen in pokemon before. If the DLC is more area zero and less main city then we're in for a treat.
    fr the gameplay loop was fun but it felt like a boring grind once it was time to go unlock the next area. didn't help that like two areas you unlock actually look unique. once i hit the credits I was cheering becuase that meant I didn't have to play the game anymore. friend of mine absolutely adored the game for the reasons I didn't like it so it's really just an opinions thing.
    For real. I didn't care for Arceus once I got past the first area.

The map was somehow both empty and had too many pokemon ready to murder me
        Yeah there's not really any cool hidden areas in the game in fact i can only think of one "hidden" area and it's the underground ice area, just makes exploration is this "open world" game feel unrewarding.
            Exactly. I have over 200 hours in BOTW because exploring is so fun in it.
        I got my hat and put the game away lol
    incredibly repetitive gameplay too. got bored by second area
    you summed up my thoughts exactly. Fun in concept, but needed more time in the oven to feel like a fleshed out game. And a fun concept does not make it a good game in reality.
    That sort of window-dressing doesn't break a game for me, and it's a shame it did for you.
Love this thread
Your comment is great. Taking about how everyone loves it and then immediately talking about how you don’t like it. Then endless comments hating on it. A self defeating comment.
    I'm not "everyon" and I'm baffled to see there's others that don't worship it
OP is a child probably
    I forgot that Redditors could be a child or teenagers.
        Look at the general tone of the post lol
        60% of redditors are either children or assholes 

Or both
PLA Sucks, there you go
Then clearly you're not looking
    If I have to look for the nefative comments specifically, then they are in the minority. I see praise about the game without even looking for it. It is simply in every pokemon forum.
        I didn't mean you weren't looking specifically for negative comments. I meant you weren't looking at all. There's negative comments on this thread alone, before and after you stated your opinion. You made a claim that you never read one and yet they're right there for you to see. You don't have to look specifically for them. That's what I mean by you're not looking. Because they're definitely there, including in this thread
I would have stopped playing Pokemon if mainline games became Arceus-like with the awful battle system. I think it's cool that they wanna try new things in side games, I even think it'd be cool to keep that same system for future Legends games and make it that series's style, but I'm glad they don't touch the mainline series.
    I loved the speed of battling.  SV is so freaking slow.
Leaving all the fans of the battling to dry, are we?

You see, Arceus is a fantastic Pokemon catching game, though the other aspects of Pokemon are ignored somewhat, namely the battling. This isn't a jab at Legends Arceus, I think having a Pokemon game solely focused on a single aspect of the series is a great thing. It just means that the people who fundamentally didn't like Legends Arceus won't like the later games.

One big reason I like Pokemon is the multiplayer battling, so axing that would greatly hinder my enjoyment.
disagree. it is a wonderful game, for sure, but the way they changed up the way taking turns in battling works fundamentally changes the game, and not for the better. it's still a great game to play casually but it destroys the way the game is played competitively.
    They should've kept frostbite and splinter status at least
        i'd be cool with that tbh
    Agreed, the new battle system was alright for a bit but had several points in the game that were frustrating and not enjoyable. If they made another legends game, I would love to have the main series battle style added in. Even better would be a VGC doubles focus
        The perfect game to me would be a cross between PLA and S/V
            Hear me out, keep the exploration and catching of PLA, and the combat of POKKEN
                Pokemon is one of the very few competitive turn-based RPGs, and you wanna turn it into every fighting game ever?
                    Pokken is in no way "every fighting game ever"
                Valid
                YES
                The ideal would be to combine the turn based strategy combat of Pokémon with the action fighting game combat of pokken for the perfect battle system 

How would it even work you may ask? I have no idea, that’s not my job.
        The battles work for a single player experience. Having turn order be an extra thing to play around with is really cool.
            agree, for a single player experience it's fine. not so for pvp. that doesn't diminish the quality of the game though. it's still an excellent game... but the mechanics of battling are not ideal.
            I somewhat disagree - it didn’t really feel fair at times because the opponent would send in a Pokémon and they’d immediately get two turns before you could even select an action sometimes. It just made everything a back-and-forth especially for the end-game battles. There’s one in particular I’m thinking of, I’m sure you know which it is if you’ve played far enough. Also, one of Ingo’s battles pits you against 3 Alphas and you legitimately have to wait 5-6 turns before you can even do anything sometimes. It just feels like you just have to sit there and watch your Pokémon die without any chance to save it.
                I liked the unfairness. It made the victory feel earned more. And it fits with the theme of how brutal nature is in this game. Like, theres no mercy in this games world. 

If I lose a battle I just rearrange my pokemons order. Theres also the fact you can switch in for free that kinda counter balances the mutliple moves.

Also its so satisfying when your enemy tries to kill you with strong style only for you to revenhe kill them with a strong style of your own.
        If they want to do a turn based system they can’t have hidden mechanics that change the turn order with no way of you knowing. Turn based systems have been around for decades but game freak somehow made a worse version. Just have each turn act individually and have any speed effects apply next turn.
    I think they did that because of how the world viewed Pokemon at this point in time. Like your town is terrified of Pokemon at first, so I think the whole turn thing was added in later, when the Pokemon leagues started to form. At this point in Pokemon's timeline, it's everyone for themselves, so the turn order change works for the lore
    Plus, unlike OP, I didn't feel like a trainer when I played it. Catching pokemon was always much faster without battling, so I barely ever battled and had zero connection with my pokemon by the end of the game because I was always catching much stronger ones than my current party.
    I disagree with you but fair opinion
    I'd say it's for the better in making outspeeding less important, with Agile giving a chance to get a hit in.

Pokemon competitive balancing has always been a train wreck  anyway.
        Doesn't it make out-speeding more important? If your Pokemon is fast enough, they can get two or even three attacks in a row. The most annoying thing to me was when I would send out a Pokemon and it would get knocked out before I even got to select a move.
I would have. Game wasn't at all what I want Pokemon to be; not even a little.
    That's totally valid. I loved PLA, but I can absolutely see how some people would dislike it. Different people like different aspects of pokemon games. The catching and collecting aspect is what I enjoy most, so PLA suits my playstyle really well. But if trainer battles are what you enjoy, it's severely lacking.
        Took the words right out of my mouth, yep yep.
    Exactly how I feel. I would just go play Zelda if I wanted that
The reason it's not is that Arceus and S/V were developed concurrently. Maybe the next games will incorporate more good PLA stuff.
It's a very great game and honestly, top of all pokemon games for me but it's not a traditional pokemon game. Yes, there needs to be more, but it's not mainline. It's formula, while basically mainline (catch, some battling) is so different, it would turn off a lot of people. They need more games like it (and they can be in "modern times.")

Arceus isn't mainline pokemon and that's ok.
    Arceus is mainline Pokémon though
    arceus is mainline
    It's literally a mainline game according to everyone at Game Freak though? I hope you know you aren't the person who decides what is and isn't mainline lol
No way! Pokemon running out in wild and humans being the one sneaking upon them, fits the time period and setting of PLA. But in modern time I can't buy that. It takes out a lot of fun from stumbling upon a rare Pokemon and hunting for a specific one in an area.
YES ARCEUS SUPREMACY.
    10000%. Best game they’ve made since Heartgold and Soulsilver. One of the only main series games that feels like an actual reimagining of Pokémon tailor made for a modern console, as opposed to a port of Gameboy-era mechanics and gameplay
Yep, it sucks that we've been acclimated to being fed the same game every one or two years, every new one being less polished and less dense than the previous one. I still have a good time playing every new game, but fucking hell was Scarlet/Violet a shitfest, even if you disregard the performance issues, which are quite literally impossible to disregard.

Arceus wasn't polished enough, kinda wasn't dense enough, but it was something new, something interesting that reimagined old mechanics, built new things around the core idea of "explore different places to find new monsters to catch". I really wish the license would take a step back and really try to go even further in that direction and surprising us.
I’d really be fine with a main series game in PLA style - and then just make a new Pokémon Stadium with VGC rules and online battling where they can be easily transferred
no, keep PLA away from the main series games,
SV really just needed to use the PLA overworld system, improve the graphics slightly and throw the traditional battle system back in.
>Legends: Arceus is PAINFULLY overrated.

Pokémon in and of itself is painfully overrated. If took me quite some time to realize that. There's a hot take for you
I feel like people were so blinded by the fact that it was “PoKeMon bUt BrEatH of tHe WiLD” that they didn’t notice how boring the actual gameplay loop is. I defy anyone who thinks this game is quality to replay it and tell me they’re not bored to tears with the “gameplay.”
    I preferred it actually, seemed better to be to be trying different kinds of battles and trying to catch different size variants to fill a page than literally just grinding and fainting pokemon repeatedly till I get the level I want

And when the page is complete you start seeing shinies
        I liked that mechanic of the game, but I wouldn’t call it a part of the core gameplay loop as you’re progressing through the story
            Nope, but I am more of a sidequest person and I happily just played around in the first area completing pages and lv100 pokemon would obey me long before I got to the heart of the story. That's why I liked it. I didn't need it to progress but I was rewarded for it anyway
    Comparing it to BOTW is really rude. BOTW is actually fun for hundreds of hours. Arceus only is for 20 max
    I totally disagree. I’ve gone back to PLA plenty of times to shiny hunt or grind out higher completion just because I enjoy that loop so much, but I’ve gone back to SV for reasons beyond a new update… maybe two or three times? At most? Even just reading this thread is making me want to boot it up, but I feel like there’s not even anything I could do in SV. Raids I guess? To get HMs for shiny hunts? But those are so laggy and slow… 

I’m not saying the game is flawless ofc, but all the issues I have with it apply to pretty much every other Pokémon game, so not really relevant to a comparison.

Also, the game isn’t really like BOTW at all. Never understood why people say that so much.
        If you shiny hunt you're not an average gamer and must have a lot of patience. You may enjoy the reward but I don't think the process can be called enjoyable. I completed the Pokedex because I'm a completionist, but I was kinda fed up with it near the end.
    People still struggle to accept Bore of the Walking was a bad game too. Good luck trying to get people to admit how repetitive PLA was.
        It’s weird cuz I thought botw was the most boring game I ever played. But I really like Pokémon legends lol
        You take that back
    played through it three times. Loved it more each time.
You didn't get to the part where you have to actually afk for 40 minutes to 3 hours to get a time distortion to spawn so that you can fill the Pokedex and do the final battle.
>hope they use a certain move

You could just use that pkm and its move. Thats the point, to get you to use and try out other pkm that you wouldn't otherwise have used.
It definitely could've benefitted with a bit more time in development (same goes for all Pokémon games as of recent) and a DLC as well. But alas that was never really going to happen as Scarlet and Violet came out in the same year. Which is a shame, because if they pushed Scarlet and Violet back (and worked on that too) we could've possibly of had a perfected Legends Arceus game, I mean we do live in a day and age of where games can be patched up with improvements. But as the last 3 mainline Pokémon games literally came out within the span of a year, it was quite clear it was going to get put aside whilst they focused on Scarlet and Violet.
X/Y was bad? I take issue with that point.
So, to people that actually liked SV better, we're out of luck?

SV and Legends are gonna have to coexist, because a lot of people actually DID LIKE SV better. The open world was done better, the story was done better, and the idea of having multiple objectives in a game rather than just "lol complete the pokedex" was amazing.


Legends was fine. But I don't want it to be all that the main series offers. SV has its place, and is one of my favorite games. Legends is not. It's not a game that I will ever have the urge to boot up ever again once I was done with it.
    Same SV are one of my favorite pokemon game to date and I didn't even finish PLA it was very repetitive to me
Well, numbers matter more to GF... and what game sold better again?
    What? That’s like saying every game will be chibi because BDSP did really well, sales wise. 

I’m not saying SV’s mechanics are bad, but they do seem to be wanting to shake up the formulas a lot more lately and having Legends be the *main* game of each generation may be the way to do that. 

SV sold really well, but the reception to them was less than favourable to the point where they had to address it. There is obviously going to be change to the way they do things behind the scenes going forward because that was a *lot* of backlash. Whether that change is good or not, but going with the mechanics and format of a game that sold very well and was acclaimed would be the smartest move. 

Of course this is all speculation, and whilst GF/Nintendo are number hungry, they also don’t want something like this happening again.
        I'm not saying they are completely number hungry, but they have a track record of not listening to feedback. We don't know what's in store for the future- but I'm not holding out that they would change anything without the sales numbers backing them up at this point.

We will have to see, but a lot of people will buy pokemon no matter the state it's in- that's simply the truth and GF knows that... After all, people still defend(ed) SV to this day. For the record, I think there will be more legends games- but we will have plenty more S/V or bdsp like games in the future. There will be no consistent changes to a strictly better formula.
        Idk if im in the minority on this one but I would be pretty dang happy if game freak decided to remake all the older games in the style of BD/SP

&#x200B;

I really like it a lot for pokemon.

Lol, whoopsie, I went against reddit sacred opinion. Forgot that y'all only want shit to look like BoTW
            I actually agree too, I wouldn't mind if they kept the art style of those games. My problems with those games were the fact they were just copy-pasted (arguably inferior too), but the art style was fine imo. Remakes of past hens with new content like ORAS would be lit.
    Ah yes, because they sold 2 rather than 1
        I feel like sales vs advertising spending is probably more important anyways. No idea which comes out ahead there
        Most people only buy one version of the games my dude.
"There’s so much more storytelling they can do with this mechanic. IMO GF should turn HOME into a VGC stadium battle so that the Legends games can take over as single player main series games."       
     
Please stop 💀
    No?
        Yes?
            Either give a genuine response as to why I should “stop” or get lost.
                Lol
                    incredible
I love Arcaeus but the graphics are a downgrade compared to many games, even years old ports. I stick with it for the exploration and Pokemon, not the story or the graphics sadly.
PLA got slammed for its graphics (and rightfully so) funny how it now looks amazing in comparison to SV though.
    I really don’t think that it does. Not to say that SV is some marvel of graphics or anything, but SV at least has lighting that isn’t just white light on flat colors.

Edit: this is also dismissing graphical glitches, of which the game has plenty. Assuming both games are running smooth I still think SV looks better.
I could never go back to pla, it's just not really that fun at all. Great concept but as always poor execution, maybe a future legends game can actually be good who knows.
That’s your opinion and I respect it, but I also don’t believe you are 100% correct with that assumption. Yes, SOME mechanics in the game are not too polished. (Pokémon mounts are the biggest offender of this) Other mechanics like catching Pokémon have never been better. Instead of walking in grass, trying to find the Pokémon you want, opening your menu, and throwing a ball, catching is simplified to: find Pokémon, throw ball. And shiny hunting becomes very beginner friendly to those that want to try it, but don’t want to spend a good portion of their life finding a differently colored fictional animal due to the large amount of spawns everywhere around you. Unfortunately they removed overworld catching in S/V, however, they did speed up catching animations and raised crit catching rates to still keep a legends-like feel to catching Pokémon.
Well apart from today, I've met loads of people who hate on arceus and alot of other pokemon games because they drift away from the original style pokemon.
Well apart from today, I've met loads of people who hate on arceus and alot of other pokemon games that drift away from the original style pokemon.
gosh i'd be so down for a PL:M
Legends meloetta when a pokemon who's ancient form is told to us about but never shown (kyurem) makes no sense man.
>BotW was all about freedom; the ability to explore a vast, gorgeous world in any way and at any pace you chose to

I feel like I'm the only person who thought this world was ugly, boring and filled with a bunch of nothing
Yeah, if anything, comparing it to BOTW does BOTW a disservice--PLA still has plenty of that hand-holdy dialogue, whereas BOTW barely has any that's mandatory.
That was one of the big draws to me! I loved getting lost in the story and lore!
    The story was just an isekai. Like, if you played a Mystery Dungeon game...

It was the exact same story.
        PMD games usually have their own lore, not lore that spans over multiple games though.

And yes I made multiple comparisons to PMD during my playthrough.
    I'm really glad you enjoyed it and that many others seem to as well. For me personally though, once I've read the story once, I just wanna enjoy building new teams to play the game and enjoy the new mechanics
I dont agree with the basis of this game not being replayable because of the dialogue. But even if I did agree with it having less replay value, thats a stupid thing to judge a ganes quality on. Like story games like last of us have low replay value cuz you can only experience the story for the first time once. But those arent bad games. 

Also, maybe just put more of a break between replaying the game.
Pokemon fans not getting mad at the fact that RPGs have tons of dialogue challenge (impossible)
    Most RPGs don't have so much dialogue that it takes 30+ minutes several times throughout the game. It's a severe pacing issue.
And Ultra, which went out of its way to get WORSE. At least BDSP was just the same thing as before.
    How was ultra worse? It had better story, better dex, better mc design and a whole extra mini story(trr)
        "Better story"? The story was GARBAGE next to SM. They weakened Lusamine so much she may as well have been a completely different person, and the entire story hinged on her, so everything else suffered as a result.
            Bruh atleast it was actually her this time and not just a puppet by some stupid hentai glass jellyfish from space
                She was always herself. The jellyfish don't control people, you realize. She was still making her own decisions.
                    Aight, still ultra necrozma is cooler, and even if the story isnt better, the other stuff still stands.
                        Eh. A cool boss fight wasn't worth sacrificing depth of character. Even seeing my man Cyrus again wasn't enough for me.
Do it. It’s worth it trust me. Just be warned, the paras are annoying as heck.
Scarlet violet came out.
But without the parts that make monster hunter fun (getting together with friends and hunting monsters)
    It has Bidoof and beanbags instead!

'whats your main?' 'I throw bags of Candy at Rathalos, it's probably just hangry, right?'
>Why do you pretend that it's not?

Because it isn't. Overrated game.
Honestly, not really. Aside from the other incredibly glaring flaws, the biggest issue with saying it's a good "remake" is the fact that Legends: Arceus reduces almost all of Sinnoh's iconic landmarks to linear paths or tiny caves and single chambers. The path to the summit of mt. Coronet is honestly insulting.
It felt like the mechanic almost made it into the game, because in SV we can crouch, and you instantly get the same "hidden" mechanic activating when you do.
    But I can just throw a pokeball to catch a Pokémon. Took me a minute to catch a Pokémon is violet vs 10 second with one ball. Violet/scarlet just showed how much I don’t have time anymore to grind. Pla ruined shiny hunting in a good way. I can’t get past three house in scarlet, the plot is boring boring boring.
No shit? Do you not know what the word “paradox” means?
    But pats paradox forms are from prehistoric times. Walking wake is prehistoric but it seems like it shouldn’t have existed in that timeline in the first place. It would’ve have to go thru evolving it’s tails into ribbon like tails
        Mate, again, do you NOT know what the word “PARADOX” means?
            Mate, I GET WHAT IT MEANS. All I’m saying is that walking make makes no sense. It’s a prehistoric version of suicune in which it’s not possible since the pokemon who died in the tower are 3 different pokemon to say the least.
                Mate, it’s doesn’t make sense BECAUSE ITS A PARADOX

You clearly don’t know what a Paradox is: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

IT

IS 

A

PARADOX

THATS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.
                    🙄🙄🙄
                        You post the emojis because you now learned what paradox means and why Walking Wake doesn’t make sense but still exists.

We also know these Pokémon are all imaginations made real.

LMAO
>The game really showed how little effort GF has to put into games and still get praise for their fans.

I thought this exact same thing
Wow... that is a *scalding* hot take...
    Not really, I think he's just a straight up troll
    Well it was a cold take for about 7 years
    Well I’m not sorry for not liking a Pokémon game with terrible Pokémon designs, incredibly boring characters, boring story, way to many rival fights, and a terrible exp system
Holy guacamole Batman, that is THE bad take of the day, and I’ve been on Reddit for a good amount today.
*Dude.*

.....Sword/Shield was even worse than them.
    Sword snd shield wasn’t the greatest but at least it had some fun aspects to it unlike gen5
Yeah congrats op, you're far from alone. That doesn't make it underrated
You also seem to be living in your own world where apparently everyone is pretending it's a bad game..... Weird.
The only entity who would probably think PLA isn’t popular is Nintendo/GF, because it didn’t sell as well as any other Pokémon game and ignores the fact it *can’t* sell as well because it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos.
    I mean it has sold 14 million units and it's only a single game (like you pointed out). Pretty sure the Pokemon Company (Nintendo, Gamefreak, Creatures) would all admit its incredibly popular. It still has the potential to beat the lifetime sales of a lot of Pokemon games.
        which means its technically the highest selling pokemon game.
    Sun & Moon only sold 16m, X & Y sold 16.5m, black & white 15.6m, diamond & pearl sold 14.5m, PLA sold 14.6m


So it seems to be right on par with a mainline game.
    So many people buy both copies. It's kinda insane, especially now when there is online trading that makes it way more feasible to get them all without the purchase of two.
        It is so crazy to me that people throw their money away like that.
            Unless you have 2 kids and you're getting each of them their own Pokémon game. But as a purchase for yourself, yeah... it's confusing.
    >it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos

Does that actually make a difference to sales? It must be a tiny minority of people who actually buy both games in a pair.
        It's popular enough for them to make double packs of both games.
That’s like a good chunk of the sub’s MO. Complaining about how unpopular their opinion is and conveniently ignoring the many comments/threads echoing the same thing. Sometimes it’s even the most popular opinion but they still act like their opinion is unpopular.
Legends Arceus, underrated gem?
    [deleted]
        B/W2 sold almost as badly. Was an "underrated gem" for a while, at least.
            [deleted]
                If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
                    To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
                        That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                            Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                            Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                            I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.

                        I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                            I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
                    I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
                        The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                            At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                            I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
                        Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
                        Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                            Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                            I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                            Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
                    ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
                That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
                    I'll be back in 10 years

                    Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
                    >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
                midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
            Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
            I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
        If you release a game, eventually, somebody will call it an "underrated gem." It's a law.
    There's this little known gem called Red Dead Redemption 2 that I personally enjoy. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.
    Reminds me of my favourite hidden gem the witcher 3
        There's this lesser known sci-fi movie, you probably haven't heard of it, but I think Star Wars might just take off.
        hey guys have you heard of HeartGold and SoulSilver? I think they're the hidden gems of the Pokémon series.
        I just laughed so hard I had to turn off my music. Oh, what was I listening to? You probably never heard of it - some band called The Beatles.
        Geraldo???
    The last of us, underrated gem?
    r/tomorrow moment
Very rarely, even in threads where people ask you to post unpopular opinions, are actual unpopular opinions posted when someone says they have an unpopular opinion.
    Unpopular opinion: good things are better than bad things
        Why would you even say that?!
        That's disgusting, take that back immediately.
        Those are fighting words, sonny. Best get to stepping now
    Oh they’re posted, they’re just downvoted to oblivion
[removed]
    #are we yelling?!
        ###YES!
#i agree with that !
it's at 66% upvoted rn lol
    Wait, where do you see the ratios?
I made [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s9culs/pokemon_2022_vs_oblivion_2006/) post about the game's graphics and even I think that asides from the graphics, the game is amazing.
I imagine that was mostly from people who aren't fans of Pokemon exaggerating the issue. Graphics are overrated.
The gameboy games really aren't that good compared to newer gens, but I agree it's weird
Why I left /r/gaming
    why i left every videogame-related sub
        Um...
            Should we tell 'em?
Well people love to upvote their own opinion. Even if the post is low effort or pointless.
This happens frequently on "unpopular opinion" subs
I'm maybe going to be shunned for this but Arceus doesn't look as good as it should. In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin but it's nowhere near what the switch is capable of. When it first came out I was disappointed with the graphics but as soon as I started playing it I fell in love and now that I've finished sandpapering my eyes while playing SV I'm not entirely sure why I was bitching in the first place. There were some other issues but overall it's easily my favorite pokemon game ever.
    Let's go pikachu/eevee has the best looking graphics of any 3d pokémon game
        Agree big time - such a gorgeous game! And some of Sw/Sh was beautiful
        Hmm, I'm conflicted. That game looked like the GameCube turned the saturation way up. It wasn't good graphics by any stretch of the imagination but also you're absolutely right that it was the most "pokemon" looking pokemon game.
            I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
    I have never met anybody wholly satisfied with a 3D Pokémon game’s graphics, rightfully so. I don’t think you’ll be shunned
    [deleted]
        Exactly, I swear pokemon fans must be drinking some premium kool-aid bc pokemon Arceus looks like playstation 2 era, hot garbage. I loved the game.but damn I kept thinking how shitty all the textures looked. And I'm not even a guy who usually gives a shit about graphics or fps.
            We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
            It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
    > In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin

Nah, that belongs to LGPE.
        Somebody else said the same. I don't know if I agree. It was definitely the best before a drastic shift and I understand why people would say that but IMO the look of PLA or other fully 3d games.(SV, SW/SH wild area) is not detracting from what I wanted.
    Arceus was great, especially in light of SV (I thought SV was good, but had issues holding it back from being truly great). The main thing that dropped it below others for me was the reduced focus on battling and multiplayer interaction, though I at least appreciate their experimenting with new battle mechanics even if I felt like it still needed more polish (and the Pokedex grind was unbearable, should've lowered or changed a lot of the requirements needed for full completion).
        The number one thing that the Pokedex needs is hints. Saying "this little guy likes to walk around" or "it behaves different depending on if it is night or day" would be amazing. The fact that it's impossible to evolve some without luck or Google is insane.
            That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
            Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
                I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
    > im going to be shunned for this

> says extremely popular opinion

arceus is fun but it looks worse than mario sunshine
    Bro the NPC look dead inside, the ouses face the same direction and the textures are copy pasted.
    No, I love that game. But it barely looks better than most Ps2 games. It’s not a stylistic choice, this is clearly just what Gamefreak is capable of doing with the limited amount time and resources they’re given.
It weirdly has a mix of really great and just awful visuals haha I guess it just depends on what sticks out the most to people
It kind of does depending on what you mean. The environments are very pretty. The rendering, textures, etc., less so.
Except they didn’t. I was here, I remember.
    For the first month the entire sub was about “duck Thai shitty game with its shitty graphics and it’s shitty animations that they said were better and weren’t”
        that was sword and shield. legends arceus was mostly well received
Alright I have to say it.

Water is an amazing beverage and everyone should be drinking it. I'm tired of pretending that water isn't as good as it is
>  nonstop posts about how shit the graphics looked and how therefore the game was a failure.

From what I remember, people complained about the graphics and others just _assumed_ that they hated the game. When PLA came out there was A LOT of justified criticism of the game being made here but half the sub didn't want to hear anything about it so if you gave even the mildest critique about PLA you were A. Actively trying to destroy the game, B. Hate Pokemon, or C. Think the game was a complete failure.

In no world on r/pokemon were you allowed to say anything negative about PLA while also enjoying it. Nuance is dead and you can only hate or love everything.

I can see that still seems to be going on...
    [deleted]
        I think the flying while asleep is more for gameplay clarity. If a flying pokemon lays on the ground, then that signals that ground moves should hit that pokemon. 
If they don't want to buff ground moves in that way, then I can't think of a way to have gameplay and animations match up.
>because it turns out HD graphics aren't all that important in a ~~Pokemon~~ game, whereas fun gameplay is.

It's always been this way, it just takes some people a while to get it.
    I wish they'd just stylize already instead of just doing whatever it is they're trying to do.
I’ve been on reddit for over a decade and this happens with just about every Pokémon game that comes out.
When I hear PLA being talked about on other subreddits and other websites the opinions are quite varied.  I've heard everything from highly positive opinions to "the graphics sucked and then everyone immediately forgot about it".

My guess is that a lot of people on the periphery of the fandom formed their takeaway opinion while things were still in flux and only the core fandom wound up converging on the opinion you see here today.  We're probably going to see posts like this long into the future as fans keep brushing up against people who formed their opinion solely from the initial controversy.
No one is saying good graphics are important, they're saying good aesthetics are, which they are and in that sense pokemon arceus looks like garbage.
Till date there are people still shitting on SV for having shit graphics, going from LA to SV, I would say SV looks cleaner in terms of graphics and they love to cite that as if PLA wasn't shat on during release for its grainy graphics.

&#x200B;

This community strangely loves to hate on the new thing while propping up the old ones.

&#x200B;

Edit: If we are talking are framerate drops in both games, PLA has its fair share, the noble boss battles and time distortions absolute tank my framerates without fail.
    I mean, most people shit on SV because they have extremely buggy graphics, not so much because it's not ultra high quality. 

I also prefer gameplay to visuals and don't usually mind simple graphics, but playing SV was sometimes very annoying. For instance, you can rarely sit back and enjoy watching a battle because the camera is always super zoomed in and you don't have a clear view of what's happening. I remember battling and all I could see was Tinkaton's arms.
        SV has definitely made me prefer a dynamic camera over one I control. Especially since some moves in the past would change the camera angle to make them look more powerful.
    I don’t mind subpar graphics but the bugs and shitty, unstable framerate in SV is what annoys me.
        Remember the Cherrim bug? And right after it was fixed, the game broke Cresslia as well? I was unfortunate enough to encounter both bugs which rendered my save unplayable in terms of progressing the game until they patched it.

Lets not pretend PLA was this shining star of a game, for its ups there are downs as well.
            I’m not disagreeing there considering I disliked PLA more than any other Pokémon game I played, and this is coming from someone who played Pokémon Channel as a kid.
    PLA looks awful especially when you go on the water.
>PLA is overrated

The metacritic score for PLA is only 2 points lower than kirby and the forgotten land. Kinda crazy since its nowhere near the same level of quality but it's pokemon so I can't be surprised.
It's okay if you don't like it but to say it's overrated is just incorrect.
    Is it good? Absolutely. Is it the best pokemon game in years? Sure. Is it overrated? 100%.

If it weren't a pokemon-branded game and was a standalone franchise, it would be  7/10 game.

The only reason it gets excessive praise is because it is being compared to Gamefreak's gameplay which hasn't seen a major tune up in 25 years.
        It probably wouldn't have even been a 7/10 game if not for the pokémon branding
            I'm basing it off the standard online video game review scale. If I gave it a 6 I'd be calling it a bad game. I don't think it's bad. It's just not amazing.

If I were basing off a more real stat like percentiles, I'd say it's probably close to 60-70th percentile (bottom 40%) when it comes to AAA games.
                Yeah, true
        Is it really, though? The new catching system was novel and fun, but even that got old and bland pretty quickly because once you figure the system out it's just the same "distract them, throw heavy ball at the back" every time. some of the sidequests were interesting, but that's just pretty much it.

The combat was a significant downgrade and turned the game into even worse of a glasscannon spam than any title before it. The actual content of the game offers 10, maybe 15 hours of gameplay? The rest is nonsensical busywork like "catch this pokemon 25 times" or "use that move 30" times.

PLA had some cool ideas, the implementation of them was underbaked and the rest of the game was just the video game equivalent of static noise.

'Twas a full price spinoff that offers less content and gameplay than most 20 dollar indie pokemon clones, while also having lower production quality.
            Agreed. Refreshing to see someone who shares a similar opinion to mine. The catching mechanic got old quickly and the combat was shit. You could easily one shot Pokémon 10+ levels higher than you. 

One of my gaming pet peeves is pointless filler that you’re forced to do and this game was absolutely filled to the brim with it.

I usually keep my games especially Pokémon unless I absolutely know for a fact I’ll 100% never play it again and Arceus is one of the ones I sold. It was such a slog I could never bring myself to play it again.
I... meant in terms of gameplay. One is an openworld game and the other is more like Monster Hunter in its progression.
That’s definitely fair but just in overall delivery, Legends is a good, fun game. BotW is like GOAT tier
> the characters were so terribly uninteresting and poorly designed, the dialogue was pretty bad.

Deadass if Volo wasn't Cynthia 2 nobody would care about him as a character, this I genuinely believe.
    He so has objectively the coolest boss fight in any pokemon game, i don't like pla that much but I'll give em that. Although the fight at the end of sv is a very close second.
        I'd def give it to SV's, yeah
            Respectabele, Mr toby fox did fantastic work on that Ost and it's unlike anything we've seen in pokemon before. If the DLC is more area zero and less main city then we're in for a treat.
fr the gameplay loop was fun but it felt like a boring grind once it was time to go unlock the next area. didn't help that like two areas you unlock actually look unique. once i hit the credits I was cheering becuase that meant I didn't have to play the game anymore. friend of mine absolutely adored the game for the reasons I didn't like it so it's really just an opinions thing.
For real. I didn't care for Arceus once I got past the first area.

The map was somehow both empty and had too many pokemon ready to murder me
    Yeah there's not really any cool hidden areas in the game in fact i can only think of one "hidden" area and it's the underground ice area, just makes exploration is this "open world" game feel unrewarding.
        Exactly. I have over 200 hours in BOTW because exploring is so fun in it.
    I got my hat and put the game away lol
incredibly repetitive gameplay too. got bored by second area
you summed up my thoughts exactly. Fun in concept, but needed more time in the oven to feel like a fleshed out game. And a fun concept does not make it a good game in reality.
That sort of window-dressing doesn't break a game for me, and it's a shame it did for you.
I'm not "everyon" and I'm baffled to see there's others that don't worship it
I forgot that Redditors could be a child or teenagers.
    Look at the general tone of the post lol
    60% of redditors are either children or assholes 

Or both
If I have to look for the nefative comments specifically, then they are in the minority. I see praise about the game without even looking for it. It is simply in every pokemon forum.
    I didn't mean you weren't looking specifically for negative comments. I meant you weren't looking at all. There's negative comments on this thread alone, before and after you stated your opinion. You made a claim that you never read one and yet they're right there for you to see. You don't have to look specifically for them. That's what I mean by you're not looking. Because they're definitely there, including in this thread
I loved the speed of battling.  SV is so freaking slow.
They should've kept frostbite and splinter status at least
    i'd be cool with that tbh
Agreed, the new battle system was alright for a bit but had several points in the game that were frustrating and not enjoyable. If they made another legends game, I would love to have the main series battle style added in. Even better would be a VGC doubles focus
    The perfect game to me would be a cross between PLA and S/V
        Hear me out, keep the exploration and catching of PLA, and the combat of POKKEN
            Pokemon is one of the very few competitive turn-based RPGs, and you wanna turn it into every fighting game ever?
                Pokken is in no way "every fighting game ever"
            Valid
            YES
            The ideal would be to combine the turn based strategy combat of Pokémon with the action fighting game combat of pokken for the perfect battle system 

How would it even work you may ask? I have no idea, that’s not my job.
    The battles work for a single player experience. Having turn order be an extra thing to play around with is really cool.
        agree, for a single player experience it's fine. not so for pvp. that doesn't diminish the quality of the game though. it's still an excellent game... but the mechanics of battling are not ideal.
        I somewhat disagree - it didn’t really feel fair at times because the opponent would send in a Pokémon and they’d immediately get two turns before you could even select an action sometimes. It just made everything a back-and-forth especially for the end-game battles. There’s one in particular I’m thinking of, I’m sure you know which it is if you’ve played far enough. Also, one of Ingo’s battles pits you against 3 Alphas and you legitimately have to wait 5-6 turns before you can even do anything sometimes. It just feels like you just have to sit there and watch your Pokémon die without any chance to save it.
            I liked the unfairness. It made the victory feel earned more. And it fits with the theme of how brutal nature is in this game. Like, theres no mercy in this games world. 

If I lose a battle I just rearrange my pokemons order. Theres also the fact you can switch in for free that kinda counter balances the mutliple moves.

Also its so satisfying when your enemy tries to kill you with strong style only for you to revenhe kill them with a strong style of your own.
    If they want to do a turn based system they can’t have hidden mechanics that change the turn order with no way of you knowing. Turn based systems have been around for decades but game freak somehow made a worse version. Just have each turn act individually and have any speed effects apply next turn.
I think they did that because of how the world viewed Pokemon at this point in time. Like your town is terrified of Pokemon at first, so I think the whole turn thing was added in later, when the Pokemon leagues started to form. At this point in Pokemon's timeline, it's everyone for themselves, so the turn order change works for the lore
Plus, unlike OP, I didn't feel like a trainer when I played it. Catching pokemon was always much faster without battling, so I barely ever battled and had zero connection with my pokemon by the end of the game because I was always catching much stronger ones than my current party.
I disagree with you but fair opinion
I'd say it's for the better in making outspeeding less important, with Agile giving a chance to get a hit in.

Pokemon competitive balancing has always been a train wreck  anyway.
    Doesn't it make out-speeding more important? If your Pokemon is fast enough, they can get two or even three attacks in a row. The most annoying thing to me was when I would send out a Pokemon and it would get knocked out before I even got to select a move.
That's totally valid. I loved PLA, but I can absolutely see how some people would dislike it. Different people like different aspects of pokemon games. The catching and collecting aspect is what I enjoy most, so PLA suits my playstyle really well. But if trainer battles are what you enjoy, it's severely lacking.
    Took the words right out of my mouth, yep yep.
Exactly how I feel. I would just go play Zelda if I wanted that
Arceus is mainline Pokémon though
arceus is mainline
It's literally a mainline game according to everyone at Game Freak though? I hope you know you aren't the person who decides what is and isn't mainline lol
10000%. Best game they’ve made since Heartgold and Soulsilver. One of the only main series games that feels like an actual reimagining of Pokémon tailor made for a modern console, as opposed to a port of Gameboy-era mechanics and gameplay
I preferred it actually, seemed better to be to be trying different kinds of battles and trying to catch different size variants to fill a page than literally just grinding and fainting pokemon repeatedly till I get the level I want

And when the page is complete you start seeing shinies
    I liked that mechanic of the game, but I wouldn’t call it a part of the core gameplay loop as you’re progressing through the story
        Nope, but I am more of a sidequest person and I happily just played around in the first area completing pages and lv100 pokemon would obey me long before I got to the heart of the story. That's why I liked it. I didn't need it to progress but I was rewarded for it anyway
Comparing it to BOTW is really rude. BOTW is actually fun for hundreds of hours. Arceus only is for 20 max
I totally disagree. I’ve gone back to PLA plenty of times to shiny hunt or grind out higher completion just because I enjoy that loop so much, but I’ve gone back to SV for reasons beyond a new update… maybe two or three times? At most? Even just reading this thread is making me want to boot it up, but I feel like there’s not even anything I could do in SV. Raids I guess? To get HMs for shiny hunts? But those are so laggy and slow… 

I’m not saying the game is flawless ofc, but all the issues I have with it apply to pretty much every other Pokémon game, so not really relevant to a comparison.

Also, the game isn’t really like BOTW at all. Never understood why people say that so much.
    If you shiny hunt you're not an average gamer and must have a lot of patience. You may enjoy the reward but I don't think the process can be called enjoyable. I completed the Pokedex because I'm a completionist, but I was kinda fed up with it near the end.
People still struggle to accept Bore of the Walking was a bad game too. Good luck trying to get people to admit how repetitive PLA was.
    It’s weird cuz I thought botw was the most boring game I ever played. But I really like Pokémon legends lol
    You take that back
played through it three times. Loved it more each time.
Same SV are one of my favorite pokemon game to date and I didn't even finish PLA it was very repetitive to me
What? That’s like saying every game will be chibi because BDSP did really well, sales wise. 

I’m not saying SV’s mechanics are bad, but they do seem to be wanting to shake up the formulas a lot more lately and having Legends be the *main* game of each generation may be the way to do that. 

SV sold really well, but the reception to them was less than favourable to the point where they had to address it. There is obviously going to be change to the way they do things behind the scenes going forward because that was a *lot* of backlash. Whether that change is good or not, but going with the mechanics and format of a game that sold very well and was acclaimed would be the smartest move. 

Of course this is all speculation, and whilst GF/Nintendo are number hungry, they also don’t want something like this happening again.
    I'm not saying they are completely number hungry, but they have a track record of not listening to feedback. We don't know what's in store for the future- but I'm not holding out that they would change anything without the sales numbers backing them up at this point.

We will have to see, but a lot of people will buy pokemon no matter the state it's in- that's simply the truth and GF knows that... After all, people still defend(ed) SV to this day. For the record, I think there will be more legends games- but we will have plenty more S/V or bdsp like games in the future. There will be no consistent changes to a strictly better formula.
    Idk if im in the minority on this one but I would be pretty dang happy if game freak decided to remake all the older games in the style of BD/SP

&#x200B;

I really like it a lot for pokemon.

Lol, whoopsie, I went against reddit sacred opinion. Forgot that y'all only want shit to look like BoTW
        I actually agree too, I wouldn't mind if they kept the art style of those games. My problems with those games were the fact they were just copy-pasted (arguably inferior too), but the art style was fine imo. Remakes of past hens with new content like ORAS would be lit.
Ah yes, because they sold 2 rather than 1
    I feel like sales vs advertising spending is probably more important anyways. No idea which comes out ahead there
    Most people only buy one version of the games my dude.
No?
    Yes?
        Either give a genuine response as to why I should “stop” or get lost.
            Lol
                incredible
I really don’t think that it does. Not to say that SV is some marvel of graphics or anything, but SV at least has lighting that isn’t just white light on flat colors.

Edit: this is also dismissing graphical glitches, of which the game has plenty. Assuming both games are running smooth I still think SV looks better.
The story was just an isekai. Like, if you played a Mystery Dungeon game...

It was the exact same story.
    PMD games usually have their own lore, not lore that spans over multiple games though.

And yes I made multiple comparisons to PMD during my playthrough.
I'm really glad you enjoyed it and that many others seem to as well. For me personally though, once I've read the story once, I just wanna enjoy building new teams to play the game and enjoy the new mechanics
Most RPGs don't have so much dialogue that it takes 30+ minutes several times throughout the game. It's a severe pacing issue.
How was ultra worse? It had better story, better dex, better mc design and a whole extra mini story(trr)
    "Better story"? The story was GARBAGE next to SM. They weakened Lusamine so much she may as well have been a completely different person, and the entire story hinged on her, so everything else suffered as a result.
        Bruh atleast it was actually her this time and not just a puppet by some stupid hentai glass jellyfish from space
            She was always herself. The jellyfish don't control people, you realize. She was still making her own decisions.
                Aight, still ultra necrozma is cooler, and even if the story isnt better, the other stuff still stands.
                    Eh. A cool boss fight wasn't worth sacrificing depth of character. Even seeing my man Cyrus again wasn't enough for me.
It has Bidoof and beanbags instead!

'whats your main?' 'I throw bags of Candy at Rathalos, it's probably just hangry, right?'
But I can just throw a pokeball to catch a Pokémon. Took me a minute to catch a Pokémon is violet vs 10 second with one ball. Violet/scarlet just showed how much I don’t have time anymore to grind. Pla ruined shiny hunting in a good way. I can’t get past three house in scarlet, the plot is boring boring boring.
But pats paradox forms are from prehistoric times. Walking wake is prehistoric but it seems like it shouldn’t have existed in that timeline in the first place. It would’ve have to go thru evolving it’s tails into ribbon like tails
    Mate, again, do you NOT know what the word “PARADOX” means?
        Mate, I GET WHAT IT MEANS. All I’m saying is that walking make makes no sense. It’s a prehistoric version of suicune in which it’s not possible since the pokemon who died in the tower are 3 different pokemon to say the least.
            Mate, it’s doesn’t make sense BECAUSE ITS A PARADOX

You clearly don’t know what a Paradox is: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

IT

IS 

A

PARADOX

THATS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.
                🙄🙄🙄
                    You post the emojis because you now learned what paradox means and why Walking Wake doesn’t make sense but still exists.

We also know these Pokémon are all imaginations made real.

LMAO
Not really, I think he's just a straight up troll
Well it was a cold take for about 7 years
Well I’m not sorry for not liking a Pokémon game with terrible Pokémon designs, incredibly boring characters, boring story, way to many rival fights, and a terrible exp system
Sword snd shield wasn’t the greatest but at least it had some fun aspects to it unlike gen5
I mean it has sold 14 million units and it's only a single game (like you pointed out). Pretty sure the Pokemon Company (Nintendo, Gamefreak, Creatures) would all admit its incredibly popular. It still has the potential to beat the lifetime sales of a lot of Pokemon games.
    which means its technically the highest selling pokemon game.
Sun & Moon only sold 16m, X & Y sold 16.5m, black & white 15.6m, diamond & pearl sold 14.5m, PLA sold 14.6m


So it seems to be right on par with a mainline game.
So many people buy both copies. It's kinda insane, especially now when there is online trading that makes it way more feasible to get them all without the purchase of two.
    It is so crazy to me that people throw their money away like that.
        Unless you have 2 kids and you're getting each of them their own Pokémon game. But as a purchase for yourself, yeah... it's confusing.
>it’s a singular game competing with other Pokémon games sold in twos

Does that actually make a difference to sales? It must be a tiny minority of people who actually buy both games in a pair.
    It's popular enough for them to make double packs of both games.
[deleted]
    B/W2 sold almost as badly. Was an "underrated gem" for a while, at least.
        [deleted]
            If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
                To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
                    That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                        Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                        Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                        I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.

                    I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                        I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
                I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
                    The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                        At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                        I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
                    Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
                    Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                        Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                        I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                        Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
                ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
            That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
                I'll be back in 10 years

                Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
                >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
            midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
        Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
        I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
    If you release a game, eventually, somebody will call it an "underrated gem." It's a law.
There's this little known gem called Red Dead Redemption 2 that I personally enjoy. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.
Reminds me of my favourite hidden gem the witcher 3
    There's this lesser known sci-fi movie, you probably haven't heard of it, but I think Star Wars might just take off.
    hey guys have you heard of HeartGold and SoulSilver? I think they're the hidden gems of the Pokémon series.
    I just laughed so hard I had to turn off my music. Oh, what was I listening to? You probably never heard of it - some band called The Beatles.
    Geraldo???
The last of us, underrated gem?
r/tomorrow moment
Unpopular opinion: good things are better than bad things
    Why would you even say that?!
    That's disgusting, take that back immediately.
    Those are fighting words, sonny. Best get to stepping now
Oh they’re posted, they’re just downvoted to oblivion
#are we yelling?!
    ###YES!
Wait, where do you see the ratios?
why i left every videogame-related sub
    Um...
        Should we tell 'em?
Let's go pikachu/eevee has the best looking graphics of any 3d pokémon game
    Agree big time - such a gorgeous game! And some of Sw/Sh was beautiful
    Hmm, I'm conflicted. That game looked like the GameCube turned the saturation way up. It wasn't good graphics by any stretch of the imagination but also you're absolutely right that it was the most "pokemon" looking pokemon game.
        I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
I have never met anybody wholly satisfied with a 3D Pokémon game’s graphics, rightfully so. I don’t think you’ll be shunned
[deleted]
    Exactly, I swear pokemon fans must be drinking some premium kool-aid bc pokemon Arceus looks like playstation 2 era, hot garbage. I loved the game.but damn I kept thinking how shitty all the textures looked. And I'm not even a guy who usually gives a shit about graphics or fps.
        We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
        It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
> In looks alone it's superior to every other pokemon game by a huge margin

Nah, that belongs to LGPE.
    Somebody else said the same. I don't know if I agree. It was definitely the best before a drastic shift and I understand why people would say that but IMO the look of PLA or other fully 3d games.(SV, SW/SH wild area) is not detracting from what I wanted.
Arceus was great, especially in light of SV (I thought SV was good, but had issues holding it back from being truly great). The main thing that dropped it below others for me was the reduced focus on battling and multiplayer interaction, though I at least appreciate their experimenting with new battle mechanics even if I felt like it still needed more polish (and the Pokedex grind was unbearable, should've lowered or changed a lot of the requirements needed for full completion).
    The number one thing that the Pokedex needs is hints. Saying "this little guy likes to walk around" or "it behaves different depending on if it is night or day" would be amazing. The fact that it's impossible to evolve some without luck or Google is insane.
        That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
        Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
            I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
> im going to be shunned for this

> says extremely popular opinion

arceus is fun but it looks worse than mario sunshine
Bro the NPC look dead inside, the ouses face the same direction and the textures are copy pasted.
No, I love that game. But it barely looks better than most Ps2 games. It’s not a stylistic choice, this is clearly just what Gamefreak is capable of doing with the limited amount time and resources they’re given.
For the first month the entire sub was about “duck Thai shitty game with its shitty graphics and it’s shitty animations that they said were better and weren’t”
    that was sword and shield. legends arceus was mostly well received

    I think the flying while asleep is more for gameplay clarity. If a flying pokemon lays on the ground, then that signals that ground moves should hit that pokemon. 
If they don't want to buff ground moves in that way, then I can't think of a way to have gameplay and animations match up.
I wish they'd just stylize already instead of just doing whatever it is they're trying to do.
I mean, most people shit on SV because they have extremely buggy graphics, not so much because it's not ultra high quality. 

I also prefer gameplay to visuals and don't usually mind simple graphics, but playing SV was sometimes very annoying. For instance, you can rarely sit back and enjoy watching a battle because the camera is always super zoomed in and you don't have a clear view of what's happening. I remember battling and all I could see was Tinkaton's arms.
    SV has definitely made me prefer a dynamic camera over one I control. Especially since some moves in the past would change the camera angle to make them look more powerful.
I don’t mind subpar graphics but the bugs and shitty, unstable framerate in SV is what annoys me.
    Remember the Cherrim bug? And right after it was fixed, the game broke Cresslia as well? I was unfortunate enough to encounter both bugs which rendered my save unplayable in terms of progressing the game until they patched it.

Lets not pretend PLA was this shining star of a game, for its ups there are downs as well.
        I’m not disagreeing there considering I disliked PLA more than any other Pokémon game I played, and this is coming from someone who played Pokémon Channel as a kid.
PLA looks awful especially when you go on the water.
Is it good? Absolutely. Is it the best pokemon game in years? Sure. Is it overrated? 100%.

If it weren't a pokemon-branded game and was a standalone franchise, it would be  7/10 game.

The only reason it gets excessive praise is because it is being compared to Gamefreak's gameplay which hasn't seen a major tune up in 25 years.
    It probably wouldn't have even been a 7/10 game if not for the pokémon branding
        I'm basing it off the standard online video game review scale. If I gave it a 6 I'd be calling it a bad game. I don't think it's bad. It's just not amazing.

If I were basing off a more real stat like percentiles, I'd say it's probably close to 60-70th percentile (bottom 40%) when it comes to AAA games.
            Yeah, true
    Is it really, though? The new catching system was novel and fun, but even that got old and bland pretty quickly because once you figure the system out it's just the same "distract them, throw heavy ball at the back" every time. some of the sidequests were interesting, but that's just pretty much it.

The combat was a significant downgrade and turned the game into even worse of a glasscannon spam than any title before it. The actual content of the game offers 10, maybe 15 hours of gameplay? The rest is nonsensical busywork like "catch this pokemon 25 times" or "use that move 30" times.

PLA had some cool ideas, the implementation of them was underbaked and the rest of the game was just the video game equivalent of static noise.

'Twas a full price spinoff that offers less content and gameplay than most 20 dollar indie pokemon clones, while also having lower production quality.
        Agreed. Refreshing to see someone who shares a similar opinion to mine. The catching mechanic got old quickly and the combat was shit. You could easily one shot Pokémon 10+ levels higher than you. 

One of my gaming pet peeves is pointless filler that you’re forced to do and this game was absolutely filled to the brim with it.

I usually keep my games especially Pokémon unless I absolutely know for a fact I’ll 100% never play it again and Arceus is one of the ones I sold. It was such a slog I could never bring myself to play it again.
He so has objectively the coolest boss fight in any pokemon game, i don't like pla that much but I'll give em that. Although the fight at the end of sv is a very close second.
    I'd def give it to SV's, yeah
        Respectabele, Mr toby fox did fantastic work on that Ost and it's unlike anything we've seen in pokemon before. If the DLC is more area zero and less main city then we're in for a treat.
Yeah there's not really any cool hidden areas in the game in fact i can only think of one "hidden" area and it's the underground ice area, just makes exploration is this "open world" game feel unrewarding.
    Exactly. I have over 200 hours in BOTW because exploring is so fun in it.
I got my hat and put the game away lol
Look at the general tone of the post lol
60% of redditors are either children or assholes 

Or both
I didn't mean you weren't looking specifically for negative comments. I meant you weren't looking at all. There's negative comments on this thread alone, before and after you stated your opinion. You made a claim that you never read one and yet they're right there for you to see. You don't have to look specifically for them. That's what I mean by you're not looking. Because they're definitely there, including in this thread
i'd be cool with that tbh
The perfect game to me would be a cross between PLA and S/V
    Hear me out, keep the exploration and catching of PLA, and the combat of POKKEN
        Pokemon is one of the very few competitive turn-based RPGs, and you wanna turn it into every fighting game ever?
            Pokken is in no way "every fighting game ever"
        Valid
        YES
        The ideal would be to combine the turn based strategy combat of Pokémon with the action fighting game combat of pokken for the perfect battle system 

How would it even work you may ask? I have no idea, that’s not my job.
The battles work for a single player experience. Having turn order be an extra thing to play around with is really cool.
    agree, for a single player experience it's fine. not so for pvp. that doesn't diminish the quality of the game though. it's still an excellent game... but the mechanics of battling are not ideal.
    I somewhat disagree - it didn’t really feel fair at times because the opponent would send in a Pokémon and they’d immediately get two turns before you could even select an action sometimes. It just made everything a back-and-forth especially for the end-game battles. There’s one in particular I’m thinking of, I’m sure you know which it is if you’ve played far enough. Also, one of Ingo’s battles pits you against 3 Alphas and you legitimately have to wait 5-6 turns before you can even do anything sometimes. It just feels like you just have to sit there and watch your Pokémon die without any chance to save it.
        I liked the unfairness. It made the victory feel earned more. And it fits with the theme of how brutal nature is in this game. Like, theres no mercy in this games world. 

If I lose a battle I just rearrange my pokemons order. Theres also the fact you can switch in for free that kinda counter balances the mutliple moves.

Also its so satisfying when your enemy tries to kill you with strong style only for you to revenhe kill them with a strong style of your own.
If they want to do a turn based system they can’t have hidden mechanics that change the turn order with no way of you knowing. Turn based systems have been around for decades but game freak somehow made a worse version. Just have each turn act individually and have any speed effects apply next turn.
Doesn't it make out-speeding more important? If your Pokemon is fast enough, they can get two or even three attacks in a row. The most annoying thing to me was when I would send out a Pokemon and it would get knocked out before I even got to select a move.
Took the words right out of my mouth, yep yep.
I liked that mechanic of the game, but I wouldn’t call it a part of the core gameplay loop as you’re progressing through the story
    Nope, but I am more of a sidequest person and I happily just played around in the first area completing pages and lv100 pokemon would obey me long before I got to the heart of the story. That's why I liked it. I didn't need it to progress but I was rewarded for it anyway
If you shiny hunt you're not an average gamer and must have a lot of patience. You may enjoy the reward but I don't think the process can be called enjoyable. I completed the Pokedex because I'm a completionist, but I was kinda fed up with it near the end.
It’s weird cuz I thought botw was the most boring game I ever played. But I really like Pokémon legends lol
You take that back
I'm not saying they are completely number hungry, but they have a track record of not listening to feedback. We don't know what's in store for the future- but I'm not holding out that they would change anything without the sales numbers backing them up at this point.

We will have to see, but a lot of people will buy pokemon no matter the state it's in- that's simply the truth and GF knows that... After all, people still defend(ed) SV to this day. For the record, I think there will be more legends games- but we will have plenty more S/V or bdsp like games in the future. There will be no consistent changes to a strictly better formula.
Idk if im in the minority on this one but I would be pretty dang happy if game freak decided to remake all the older games in the style of BD/SP

&#x200B;

I really like it a lot for pokemon.

Lol, whoopsie, I went against reddit sacred opinion. Forgot that y'all only want shit to look like BoTW
    I actually agree too, I wouldn't mind if they kept the art style of those games. My problems with those games were the fact they were just copy-pasted (arguably inferior too), but the art style was fine imo. Remakes of past hens with new content like ORAS would be lit.
I feel like sales vs advertising spending is probably more important anyways. No idea which comes out ahead there
Most people only buy one version of the games my dude.
Yes?
    Either give a genuine response as to why I should “stop” or get lost.
        Lol
            incredible
PMD games usually have their own lore, not lore that spans over multiple games though.

And yes I made multiple comparisons to PMD during my playthrough.
"Better story"? The story was GARBAGE next to SM. They weakened Lusamine so much she may as well have been a completely different person, and the entire story hinged on her, so everything else suffered as a result.
    Bruh atleast it was actually her this time and not just a puppet by some stupid hentai glass jellyfish from space
        She was always herself. The jellyfish don't control people, you realize. She was still making her own decisions.
            Aight, still ultra necrozma is cooler, and even if the story isnt better, the other stuff still stands.
                Eh. A cool boss fight wasn't worth sacrificing depth of character. Even seeing my man Cyrus again wasn't enough for me.
Mate, again, do you NOT know what the word “PARADOX” means?
    Mate, I GET WHAT IT MEANS. All I’m saying is that walking make makes no sense. It’s a prehistoric version of suicune in which it’s not possible since the pokemon who died in the tower are 3 different pokemon to say the least.
        Mate, it’s doesn’t make sense BECAUSE ITS A PARADOX

You clearly don’t know what a Paradox is: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

IT

IS 

A

PARADOX

THATS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.
            🙄🙄🙄
                You post the emojis because you now learned what paradox means and why Walking Wake doesn’t make sense but still exists.

We also know these Pokémon are all imaginations made real.

LMAO
which means its technically the highest selling pokemon game.
It is so crazy to me that people throw their money away like that.
    Unless you have 2 kids and you're getting each of them their own Pokémon game. But as a purchase for yourself, yeah... it's confusing.
It's popular enough for them to make double packs of both games.
B/W2 sold almost as badly. Was an "underrated gem" for a while, at least.
    [deleted]
        If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
            To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
                That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                    Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                    Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                    I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.

                I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                    I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
            I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
                The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                    At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                    I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
                Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
                Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                    Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                    I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                    Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
            ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
        That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
            I'll be back in 10 years

            Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
            >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
        midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
    Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
    I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
If you release a game, eventually, somebody will call it an "underrated gem." It's a law.
There's this lesser known sci-fi movie, you probably haven't heard of it, but I think Star Wars might just take off.
hey guys have you heard of HeartGold and SoulSilver? I think they're the hidden gems of the Pokémon series.
I just laughed so hard I had to turn off my music. Oh, what was I listening to? You probably never heard of it - some band called The Beatles.
Geraldo???
Why would you even say that?!
That's disgusting, take that back immediately.
Those are fighting words, sonny. Best get to stepping now
###YES!
Um...
    Should we tell 'em?
Agree big time - such a gorgeous game! And some of Sw/Sh was beautiful
Hmm, I'm conflicted. That game looked like the GameCube turned the saturation way up. It wasn't good graphics by any stretch of the imagination but also you're absolutely right that it was the most "pokemon" looking pokemon game.
    I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
Exactly, I swear pokemon fans must be drinking some premium kool-aid bc pokemon Arceus looks like playstation 2 era, hot garbage. I loved the game.but damn I kept thinking how shitty all the textures looked. And I'm not even a guy who usually gives a shit about graphics or fps.
    We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
    It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
Somebody else said the same. I don't know if I agree. It was definitely the best before a drastic shift and I understand why people would say that but IMO the look of PLA or other fully 3d games.(SV, SW/SH wild area) is not detracting from what I wanted.
The number one thing that the Pokedex needs is hints. Saying "this little guy likes to walk around" or "it behaves different depending on if it is night or day" would be amazing. The fact that it's impossible to evolve some without luck or Google is insane.
    That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
    Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
        I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
that was sword and shield. legends arceus was mostly well received
I think the flying while asleep is more for gameplay clarity. If a flying pokemon lays on the ground, then that signals that ground moves should hit that pokemon. 
If they don't want to buff ground moves in that way, then I can't think of a way to have gameplay and animations match up.

    If it was that simple we'd be in the middle of gen 6 love bombing. Some people are getting really nostalgic for it, but I think ultimately some of the games don't have as much staying power as others, especially since so many more people played gen 6, and yet, ya know.
        To be fair, I think Gen6 gets a lot of recognition, it's just that that recognition is "We want to like this half finished bare bones game you gave us but you didn't give us enough TO love"
            That's basically how I feel about Sw/Sh. And no, asking people to pay *more* money for the second half of the full-price game we already bought does not make it better.
                Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
                Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
                I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.

            I think that's more a wave of "Wow I wish kalos was better / more well developed", tbh
                I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
        I really like gen 6. Made the switch to 3d (which ultimately led to Legends Arceus), gave us Megas!!!, Removed HMs, had the PSS, introduced Fairy types, gave us the best remakes, introduced some really cool pokemon like Hawlucha, Talonflame, Aegislash, Trevanent, etc. 

I know it gets dunked on for being so easy but it makes a great introduction to Nuzlocking if nothing else...
            The best remakes? Hardly. FRLG and HGSS hold that title for sure. So much content wasn’t included for ORAS that it really can’t compare to playing Emerald, while FRLG and HGSS are just direct upgrades with even more content to do. You can have nostalgia for Hoenn like the rest of us, but it’s undeniable that ORAS is a stripped attempt at Hoenn in 3D with gen 6 mechanics.
                At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
                I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
            Gen 6 was the first to have all hand picked colors for shinies. And I think all the Pokemon it introduced were great, plus cool gimmick evos like inkay. It had a bunch of issues, no doubt, but it had a bunch of great things
            Gen 6 still very much had HMs. It wasn't until Sun/Moon that they were replaced with (the much worse) ride Pokémon.
                Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
                I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
                Well yes, but at that stage they were just handing you things like a free Lapras for Surfing or the Latias/Latios in ORAS to zoom around on
        ORAS is getting that treatment, at least.
    That’s not possible when you consider WHY BW2 were suddenly being praised. Modern pokemon games fucking suck. Low quality, rushed, full price with $30 DLC, too easy, no one fucking likes them. In 10 years no matter how bad it gets, no one is going to look back at gen 8 and praise it.
        I'll be back in 10 years

        Some of us already am. I am more excited right now to go back to G8 then I am to keep playing 9. Maybe the DLC will help with that but I am bored with running from raid den to raid den.
        >No one fucking likes them.

Weird take considering how incredibly Pokémon games still are.
    midway through gen 7. but yeah (actually right after SUMO release, when people realized, this isnt an accident, this is the new normal)
Lame joke time: Nah, B2W2 can't be underrated gems. The only options for underrated gem are Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Diamond.
I only don't like gen 5 because I hate the region. Unova pisses me off
Should we tell 'em?
I'd rather gamecube with too much saturation than n64 level graphics
We all know that guy in the village where someone copied his character model, didn't even bother to rotate him or anything, and just dragged him over across the river, pasted him, and called it a day.
It always makes me feel fucking crazy when I see people hyping up how "good" a modern Pokémon game's graphics are, and then I boot that shit up myself and it looks like it could have run on my GameCube 20 years ago
That'd be nice too. But no, I mean like having to catch 25 or so of a Pokemon that has a low or rare spawn rate. Like Growlithe, where you'll usually only find maybe one or two on the entire map at a time. Or some of the ones that spawn exclusively in time bubbles. As well as stuff like "Have [X] use [specific move] 30 times."
Some of them have light hints in the Pokédex, like Stantler. 

And then there's Ursaluna. Fuck Ursaluna, I caught mine in a Massive Mass Outbreak.
    I just carried an Ursaring with me while completing the dancing Clefairy quest since both are triggered by the same thing.
I’m not disagreeing there considering I disliked PLA more than any other Pokémon game I played, and this is coming from someone who played Pokémon Channel as a kid.
I'm basing it off the standard online video game review scale. If I gave it a 6 I'd be calling it a bad game. I don't think it's bad. It's just not amazing.

If I were basing off a more real stat like percentiles, I'd say it's probably close to 60-70th percentile (bottom 40%) when it comes to AAA games.
    Yeah, true
Agreed. Refreshing to see someone who shares a similar opinion to mine. The catching mechanic got old quickly and the combat was shit. You could easily one shot Pokémon 10+ levels higher than you. 

One of my gaming pet peeves is pointless filler that you’re forced to do and this game was absolutely filled to the brim with it.

I usually keep my games especially Pokémon unless I absolutely know for a fact I’ll 100% never play it again and Arceus is one of the ones I sold. It was such a slog I could never bring myself to play it again.
Respectabele, Mr toby fox did fantastic work on that Ost and it's unlike anything we've seen in pokemon before. If the DLC is more area zero and less main city then we're in for a treat.
Pokemon is one of the very few competitive turn-based RPGs, and you wanna turn it into every fighting game ever?
    Pokken is in no way "every fighting game ever"
Valid
YES
The ideal would be to combine the turn based strategy combat of Pokémon with the action fighting game combat of pokken for the perfect battle system 

How would it even work you may ask? I have no idea, that’s not my job.
I liked the unfairness. It made the victory feel earned more. And it fits with the theme of how brutal nature is in this game. Like, theres no mercy in this games world. 

If I lose a battle I just rearrange my pokemons order. Theres also the fact you can switch in for free that kinda counter balances the mutliple moves.

Also its so satisfying when your enemy tries to kill you with strong style only for you to revenhe kill them with a strong style of your own.
Lol
    incredible
She was always herself. The jellyfish don't control people, you realize. She was still making her own decisions.
    Aight, still ultra necrozma is cooler, and even if the story isnt better, the other stuff still stands.
        Eh. A cool boss fight wasn't worth sacrificing depth of character. Even seeing my man Cyrus again wasn't enough for me.
Mate, it’s doesn’t make sense BECAUSE ITS A PARADOX

You clearly don’t know what a Paradox is: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

IT

IS 

A

PARADOX

THATS WHY IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO.
    🙄🙄🙄
        You post the emojis because you now learned what paradox means and why Walking Wake doesn’t make sense but still exists.

We also know these Pokémon are all imaginations made real.

LMAO

Bad business aside, the 'full' game was great lol
Sw/Sh at least had new ideas and tried to be bold in ways, even if it stumbled in the story and character departments.

X/Y did **nothing**. those games are so bland that they make mayo seem like an exotic and spicy condiment.
I *understand* that people are upset because they feel like the Xpacs are a way to get away with shipping an unfinished game. But can we please *also* contextualize that against the fact that the old method of a 3rd version that's the same, but slightly different, and sold at full price, could very easily be argued to be the same tactic? And that the 3rd version method was *more* expensive since you paid full game price twice instead of buying a game + DLC?

If we're mad the new games aren't polished enough we shouldn't take it out on the Xpacs, IMO. Expanding on our base games is so much better. We get to continue our adventure with our teams with additional postgame content at DLC prices. Instead of restarting and playing through almost exactly the same game a second time at full price.
I think this is it. Kalos turns a decade old this year, and people who felt teased with it remembered XY and the empty feeling it left you with: Zygarde just kind of being there, very limited explanation of AZ and his story, wanting to know more about the war, etc. 

I think a lot of us were hoping and coping for Megas to return too since that is probably easily the most beloved Gen 6+ feature we’ve had.
At the very least, I can honestly say ORAS were the last *good* remakes. So far anyways, but after BDSP I am... not very confident about how a BW/BW2 remake will turn out.
I didn't play RSE at all (still haven't) and still think ORAS is my second favorite release behind HGSS, so it's definitely not just nostalgia.
Wdym much worse? HM's sucked
I'll take riding pokemon over wasting an entire move slot for an awful (with three exceptions) move
