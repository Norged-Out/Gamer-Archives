Legit though
    What's that? A new psychic type!?
        Nah, you're thinking of Teemphlair.

Our time has come! 

Revenge of the trainers!
    I’ve played so many of the Pokémon games and legitimately enjoyed most of them but I’ve never felt more like a trainer than when playing arceus
        Exactly. Catching pokemon is absolutely amazing, and it's incredibly smooth. Normally I would only catch pokemon I wanted through the story, but now I actually try to catch any pokemon I see
            over 24hrs play time and i havent even tried kleavor yet (i do have my own though), 7 star ranking and i still have so much to do just in the first area
                damn you haven't done kleavor yet and you are rank 7 ??
                    im slowly working on perfect dex entries, i know you can get to 8th star easily because im only ~1.5k away from it and still have so much to do; i wonder what the absolute limit is, id need to see the requirements for each star to speculate further
                        I’m working on 10th star now and it requires as much experience as stars 1-9 combined
                            just hit 8th star, which required 20k research points

need another 10k (30k total) for 9th star... i dont think this will be possible before kleavor, or if it is itll be real tight

so it sounds like 30k (60k total) for 10th? fairly sure thats not possible pre kleavor; shame; wouldve been a cool goal
                        I tip my hat to you. I thought I’d do something similar, but got carried away, and now I’m mucking about in the second area, running from level 45 alphas. :D
                            I avoided all of the alphas until I was half way done with the fourth area. Now I’m going back and catching them.
                                They do just spawn randomly. Every random spawn has somewhere between .2-2% to be an alpha depending on the Pokémon
                                    I think that’s only after you quell the frenzy in an area before others start spawning as alphas. 

At least that’s what I’ve noticed. I’m in the fourth area but have not done the frenzy yet, so no extra alphas.
                            its funny because its only like this because i always get distracted on my way to kleavor doing other things; once i hit 6th star i figured i may as well just roll with it and see how high i can get beforehand

im now 8th star with a lvl 59 samurott and 6 lvl 60 alakazams on the ranch... i dont think ill be able to reach 9 stars without progressing MSQ forwards though, its 20k total research points to reach 8* and 30k to reach 9*; so id need to scrounge up another 50% and i dont see that happening since the bulk of research points focus around the rank 10 entries
                                I assume you got as far as you did thanks to the space-time distortions?
                                    nope, no space time distortions (do they even spawn this early?)

also only had one mass outbreak (bidoof)
                        lol that some patience
                            Just throw pokeballs at everything. Thats what im doing lol. 

Im also broke and catching pokemon is a good way for money as far as i can tell
                                I think it’s more the patience to not do the story (at least that’s how I see it). I beat the story ~20 levels underlevelled because I’m impatient
                                Living exposition to exposition just like me I see haha dropping about 5,000 after one trip AND crafting 20-40 balls
                I also haven’t tried the Kleavor yet because I been running around trying to complete the Dex in the beginning area.

Any tips on how to catch light or heavy Pokémon? So far I feel that it is random.😞

Right now my rank is 3.
                    It is a bit

The size of the pokemon does actually vary a bit. Trying to get that damn large buizel for the security guy... still haven't managed it (got a few 2' 7" ones)... but getting an eye for larger ones of them haha
                        I just got him an alpha one
                            where can you find the alpha one?
                                South of worn bridge near the alpha floatzel is where I caught mine
                                Windswept run was where I found one at night
                                There’s one that spawns on the little beach east of the worn bridge, near the entrance of oreburrow tunnel.  He’s how I beat that quest.
                                    What level were your pokes when you did it?
                        i ended up having to find and catch an alpha buizel just to get that one done. XD
                            I havent seen one :( otherwise I would have gotten him one to get it done haha
                                yeah, i've only seen 2 myself
                    It is random as it's based on their size which is a random roll when it spawns.  The cool thing is the model in world does show you the size so if you see a smaller one it's light and a larger one it's heavy.
                        I love seeing super tiny mons. Like I came across this teeny tiny graveler and it was just so adorable
                    Feather ball seems to be the best one for me.  You can throw it very far and can catch almost everything with it.
                    sometimes i can just tell by looking at them (machop in oreburgh cave for example are ones i can tell the size/weight easily)... but if i cant (abra) then i just catch every one i see until i get the required amount of light/heavy specimens
                        When I'm getting to the end of regular "caught" count and still have light/heavy left I'll save before catching new ones and reset and use them to increase my "defeated" count if they don't trigger the light/heavy count.
                            oh thats smart, i hit the caught count on abra far before light specimens so wasted a lot of potential defeats on captures... then again, depending on spawn scarcity its probably not always worth the time it takes to save and reset
                                Oh yeah, don't waste your time on like Bidoof or Starly or something, but for rarer stuff it's totally worth it.
                How do you get the item to evolve scyther into kleavor? I can't find it anywhere
                    Graveler drops it more commonly in the 4-5 area
                    I think I got one in the 2nd area without realizing it. You can dig it up, or rarely it can be in the ore deposites.
                        i've been praising >!lord ursaluna!< for getting me one
                            I've been lucky enough to get three from him, but still working on getting some of the evolution stones.
                                well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
                    i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them
                Is there a benefit to completing all of the tasks on one Pokemon? I've just been getting them to level 10 to "complete the entry."
                    increased shiny rates apparently
                    the shiny rates for that Pokemon doubles when you get to rank 10. It increases by 50% again when you complete every task for a pokemon.
                        No, it doubles each time. Rank 10 adds 1 roll(for a total 2) and Perfect adds 2 rolls(for a total of 4)

Of course this is before factoring in Shiny Charm or Mass Outbreaks, since the extra rolls are a flat increase rather than a multiplier it won't double for people with the Shiny Charm since it adds 3 rolls so Perfect Pokédex entry would increase the number of rolls from 5 to 7. Mass Outbreaks add a whopping 25 rolls, so anything else is a drop in the bucket in comparison too.
                    rank 10 dex entry is 2/4096 chance of a shiny

perfect dex entry is 4/4096 chance of a shiny

but mostly for completionist purposes
                I ended up in a similar position, although I'm not sure I took quite as long on the first area. I was level 6 (almost 7) and my team was in the high 40s/low 50s.

It didn't help matters that in the next area I caught a lvl 55 and a lvl 65 alpha. Ended up with a highly overlevelled team early on because getting those first 7 stars can be done rather quickly.
                did the exact opposite, through most of the endgame legends and still 6 star. Looking forward to going back and collecting however
            Fr
        PLA might have its issues, but the one thing I believe they absolutely knocked out of the park is battles. If both Pokémon ran around a bit more, it’d be on the nose on how i imagined Pokémon battles as a youth. It’s so much more dynamic and I love it.
            Dude same, I'm not even mad when the enemy mon gets three hits in a row or some bullshit. It feels real as fuck
                Starly is keeping its guard up

Starly used tackle

Starly ran away. 

Fucker hit and ran me
                    the thing where pokemon run is the one thing I dont like
                        The trick is to hit them in the back, that way they won't escape
                not the biggest fan of the turn changes, but it certainly is refreshing and feels so much better on a certain level.
                    I totally get that.  I love them cus it makes the game harder but I also have no idea what determines turn order anymore and I totally get why that's not fun for people.
                        You can hit Y during battle and it will tell you the turn order.
                        Agile style and quick attack allow you to attack twice in a row from what i can tell. 

A quick attack followed by a strong attack is a pretty good combo if you know youll faint it
                            It looks like it’s just based on speed initially, then certain moves have different modifiers to attack order, which appear to carry forward to future turns as well
                                it seems a couple of things change turn speed though, but all the modifiers are hidden.

switching pokemon and using items seem like they increase turn speed a bit? 

knocking out a pokemon seems to give the enemy trainer a free turn, even if my turn was next in the turn order.

some moves have a different turn speed modifier - status moves give you earlier turns sometimes even without using it in agile style

engaging a wild pokemon without a backstrike seems to give them an initial turn speed boost. enemy trainers also seem to have an inherent initial turn speed boost and go first every time even if i'm overlevelled.

among other things 🤔
                                    I do like how the new turn system sneakily removed the Switch battle style where you get to respond to enemy switches with your own - you barely notice it since most fights in the game are against wild Pokémon, but in the endgame where you get into trainer fights with 4 to 6 Pokémon it feels a lot like playing in Set Mode and they can do some real damage.
                I still don’t understand move order but I don’t even care tbh, it’s fun
                    Low key I think it's just random but favors the enemy. I do not get how it works at all.
                        It's not random at all lol, unless you both have the same speed stat and level and neither use any boosting or agile style moves in which case yes it'll be determined by a coin flip.
                    Didn’t the game say it’s based on speed stat and certain moves (quick attack/agile style)?

Edit: genuinely don’t remember. I feel like this was mentioned, but it of course wouldn’t have given exact adjustments.
                        Yeah they did, but it gets weird when you switch out Pokémon mid-battle. Sometimes the AI will go twice/three times in a row. I’m sure it’s mathematically correct, it’s just weird.
                            I’ve also had it where I use an item and immediately get to go again so maybe items and Pokémon switching have an affect on priority too?
                Its annoyed me against an alpha... trying to catch it in the ball and it smashes my guy a few times in a row :( really annoying

Otherwise... really good
            What I wish they would have done is have Pokémon actually dodge attacks when I’m supposed to miss

It would be so much cooler to show the fire blast animation and then have the enemy Pokémon dodge roll or jump out of the way and the message say “You missed”
            yea if the Mons just made a bit more movements \*perfect\*
            Arceus is the like the alpha version of what I hope pokemon eventually becomes.  Fun but very low effort and janky.  So much potential to improve with a little polish.
                My exact thoughts. The things they did right, they did damn right. The things they lacked on, lack a ton. Praying for an update down the line
                    Yeah just little things like giving them better AI in the field or at least more varied patterns.  Seeing a gyrados just flying in a circle for all eternity is kinda lame.  Also pokemon attacking the trainer are a complete non issue outside of some story bosses.  Would be nice if the trainer got more involved in catching or getting the advantage on some of the more advanced mons.   I don't expect Monster Hunter levels of depth but it could use a little more.
            They just need to allow us to control the Pokemon directly.
        [deleted]
            lol yea there's certainly a lot to keep anyone busy
        Amen to that
            entering new poke spawns is so seamless too.  i'm just riding along like...'wait...' \*stops\* 'is that..is that an abra??'  just popping around hahah.  little moments like that you just couldn't get in the traditional games
        first game ive played where the pokedex research felt like more than a plot device too.
            exactly.  i mean i never gave a whit about Buziel before.  I couldn't tell a bidoof from a bibarel

now i can spot a lot of 'Mons from far off and tell what they are

i feel like i'm learning a new skill, lol
        It's the first time I felt like the pokedex actually mattered as well. You're not just catching them to add their name to a list, you're learning about them and documenting as you go, not just trusting an old man to tell you everything out the gate. 

It's a little grindy but honestly so much better at keep me engaged.
    well pla is set in the past so maybe it was the pokemon who got revenge after all
        they learned from the best, PLA protag is to blame
    Trainers rise up!
    Given that this game takes place in the past, it’s more like the Pokémon in every other game is getting revenge *on us*.
    Wild trainer appears!
    Since it is a prequel... What if they learned to hide in the grass from us? And then perfected it!
Now we catch them unaware! Hahaha
    why does the game say "unawares"? is it a spelling mistake?
        I think "unawares" is actually grammatically correct.
            From merriam Webster site

“The common adverbial form of the adjective 'unaware' is 'unawares'. It's not a mistake—it's a holdover from Middle English.”
        I learnt this as a kid from Scar’s song in Lion King, ‘Be Prepared’. It is, apparently, ‘unawares’.
            I learned it from a trippy tv show called bananas in pajamas
I was just thinking this! Honestly, it’s more realistic. Now we just need a crawling prone option
    If they aren't scared away by my big bobbing red hat over the grass they deserve to be caught.
        This is why I wear the qpven hat. Blends in with the grass.
            Where do you get the qpven hat?
                I think they mean the woven hat. I personally don't like it much. It's available at the cloth store not too long into the gsme
                    I see what you did tgere
                A.    w
    You can't go prone in the new game?
        Nope, just crouch and roll. The rolling is pretty nice tho. Makes me feel like I’m fighting dark souls bosses lol
            Do you ever get a Tangela Ghillie Suit? Ghost Recon some pokefools?
                no, but you can get smoke bombs that are basically instant cover, so you can pretend to be a ninja with your socks in sandals
            if you hold b down during the roll, you end the roll in a crouch
                I noticed that cause I always Yeet the ball from behind and then duck for cover in case it doesn’t work.
Hey what you do in the tall grass is none of my business
    I will make it your business!
        Depends if you wash your hands afterwards u/Dukmiester

            Turn tabled have
                Have a turn table
Maybe we're who they learned it from
    This is too much for my easily amazed brain to handle
    I was just wondering this too!
Maybe that’s how Pokémon learned to hide in tall grass, after more people came out looking to find and capture Pokémon that were carelessly roaming freely they started hiding in grass like the people would
    Or maybe they learned how to ambush people from the grass and that was your true legacy that you passed down?😂
        Probably, cause it clearly wasn’t the completed Pokédex
I got why pokemons today hides on grasses now. Years of terrors
A wild Trainer attacked!
Except on the water. I've been loving the game, but getting Basculegion felt like a downgrade for catching stuff since I can't seem to "sneak" worth a damn; having to actually *battle* most things to catch them is a pain with how the battle mechanics seem to work.
    I’m not there yet but later in the game you get access to smoke bombs so you can create your own “tall grass”. Alternatively use berries and lures to bring the Pokémon to you
        Oh, shit, hadn't even thought about using items on the water.
        Oh my god how have I never thought of this. I basically just gave up on getting any of the Pokemon deep in the water.
    It would be cool if we could dive underwater for a short while as way to "sneak" on Basculegion
        Goggles like that one warden had and a snorkel. Unlimited water sneak!
        It’s not exactly the same, but if you jump & aim your pokeball immediately, time will slow down and you’ll have a better chance of getting the pokeball in before they notice you. You can dash in the air too for extra speed / airtime.
    You need to do the double jump above them, then bullet time the throw. If you time the jump right they usually don't see you
        They always seem to spot my immediately when I jump.
            Jump from out of range. They don't notice you if you're above the water, in my experience anyway.
    Its actually fun to me to chase them down on fishback, it has that feeling of shooting a bow and arrow from horseback in BotW
I mean technically Pokemon got the idea from us hiding in the grass since the game takes place in the past
    They also stopped evolving so much in the wild. Yup they got that from us too.
I’m glad I’m not the only one skulking around in the tall grass in Hisui thinking “tables have turned bitches” 😂
Can you make one for Sneasler carrying you around to the Steve buscemi hello fellow children meme?
Honestly this is one thing in this game I think makes sense.  
This is before trainers where every where. This means Pokemon are more free to roam with out danger. Trainers on the other hand have small numbers so they must take to the grass to hide. As time goes on and more trainers start showing up. The Pokemon start hiding from trainers using things like tall grass and caves to avoid the trainers on the main roads.
Oh how the turntables…
I'm not happy about it, but take my updoot.
My brother felt it was necessary to point out how instead of Pokémon popping out of the grass to assault you, you pop out of the grass to assault Pokémon. And I think that’s poetic
Beat meme I’ve seen this year
More like "don't look at me" though
Pulled an uno reverse card on em
Still doesn’t stop every Zubat/Golbat in the area zooming in on my sorry ass lol.
    That goddamn sonar ability of bats
What’s happening for my mans fingers though lmao
I like how this game reverse-uno’d the tall grass. Before - you go in grass to find hidden Pokémon. Now - Pokémon go on grass to find hidden you.
Wild Trainer appears!
Well, well, well. How the turn tables...
I loves this game. Anyone else got freaked out by the Arcanine battle, though?
    Just wait.... I legit walked into a battle and immediately said... "I f@cked up"
In sinnoh grass hide Pokémon , in mother hisui grass hide You

Edit: our
Technically if the game happens in the past, you are teaching future generations of Pokemon to hide in the grass
Lol I think this every time I crouch in the grass “hahaha, my turn now, motherfuckers.”
Look how the tables have turned
"Don't go out! It's unsafe! Wild HUMANs live in tall grass! You need your own HUMAN for your protection!"
    "How do you get one? Simple, stay clear of the tall grass till you see a berry where it shouldn't be, this is the first sign that a human is interested in you rather than trying to sacrifice you to the pokémon that have enthralled them. Make sure the coast is clear then go for the berry, while eating it the human will throw you their invitation. If you choose to accept, relax. Congratulations, you have now enslaved yourself a caregiver, either your human personally or an associate that they have arranged to look after your wants and needs. If something about you strikes your humans fancy then they will do their best to make you able to rival or match even the mighty legendaries."
Thanks for the love and awards everyone.

PLA is so close to the game I imagined I was playing when I was 7 years old with Pokemon Red.

It's great to see how positive everyone is for the future of Pokemon after this giant step in the right direction.

Enjoy Hisui everyone, and may your shinies be frequent and plentiful!
Imagine all of the Zubat YOU can now jump out at every 3 steps in caves
Lol yeah I saw a tiktok meme about this, it was an animation of a pokemon in tall grass smirking transitioning to legends arceus where the trainer was smirking and the pokemon was scared now
Now you know how that feels! Get rekt Pokémons!
This was basically the first thing my wife said when she started playing the game in earnest.

"Now *I* am the one who lurks in the tall grass!"
Is it true there are only ~250 Pokémon in the game?
    242, yes
        Okay cool, thanks
            There's only 151 real ones anyways.

This just makes me wish for a Russian Pokémon region. The fact that Russia is technically north of Sinnoh/Hisui just adds onto it.
"Hides"
I get to hide in tall grass! I get to randomly attack you! You get to knock me out!

&#x200B;

wait, that’s not very good.
If I didn't see it today, I was about to make it myself. Kudos, OP. Take my free award
“Get in the pokeball…no one gets hurt…easy.”

Sneaking up on an alpha machoke and I throw my heavy ball 6 inches and he yeets me to Kanto.
This is so true. What a pleasant new game experience too. Hopefully more Legends are to follow
I've been watching my gf play and this absolutely checks out. It's so truuuue.
But don't look at me!
I’m in the tall grass doing drive bys with all the the heavy and lead balls I can throw.
What if you are teaching them to hide in the grass?
Except don't actually look at me. I get that bonus if this Pokéball hits you in the back.
Must be where all future pokemon learned it from!
I legit was stalking a Pokémon and it was coming close to the tall grass. I said don’t go into the tall grass. Threw a ball. Then continued there are humans there
in ancient hisui, pokemon faint you
Is the game good? I thought it had potential but figured I'd wait to see reactions after the initial day or two
    It's amazing. Yeah you can gripe about minor things but it's something you have to experience.
Oh, how the tables have turned…
Our time has come! 

Revenge of the trainers!

Same storie, different roles
Funny how the turnandos have tablones, isn't it
Except when they do it they waste 15 seconds of your time but when you do it you imprison them for life.
And when you throw a ball it doinks off them.
ME TOO OH MY GOD
So I guess it was our fault... they learned it from us...
😂😂😂😂
This absolutely tickled me :D
What's that? A new psychic type!?
    Nah, you're thinking of Teemphlair.

I’ve played so many of the Pokémon games and legitimately enjoyed most of them but I’ve never felt more like a trainer than when playing arceus
    Exactly. Catching pokemon is absolutely amazing, and it's incredibly smooth. Normally I would only catch pokemon I wanted through the story, but now I actually try to catch any pokemon I see
        over 24hrs play time and i havent even tried kleavor yet (i do have my own though), 7 star ranking and i still have so much to do just in the first area
            damn you haven't done kleavor yet and you are rank 7 ??
                im slowly working on perfect dex entries, i know you can get to 8th star easily because im only ~1.5k away from it and still have so much to do; i wonder what the absolute limit is, id need to see the requirements for each star to speculate further
                    I’m working on 10th star now and it requires as much experience as stars 1-9 combined
                        just hit 8th star, which required 20k research points

need another 10k (30k total) for 9th star... i dont think this will be possible before kleavor, or if it is itll be real tight

so it sounds like 30k (60k total) for 10th? fairly sure thats not possible pre kleavor; shame; wouldve been a cool goal
                    I tip my hat to you. I thought I’d do something similar, but got carried away, and now I’m mucking about in the second area, running from level 45 alphas. :D
                        I avoided all of the alphas until I was half way done with the fourth area. Now I’m going back and catching them.
                            They do just spawn randomly. Every random spawn has somewhere between .2-2% to be an alpha depending on the Pokémon
                                I think that’s only after you quell the frenzy in an area before others start spawning as alphas. 

At least that’s what I’ve noticed. I’m in the fourth area but have not done the frenzy yet, so no extra alphas.
                        its funny because its only like this because i always get distracted on my way to kleavor doing other things; once i hit 6th star i figured i may as well just roll with it and see how high i can get beforehand

im now 8th star with a lvl 59 samurott and 6 lvl 60 alakazams on the ranch... i dont think ill be able to reach 9 stars without progressing MSQ forwards though, its 20k total research points to reach 8* and 30k to reach 9*; so id need to scrounge up another 50% and i dont see that happening since the bulk of research points focus around the rank 10 entries
                            I assume you got as far as you did thanks to the space-time distortions?
                                nope, no space time distortions (do they even spawn this early?)

also only had one mass outbreak (bidoof)
                    lol that some patience
                        Just throw pokeballs at everything. Thats what im doing lol. 

Im also broke and catching pokemon is a good way for money as far as i can tell
                            I think it’s more the patience to not do the story (at least that’s how I see it). I beat the story ~20 levels underlevelled because I’m impatient
                            Living exposition to exposition just like me I see haha dropping about 5,000 after one trip AND crafting 20-40 balls
            I also haven’t tried the Kleavor yet because I been running around trying to complete the Dex in the beginning area.

Any tips on how to catch light or heavy Pokémon? So far I feel that it is random.😞

Right now my rank is 3.
                It is a bit

The size of the pokemon does actually vary a bit. Trying to get that damn large buizel for the security guy... still haven't managed it (got a few 2' 7" ones)... but getting an eye for larger ones of them haha
                    I just got him an alpha one
                        where can you find the alpha one?
                            South of worn bridge near the alpha floatzel is where I caught mine
                            Windswept run was where I found one at night
                            There’s one that spawns on the little beach east of the worn bridge, near the entrance of oreburrow tunnel.  He’s how I beat that quest.
                                What level were your pokes when you did it?
                    i ended up having to find and catch an alpha buizel just to get that one done. XD
                        I havent seen one :( otherwise I would have gotten him one to get it done haha
                            yeah, i've only seen 2 myself
                It is random as it's based on their size which is a random roll when it spawns.  The cool thing is the model in world does show you the size so if you see a smaller one it's light and a larger one it's heavy.
                    I love seeing super tiny mons. Like I came across this teeny tiny graveler and it was just so adorable
                Feather ball seems to be the best one for me.  You can throw it very far and can catch almost everything with it.
                sometimes i can just tell by looking at them (machop in oreburgh cave for example are ones i can tell the size/weight easily)... but if i cant (abra) then i just catch every one i see until i get the required amount of light/heavy specimens
                    When I'm getting to the end of regular "caught" count and still have light/heavy left I'll save before catching new ones and reset and use them to increase my "defeated" count if they don't trigger the light/heavy count.
                        oh thats smart, i hit the caught count on abra far before light specimens so wasted a lot of potential defeats on captures... then again, depending on spawn scarcity its probably not always worth the time it takes to save and reset
                            Oh yeah, don't waste your time on like Bidoof or Starly or something, but for rarer stuff it's totally worth it.
            How do you get the item to evolve scyther into kleavor? I can't find it anywhere
                Graveler drops it more commonly in the 4-5 area
                I think I got one in the 2nd area without realizing it. You can dig it up, or rarely it can be in the ore deposites.
                    i've been praising >!lord ursaluna!< for getting me one
                        I've been lucky enough to get three from him, but still working on getting some of the evolution stones.
                            well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
                i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them
            Is there a benefit to completing all of the tasks on one Pokemon? I've just been getting them to level 10 to "complete the entry."
                increased shiny rates apparently
                the shiny rates for that Pokemon doubles when you get to rank 10. It increases by 50% again when you complete every task for a pokemon.
                    No, it doubles each time. Rank 10 adds 1 roll(for a total 2) and Perfect adds 2 rolls(for a total of 4)

Of course this is before factoring in Shiny Charm or Mass Outbreaks, since the extra rolls are a flat increase rather than a multiplier it won't double for people with the Shiny Charm since it adds 3 rolls so Perfect Pokédex entry would increase the number of rolls from 5 to 7. Mass Outbreaks add a whopping 25 rolls, so anything else is a drop in the bucket in comparison too.
                rank 10 dex entry is 2/4096 chance of a shiny

perfect dex entry is 4/4096 chance of a shiny

but mostly for completionist purposes
            I ended up in a similar position, although I'm not sure I took quite as long on the first area. I was level 6 (almost 7) and my team was in the high 40s/low 50s.

It didn't help matters that in the next area I caught a lvl 55 and a lvl 65 alpha. Ended up with a highly overlevelled team early on because getting those first 7 stars can be done rather quickly.
            did the exact opposite, through most of the endgame legends and still 6 star. Looking forward to going back and collecting however
        Fr
    PLA might have its issues, but the one thing I believe they absolutely knocked out of the park is battles. If both Pokémon ran around a bit more, it’d be on the nose on how i imagined Pokémon battles as a youth. It’s so much more dynamic and I love it.
        Dude same, I'm not even mad when the enemy mon gets three hits in a row or some bullshit. It feels real as fuck
            Starly is keeping its guard up

Starly used tackle

Starly ran away. 

Fucker hit and ran me
                the thing where pokemon run is the one thing I dont like
                    The trick is to hit them in the back, that way they won't escape
            not the biggest fan of the turn changes, but it certainly is refreshing and feels so much better on a certain level.
                I totally get that.  I love them cus it makes the game harder but I also have no idea what determines turn order anymore and I totally get why that's not fun for people.
                    You can hit Y during battle and it will tell you the turn order.
                    Agile style and quick attack allow you to attack twice in a row from what i can tell. 

A quick attack followed by a strong attack is a pretty good combo if you know youll faint it
                        It looks like it’s just based on speed initially, then certain moves have different modifiers to attack order, which appear to carry forward to future turns as well
                            it seems a couple of things change turn speed though, but all the modifiers are hidden.

switching pokemon and using items seem like they increase turn speed a bit? 

knocking out a pokemon seems to give the enemy trainer a free turn, even if my turn was next in the turn order.

some moves have a different turn speed modifier - status moves give you earlier turns sometimes even without using it in agile style

engaging a wild pokemon without a backstrike seems to give them an initial turn speed boost. enemy trainers also seem to have an inherent initial turn speed boost and go first every time even if i'm overlevelled.

among other things 🤔
                                I do like how the new turn system sneakily removed the Switch battle style where you get to respond to enemy switches with your own - you barely notice it since most fights in the game are against wild Pokémon, but in the endgame where you get into trainer fights with 4 to 6 Pokémon it feels a lot like playing in Set Mode and they can do some real damage.
            I still don’t understand move order but I don’t even care tbh, it’s fun
                Low key I think it's just random but favors the enemy. I do not get how it works at all.
                    It's not random at all lol, unless you both have the same speed stat and level and neither use any boosting or agile style moves in which case yes it'll be determined by a coin flip.
                Didn’t the game say it’s based on speed stat and certain moves (quick attack/agile style)?

Edit: genuinely don’t remember. I feel like this was mentioned, but it of course wouldn’t have given exact adjustments.
                    Yeah they did, but it gets weird when you switch out Pokémon mid-battle. Sometimes the AI will go twice/three times in a row. I’m sure it’s mathematically correct, it’s just weird.
                        I’ve also had it where I use an item and immediately get to go again so maybe items and Pokémon switching have an affect on priority too?
            Its annoyed me against an alpha... trying to catch it in the ball and it smashes my guy a few times in a row :( really annoying

Otherwise... really good
        What I wish they would have done is have Pokémon actually dodge attacks when I’m supposed to miss

It would be so much cooler to show the fire blast animation and then have the enemy Pokémon dodge roll or jump out of the way and the message say “You missed”
        yea if the Mons just made a bit more movements \*perfect\*
        Arceus is the like the alpha version of what I hope pokemon eventually becomes.  Fun but very low effort and janky.  So much potential to improve with a little polish.
            My exact thoughts. The things they did right, they did damn right. The things they lacked on, lack a ton. Praying for an update down the line
                Yeah just little things like giving them better AI in the field or at least more varied patterns.  Seeing a gyrados just flying in a circle for all eternity is kinda lame.  Also pokemon attacking the trainer are a complete non issue outside of some story bosses.  Would be nice if the trainer got more involved in catching or getting the advantage on some of the more advanced mons.   I don't expect Monster Hunter levels of depth but it could use a little more.
        They just need to allow us to control the Pokemon directly.
    [deleted]
        lol yea there's certainly a lot to keep anyone busy
    Amen to that
        entering new poke spawns is so seamless too.  i'm just riding along like...'wait...' \*stops\* 'is that..is that an abra??'  just popping around hahah.  little moments like that you just couldn't get in the traditional games
    first game ive played where the pokedex research felt like more than a plot device too.
        exactly.  i mean i never gave a whit about Buziel before.  I couldn't tell a bidoof from a bibarel

now i can spot a lot of 'Mons from far off and tell what they are

i feel like i'm learning a new skill, lol
    It's the first time I felt like the pokedex actually mattered as well. You're not just catching them to add their name to a list, you're learning about them and documenting as you go, not just trusting an old man to tell you everything out the gate. 

It's a little grindy but honestly so much better at keep me engaged.
well pla is set in the past so maybe it was the pokemon who got revenge after all
    they learned from the best, PLA protag is to blame
Trainers rise up!
Given that this game takes place in the past, it’s more like the Pokémon in every other game is getting revenge *on us*.
Wild trainer appears!
Since it is a prequel... What if they learned to hide in the grass from us? And then perfected it!
why does the game say "unawares"? is it a spelling mistake?
    I think "unawares" is actually grammatically correct.
        From merriam Webster site

“The common adverbial form of the adjective 'unaware' is 'unawares'. It's not a mistake—it's a holdover from Middle English.”
    I learnt this as a kid from Scar’s song in Lion King, ‘Be Prepared’. It is, apparently, ‘unawares’.
        I learned it from a trippy tv show called bananas in pajamas
If they aren't scared away by my big bobbing red hat over the grass they deserve to be caught.
    This is why I wear the qpven hat. Blends in with the grass.
        Where do you get the qpven hat?
            I think they mean the woven hat. I personally don't like it much. It's available at the cloth store not too long into the gsme
                I see what you did tgere
            A.    w
You can't go prone in the new game?
    Nope, just crouch and roll. The rolling is pretty nice tho. Makes me feel like I’m fighting dark souls bosses lol
        Do you ever get a Tangela Ghillie Suit? Ghost Recon some pokefools?
            no, but you can get smoke bombs that are basically instant cover, so you can pretend to be a ninja with your socks in sandals
        if you hold b down during the roll, you end the roll in a crouch
            I noticed that cause I always Yeet the ball from behind and then duck for cover in case it doesn’t work.
I will make it your business!
    Depends if you wash your hands afterwards u/Dukmiester

The Turns have tabled
    Have tabled the turns?
        Turns the table have.
            Table have the turns
        Turn tabled have
            Have a turn table
This is too much for my easily amazed brain to handle
I was just wondering this too!
Or maybe they learned how to ambush people from the grass and that was your true legacy that you passed down?😂
    Probably, cause it clearly wasn’t the completed Pokédex
I’m not there yet but later in the game you get access to smoke bombs so you can create your own “tall grass”. Alternatively use berries and lures to bring the Pokémon to you
    Oh, shit, hadn't even thought about using items on the water.
    Oh my god how have I never thought of this. I basically just gave up on getting any of the Pokemon deep in the water.
It would be cool if we could dive underwater for a short while as way to "sneak" on Basculegion
    Goggles like that one warden had and a snorkel. Unlimited water sneak!
    It’s not exactly the same, but if you jump & aim your pokeball immediately, time will slow down and you’ll have a better chance of getting the pokeball in before they notice you. You can dash in the air too for extra speed / airtime.
You need to do the double jump above them, then bullet time the throw. If you time the jump right they usually don't see you
    They always seem to spot my immediately when I jump.
        Jump from out of range. They don't notice you if you're above the water, in my experience anyway.
Its actually fun to me to chase them down on fishback, it has that feeling of shooting a bow and arrow from horseback in BotW
They also stopped evolving so much in the wild. Yup they got that from us too.
That goddamn sonar ability of bats
Just wait.... I legit walked into a battle and immediately said... "I f@cked up"
"How do you get one? Simple, stay clear of the tall grass till you see a berry where it shouldn't be, this is the first sign that a human is interested in you rather than trying to sacrifice you to the pokémon that have enthralled them. Make sure the coast is clear then go for the berry, while eating it the human will throw you their invitation. If you choose to accept, relax. Congratulations, you have now enslaved yourself a caregiver, either your human personally or an associate that they have arranged to look after your wants and needs. If something about you strikes your humans fancy then they will do their best to make you able to rival or match even the mighty legendaries."
242, yes
    Okay cool, thanks
        There's only 151 real ones anyways.

            I think I got one in the 2nd area without realizing it. You can dig it up, or rarely it can be in the ore deposites.
                i've been praising >!lord ursaluna!< for getting me one
                    I've been lucky enough to get three from him, but still working on getting some of the evolution stones.
                        well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
            i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them
        Is there a benefit to completing all of the tasks on one Pokemon? I've just been getting them to level 10 to "complete the entry."
            increased shiny rates apparently
            the shiny rates for that Pokemon doubles when you get to rank 10. It increases by 50% again when you complete every task for a pokemon.
                No, it doubles each time. Rank 10 adds 1 roll(for a total 2) and Perfect adds 2 rolls(for a total of 4)

Of course this is before factoring in Shiny Charm or Mass Outbreaks, since the extra rolls are a flat increase rather than a multiplier it won't double for people with the Shiny Charm since it adds 3 rolls so Perfect Pokédex entry would increase the number of rolls from 5 to 7. Mass Outbreaks add a whopping 25 rolls, so anything else is a drop in the bucket in comparison too.
            rank 10 dex entry is 2/4096 chance of a shiny

perfect dex entry is 4/4096 chance of a shiny

but mostly for completionist purposes
        I ended up in a similar position, although I'm not sure I took quite as long on the first area. I was level 6 (almost 7) and my team was in the high 40s/low 50s.

It didn't help matters that in the next area I caught a lvl 55 and a lvl 65 alpha. Ended up with a highly overlevelled team early on because getting those first 7 stars can be done rather quickly.
        did the exact opposite, through most of the endgame legends and still 6 star. Looking forward to going back and collecting however
    Fr
PLA might have its issues, but the one thing I believe they absolutely knocked out of the park is battles. If both Pokémon ran around a bit more, it’d be on the nose on how i imagined Pokémon battles as a youth. It’s so much more dynamic and I love it.
    Dude same, I'm not even mad when the enemy mon gets three hits in a row or some bullshit. It feels real as fuck
        Starly is keeping its guard up

Starly used tackle

Starly ran away. 

Fucker hit and ran me
            the thing where pokemon run is the one thing I dont like
                The trick is to hit them in the back, that way they won't escape
        not the biggest fan of the turn changes, but it certainly is refreshing and feels so much better on a certain level.
            I totally get that.  I love them cus it makes the game harder but I also have no idea what determines turn order anymore and I totally get why that's not fun for people.
                You can hit Y during battle and it will tell you the turn order.
                Agile style and quick attack allow you to attack twice in a row from what i can tell. 

A quick attack followed by a strong attack is a pretty good combo if you know youll faint it
                    It looks like it’s just based on speed initially, then certain moves have different modifiers to attack order, which appear to carry forward to future turns as well
                        it seems a couple of things change turn speed though, but all the modifiers are hidden.

switching pokemon and using items seem like they increase turn speed a bit? 

knocking out a pokemon seems to give the enemy trainer a free turn, even if my turn was next in the turn order.

some moves have a different turn speed modifier - status moves give you earlier turns sometimes even without using it in agile style

engaging a wild pokemon without a backstrike seems to give them an initial turn speed boost. enemy trainers also seem to have an inherent initial turn speed boost and go first every time even if i'm overlevelled.

among other things 🤔
                            I do like how the new turn system sneakily removed the Switch battle style where you get to respond to enemy switches with your own - you barely notice it since most fights in the game are against wild Pokémon, but in the endgame where you get into trainer fights with 4 to 6 Pokémon it feels a lot like playing in Set Mode and they can do some real damage.
        I still don’t understand move order but I don’t even care tbh, it’s fun
            Low key I think it's just random but favors the enemy. I do not get how it works at all.
                It's not random at all lol, unless you both have the same speed stat and level and neither use any boosting or agile style moves in which case yes it'll be determined by a coin flip.
            Didn’t the game say it’s based on speed stat and certain moves (quick attack/agile style)?

Edit: genuinely don’t remember. I feel like this was mentioned, but it of course wouldn’t have given exact adjustments.
                Yeah they did, but it gets weird when you switch out Pokémon mid-battle. Sometimes the AI will go twice/three times in a row. I’m sure it’s mathematically correct, it’s just weird.
                    I’ve also had it where I use an item and immediately get to go again so maybe items and Pokémon switching have an affect on priority too?
        Its annoyed me against an alpha... trying to catch it in the ball and it smashes my guy a few times in a row :( really annoying

Otherwise... really good
    What I wish they would have done is have Pokémon actually dodge attacks when I’m supposed to miss

It would be so much cooler to show the fire blast animation and then have the enemy Pokémon dodge roll or jump out of the way and the message say “You missed”
    yea if the Mons just made a bit more movements \*perfect\*
    Arceus is the like the alpha version of what I hope pokemon eventually becomes.  Fun but very low effort and janky.  So much potential to improve with a little polish.
        My exact thoughts. The things they did right, they did damn right. The things they lacked on, lack a ton. Praying for an update down the line
            Yeah just little things like giving them better AI in the field or at least more varied patterns.  Seeing a gyrados just flying in a circle for all eternity is kinda lame.  Also pokemon attacking the trainer are a complete non issue outside of some story bosses.  Would be nice if the trainer got more involved in catching or getting the advantage on some of the more advanced mons.   I don't expect Monster Hunter levels of depth but it could use a little more.
    They just need to allow us to control the Pokemon directly.
[deleted]
    lol yea there's certainly a lot to keep anyone busy
Amen to that
    entering new poke spawns is so seamless too.  i'm just riding along like...'wait...' \*stops\* 'is that..is that an abra??'  just popping around hahah.  little moments like that you just couldn't get in the traditional games
first game ive played where the pokedex research felt like more than a plot device too.
    exactly.  i mean i never gave a whit about Buziel before.  I couldn't tell a bidoof from a bibarel

now i can spot a lot of 'Mons from far off and tell what they are

i feel like i'm learning a new skill, lol
It's the first time I felt like the pokedex actually mattered as well. You're not just catching them to add their name to a list, you're learning about them and documenting as you go, not just trusting an old man to tell you everything out the gate. 

It's a little grindy but honestly so much better at keep me engaged.
they learned from the best, PLA protag is to blame
I think "unawares" is actually grammatically correct.
    From merriam Webster site

“The common adverbial form of the adjective 'unaware' is 'unawares'. It's not a mistake—it's a holdover from Middle English.”
I learnt this as a kid from Scar’s song in Lion King, ‘Be Prepared’. It is, apparently, ‘unawares’.
    I learned it from a trippy tv show called bananas in pajamas
This is why I wear the qpven hat. Blends in with the grass.
    Where do you get the qpven hat?
        I think they mean the woven hat. I personally don't like it much. It's available at the cloth store not too long into the gsme
            I see what you did tgere
        A.    w
Nope, just crouch and roll. The rolling is pretty nice tho. Makes me feel like I’m fighting dark souls bosses lol
    Do you ever get a Tangela Ghillie Suit? Ghost Recon some pokefools?
        no, but you can get smoke bombs that are basically instant cover, so you can pretend to be a ninja with your socks in sandals
    if you hold b down during the roll, you end the roll in a crouch
        I noticed that cause I always Yeet the ball from behind and then duck for cover in case it doesn’t work.
Depends if you wash your hands afterwards u/Dukmiester
Have tabled the turns?
    Turns the table have.
        Table have the turns
    Turn tabled have
        Have a turn table
Probably, cause it clearly wasn’t the completed Pokédex
Oh, shit, hadn't even thought about using items on the water.
Oh my god how have I never thought of this. I basically just gave up on getting any of the Pokemon deep in the water.
Goggles like that one warden had and a snorkel. Unlimited water sneak!
It’s not exactly the same, but if you jump & aim your pokeball immediately, time will slow down and you’ll have a better chance of getting the pokeball in before they notice you. You can dash in the air too for extra speed / airtime.
They always seem to spot my immediately when I jump.
    Jump from out of range. They don't notice you if you're above the water, in my experience anyway.
Okay cool, thanks
    There's only 151 real ones anyways.

over 24hrs play time and i havent even tried kleavor yet (i do have my own though), 7 star ranking and i still have so much to do just in the first area
    damn you haven't done kleavor yet and you are rank 7 ??
        im slowly working on perfect dex entries, i know you can get to 8th star easily because im only ~1.5k away from it and still have so much to do; i wonder what the absolute limit is, id need to see the requirements for each star to speculate further
            I’m working on 10th star now and it requires as much experience as stars 1-9 combined
                just hit 8th star, which required 20k research points

need another 10k (30k total) for 9th star... i dont think this will be possible before kleavor, or if it is itll be real tight

so it sounds like 30k (60k total) for 10th? fairly sure thats not possible pre kleavor; shame; wouldve been a cool goal
            I tip my hat to you. I thought I’d do something similar, but got carried away, and now I’m mucking about in the second area, running from level 45 alphas. :D
                I avoided all of the alphas until I was half way done with the fourth area. Now I’m going back and catching them.
                    They do just spawn randomly. Every random spawn has somewhere between .2-2% to be an alpha depending on the Pokémon
                        I think that’s only after you quell the frenzy in an area before others start spawning as alphas. 

At least that’s what I’ve noticed. I’m in the fourth area but have not done the frenzy yet, so no extra alphas.
                its funny because its only like this because i always get distracted on my way to kleavor doing other things; once i hit 6th star i figured i may as well just roll with it and see how high i can get beforehand

im now 8th star with a lvl 59 samurott and 6 lvl 60 alakazams on the ranch... i dont think ill be able to reach 9 stars without progressing MSQ forwards though, its 20k total research points to reach 8* and 30k to reach 9*; so id need to scrounge up another 50% and i dont see that happening since the bulk of research points focus around the rank 10 entries
                    I assume you got as far as you did thanks to the space-time distortions?
                        nope, no space time distortions (do they even spawn this early?)

also only had one mass outbreak (bidoof)
            lol that some patience
                Just throw pokeballs at everything. Thats what im doing lol. 

Im also broke and catching pokemon is a good way for money as far as i can tell
                    I think it’s more the patience to not do the story (at least that’s how I see it). I beat the story ~20 levels underlevelled because I’m impatient
                    Living exposition to exposition just like me I see haha dropping about 5,000 after one trip AND crafting 20-40 balls
    I also haven’t tried the Kleavor yet because I been running around trying to complete the Dex in the beginning area.

Any tips on how to catch light or heavy Pokémon? So far I feel that it is random.😞

Right now my rank is 3.
        It is a bit

The size of the pokemon does actually vary a bit. Trying to get that damn large buizel for the security guy... still haven't managed it (got a few 2' 7" ones)... but getting an eye for larger ones of them haha
            I just got him an alpha one
                where can you find the alpha one?
                    South of worn bridge near the alpha floatzel is where I caught mine
                    Windswept run was where I found one at night
                    There’s one that spawns on the little beach east of the worn bridge, near the entrance of oreburrow tunnel.  He’s how I beat that quest.
                        What level were your pokes when you did it?
            i ended up having to find and catch an alpha buizel just to get that one done. XD
                I havent seen one :( otherwise I would have gotten him one to get it done haha
                    yeah, i've only seen 2 myself
        It is random as it's based on their size which is a random roll when it spawns.  The cool thing is the model in world does show you the size so if you see a smaller one it's light and a larger one it's heavy.
            I love seeing super tiny mons. Like I came across this teeny tiny graveler and it was just so adorable
        Feather ball seems to be the best one for me.  You can throw it very far and can catch almost everything with it.
        sometimes i can just tell by looking at them (machop in oreburgh cave for example are ones i can tell the size/weight easily)... but if i cant (abra) then i just catch every one i see until i get the required amount of light/heavy specimens
            When I'm getting to the end of regular "caught" count and still have light/heavy left I'll save before catching new ones and reset and use them to increase my "defeated" count if they don't trigger the light/heavy count.
                oh thats smart, i hit the caught count on abra far before light specimens so wasted a lot of potential defeats on captures... then again, depending on spawn scarcity its probably not always worth the time it takes to save and reset
                    Oh yeah, don't waste your time on like Bidoof or Starly or something, but for rarer stuff it's totally worth it.
    How do you get the item to evolve scyther into kleavor? I can't find it anywhere
        Graveler drops it more commonly in the 4-5 area
        I think I got one in the 2nd area without realizing it. You can dig it up, or rarely it can be in the ore deposites.

                    well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
        i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them
    Is there a benefit to completing all of the tasks on one Pokemon? I've just been getting them to level 10 to "complete the entry."

        rank 10 dex entry is 2/4096 chance of a shiny

perfect dex entry is 4/4096 chance of a shiny

                There’s one that spawns on the little beach east of the worn bridge, near the entrance of oreburrow tunnel.  He’s how I beat that quest.
                    What level were your pokes when you did it?
        i ended up having to find and catch an alpha buizel just to get that one done. XD
            I havent seen one :( otherwise I would have gotten him one to get it done haha
                yeah, i've only seen 2 myself
    It is random as it's based on their size which is a random roll when it spawns.  The cool thing is the model in world does show you the size so if you see a smaller one it's light and a larger one it's heavy.
        I love seeing super tiny mons. Like I came across this teeny tiny graveler and it was just so adorable
    Feather ball seems to be the best one for me.  You can throw it very far and can catch almost everything with it.
    sometimes i can just tell by looking at them (machop in oreburgh cave for example are ones i can tell the size/weight easily)... but if i cant (abra) then i just catch every one i see until i get the required amount of light/heavy specimens
        When I'm getting to the end of regular "caught" count and still have light/heavy left I'll save before catching new ones and reset and use them to increase my "defeated" count if they don't trigger the light/heavy count.
            oh thats smart, i hit the caught count on abra far before light specimens so wasted a lot of potential defeats on captures... then again, depending on spawn scarcity its probably not always worth the time it takes to save and reset
                Oh yeah, don't waste your time on like Bidoof or Starly or something, but for rarer stuff it's totally worth it.
How do you get the item to evolve scyther into kleavor? I can't find it anywhere
    Graveler drops it more commonly in the 4-5 area
    I think I got one in the 2nd area without realizing it. You can dig it up, or rarely it can be in the ore deposites.
        i've been praising >!lord ursaluna!< for getting me one
            I've been lucky enough to get three from him, but still working on getting some of the evolution stones.
                well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
    i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them
Is there a benefit to completing all of the tasks on one Pokemon? I've just been getting them to level 10 to "complete the entry."
    increased shiny rates apparently
    the shiny rates for that Pokemon doubles when you get to rank 10. It increases by 50% again when you complete every task for a pokemon.
        No, it doubles each time. Rank 10 adds 1 roll(for a total 2) and Perfect adds 2 rolls(for a total of 4)

Of course this is before factoring in Shiny Charm or Mass Outbreaks, since the extra rolls are a flat increase rather than a multiplier it won't double for people with the Shiny Charm since it adds 3 rolls so Perfect Pokédex entry would increase the number of rolls from 5 to 7. Mass Outbreaks add a whopping 25 rolls, so anything else is a drop in the bucket in comparison too.
    rank 10 dex entry is 2/4096 chance of a shiny

perfect dex entry is 4/4096 chance of a shiny

but mostly for completionist purposes
I ended up in a similar position, although I'm not sure I took quite as long on the first area. I was level 6 (almost 7) and my team was in the high 40s/low 50s.

It didn't help matters that in the next area I caught a lvl 55 and a lvl 65 alpha. Ended up with a highly overlevelled team early on because getting those first 7 stars can be done rather quickly.
did the exact opposite, through most of the endgame legends and still 6 star. Looking forward to going back and collecting however
Starly is keeping its guard up

Starly used tackle

Starly ran away. 

Fucker hit and ran me
    the thing where pokemon run is the one thing I dont like
        The trick is to hit them in the back, that way they won't escape
not the biggest fan of the turn changes, but it certainly is refreshing and feels so much better on a certain level.
    I totally get that.  I love them cus it makes the game harder but I also have no idea what determines turn order anymore and I totally get why that's not fun for people.
        You can hit Y during battle and it will tell you the turn order.
        Agile style and quick attack allow you to attack twice in a row from what i can tell. 

A quick attack followed by a strong attack is a pretty good combo if you know youll faint it
            It looks like it’s just based on speed initially, then certain moves have different modifiers to attack order, which appear to carry forward to future turns as well
                it seems a couple of things change turn speed though, but all the modifiers are hidden.

switching pokemon and using items seem like they increase turn speed a bit? 

knocking out a pokemon seems to give the enemy trainer a free turn, even if my turn was next in the turn order.

some moves have a different turn speed modifier - status moves give you earlier turns sometimes even without using it in agile style

engaging a wild pokemon without a backstrike seems to give them an initial turn speed boost. enemy trainers also seem to have an inherent initial turn speed boost and go first every time even if i'm overlevelled.

among other things 🤔
                    I do like how the new turn system sneakily removed the Switch battle style where you get to respond to enemy switches with your own - you barely notice it since most fights in the game are against wild Pokémon, but in the endgame where you get into trainer fights with 4 to 6 Pokémon it feels a lot like playing in Set Mode and they can do some real damage.
I still don’t understand move order but I don’t even care tbh, it’s fun
    Low key I think it's just random but favors the enemy. I do not get how it works at all.
        It's not random at all lol, unless you both have the same speed stat and level and neither use any boosting or agile style moves in which case yes it'll be determined by a coin flip.
    Didn’t the game say it’s based on speed stat and certain moves (quick attack/agile style)?

Edit: genuinely don’t remember. I feel like this was mentioned, but it of course wouldn’t have given exact adjustments.
        Yeah they did, but it gets weird when you switch out Pokémon mid-battle. Sometimes the AI will go twice/three times in a row. I’m sure it’s mathematically correct, it’s just weird.
            I’ve also had it where I use an item and immediately get to go again so maybe items and Pokémon switching have an affect on priority too?
Its annoyed me against an alpha... trying to catch it in the ball and it smashes my guy a few times in a row :( really annoying

Otherwise... really good
My exact thoughts. The things they did right, they did damn right. The things they lacked on, lack a ton. Praying for an update down the line
    Yeah just little things like giving them better AI in the field or at least more varied patterns.  Seeing a gyrados just flying in a circle for all eternity is kinda lame.  Also pokemon attacking the trainer are a complete non issue outside of some story bosses.  Would be nice if the trainer got more involved in catching or getting the advantage on some of the more advanced mons.   I don't expect Monster Hunter levels of depth but it could use a little more.
I think they mean the woven hat. I personally don't like it much. It's available at the cloth store not too long into the gsme
    I see what you did tgere
A.    w
no, but you can get smoke bombs that are basically instant cover, so you can pretend to be a ninja with your socks in sandals
I noticed that cause I always Yeet the ball from behind and then duck for cover in case it doesn’t work.
Table have the turns
Have a turn table
im slowly working on perfect dex entries, i know you can get to 8th star easily because im only ~1.5k away from it and still have so much to do; i wonder what the absolute limit is, id need to see the requirements for each star to speculate further
    I’m working on 10th star now and it requires as much experience as stars 1-9 combined
        just hit 8th star, which required 20k research points

need another 10k (30k total) for 9th star... i dont think this will be possible before kleavor, or if it is itll be real tight

so it sounds like 30k (60k total) for 10th? fairly sure thats not possible pre kleavor; shame; wouldve been a cool goal
    I tip my hat to you. I thought I’d do something similar, but got carried away, and now I’m mucking about in the second area, running from level 45 alphas. :D
        I avoided all of the alphas until I was half way done with the fourth area. Now I’m going back and catching them.
            They do just spawn randomly. Every random spawn has somewhere between .2-2% to be an alpha depending on the Pokémon
                I think that’s only after you quell the frenzy in an area before others start spawning as alphas. 

At least that’s what I’ve noticed. I’m in the fourth area but have not done the frenzy yet, so no extra alphas.
        its funny because its only like this because i always get distracted on my way to kleavor doing other things; once i hit 6th star i figured i may as well just roll with it and see how high i can get beforehand

im now 8th star with a lvl 59 samurott and 6 lvl 60 alakazams on the ranch... i dont think ill be able to reach 9 stars without progressing MSQ forwards though, its 20k total research points to reach 8* and 30k to reach 9*; so id need to scrounge up another 50% and i dont see that happening since the bulk of research points focus around the rank 10 entries
            I assume you got as far as you did thanks to the space-time distortions?
                nope, no space time distortions (do they even spawn this early?)

also only had one mass outbreak (bidoof)
    lol that some patience
        Just throw pokeballs at everything. Thats what im doing lol. 

Im also broke and catching pokemon is a good way for money as far as i can tell
            I think it’s more the patience to not do the story (at least that’s how I see it). I beat the story ~20 levels underlevelled because I’m impatient
            Living exposition to exposition just like me I see haha dropping about 5,000 after one trip AND crafting 20-40 balls
It is a bit

The size of the pokemon does actually vary a bit. Trying to get that damn large buizel for the security guy... still haven't managed it (got a few 2' 7" ones)... but getting an eye for larger ones of them haha
    I just got him an alpha one
        where can you find the alpha one?
            South of worn bridge near the alpha floatzel is where I caught mine
            Windswept run was where I found one at night
            There’s one that spawns on the little beach east of the worn bridge, near the entrance of oreburrow tunnel.  He’s how I beat that quest.

    i've been praising >!lord ursaluna!< for getting me one
        I've been lucky enough to get three from him, but still working on getting some of the evolution stones.
            well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
i got it from the area past snorlax, gravellers can jump out of ore deposits over there... im not sure if i got it from a graveller or the ore itself; but one of them

well, if i could i'd send you some of my surplus of evolution stones; because i got at least 5 fire, 3 water, 8 moon, and a dawn stone that i plan on using once i recatch a male ralts i just lost to a game breaking bug.
it seems a couple of things change turn speed though, but all the modifiers are hidden.

switching pokemon and using items seem like they increase turn speed a bit? 

knocking out a pokemon seems to give the enemy trainer a free turn, even if my turn was next in the turn order.

some moves have a different turn speed modifier - status moves give you earlier turns sometimes even without using it in agile style

engaging a wild pokemon without a backstrike seems to give them an initial turn speed boost. enemy trainers also seem to have an inherent initial turn speed boost and go first every time even if i'm overlevelled.

among other things 🤔
    I do like how the new turn system sneakily removed the Switch battle style where you get to respond to enemy switches with your own - you barely notice it since most fights in the game are against wild Pokémon, but in the endgame where you get into trainer fights with 4 to 6 Pokémon it feels a lot like playing in Set Mode and they can do some real damage.
I think that’s only after you quell the frenzy in an area before others start spawning as alphas. 

At least that’s what I’ve noticed. I’m in the fourth area but have not done the frenzy yet, so no extra alphas.
nope, no space time distortions (do they even spawn this early?)

also only had one mass outbreak (bidoof)
What level were your pokes when you did it?
