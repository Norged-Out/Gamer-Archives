[[No big deal just five years of floundering]]





I remember having (I think) the expert level on my banner, playing 1v1. 

At some point my opponent stops and asks:

"can I ask you a question?"

Me: "sure"


him: "How can you be Expert and this bad?" 

I removed that banner afterwards.
    Experiences like that were actually the reason they gave the option to change the title or hide it altogether. Titles were given out solely from the experience gained in-game which is a reflection of how much time you had to waste, but everyone assumed Expert meant that you were playing against the pros every weekend and consistently beating them.
        If you had rocketeer and missed a shot you basically had to instantly quit lmao, soon became the S3 GC tag
            I think I left mine on the lowest rank most of the time to avoid that shit too. Never got Rocketeer on PS4 sadly.
                Rocketeer took quite a bit of effort to get when the cap was level 75. Took me ages to get iirc
                    yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
                    I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
                        They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
                        I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
                        No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
                            Thank you for the moral support lol
                        I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
                        I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
                I left mine on troubleshooter, because I have trouble shooting
            Omg this^ I remember the first time I got to level 100 and could throw this title on. I‚Äôm in like my second game doing half ass aerials when a kid just chews me out over game chat for being ass. Ahhh I miss the old days
                100... You're lyin... it was level 70-75.
                    I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
                        74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
                    It's currently 100
                He's talking about back when rocketeer actually took a crazy amount of hours, it doesn't take anywhere near as much now.
                    I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
                        How many hours roughly?
                            To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
                                Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
                            It took around 800-1200 hours for most
                            It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
                Precious memories
        This.
I made my banner "Ballistic" and never changed it since
            [removed]
                I use Sherpa too because I‚Äôm always carrying my friends.
            I used "Transcendent Master" sarcastically for a while until I learned how fun it was to blow people up ten times per match, and since then I've used "Demolition Demon" without a hint of sarcasm.
                Yes! What's rocket league without a healthy amount of chaos
                    Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
                        I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
                        I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
                        So we meet again. Ill get you next time.

            I rock Reckless because it describes me perfectly. Almost always doing something I shouldn‚Äôt be trying lol.
                I use Speed Demon so no one's surprised when I whiff at max speed
                If people used titles that described them perfectly, the ball chaser title would be a lot more common.
                Wild Card for me.

Hit a banger? Whiff an easy save? Demo the goalie? Miss the demo and put the whole team out of position?

WILD CARD, BITCHES! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
        I switched mine to animator, as it's my irl job.  I have no idea why it's a title option though.   I've never seen anybody else with it.

        [deleted]
            Yea, the community has evolved since then and now nobody cares about titles unless it's glowing.
                Yeah, it's sad IMO when I was on the come up in the early days I could use those to decide what role I would assume until play started and I learned  what I needed to do to best help the team.

Hell I think it defined my play style as the passer/hockey style defender.

Downside I spent so much of the early days setting up the ally-oop dunk in front of the goal and making safe clears, that I didn't spend time practicing ball control.

My oldest Est. 20** banner is something I apparently need to get from my old Xbox Account, along with all the items that weren't tradable. No longer having an Xbox makes this a challenge.

I typically just rock the OG Player title, and I can't even remember which were earned actually mean something and which were game pass rewards and shit.
                    Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
                        Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
        I remember back in the day in the lower ranks I‚Äôd ask someone their rank and they‚Äôd tell me their title. Lol.
        That's why if I ever earn gold for a gun in call of duty I don't add the camo. Not going to give someone the satisfaction of killing a guy with a gold gun
            I remember when black ops 2 came out. I didn't like any of the guns so I just used the Five Seven, I had a gold gun on the second night. Probably felt bad losing to the guy only running around with a pistol in FFA
    Don't feel bad. I once got in a game, using a freshly created preset.  At the end, the opponent asked if I was color blind.
Was the first and last time I used that preset lmao.
        lol
        > Don't feel bad. 

Don't worry, I don't care about rank/skill as long as I'm having fun. I just removed my level in case opponents would get high hopes and be disappointed afterwards with my not as expected skill level.
    This is why I set my title to ‚ÄúTactical Whiffer‚Äù. No one can call me out on whiffing now
        Ball Chaser or Rank Amateur for me. Seems pretty accurate.
            Trouble Shooter

Because I have trouble shooting. That's how that works, no?
        Sunday Driver so they can't hurt my feelings by calling me a try-hard or rub it in when I play poorly. 

Jk it still happens.
        Cant complain about me stealing boost, its in my title!
    I had a champ goal explosion from rumble before I was a true champ. Got called out on how bad I was in a 1v1 and took it off haha
    I use "committed" because at the very least I try to help lol
        That‚Äôs a good one. I like the ‚Äúcrossbar hero‚Äù one so when I shank 5 open nets off the crossbar I can at least say ‚ÄúI tried to tell you.‚Äù
            I play the title for that reason üôÇ
            Yeah, I use "Trouble Shooter" for the same reason.  I'm pretty good at playing defense, and I typically play faster than other people at my skill level, but I can't shoot for shit, so I always get chirped for my atrocious shots (particularly compared to other aspects of my game), so I just say "yeh, hence the title, I have troubles shooting".
    I've been "rocketeer" for a while.  And more than few times I've gotten "Wow, we beat a rocketeer!". Feelsbadman
        I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the worst rocketeer ever so don‚Äôt feel bad.
    See this is why my title says "Rank Amateur"
    Ahh i remember the times when we used to judge people bases on their level titles (1-75)
    ‚ÄúIm an expert at being bad...‚Äù
    exactly this, although i can‚Äôt say i didn‚Äôt troll on people for being ‚Äòlegend‚Äô and playing like a semi-pro
        Some good trolling and jest is great, like that guy did to me. He didn‚Äôt use slurs or racist comments, just some cheeky banter.
    Yeah I‚Äôm level 2200 and don‚Äôt use the rocket demigod lol. I‚Äôm trash
I have 2015 and the past few months was the first time I hit plat. Granted I only have like 200 hours but I can do better than that
    If your hours are so spread out over the years it's unfair to expect yourself to be better.
        My hours are not spread out.   I'm plat 2.  I've hit plat 3 but the game quickly reminded me that I'm plat 2.   Then it reminded me that I can be plat 1 if I pull that shit again.
            I'm silver 2. I've hit gold 1. The game reminded me that there's no fucking difference between that and bronze 2, because I've been all 3 in 2 days...
                A couple friends were playing 2v2.  They dropped from plat 1 to bronze 3 one night.  They were laughing the whole time.  Sometimes, it's better to laugh.
                    I did that one night with alcohol...
                        We just do it with our skills.
                    I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
                Can confirm I've been legit in B3 at 8 hours, 80 hours, and again at 800 hours.
                    i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
                        I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
                Lmao I know that feel, but with Plat 1 all the way down to bronze. I was reminded when I played on a friend's account expecting to clean up against noobs.
                Bro i was gold 3 div 3, lost 1 game in ot, now I'm gold 2 div 3. What is the rank system?
                    No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
                        Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
                            Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
                        It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
                I have been all shades of platinum. Never diamond. Never diamond.
                It depends upon your expectations from teammates, under Plat, you can't really trust your TMs to clear or save an easy shot, as everyone is still learning the mechanics. 

Your rank pretty much is indicated by how many games you're going to play last man eternally and defend the net haha.

You get those kind of fluctuations too, I had a bitch of a time where I'd dip down to Plat 2, then up to high Dia 1, so on. 
I finally started not relying upon my teammate for consistent clears, etc (when you get to a certain level, you just expect good hits 99% of the time) and played with "I must carry our defence" in mind, was super careful not to overcommit, etc, shot up to D2 almost overnight,  then have slowly migrated back to a bit more of a trusting style, and I'm now up to champ 1. 

People can preach rotation, etc, but it just doesn't work at some ranks.
            I think he was deducing the spread out from starting in 2015 and having only 200 hours in the game
    same for me but 2016 & plat 1. played with a psn buddy who got the game in 2015 then kind of gave it up for over a year. play more consistent now but yea still only around 8 days playtime.

they just hate cuz they cant get the sweet title.
    Don't underestimate the community skill level increasing rapidly during your gaps.

As I've started hitting Champ 1, I'm coming across Season 9+10 GCs, they obviously played till GC then took a break, but their shots lack that power and accuracy, as well as they just weren't as comfortable in the air. 

Heck, look at Deevo vs Scrukilla, hailed as the greatest 1v1 at the time, but they can't hold a candle to today's average high level match. 

If you're really serious about doing better than that, then sure, train, really grind those practice hours, but if not, don't hold your rank against yourself, it's just a fun game about flying soccer with cars, and getting so angry you yeet controllers :)
    Did they give those out with the update already ?

I signed in and it already knew my epic I‚Äôd which was wierd,maybe because my gamer tag is connected to Fortnite.
    I'm at nearly 500 hours...

&#x200B;

I'm gold....
stuck in silver since 2015
    How though?
        I only just made it to gold for the first time and I started playing when it was free on PS+.  The answer for me is that I have 3 kids and anger management problems so I play sparingly and took several long breaks.
            Yeah anger issues and rocket league do not mix lmao
        This question needs an answer. That's a staggeringly consistent level of mediocrity with no improvement over a very long time, I don't believe it.
            could be the reason I'm in diamond but cant aerial: I refuse to practice. I just want to hop on, win a few games, feel the good brain juice, and hop off. Being diamond is pure luck I guess.

Edit: just to clarify, i can aerial and often from weird angles, but 9 times out of 10 my car doesn't spin to get a hard shot and half the time i whiff anyway.
                I too refuse to practice, I'm never "going pro" so don't see the point, and feel like Diamond is the limit for people such as us
                    I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
                        I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
                            Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
                                Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                                    Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                                    Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
                                I feel so at home in this thread!
                                This gives me hope lmao
                            lol.

&#x200B;

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
                                I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
                            Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
                            Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
                            Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
                        Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
                            Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
                                This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
                                    Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
                            That's basically my flair.
                        Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
                        I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
                            It's called not being an adult.
                                Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
                                Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
                        Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
                    Depends on your definition of practice. I've never used a training pack and I only use free play to mess around while waiting for a match. I am certain that casual matches make up well under 1% of my total game play.

So it's entirely possible to go past diamond without doing any sort of concentrated practice. What I do is see what the people at my rank are doing that I can't and I try to learn and execute it all through ranked games, so I guess I could see that being "practice" of some kind.

But I think getting to GC would be another story. I've been C2/C3 for like a year and a half now and have accepted I'll need to practice if I ever want GC. But just like y'all I really don't want to put in that grind at all.
                        I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
                            Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
                                I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
                    Diamond is still full of toxic assholes who look like smurfs... but they claim they aren‚Äôt. Except for your teammate. He‚Äôs always the lucky silver who somehow got ranked up
                        Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
                    I refused to practice until D3...stuck in Silver is almost inexcusable lol.
                        Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
                            And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
                    Hell yeah. I tried the whole practice a few minutes before playing a match thing and I hated it. I'm comfortable at diamond 1. I reached diamond 2 once and I couldn't even win one match at that level so back down to diamond 1 and I'm happy.
                        Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
                    But freestyling and learning to freestyle is so much fun.

I refused to practice also until I downloaded Baakesmod. Now I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll spend a whole night in freeplay instead of in games.
                    Dude what the hell, I don't play without a solid 20-30mins warmup in the practice and I'm topping out around plat 2-3. Just how..
                This. I'm in Gold 3 since 2017 because I just play the game. I don't even play it every day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, just for half an hour each session. I've never done any training of any kind, and I refuse to do it. I have other games to play. Rocket League is like my in-between-games game.
                This right here. I‚Äôm not working on mechanics so I can do the latest musty half cancel triple touch reset pinch. Car go brrrrrr
                    WSB leaking in to Rocket League I see.
                If you play just one game of 1v1 you'll be that much tighter for the following 3v3 games.
                Feel the good brain juice? While playing this game? How
                    By spamming what a save and ruining your team mates night for a mistake you made. It's clearly very enjoyable since all my team mates do it
                Are you me? Except I‚Äôm in plat 2/3. I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 (although I did stop for about two years) and I still don‚Äôt really know how to aerial. Just have never felt the motivation to learn it since I‚Äôm still having fun at the rank I‚Äôm at. 

It helps that I don‚Äôt have too many friends that play the game, and the ones that do suck worse than me so I feel no peer pressure to get better
                    How dare you have fun! Rocket League is meant to be an endless, hateful grind to the top.
                I refuse to practice too but I have made it to Champ 2 just by playing. I mean if you play enough you'll definitely have better positioning, rotation and aerials at some point because those things are pretty much necessary every game. I can't dribble tho (ground nor air) because that requires practice imo, or do any fancy thing really.
            Probably just playing passively or off and on. I got worse from 2016 was gold now bronze (I did move to pc so that might be the reason for that) but I took a year off to focus on overwatch and I guess I unimproved.
                people have definitely gotten better at this game. After a long hiatus i came back to silver to find everyone hitting balls out of the air. I was astonished at the time. We don't play the game the same way anymore.
                    Your absolutely right its scary to see silvers hitting  ceiling resets and wavedashes. 2015 RL and 2020 RL are two different games!
                        2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
                        No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
                        Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
                            Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
                                Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
                    I recently switched to PC and had to play placement matches from 0, I too was very shocked by how much better the low ranks have become
                    I thought I was going crazy... Used to be diamond 2 a couple years ago and I can't crawl out of plat 1 anymore in 2s!
                    Big truths all the way across ranks. Took a year hiatus myself too. Left as a C2, and returned struggling to hold D3 for a while.
            Me and my friends are around Gold III, popped into Platinum I for a week or two then went back down to Gold II.

We've had the game since 2015 (or at least early 2016), but we play maybe once or twice a week. We don't practice, we don't care about learning advanced mechanics - it's just a excuse for us to have a drink and play some games. We've also had a handful of times where we've not played for several months.

It's not that surprising at all.
            When I came back this summer I started at silver. Even though I started in 2015 I only had 250 hours.
                Was the same for me in season 12. Starded s1 but came back just mid S12 with 250ish hours. Now I have over a thousand üòÇ thanks corona
            I go through long periods of not playing, if I don't play for half a year and come back to the same rank other people are noticeable worse.  Rank inflation is a thing in my anecdotal experience so staying the same rank implies they're getting worse even.
        I'd venture to say a lot of people casually play to unwind. Im a plat/gold in 3s and 2s and silver/gold in 1s. I've been playing for like 2-3 years or so, but I just get drunk/high and play. Rank is meaningless to me.
            preach
        Beta player here  I am the same. Silver 3 right now in doubles. Terribly inconsistent.  I have ok to bad aerial skills and have a bad habit that I've been unable break with double jumping all the time. I don't play with a partner, and some games I play like a plat 2-3, some games like I'm bronze 1. While training can help, I'd rather just play 2 or 3 online matches before I have to stop. Im a middle aged dad, with 3 kids in the house, work 50 hrs a week while doing my own house renovations. Training is boring and something I'd do if I had hours each day instead of 40 minutes
        I've got a guess, but you'll think I've completely lost my mind.  What if, now hear me out, what if... he's one of those?  You know, one of those 'people' that play 'other' games.  Crazy, right?  They're out there though, believe me, games with guns (and lots of hackers) or jellybeans running on conveyor belts.  You'll think I've lost it, I don't blame you.
            Oh my god. You mean someone that isn‚Äôt hopelessly addicted to a car soccer?
                It... it simply cannot be!
                Hey, I can stop whenever I want!
                    You can, but seriously don't. I tried it, do not recommend.
            most accurate, plus no practice.
        I've actually gotten worse at the game and have a lower rank. I played a ton for years and then got burnt out now I play very randomly.  Now if you play every day I have no idea.
        It's actually impossible. Would have been challenger back during launch.
        I've been stuck in Bronze in 2s and 3s since 2018 because I got through my placement matches and stopped playing because at Bronze your teammates are a bigger threat than your opponents.
    Hey, me too, my brother.  Well, I'm high plat in Snow Day, but I'm SILVER ONE in 1 v 1, which I play with some regularity.  S3 in 2v2.
    While a lot of the game comes from continual play and feeling out positioning, I think a big chunk of improvement comes from dedicated practice. I was Silver 2 for a couple years before quitting. I came back in 2019 and dedicated time to practice certain mechanics and rose (then settled) pretty quickly into plat 1-2. 

So that's where I'm sitting now. I'm confident I could get high plat or diamond if I did the same thing and tried really hammering into some of the more difficult mechanics, but I just don't have the time nowadays. 

I don't know how much it would truly help, but I also felt that my gameplay improved after changing my controls to match a video from Fluump. Took a few days to feel comfortable moving all the buttons around but now I can't imagine going default.
        This is 100% my case for sure. I started playing in 2016. I‚Äôm a diamond 3 at my best, but for me to improve out of that I‚Äôd need to get really dedicated and that‚Äôs just not something I really want to do. I like playing casually and using the game as an outlet to decompress.
    ive been playing since 2017 and i am bronze.....
    Same for me, but I'm not an ultra hardcore gamer so I played RL for few months, then stopped for few months and so on. This way I find it very difficult to make some bigger progress, but I'm having fun and I'm happy...
    Are you serious?
    Could be worse, I have a friend who's been stuck in bronze after a few years of playing. No clue how though
Man, as long as he‚Äôs having fun, rock that 2015 title, who gives a shit about rank.
    This is how I feel. My favorite RL bud to play with has the "Rocket Demigod" title, and he receives a ton of hate (He is gold/plat). Why can't people just have fun playing the rocket soccer game.
    He is me, and I'm still having fun! I wasn't actually upset by this persons Twitter comment, I think they intended it as a joke.

That being said I can't help but feel bad for underperforming in games regardless. This is just an extra weapon for folks to attack me with.
I‚Äôve had RL since 2015 but I only started playing comp in really late 2019.
    Same. I played a lot in 15-16 when it was free on PS4. Got to gold 2 before dropping it. Quarentine happened and I got to plat 2. I'm sure if I kept playing Maybe would've gotten to some form of champ in those 5 years
        Yea however I have managed to beak into Diamond 2, but I‚Äôm nearing my peaks as a RL player.
            No you‚Äôre not man. I don‚Äôt think you are.
    Same. I went long periods of time without playing so it's not really accurate
    I've been playing since launch day, and only played ranked matches a handful of times. No idea what my ranking is, and never bothered to look up how it works.

Got to level 400ish with mostly 3v3 casual.

And since the last update, I quit and uninstalled RL from all my systems.

r/fuckepic They slowly but surely ruined this game.
Gold since ‚Äò16 üëä
    Hell yea!
    Ditto!  I didn‚Äôt break out of Gold III hell until this year.
        Ive been Diamond 2-3 for a year now... its a rough grind in every rank lmao
            But that feeling when you hit champ and you‚Äôre so happy. Only to lose the next 3 games and go right back to D3.  Feels bad.
    just wondering, how many hours?
        I've been a consistent Gold 3 since 2017 (hit Plat 1 like four times), and I'm around the 3 and a half days of playtime mark.
            So not much at all for you. Not too much is expected if your sub-100 hours in game. Of course everyone progresses at their own speeds too. If you've poked into Plat 1 a few timed with just over 72 hours, you're doing fine.

Also whenever I discuss the timeframes that generally apply to different ranks in this game, it makes me immediately question how are you supposed to sell anyone on this game if you tell them you'll be garbage until you've sunk x hundreds of hours into the game. Like, that's a crazy person thing to suggest... yet here we all are.
                It isn't really crazy though. 

Will you suck forever at this? Probably yes. Because it's a tough game. We all suck to varying degrees and that's 100% fine. 

The end goal for the majority of the player base is having fun one way or the other; for some that entails chasing clips, for some it's purely about winning no matter how pretty the gameplay looks. 

The point is you don't need to play hundreds of hours to have fun with this game.
                    I told my buddy last night, "Everybody sucks at this game. Higher ranks just suck *faster*"
                        Except for my teammates. They're perfect and if I fall below their standards they immediately ff
                        This is very true. I whiff all the time, but I try to only take risky plays when I'm not the last man.
        I'm 1300 hours and only a plat 3 on a good day, I was gold 3 for 1000 of those.
            ...oh ok then
                I don't really practice at all tbh, and I play with kb+m.

And most importantly, my IQ is a one digit number.
                    well, as long as you enjoy it.
i only have the 2018 one üòî
    Gc in 2 years is pretty good though
        no i spent 1000 hours before gc on xbox so i dont have anything prior to 2018 on my pc account
            why don‚Äôt you link your xbox account to your pc and get your old tag
                Wait do inventories combine if I do that?
                    [deleted]
                        Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
                            [deleted]
                                I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
                    yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
                i dont remember the login lol i gave away my xbox years ago
                    If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
                    oof
        I'm standing up and clapping
2meirl. EST. 2015 and plat 3. Got it with ps+ but always has shit internet so I never got really deep with online play, until last year
    Same. 2015 on psplus. D3 is my highest. I basically didn't practice at all the first two years of the game and intermittently took weeks at a time off here and there. 

Eventually I decided I wanted to actually get better and get out of gold and plat so I started working a little more for it. I've hit another ceiling though at the moment.
    Mine is 2015 also but I didn‚Äôt get this game on PS+ unfortunately. However I played on a buddy‚Äôs PS4 (he got the game free with PS+) with my account so maybe that‚Äôs why? Idk.

I bought the game myself in 2018.
Gold, been playing since 2017. Only have 240 hours which seems to be average-ish.

Or I'm just bad, not sure...
    Better than me :D I have 600 hrs and I am Plat 3.
        I was plat 3 at 600 hours. Then hit champ around 900 to 1000 hours mark.  


You're entering a time where you should start seeing the light lol then you can be stuck in champ like me from 1000 hours up until 2000 hours.
        250hrs here and D3. Thanks for lifting my spirits!!!
            Everyone goes at their own pace :D No problem haha
                Totally! To be fair, I ‚Äútried hard‚Äù, obsessively watched videos, with some training for like my last 150 hours of play time.
                    That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
            600hrs here and G2. Thanks for fucking destroying my spirits!!!
            Wtf I'm at 1300h and D2/C1 congrats dude
    I've been playing since late 2017, but I have 2000 hours and I'm c1. There's probably a pretty big range of time and ranks of people that started in 2017.
    240 hours and gold is pretty good, I remember I hit gold when I had ~400 iirc. After that it was much easier ranking up for me.
2018 Gang, started playing consistently last year I guess
    Yeah 2018 gang!
        Any tips to hit champ? I'm struggling at getting past diamond 3 :c
(Also 2018 gang)
            I can try. For me what helped me was analyzing my replays to find out that I need to practice my recoveries(yours might not suck though). Learning when to get softer touches on the ball or boom it. And probably what helped the most for me was setting up, hitting, and defending backboard shots. 

I hope that helps and good luck with the grind!

Edit: I should add that it is very important to not care too much about your rank. For the longest time I bordered in d3 div 3-4 and those were some of the most stressful matches for me because I was just so close. Caring less helped me focus on achieving better skill and consistency, helped me respect the skills of my opponents (one of which helped coach me a little) and overall have more fun.
I have 2020, but no way to say, "No I didn't buy it a week before the f2p update." I bought it in Feb 2020.
    Hey, why did you buy RL a week before f2p update?
        Why you little, chop-busting...
I played on release day in 2015 in PS4, then eventually Xbox and how PC since 2018 so I only have the 2018 one :(
I grabbed the game when it came out in 2015, played for a couple of hours and came back in 2019. I'm plat 1. I'll be the laughing stock of all competitive playlist...
2016 :(
    Why the unhappy? We still go way back
        Yea I have it, I consider it still on the OG side.  I still like EST 2017, 3 years is a long time, just a cool title imo - not that it's a hard indicator of hours or skill level.
            Yup 2016 is the last "OG" year IMO. Considering it didn't release on Xbox until June, 2016.
For a game thats essentially car soccer, it's way too toxic for me
I have the 2015 tag. I only played season mode in 2015. I just got into ranked in June. I just learned how to consistently ariel.


I will be hurt by the words. I have approximately 200 hours into doubles. 100 hours into the rest of game modes.....

I'm d3 div 1....who needs to know how to dribble or half flip. Two weeks ago I learned the basic wavedash.


Anyone is wondering ps4: scwattyjr7
    you‚Äôre pretty high then for having low mechanical skill, that means once you actually do get these techniques down you should be able to climb a fair bit!
        I‚Äôm c1 and can barley quick jump. My fingers don‚Äôt like the controller especially when in the air. I try and train and get 6 mins in and straight to a game I go. I‚Äôll never learn how to control my car :/ lol
            I goaltend fairly well. I love to pinch things. And I mainly work on boost conservation although it still needs tons of work. My shot accuracy is meh but I train alot on soft touch and passing as well as total field view and other player positioning.

Mechanics are for nerds lol
            That can go badly, man.
    Still higher rank than me and also from 2015
i got the 2016 but i got the game in 2015, it hurts my feelings, i bought it for xbox in game preview
Been playing since 2015 but got given 2020. Anyone else?
    I got both
    I got the 2018(Steam) and 2020. My ps4 should‚Äôve been 2015.
Shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with these situations.
    I think the Twitter commenter was just goofing, but I know full well I'm going to get flamed in ranked.
I was so excited to slap on my "Est 2016" title. Played 1 ranked game of doubles and got flamed by my own teammate (context. He dribbled straight into the opponent and I couldn't make it back for a save) "what a save!", "2016 and still diamond"... Remove title. Chat goes back to disabled. This is Rocket League!
I got the 2020 and 2015, but I bought the game in 2019
I linked both my Xbox and ps4 account and set my Xbox to my primary, yet I only have the 2018 tag even tho my PS4 account started back in 2016?
Noob question, i bought rocket league day one but didnt played for years, any idea if i'll get this title?
    You will. Same here and i got it.
    Yeah I played a lot when it came out then quit for years. Only came back mid 2019 but I hold the 2015 title.
I started playing in 2015, was in gold until 2018 when I went on an insane streak and got to plat 2, I then hit diamond one for the first time early this year. Now I'm D2 div 3. It's a very slow development but I'm getting better slowly. Basically, don't give up. It can take a lot of time but it's worth it in the end.
season 1 crown reward gang... where you at??????
I somehow made Plat 1 this season, and immediately stopped playing so I don't lose it.
    Did you win your qualifying matches? You don't get highest rank, you have to win ten at a rank and then you can't drop below there for rewards.
2017 gang here also ima bout to be bullied for being low gold when I started 3 years ago
2016 gang here, still stuck in plat. Probably cause i got no friends and play with randos
Where‚Äôs my ‚Äò15 plats at
2016 gang?
    Woot woot
Started in January 2016, Reached Gold in late 2016, reached Plat in late 2017, reached Diamond in early 2019, still in Diamond now, but recently completely changed camera settings and some bindings, so I'm working my way back up.
I‚Äôve been playing for like two years and my tag was 2020 :/
Didn't realise it actually corresponded to the year you started. I have the 2016 title. Yes, I'm still in silver.
How do you get it? I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 but don‚Äôt have it?
est.2020 october: diamond 1
Nobody has said a word to me yet, but if they do I'll just laugh. Sorry I had a life and have only played consistently probably 7 of the 14 seasons.
    You're a GC anyway
2017 Pog, I did not have a computer at the time, it was building at the moment finish it in 2017.
Too bad I didn‚Äôt link my 2016 PC account to my 2018 Xbox account. Now I look like an FNG
The thing is I bought it some time ago but I hardly played it. I started getting into it this year
I‚Äôve got 2019!!
I can agree, I have est. 2016 and I'm diamond 3. I never actually played the game daily until 2020 though, so that's why
Reminds me of Counter Strike where people would check steam ID‚Äôs to judge if you were old and cool or new and uncool.
I bought this game on release and was never given 2015, only 2020 and I‚Äôve been playing it almost every day since first release.
Stuck in gold since 2017
Cant just be me who started in 2015 but got given 2017?
Est. 2018 Grand Champion‚Äôs where ya at!?
I bought the game a month after release, maybe even less. Played 6 hours. Recently started playing and have 80 now.
Since 2015 on pc since 2017 on Xbox
[deleted]
I‚Äôm in mid diamond and started in 2015, haven‚Äôt  really attempted to take it seriously in over2 years though
I played on PC in 2015, switched to XBox in 2016, and don't have the 2015 title even after merging accounts, so RIP OG status I guess.
Where can I get that. I‚Äôve had the game in disk form or a while and might hop on with the f2p. But haven‚Äôt updated the game in a while. So I was just wondering what steps I need to do to acquire that badge
It only gave me a 2020 title despite owning the game since 2016? Anyone else have this issue?
Look I might have started in 2015 but I play like I just got the damn game.
I'm 2016 but I've been stuck in Gold 1 for years, frankly it's probably because I don't know how to practice
Is 2015 the earliest it goes? I played alpha and everyone thinks my hat was paid for by daddy‚Äôs money (I‚Äôm 25 with a full time job but that‚Äôs not the point). I just want to prove I actually did play then without using a tradable (and not very aesthetically pleasing) item lol.
Does anyone know if the platform stuff transferred with this update, or will it happen when it's free to play on the 23rd? I connected my Playstation account where I started playing in 2015, however on my main PC account I only bought it in 2017. That's the earliest est. date I have. Do these even transfer over?
I got the game in 2016 but I didn‚Äôt start actually playing it until like 2 months ago
5 years to reach Gold 1 :/
Are you shitting me you have to have played comp to show off your OG status???? I‚Äôll be a fuckin laughing stock
Does 2016 have something?
I have it and honestly didn't realize how soon I started playing following its release. I thought I was late to the party (and I also had the same thought as Warren).
Est 2020 will be my excuse for now but over time it will be less of an excuse.
I was too happy playing SARPBC to start RL until early 2016. I regret that now.
I got RL in 2016, but got the est. 2017 title. Anyone know why?
Est 2015, still bronze
I'm salty about the title, I should have the 2015 one, but I only got 2016 since I didn't realize until Season 2 or 3 how much better it was on PC vs PS4.
    I think if you link your ps4 account you can use the 2015 one
        Hey that worked!

For anyone else who wants to know how to do it: you have to link your console account to epic games and then run the game once on that console.  So yes, you have to play through that stupid tutorial multiple times.
I relate to this so much
Wait do people who start this year get 2020, i mean when f2p goes live
    I hope it just says "cheap bastard"
Rocking the 2015 title and season 2 prospect boost in gold
Awww I thought 2016 was the earliest, I must've gotten it january of 2016 or something
I am 2015 PS4 2018 PC
mine says 2016
I‚Äôm 2016 and I‚Äôm only c1-c2
Same. Diamond 1 on a good week...
I'll get the 2015 tag on xbox, but I switched to PC a few months ago and only play there now. So I'll look like a scrub with a 2020 tag. No offence to any scrubs out there, you're a vital part to the rocket league ecosystem
The fact that people believe ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been playing since 2015, you should be a certain rank‚Äù is nonsense. Not everybody is grinding and trying to make the RLCS for the 6th time (and failing again). Some people play once a week, some play once a month. Besides, with the rank distribution, there‚Äôs no way all those players could be GC or even champ. There‚Äôs just not enough room.  People peak and plateau, some people don‚Äôt see rocket league as a life goal like some of y‚Äôall do.  Bashing people for their rank is actually pretty pathetic. Just because it matters to you doesn‚Äôt mean it matters to anyone else.
Dang. I only got est 2018 bc that‚Äôs when I started on pc. My ps4 items/rewards still haven‚Äôt carried over
Im right there with you, I peaked at Gold 3.
I play 3‚Äôs with my friend who is GC and another who is D3. I‚Äôm usually somewhere in the D1-2 range. After the new update I had two more placement matches for 3‚Äôs, and it ranked me GOLD FUCKING 3.... after playing against teams of all champs. I was fucking stunned. Absolutely no way I‚Äôm turning this thing on for people to laugh at me.
I have clips and achievements from 2016 but it gave me the 2018?
I played sarpbc in 2014-2015 with a bunch of friends and when rocket league was in alpha we were all hyped to get it.. non of us had computers. I only got a computer in 2016 so you can bet what title I got
They're to big to be called buoys.
I'm ready to get bullied by being playing since 2015 (non continuous), and still float around Plat 2
Gotta flex somehow on the fresh meet.
Started playing a few weeks after launch in 2015 but for some reason I got the est. 2016. Like I even have clips of me playing in 2015 same account same gamer tag and everything. Really annoying
i gave up on ranked lmao i don‚Äôt play anything but casual now it‚Äôs so much more fun cause everyone sucks and it‚Äôs not just me
I have never put a banner before but I‚Äôm definitely going to put this one on just because I‚Äôm proud of how far this game has come. I don‚Äôt play ranked anymore and I‚Äôm terrible at the game now, so my feelings will not be that hurt
im 2016 gang
Fuck I didn‚Äôt think about the time stamp lol good thing I made it to platinum at least one season lol
But at the same time a 2015 gets mad when I beat them with my 2020 title so yeah. Or they already write me off as a noob and underestimate me.
I'm est. 2016
I only got the ‚Äò20 one, just started on pc. Probably would‚Äôve had the 2016 on on Xbox.
I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 but didn‚Äôt get the title. Don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs not a big deal
Wasn't given to me after I linked my accounts.
Luckily for me I recently switched to pc so no one  will know I‚Äôm still in play after 5 years
[deleted]
I‚Äôm d3 and i have the 2015 one, just recently picked it up again after a couple of years tho
I‚Äôm rocking the 2020 badge in champ
I am a champ 3 in Dous and a diamond 3 in 3s and wearing this title and seeing people have the 2019 one makes me feel like I‚Äôm bad since I lower by 3 ranks
@warren I feel you man :,(
Est 2015...feels/looks like I started playing yesterday, but I never stopped. T.T
Stuck in gold since beta here. -_-'
I've got "Est. 2015" on PS4, but I suck while playing on the PS4, I'm guessing it's got to do with framerates and input lag and other things.... I *might* be gold 1 on PS4, while bumping diamond on PC, and high plat on Xbox 


Est. 2019 on PC, 2018 on Xbox
I unfortunately started playing on playstation week one of the games release when it was free on PlayStation plus and played ever since, with occasional breaks. Switched to Xbox a year later and am now on steam so mine says ‚ÄúEST. 2016‚Äù. Wish so bad there was a way to get my 2015 lol
I have had the beta nugget on since forever and never been chirped for being bad
Does anybody know when it came out on Xbox? I know PlayStation got it in 2015 but I looked it up and all I could find was February 2016 for Xbox.
Been Gold since ‚Äò15 but I think I got really lucky the past 6 months
i see a lot of people has est 2015 but playing sooo bad i was playing on 2015 but cracked, i bought the game on 2017 i did not liked this people using it for queen it over like "i have been playing over 5 years so im king of the rocket  league and im leader so you started on 2017? you bad noob shit im better than you"
When you got your gc title on and do bad, people be salty all game
Same, playing the game for five years and my skill is like I've only played for five days...
Lmfao that's rocket league for me in a nutshell. I thought I was the only one that has been here that long and still not gc
EST. 2015 here.  I almost never played rank, and I stopped playing for two years.  My rank on the PS4 is bronze, silver on Steam, and plat on Xbox.  Yet I decided to claim the PS4 as my primary since I was the highest level on it.
I have 2016, but only started actually playing in 2019... I'm scared
Forever Drift Queen here
I have the est. 2015 title, but I only played against bots. The first time I played online was like 2017 or 2018
I have 2020 cause I started 2 months ago lol
#Est 2016 Gang Gang
yeah I don't need that smoke thanks
I‚Äôm 2015 gang but I don‚Äôt wear it cause I will but get bullied but I only have 500hrs smh
EST. 2019, flexing here lol
I had access to the alpha back in 2014, but I was living in Australia at the time and they didn't have any servers over there so the ping made the experience really unenjoyable, and I never got back into it until a friend got it for me in 2017. Wish I would have stayed now for that 2015 banner now
2015 represent! We're all terrible and we know it!
EST 2015 is basically the universal PlayStation title since it was free then
Me with my GC title. I stopped playing then got back on and took so much shit cuz i wasn‚Äôt nearly as good as I once was
[removed]
Thats why I use very underwhelming titles
I started playing in 2019, but all my friends have 2015 tags so I feel left out :(
When i have Est. 2015 but you havent hit D2 yet
I'm just falling in style.
I had 4 wins in grandchampion in rumble but in normal modes i am platinum 1. I guess if I did got the 10 wins people would be very surprised to see me play in platinum 1 with that title
Is that out already.
I hate to say it but Fortnite brought me into this game. I only got an xbox because the whole world was playing Fortnite and when it died down I turned to RL. It‚Äôs kinda cool how it came full circle back to Fortnite tho. 

2018 gang for life
Been playing since it first came out on PSplus. Sadly I lost everything when I switched over to PC a year or two ago :(
No not illegal as long as I'm alive.
Ive been playing since 2015 but switched to ps4 and got the game in 2016. I played it consistently then switch to fortnight when it was still good. I started going back to rl and took it a bit more serious. My goal is get champion reward on normal and not other modes.
Was diamond for about the last year, recently fell back to plat 3. 

Pain.

Not changing my flair yet I‚Äôm going to prove I‚Äôm diamond worthy
I got rid of my "Master" flair for just this reason...
Does anyone else have multiple years? I have 2019 and 2020
Wait hol up,

I logged in yesterday for the first time since the Epic change and I got EST 2020, I've been playing for like 4 years.  Did I mess something up?
same reason I never use my GC titles lol. people just flame you for it
Ive been playing since 2015 too and im c3 now i think ppl get confused when they hear this. I haven‚Äôt been trying for years to get gc and only really started trying hard this year, mostly i just played for fun before. 
Theres alot of different ways to play rL like focusing on trading, messing around, or just learning new mechanics. 
I probably have over 1000 hrs but were all those hours toward getting better? Lol no. Sometimes there were month long breaks I took too.
PS4 RL Day One players, where you at?
I keep mine as tactical whiffer just to have an excuse to miss
Jafeel
I've been playing since 2016 and plateau'd a long time ago lol, the best I can do is okay adjustments to land smoothly on walls and half-flips. Me and my friend got to Platinum 3 once, but that's the highest we got.

It's at least partially do with the fact that I stopped taking the game semi-seriously a couple years back and now prefer to just play a few games casually now and then.
I know the feeling :(
I get shit all the time for owning alpha items and "not deserving" them.

I got them for playing the alpha, not for actually being good at the game.
I was just happy to get the 2016 title but I know it'll be used the same way. I got the game back then and didn't start playing it again until late 2018
I have the 2015 title but back then I was so bad that i didn't play for 3 years. Not Ive been playing constantly and getting better.
i only played the game for like 20 hours back when i got it in 2017, and i‚Äôm a bronze 2 rn because i took a 3 year break. there is no way i‚Äôm using that tag
My best bud and I both rock the "Rocket Demigod" title. I'm low/mid GC he is some where between Gold and Plat. The amount of shit he gets is astounding. I just don't see why people have to be like that.
I bought the game on Xbox back in 2016, but didn't really get seriously into it until this year, so I've only got 200 hours but I have a 2016 title.
I linked my Xbox account for the sole purpose of getting my sweet, sweet Est. 2017 title. The other gold 2s are so jealous
Question. I started RL in 2015 on steam. When the game came out on Xbox I switched over to that. I now have the "Est. 2016". If I link my RL from steam will I be able to have Est. 2015 on Xbox?
I have since 2017 and I think I‚Äôm decent
Me. There‚Äôs so much me in here it hurts
Works the other way as well. Ex: "Wow you've only been playing since 2018 and you're already this rank? Get a life, bro."
man i started at like 10th jan 2017 literally 10 days bruh
Is this auto generated or can I include my years playing SARPBC? I‚Äôm only in Gold 3 but I‚Äôve been playing since 2010
Already had this thought. First thought was excitement that I have been playing at the start. Second thought was that I am still trash since the start.
Ye not putting up my banner.......no bully plz
Lol I just came back to the game for the first time in 3 maybe 4 years. My title is Rocketeer, I've won 2 out of maybe 40 matches lol
Let's go 2015 gang rise upppp. Still miss the original search menu...
It's not like I have played every single day since the first day I got the game. I just ignore those people. Its all mind games to get an edge over you. Normal people take breaks and get rusty.
EST. 2016 high silver/low gold in everything here. Feels bad, man.
Any 2016 golds out there
I‚Äôm supposed to have 2016 since I started on Xbox and I didn‚Äôt get the title at all, just 2020. That and none of my items or anything merged after linking accounts and setting a primary. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time playing this game but after floundering around this update for 6 or 7 months and it turning out to be this made me uninstall. Good riddance. Great game, terrible developer.
Exactly why I don‚Äôt want to use mine
That's why I use ball chaser and not east 2016
I remember having the title ¬´¬†legend¬†¬ª at some point, but refused to show it until I felt like I deserved the title
I wish they gave out titles if you had the original game.  I would have Est 2009.  But now I have Est 2016 because I bought the new one Jan 10... üôÉ
I have season 3 grand champ, because i played a lot when the game was first coming out, but because of spotty internet among other reasons I kinda stopped playing more than for like a couple days a season. Nonstop ‚Äúhow much did you pay for that title‚Äù.
Mine is 2016, rip
Plat 2 started 2017
same. high silver since the beginning. Just recently got into gold and am amazed out how these people can shoot off the wall and air dribble into the goal. I've watched the videos online, changed my settings, and practiced. All I can do is hit a ball out of the air. My shots are pretty accurate, but only if they start from the ground. Cannot figure out dribbling.
Now this is why pysonix gave us the ability to remove or change our tags as the majority of this community is way too toxic.
2016 gang! Still haven‚Äôt hit GC tho :(
Anyone having issues getting the est. 20xx you deserve? What fixed it for me was logging into the account so that it can sync. I main on Steam but started on PS4. So I started up RL on the PS4 and all my stuff was added.

TLDR: Make sure start the game on the other platforms to get your inventory.
People are dumb, It doesn't matter what rank you are, everybody has a bad day every once in a while

I'll continue to wear whatever titles despite what people say
Same thing happened to me.
I was in a ranked 2v2 rocking the platinum goal explosion.
I score, which means everyone in the lobby knows I'm plat.

Teammate: *sees explosion* I don't think you're diamond.

Me: I'm not. That's a plat explosion.

Teammate: I don't think you're platinum.

Never used that goal explosion ever again.
Okay great example of a funny Twitter convo, no braindead toxicity, just a funny conversation
I would have been 2015 but I only had an Xbox at the time and it released in 2016 for Xbox :/
My friend is a bronze 2 since '15
Remember, if theyre worse than you, they're a noob. If theyre better than you, they have no life.
    One time I dude got wildly toxic at me and I said something along the lines of "imagine getting this upset at your own chosen passtime" and they hit me with "lol this is your passtime? wow"

bitch unless you're being paid to play you're literally PASSING THE TIME WITH THIS GAME.
My 2015 tag is less of an indication of my skill and more of an intimidation tactic against the other team. 

...right up until I whiff three balls in a row and let a goal in.
I've been playing since the beginning and, since the update, it says Est. 2020...
I‚Äôm low key bitter because I got a 2016 title instead of 2015 despite downloading the game on my Xbox the day it was released...
I cant lie it feels kinda nice when i see a 'Est. 2015-18' in a lobby against me. I started in 2019. Im still a filthy whiffing diamond, but at least I havent been playing as long ü§£
I have 2017 but checked and I got RL January 11... rip i was so close to 2016 greatness :( they should add the month, because a whole year is a lot of varying times jammed into one.
Been playing since 2016 and only got to a consistent champ 1 this year.
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
I got the game 2017, played a few games, and then left it until about February this year
Haha im 2016(Xbox) and totally agree. To be fair, I have 450 hours between systems, but other people don't know that.
Oof
Me hides, i only play casual....
The real OGs rock the gold nugget antenna you only get from playing the beta
Got the game 2016 üò™
Diamond 1 checking in, 2015 gang!

I actually played for about 20 hours then had a friend convince me to join a league and I've went gold 1 to Dia 1 in that time. But it's neat to show off. Nobody believed me in the league when I told them 2015 but now they realise that I'm just bad lmfao.
I already did this to someone who had est 2017 and was in silver lol
Took me 4 years to learn that yes, you could in fact , do aerial with keyboard and mouse. So yeah , this year I'm just touching GC for the first time. Still need 5 win in GC, that probably won't happen before the 23 but at least i was finnaly able to make progress and enjoy the game even more this year.
what‚Äôs annoying is i played since 2016 i think on ps4 and in 2019 i moved to pc (still play with a controller though, the same controller to be exact). but now i only have 2019 and 2020 ones so am the big sad, might have to rock the ‚Äúog player‚Äù one just because
I‚Äôve been playing since then and got given the 2020 one lol
Playing with my buddies last night and we were talking about our 5 year grind to GC rank. I'm up to Silver 2, only a few more decades to go and I'll get my goal!
Man i got the game when it was free for PS+ that year.... and I still can‚Äôt get out of gold
Crossbar Hero til I die!
Literally have EST. 2016 but don't want to use it since I only properly started a month or so ago. I can't live up to that expectation.
I rock est 2020 so no one overestimates me
mfw you only get Est. 2020. :c
I wear it with pride! *Disabled game chat* I get in my own head enough when I make a mistake, dont need other people to tell me what im already yelling at myself about.
15 bois wya
Just rock the tag, anyone who brags about I‚Äôm game rank is booty anyways.
I'm kinda mad, I looked in my steam purchase history, and I bought rl on January 20th, 2016 :(
Moved from Xbox to PC in late January. Have the 2020 title with incoming champion rewards.
2018 free weekend 50% off gang where u at?
Filthy casual teaming with randos since 2017 here. No need to state my rank, check the pedigree... or just look at my sub flair. I just crossed level 1000 last week.
Yeah, I'm "Est. 2107" and I turned it on, played a few games, and realized I should switch back to "Longtime Fan" so people don't realize I'm still this bad after 3 years.
Y'all are scrubs lmk when your in platinum pfft
I have it. I am Champ 2, but I don‚Äôt play much anymore. I use ‚ÄòAirhead‚Äô though. Because, well if I miss the ball or ain‚Äôt paying attention. At lest I warned them.... ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Warren‚Äôs comment hit me in the soul
I had it in 2015 but switched accounts. So I only got 2017:(
I got 15 I am currently mid C3 but I‚Äôm a 4x GC 9,10,11,13 and I play like once a week now lol.
I played 2015 on xbox and moved to pc 2018 and im diamond so lucky for me i avoid the problem
You've played since 2015? You must be really good.
Hi
I would have that title but I can‚Äôt remember my login info for PSN lol
Experiences like that were actually the reason they gave the option to change the title or hide it altogether. Titles were given out solely from the experience gained in-game which is a reflection of how much time you had to waste, but everyone assumed Expert meant that you were playing against the pros every weekend and consistently beating them.
    If you had rocketeer and missed a shot you basically had to instantly quit lmao, soon became the S3 GC tag
        I think I left mine on the lowest rank most of the time to avoid that shit too. Never got Rocketeer on PS4 sadly.
            Rocketeer took quite a bit of effort to get when the cap was level 75. Took me ages to get iirc
                yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
                I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
                    They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
                    I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
                    No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
                        Thank you for the moral support lol
                    I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
                    I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
            I left mine on troubleshooter, because I have trouble shooting
        Omg this^ I remember the first time I got to level 100 and could throw this title on. I‚Äôm in like my second game doing half ass aerials when a kid just chews me out over game chat for being ass. Ahhh I miss the old days
            100... You're lyin... it was level 70-75.
                I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
                    74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
                It's currently 100
            He's talking about back when rocketeer actually took a crazy amount of hours, it doesn't take anywhere near as much now.
                I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
                    How many hours roughly?
                        To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
                            Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
                        It took around 800-1200 hours for most
                        It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
            Precious memories
    This.
I made my banner "Ballistic" and never changed it since
        [removed]
            I use Sherpa too because I‚Äôm always carrying my friends.
        I used "Transcendent Master" sarcastically for a while until I learned how fun it was to blow people up ten times per match, and since then I've used "Demolition Demon" without a hint of sarcasm.
            Yes! What's rocket league without a healthy amount of chaos
                Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
                    I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
                    I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
                    So we meet again. Ill get you next time.

        I rock Reckless because it describes me perfectly. Almost always doing something I shouldn‚Äôt be trying lol.
            I use Speed Demon so no one's surprised when I whiff at max speed
            If people used titles that described them perfectly, the ball chaser title would be a lot more common.
            Wild Card for me.

Hit a banger? Whiff an easy save? Demo the goalie? Miss the demo and put the whole team out of position?

WILD CARD, BITCHES! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
    I switched mine to animator, as it's my irl job.  I have no idea why it's a title option though.   I've never seen anybody else with it.
        Psyonix is watching
    [deleted]
        Yea, the community has evolved since then and now nobody cares about titles unless it's glowing.
            Yeah, it's sad IMO when I was on the come up in the early days I could use those to decide what role I would assume until play started and I learned  what I needed to do to best help the team.

Hell I think it defined my play style as the passer/hockey style defender.

Downside I spent so much of the early days setting up the ally-oop dunk in front of the goal and making safe clears, that I didn't spend time practicing ball control.

My oldest Est. 20** banner is something I apparently need to get from my old Xbox Account, along with all the items that weren't tradable. No longer having an Xbox makes this a challenge.

I typically just rock the OG Player title, and I can't even remember which were earned actually mean something and which were game pass rewards and shit.
                Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
                    Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
    I remember back in the day in the lower ranks I‚Äôd ask someone their rank and they‚Äôd tell me their title. Lol.
    That's why if I ever earn gold for a gun in call of duty I don't add the camo. Not going to give someone the satisfaction of killing a guy with a gold gun
        I remember when black ops 2 came out. I didn't like any of the guns so I just used the Five Seven, I had a gold gun on the second night. Probably felt bad losing to the guy only running around with a pistol in FFA
Don't feel bad. I once got in a game, using a freshly created preset.  At the end, the opponent asked if I was color blind.
Was the first and last time I used that preset lmao.
    lol
    > Don't feel bad. 

Don't worry, I don't care about rank/skill as long as I'm having fun. I just removed my level in case opponents would get high hopes and be disappointed afterwards with my not as expected skill level.
This is why I set my title to ‚ÄúTactical Whiffer‚Äù. No one can call me out on whiffing now
    Ball Chaser or Rank Amateur for me. Seems pretty accurate.
        Trouble Shooter

Because I have trouble shooting. That's how that works, no?
    Sunday Driver so they can't hurt my feelings by calling me a try-hard or rub it in when I play poorly. 

Jk it still happens.
    Cant complain about me stealing boost, its in my title!
I had a champ goal explosion from rumble before I was a true champ. Got called out on how bad I was in a 1v1 and took it off haha
I use "committed" because at the very least I try to help lol
    That‚Äôs a good one. I like the ‚Äúcrossbar hero‚Äù one so when I shank 5 open nets off the crossbar I can at least say ‚ÄúI tried to tell you.‚Äù
        I play the title for that reason üôÇ
        Yeah, I use "Trouble Shooter" for the same reason.  I'm pretty good at playing defense, and I typically play faster than other people at my skill level, but I can't shoot for shit, so I always get chirped for my atrocious shots (particularly compared to other aspects of my game), so I just say "yeh, hence the title, I have troubles shooting".
I've been "rocketeer" for a while.  And more than few times I've gotten "Wow, we beat a rocketeer!". Feelsbadman
    I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the worst rocketeer ever so don‚Äôt feel bad.
See this is why my title says "Rank Amateur"
Ahh i remember the times when we used to judge people bases on their level titles (1-75)
‚ÄúIm an expert at being bad...‚Äù
exactly this, although i can‚Äôt say i didn‚Äôt troll on people for being ‚Äòlegend‚Äô and playing like a semi-pro
    Some good trolling and jest is great, like that guy did to me. He didn‚Äôt use slurs or racist comments, just some cheeky banter.
Yeah I‚Äôm level 2200 and don‚Äôt use the rocket demigod lol. I‚Äôm trash
If your hours are so spread out over the years it's unfair to expect yourself to be better.
    My hours are not spread out.   I'm plat 2.  I've hit plat 3 but the game quickly reminded me that I'm plat 2.   Then it reminded me that I can be plat 1 if I pull that shit again.
        I'm silver 2. I've hit gold 1. The game reminded me that there's no fucking difference between that and bronze 2, because I've been all 3 in 2 days...
            A couple friends were playing 2v2.  They dropped from plat 1 to bronze 3 one night.  They were laughing the whole time.  Sometimes, it's better to laugh.
                I did that one night with alcohol...
                    We just do it with our skills.
                I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
            Can confirm I've been legit in B3 at 8 hours, 80 hours, and again at 800 hours.
                i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
                    I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
            Lmao I know that feel, but with Plat 1 all the way down to bronze. I was reminded when I played on a friend's account expecting to clean up against noobs.
            Bro i was gold 3 div 3, lost 1 game in ot, now I'm gold 2 div 3. What is the rank system?
                No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
                    Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
                        Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
                    It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
            I have been all shades of platinum. Never diamond. Never diamond.
            It depends upon your expectations from teammates, under Plat, you can't really trust your TMs to clear or save an easy shot, as everyone is still learning the mechanics. 

Your rank pretty much is indicated by how many games you're going to play last man eternally and defend the net haha.

You get those kind of fluctuations too, I had a bitch of a time where I'd dip down to Plat 2, then up to high Dia 1, so on. 
I finally started not relying upon my teammate for consistent clears, etc (when you get to a certain level, you just expect good hits 99% of the time) and played with "I must carry our defence" in mind, was super careful not to overcommit, etc, shot up to D2 almost overnight,  then have slowly migrated back to a bit more of a trusting style, and I'm now up to champ 1. 

People can preach rotation, etc, but it just doesn't work at some ranks.
        I think he was deducing the spread out from starting in 2015 and having only 200 hours in the game
same for me but 2016 & plat 1. played with a psn buddy who got the game in 2015 then kind of gave it up for over a year. play more consistent now but yea still only around 8 days playtime.

they just hate cuz they cant get the sweet title.
Don't underestimate the community skill level increasing rapidly during your gaps.

As I've started hitting Champ 1, I'm coming across Season 9+10 GCs, they obviously played till GC then took a break, but their shots lack that power and accuracy, as well as they just weren't as comfortable in the air. 

Heck, look at Deevo vs Scrukilla, hailed as the greatest 1v1 at the time, but they can't hold a candle to today's average high level match. 

If you're really serious about doing better than that, then sure, train, really grind those practice hours, but if not, don't hold your rank against yourself, it's just a fun game about flying soccer with cars, and getting so angry you yeet controllers :)
Did they give those out with the update already ?

I signed in and it already knew my epic I‚Äôd which was wierd,maybe because my gamer tag is connected to Fortnite.
I'm at nearly 500 hours...

&#x200B;

I'm gold....
How though?
    I only just made it to gold for the first time and I started playing when it was free on PS+.  The answer for me is that I have 3 kids and anger management problems so I play sparingly and took several long breaks.
        Yeah anger issues and rocket league do not mix lmao
    This question needs an answer. That's a staggeringly consistent level of mediocrity with no improvement over a very long time, I don't believe it.
        could be the reason I'm in diamond but cant aerial: I refuse to practice. I just want to hop on, win a few games, feel the good brain juice, and hop off. Being diamond is pure luck I guess.

Edit: just to clarify, i can aerial and often from weird angles, but 9 times out of 10 my car doesn't spin to get a hard shot and half the time i whiff anyway.
            I too refuse to practice, I'm never "going pro" so don't see the point, and feel like Diamond is the limit for people such as us
                I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
                    I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
                        Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
                            Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                                Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                                Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
                            I feel so at home in this thread!
                            This gives me hope lmao
                        lol.

&#x200B;

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
                            I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
                        Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
                        Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
                        Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
                    Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
                        Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
                            This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
                                Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
                        That's basically my flair.
                    Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
                    I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
                        It's called not being an adult.
                            Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
                            Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
                    Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
                Depends on your definition of practice. I've never used a training pack and I only use free play to mess around while waiting for a match. I am certain that casual matches make up well under 1% of my total game play.

So it's entirely possible to go past diamond without doing any sort of concentrated practice. What I do is see what the people at my rank are doing that I can't and I try to learn and execute it all through ranked games, so I guess I could see that being "practice" of some kind.

But I think getting to GC would be another story. I've been C2/C3 for like a year and a half now and have accepted I'll need to practice if I ever want GC. But just like y'all I really don't want to put in that grind at all.
                    I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
                        Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
                            I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
                Diamond is still full of toxic assholes who look like smurfs... but they claim they aren‚Äôt. Except for your teammate. He‚Äôs always the lucky silver who somehow got ranked up
                    Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
                I refused to practice until D3...stuck in Silver is almost inexcusable lol.
                    Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
                        And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
                Hell yeah. I tried the whole practice a few minutes before playing a match thing and I hated it. I'm comfortable at diamond 1. I reached diamond 2 once and I couldn't even win one match at that level so back down to diamond 1 and I'm happy.
                    Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
                But freestyling and learning to freestyle is so much fun.

I refused to practice also until I downloaded Baakesmod. Now I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll spend a whole night in freeplay instead of in games.
                Dude what the hell, I don't play without a solid 20-30mins warmup in the practice and I'm topping out around plat 2-3. Just how..
            This. I'm in Gold 3 since 2017 because I just play the game. I don't even play it every day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, just for half an hour each session. I've never done any training of any kind, and I refuse to do it. I have other games to play. Rocket League is like my in-between-games game.
            This right here. I‚Äôm not working on mechanics so I can do the latest musty half cancel triple touch reset pinch. Car go brrrrrr
                WSB leaking in to Rocket League I see.
            If you play just one game of 1v1 you'll be that much tighter for the following 3v3 games.
            Feel the good brain juice? While playing this game? How
                By spamming what a save and ruining your team mates night for a mistake you made. It's clearly very enjoyable since all my team mates do it
            Are you me? Except I‚Äôm in plat 2/3. I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 (although I did stop for about two years) and I still don‚Äôt really know how to aerial. Just have never felt the motivation to learn it since I‚Äôm still having fun at the rank I‚Äôm at. 

It helps that I don‚Äôt have too many friends that play the game, and the ones that do suck worse than me so I feel no peer pressure to get better
                How dare you have fun! Rocket League is meant to be an endless, hateful grind to the top.
            I refuse to practice too but I have made it to Champ 2 just by playing. I mean if you play enough you'll definitely have better positioning, rotation and aerials at some point because those things are pretty much necessary every game. I can't dribble tho (ground nor air) because that requires practice imo, or do any fancy thing really.
        Probably just playing passively or off and on. I got worse from 2016 was gold now bronze (I did move to pc so that might be the reason for that) but I took a year off to focus on overwatch and I guess I unimproved.
            people have definitely gotten better at this game. After a long hiatus i came back to silver to find everyone hitting balls out of the air. I was astonished at the time. We don't play the game the same way anymore.
                Your absolutely right its scary to see silvers hitting  ceiling resets and wavedashes. 2015 RL and 2020 RL are two different games!
                    2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
                    No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
                    Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
                        Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
                            Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
                I recently switched to PC and had to play placement matches from 0, I too was very shocked by how much better the low ranks have become
                I thought I was going crazy... Used to be diamond 2 a couple years ago and I can't crawl out of plat 1 anymore in 2s!
                Big truths all the way across ranks. Took a year hiatus myself too. Left as a C2, and returned struggling to hold D3 for a while.
        Me and my friends are around Gold III, popped into Platinum I for a week or two then went back down to Gold II.

We've had the game since 2015 (or at least early 2016), but we play maybe once or twice a week. We don't practice, we don't care about learning advanced mechanics - it's just a excuse for us to have a drink and play some games. We've also had a handful of times where we've not played for several months.

It's not that surprising at all.
        When I came back this summer I started at silver. Even though I started in 2015 I only had 250 hours.
            Was the same for me in season 12. Starded s1 but came back just mid S12 with 250ish hours. Now I have over a thousand üòÇ thanks corona
        I go through long periods of not playing, if I don't play for half a year and come back to the same rank other people are noticeable worse.  Rank inflation is a thing in my anecdotal experience so staying the same rank implies they're getting worse even.
    I'd venture to say a lot of people casually play to unwind. Im a plat/gold in 3s and 2s and silver/gold in 1s. I've been playing for like 2-3 years or so, but I just get drunk/high and play. Rank is meaningless to me.
        preach
    Beta player here  I am the same. Silver 3 right now in doubles. Terribly inconsistent.  I have ok to bad aerial skills and have a bad habit that I've been unable break with double jumping all the time. I don't play with a partner, and some games I play like a plat 2-3, some games like I'm bronze 1. While training can help, I'd rather just play 2 or 3 online matches before I have to stop. Im a middle aged dad, with 3 kids in the house, work 50 hrs a week while doing my own house renovations. Training is boring and something I'd do if I had hours each day instead of 40 minutes
    I've got a guess, but you'll think I've completely lost my mind.  What if, now hear me out, what if... he's one of those?  You know, one of those 'people' that play 'other' games.  Crazy, right?  They're out there though, believe me, games with guns (and lots of hackers) or jellybeans running on conveyor belts.  You'll think I've lost it, I don't blame you.
        Oh my god. You mean someone that isn‚Äôt hopelessly addicted to a car soccer?
            It... it simply cannot be!
            Hey, I can stop whenever I want!
                You can, but seriously don't. I tried it, do not recommend.
        most accurate, plus no practice.
    I've actually gotten worse at the game and have a lower rank. I played a ton for years and then got burnt out now I play very randomly.  Now if you play every day I have no idea.
    It's actually impossible. Would have been challenger back during launch.
    I've been stuck in Bronze in 2s and 3s since 2018 because I got through my placement matches and stopped playing because at Bronze your teammates are a bigger threat than your opponents.
Hey, me too, my brother.  Well, I'm high plat in Snow Day, but I'm SILVER ONE in 1 v 1, which I play with some regularity.  S3 in 2v2.
While a lot of the game comes from continual play and feeling out positioning, I think a big chunk of improvement comes from dedicated practice. I was Silver 2 for a couple years before quitting. I came back in 2019 and dedicated time to practice certain mechanics and rose (then settled) pretty quickly into plat 1-2. 

So that's where I'm sitting now. I'm confident I could get high plat or diamond if I did the same thing and tried really hammering into some of the more difficult mechanics, but I just don't have the time nowadays. 

I don't know how much it would truly help, but I also felt that my gameplay improved after changing my controls to match a video from Fluump. Took a few days to feel comfortable moving all the buttons around but now I can't imagine going default.
    This is 100% my case for sure. I started playing in 2016. I‚Äôm a diamond 3 at my best, but for me to improve out of that I‚Äôd need to get really dedicated and that‚Äôs just not something I really want to do. I like playing casually and using the game as an outlet to decompress.
ive been playing since 2017 and i am bronze.....
Same for me, but I'm not an ultra hardcore gamer so I played RL for few months, then stopped for few months and so on. This way I find it very difficult to make some bigger progress, but I'm having fun and I'm happy...
Are you serious?
Could be worse, I have a friend who's been stuck in bronze after a few years of playing. No clue how though
This is how I feel. My favorite RL bud to play with has the "Rocket Demigod" title, and he receives a ton of hate (He is gold/plat). Why can't people just have fun playing the rocket soccer game.
He is me, and I'm still having fun! I wasn't actually upset by this persons Twitter comment, I think they intended it as a joke.

That being said I can't help but feel bad for underperforming in games regardless. This is just an extra weapon for folks to attack me with.
Same. I played a lot in 15-16 when it was free on PS4. Got to gold 2 before dropping it. Quarentine happened and I got to plat 2. I'm sure if I kept playing Maybe would've gotten to some form of champ in those 5 years
    Yea however I have managed to beak into Diamond 2, but I‚Äôm nearing my peaks as a RL player.
        No you‚Äôre not man. I don‚Äôt think you are.
Same. I went long periods of time without playing so it's not really accurate
I've been playing since launch day, and only played ranked matches a handful of times. No idea what my ranking is, and never bothered to look up how it works.

Got to level 400ish with mostly 3v3 casual.

And since the last update, I quit and uninstalled RL from all my systems.

r/fuckepic They slowly but surely ruined this game.
Hell yea!
Ditto!  I didn‚Äôt break out of Gold III hell until this year.
    Ive been Diamond 2-3 for a year now... its a rough grind in every rank lmao
        But that feeling when you hit champ and you‚Äôre so happy. Only to lose the next 3 games and go right back to D3.  Feels bad.
just wondering, how many hours?
    I've been a consistent Gold 3 since 2017 (hit Plat 1 like four times), and I'm around the 3 and a half days of playtime mark.
        So not much at all for you. Not too much is expected if your sub-100 hours in game. Of course everyone progresses at their own speeds too. If you've poked into Plat 1 a few timed with just over 72 hours, you're doing fine.

Also whenever I discuss the timeframes that generally apply to different ranks in this game, it makes me immediately question how are you supposed to sell anyone on this game if you tell them you'll be garbage until you've sunk x hundreds of hours into the game. Like, that's a crazy person thing to suggest... yet here we all are.
            It isn't really crazy though. 

Will you suck forever at this? Probably yes. Because it's a tough game. We all suck to varying degrees and that's 100% fine. 

The end goal for the majority of the player base is having fun one way or the other; for some that entails chasing clips, for some it's purely about winning no matter how pretty the gameplay looks. 

The point is you don't need to play hundreds of hours to have fun with this game.
                I told my buddy last night, "Everybody sucks at this game. Higher ranks just suck *faster*"
                    Except for my teammates. They're perfect and if I fall below their standards they immediately ff
                    This is very true. I whiff all the time, but I try to only take risky plays when I'm not the last man.
    I'm 1300 hours and only a plat 3 on a good day, I was gold 3 for 1000 of those.
        ...oh ok then
            I don't really practice at all tbh, and I play with kb+m.

And most importantly, my IQ is a one digit number.
                well, as long as you enjoy it.
Gc in 2 years is pretty good though
    no i spent 1000 hours before gc on xbox so i dont have anything prior to 2018 on my pc account
        why don‚Äôt you link your xbox account to your pc and get your old tag
            Wait do inventories combine if I do that?
                [deleted]
                    Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
                        [deleted]
                            I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
                yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
            i dont remember the login lol i gave away my xbox years ago
                If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
                oof
    I'm standing up and clapping
Same. 2015 on psplus. D3 is my highest. I basically didn't practice at all the first two years of the game and intermittently took weeks at a time off here and there. 

Eventually I decided I wanted to actually get better and get out of gold and plat so I started working a little more for it. I've hit another ceiling though at the moment.
Mine is 2015 also but I didn‚Äôt get this game on PS+ unfortunately. However I played on a buddy‚Äôs PS4 (he got the game free with PS+) with my account so maybe that‚Äôs why? Idk.

I bought the game myself in 2018.
Better than me :D I have 600 hrs and I am Plat 3.
    I was plat 3 at 600 hours. Then hit champ around 900 to 1000 hours mark.  


You're entering a time where you should start seeing the light lol then you can be stuck in champ like me from 1000 hours up until 2000 hours.
    250hrs here and D3. Thanks for lifting my spirits!!!
        Everyone goes at their own pace :D No problem haha
            Totally! To be fair, I ‚Äútried hard‚Äù, obsessively watched videos, with some training for like my last 150 hours of play time.
                That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
        600hrs here and G2. Thanks for fucking destroying my spirits!!!
        Wtf I'm at 1300h and D2/C1 congrats dude
I've been playing since late 2017, but I have 2000 hours and I'm c1. There's probably a pretty big range of time and ranks of people that started in 2017.
240 hours and gold is pretty good, I remember I hit gold when I had ~400 iirc. After that it was much easier ranking up for me.
Yeah 2018 gang!
    Any tips to hit champ? I'm struggling at getting past diamond 3 :c
(Also 2018 gang)
        I can try. For me what helped me was analyzing my replays to find out that I need to practice my recoveries(yours might not suck though). Learning when to get softer touches on the ball or boom it. And probably what helped the most for me was setting up, hitting, and defending backboard shots. 

I hope that helps and good luck with the grind!

Edit: I should add that it is very important to not care too much about your rank. For the longest time I bordered in d3 div 3-4 and those were some of the most stressful matches for me because I was just so close. Caring less helped me focus on achieving better skill and consistency, helped me respect the skills of my opponents (one of which helped coach me a little) and overall have more fun.
Hey, why did you buy RL a week before f2p update?
    Why you little, chop-busting...
Why the unhappy? We still go way back
    Yea I have it, I consider it still on the OG side.  I still like EST 2017, 3 years is a long time, just a cool title imo - not that it's a hard indicator of hours or skill level.
        Yup 2016 is the last "OG" year IMO. Considering it didn't release on Xbox until June, 2016.
you‚Äôre pretty high then for having low mechanical skill, that means once you actually do get these techniques down you should be able to climb a fair bit!
    I‚Äôm c1 and can barley quick jump. My fingers don‚Äôt like the controller especially when in the air. I try and train and get 6 mins in and straight to a game I go. I‚Äôll never learn how to control my car :/ lol
        I goaltend fairly well. I love to pinch things. And I mainly work on boost conservation although it still needs tons of work. My shot accuracy is meh but I train alot on soft touch and passing as well as total field view and other player positioning.

Mechanics are for nerds lol
        That can go badly, man.
Still higher rank than me and also from 2015
I got both
I got the 2018(Steam) and 2020. My ps4 should‚Äôve been 2015.
I think the Twitter commenter was just goofing, but I know full well I'm going to get flamed in ranked.
You will. Same here and i got it.
Yeah I played a lot when it came out then quit for years. Only came back mid 2019 but I hold the 2015 title.
Did you win your qualifying matches? You don't get highest rank, you have to win ten at a rank and then you can't drop below there for rewards.
Woot woot
You're a GC anyway
I think if you link your ps4 account you can use the 2015 one
    Hey that worked!

For anyone else who wants to know how to do it: you have to link your console account to epic games and then run the game once on that console.  So yes, you have to play through that stupid tutorial multiple times.
I hope it just says "cheap bastard"
One time I dude got wildly toxic at me and I said something along the lines of "imagine getting this upset at your own chosen passtime" and they hit me with "lol this is your passtime? wow"

bitch unless you're being paid to play you're literally PASSING THE TIME WITH THIS GAME.
If you had rocketeer and missed a shot you basically had to instantly quit lmao, soon became the S3 GC tag
    I think I left mine on the lowest rank most of the time to avoid that shit too. Never got Rocketeer on PS4 sadly.
        Rocketeer took quite a bit of effort to get when the cap was level 75. Took me ages to get iirc
            yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
            I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
                They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
                I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
                No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
                    Thank you for the moral support lol
                I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
                I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
        I left mine on troubleshooter, because I have trouble shooting
    Omg this^ I remember the first time I got to level 100 and could throw this title on. I‚Äôm in like my second game doing half ass aerials when a kid just chews me out over game chat for being ass. Ahhh I miss the old days
        100... You're lyin... it was level 70-75.
            I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
                74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
            It's currently 100
        He's talking about back when rocketeer actually took a crazy amount of hours, it doesn't take anywhere near as much now.
            I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
                How many hours roughly?
                    To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
                        Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
                    It took around 800-1200 hours for most
                    It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
        Precious memories
This.
I made my banner "Ballistic" and never changed it since
    [removed]
        I use Sherpa too because I‚Äôm always carrying my friends.
    I used "Transcendent Master" sarcastically for a while until I learned how fun it was to blow people up ten times per match, and since then I've used "Demolition Demon" without a hint of sarcasm.
        Yes! What's rocket league without a healthy amount of chaos
            Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
                I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
                I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
                So we meet again. Ill get you next time.
    Peppermint Powerhouse ~~f~~Porever
        Boost Hog baby
    I rock Reckless because it describes me perfectly. Almost always doing something I shouldn‚Äôt be trying lol.
        I use Speed Demon so no one's surprised when I whiff at max speed
        If people used titles that described them perfectly, the ball chaser title would be a lot more common.
        Wild Card for me.

Hit a banger? Whiff an easy save? Demo the goalie? Miss the demo and put the whole team out of position?

WILD CARD, BITCHES! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I switched mine to animator, as it's my irl job.  I have no idea why it's a title option though.   I've never seen anybody else with it.
    Psyonix is watching
[deleted]
    Yea, the community has evolved since then and now nobody cares about titles unless it's glowing.
        Yeah, it's sad IMO when I was on the come up in the early days I could use those to decide what role I would assume until play started and I learned  what I needed to do to best help the team.

Hell I think it defined my play style as the passer/hockey style defender.

Downside I spent so much of the early days setting up the ally-oop dunk in front of the goal and making safe clears, that I didn't spend time practicing ball control.

My oldest Est. 20** banner is something I apparently need to get from my old Xbox Account, along with all the items that weren't tradable. No longer having an Xbox makes this a challenge.

I typically just rock the OG Player title, and I can't even remember which were earned actually mean something and which were game pass rewards and shit.
            Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
                Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
I remember back in the day in the lower ranks I‚Äôd ask someone their rank and they‚Äôd tell me their title. Lol.
That's why if I ever earn gold for a gun in call of duty I don't add the camo. Not going to give someone the satisfaction of killing a guy with a gold gun
    I remember when black ops 2 came out. I didn't like any of the guns so I just used the Five Seven, I had a gold gun on the second night. Probably felt bad losing to the guy only running around with a pistol in FFA
lol
> Don't feel bad. 

Don't worry, I don't care about rank/skill as long as I'm having fun. I just removed my level in case opponents would get high hopes and be disappointed afterwards with my not as expected skill level.
Ball Chaser or Rank Amateur for me. Seems pretty accurate.
    Trouble Shooter

Because I have trouble shooting. That's how that works, no?
Sunday Driver so they can't hurt my feelings by calling me a try-hard or rub it in when I play poorly. 

Jk it still happens.
Cant complain about me stealing boost, its in my title!
That‚Äôs a good one. I like the ‚Äúcrossbar hero‚Äù one so when I shank 5 open nets off the crossbar I can at least say ‚ÄúI tried to tell you.‚Äù
    I play the title for that reason üôÇ
    Yeah, I use "Trouble Shooter" for the same reason.  I'm pretty good at playing defense, and I typically play faster than other people at my skill level, but I can't shoot for shit, so I always get chirped for my atrocious shots (particularly compared to other aspects of my game), so I just say "yeh, hence the title, I have troubles shooting".
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the worst rocketeer ever so don‚Äôt feel bad.
Some good trolling and jest is great, like that guy did to me. He didn‚Äôt use slurs or racist comments, just some cheeky banter.
My hours are not spread out.   I'm plat 2.  I've hit plat 3 but the game quickly reminded me that I'm plat 2.   Then it reminded me that I can be plat 1 if I pull that shit again.
    I'm silver 2. I've hit gold 1. The game reminded me that there's no fucking difference between that and bronze 2, because I've been all 3 in 2 days...
        A couple friends were playing 2v2.  They dropped from plat 1 to bronze 3 one night.  They were laughing the whole time.  Sometimes, it's better to laugh.
            I did that one night with alcohol...
                We just do it with our skills.
            I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
        Can confirm I've been legit in B3 at 8 hours, 80 hours, and again at 800 hours.
            i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
                I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
        Lmao I know that feel, but with Plat 1 all the way down to bronze. I was reminded when I played on a friend's account expecting to clean up against noobs.
        Bro i was gold 3 div 3, lost 1 game in ot, now I'm gold 2 div 3. What is the rank system?
            No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
                Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
                    Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
                It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
        I have been all shades of platinum. Never diamond. Never diamond.
        It depends upon your expectations from teammates, under Plat, you can't really trust your TMs to clear or save an easy shot, as everyone is still learning the mechanics. 

Your rank pretty much is indicated by how many games you're going to play last man eternally and defend the net haha.

You get those kind of fluctuations too, I had a bitch of a time where I'd dip down to Plat 2, then up to high Dia 1, so on. 
I finally started not relying upon my teammate for consistent clears, etc (when you get to a certain level, you just expect good hits 99% of the time) and played with "I must carry our defence" in mind, was super careful not to overcommit, etc, shot up to D2 almost overnight,  then have slowly migrated back to a bit more of a trusting style, and I'm now up to champ 1. 

People can preach rotation, etc, but it just doesn't work at some ranks.
    I think he was deducing the spread out from starting in 2015 and having only 200 hours in the game
I only just made it to gold for the first time and I started playing when it was free on PS+.  The answer for me is that I have 3 kids and anger management problems so I play sparingly and took several long breaks.
    Yeah anger issues and rocket league do not mix lmao
This question needs an answer. That's a staggeringly consistent level of mediocrity with no improvement over a very long time, I don't believe it.
    could be the reason I'm in diamond but cant aerial: I refuse to practice. I just want to hop on, win a few games, feel the good brain juice, and hop off. Being diamond is pure luck I guess.

Edit: just to clarify, i can aerial and often from weird angles, but 9 times out of 10 my car doesn't spin to get a hard shot and half the time i whiff anyway.
        I too refuse to practice, I'm never "going pro" so don't see the point, and feel like Diamond is the limit for people such as us
            I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
                I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
                    Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
                        Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                            Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                            Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
                        I feel so at home in this thread!
                        This gives me hope lmao
                    lol.

&#x200B;

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
                        I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
                    Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
                    Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
                    Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
                Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
                    Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
                        This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
                            Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
                    That's basically my flair.
                Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
                I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
                    It's called not being an adult.
                        Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
                        Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
                Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
            Depends on your definition of practice. I've never used a training pack and I only use free play to mess around while waiting for a match. I am certain that casual matches make up well under 1% of my total game play.

So it's entirely possible to go past diamond without doing any sort of concentrated practice. What I do is see what the people at my rank are doing that I can't and I try to learn and execute it all through ranked games, so I guess I could see that being "practice" of some kind.

But I think getting to GC would be another story. I've been C2/C3 for like a year and a half now and have accepted I'll need to practice if I ever want GC. But just like y'all I really don't want to put in that grind at all.
                I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
                    Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
                        I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
            Diamond is still full of toxic assholes who look like smurfs... but they claim they aren‚Äôt. Except for your teammate. He‚Äôs always the lucky silver who somehow got ranked up
                Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
            I refused to practice until D3...stuck in Silver is almost inexcusable lol.
                Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
                    And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
            Hell yeah. I tried the whole practice a few minutes before playing a match thing and I hated it. I'm comfortable at diamond 1. I reached diamond 2 once and I couldn't even win one match at that level so back down to diamond 1 and I'm happy.
                Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
            But freestyling and learning to freestyle is so much fun.

I refused to practice also until I downloaded Baakesmod. Now I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll spend a whole night in freeplay instead of in games.
            Dude what the hell, I don't play without a solid 20-30mins warmup in the practice and I'm topping out around plat 2-3. Just how..
        This. I'm in Gold 3 since 2017 because I just play the game. I don't even play it every day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, just for half an hour each session. I've never done any training of any kind, and I refuse to do it. I have other games to play. Rocket League is like my in-between-games game.
        This right here. I‚Äôm not working on mechanics so I can do the latest musty half cancel triple touch reset pinch. Car go brrrrrr
            WSB leaking in to Rocket League I see.
        If you play just one game of 1v1 you'll be that much tighter for the following 3v3 games.
        Feel the good brain juice? While playing this game? How
            By spamming what a save and ruining your team mates night for a mistake you made. It's clearly very enjoyable since all my team mates do it
        Are you me? Except I‚Äôm in plat 2/3. I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 (although I did stop for about two years) and I still don‚Äôt really know how to aerial. Just have never felt the motivation to learn it since I‚Äôm still having fun at the rank I‚Äôm at. 

It helps that I don‚Äôt have too many friends that play the game, and the ones that do suck worse than me so I feel no peer pressure to get better
            How dare you have fun! Rocket League is meant to be an endless, hateful grind to the top.
        I refuse to practice too but I have made it to Champ 2 just by playing. I mean if you play enough you'll definitely have better positioning, rotation and aerials at some point because those things are pretty much necessary every game. I can't dribble tho (ground nor air) because that requires practice imo, or do any fancy thing really.
    Probably just playing passively or off and on. I got worse from 2016 was gold now bronze (I did move to pc so that might be the reason for that) but I took a year off to focus on overwatch and I guess I unimproved.
        people have definitely gotten better at this game. After a long hiatus i came back to silver to find everyone hitting balls out of the air. I was astonished at the time. We don't play the game the same way anymore.
            Your absolutely right its scary to see silvers hitting  ceiling resets and wavedashes. 2015 RL and 2020 RL are two different games!
                2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
                No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
                Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
                    Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
                        Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
            I recently switched to PC and had to play placement matches from 0, I too was very shocked by how much better the low ranks have become
            I thought I was going crazy... Used to be diamond 2 a couple years ago and I can't crawl out of plat 1 anymore in 2s!
            Big truths all the way across ranks. Took a year hiatus myself too. Left as a C2, and returned struggling to hold D3 for a while.
    Me and my friends are around Gold III, popped into Platinum I for a week or two then went back down to Gold II.

We've had the game since 2015 (or at least early 2016), but we play maybe once or twice a week. We don't practice, we don't care about learning advanced mechanics - it's just a excuse for us to have a drink and play some games. We've also had a handful of times where we've not played for several months.

It's not that surprising at all.
    When I came back this summer I started at silver. Even though I started in 2015 I only had 250 hours.
        Was the same for me in season 12. Starded s1 but came back just mid S12 with 250ish hours. Now I have over a thousand üòÇ thanks corona
    I go through long periods of not playing, if I don't play for half a year and come back to the same rank other people are noticeable worse.  Rank inflation is a thing in my anecdotal experience so staying the same rank implies they're getting worse even.
I'd venture to say a lot of people casually play to unwind. Im a plat/gold in 3s and 2s and silver/gold in 1s. I've been playing for like 2-3 years or so, but I just get drunk/high and play. Rank is meaningless to me.
    preach
Beta player here  I am the same. Silver 3 right now in doubles. Terribly inconsistent.  I have ok to bad aerial skills and have a bad habit that I've been unable break with double jumping all the time. I don't play with a partner, and some games I play like a plat 2-3, some games like I'm bronze 1. While training can help, I'd rather just play 2 or 3 online matches before I have to stop. Im a middle aged dad, with 3 kids in the house, work 50 hrs a week while doing my own house renovations. Training is boring and something I'd do if I had hours each day instead of 40 minutes
I've got a guess, but you'll think I've completely lost my mind.  What if, now hear me out, what if... he's one of those?  You know, one of those 'people' that play 'other' games.  Crazy, right?  They're out there though, believe me, games with guns (and lots of hackers) or jellybeans running on conveyor belts.  You'll think I've lost it, I don't blame you.
    Oh my god. You mean someone that isn‚Äôt hopelessly addicted to a car soccer?
        It... it simply cannot be!
        Hey, I can stop whenever I want!
            You can, but seriously don't. I tried it, do not recommend.
    most accurate, plus no practice.
I've actually gotten worse at the game and have a lower rank. I played a ton for years and then got burnt out now I play very randomly.  Now if you play every day I have no idea.
It's actually impossible. Would have been challenger back during launch.
I've been stuck in Bronze in 2s and 3s since 2018 because I got through my placement matches and stopped playing because at Bronze your teammates are a bigger threat than your opponents.
This is 100% my case for sure. I started playing in 2016. I‚Äôm a diamond 3 at my best, but for me to improve out of that I‚Äôd need to get really dedicated and that‚Äôs just not something I really want to do. I like playing casually and using the game as an outlet to decompress.
Yea however I have managed to beak into Diamond 2, but I‚Äôm nearing my peaks as a RL player.
    No you‚Äôre not man. I don‚Äôt think you are.
Ive been Diamond 2-3 for a year now... its a rough grind in every rank lmao
    But that feeling when you hit champ and you‚Äôre so happy. Only to lose the next 3 games and go right back to D3.  Feels bad.
I've been a consistent Gold 3 since 2017 (hit Plat 1 like four times), and I'm around the 3 and a half days of playtime mark.
    So not much at all for you. Not too much is expected if your sub-100 hours in game. Of course everyone progresses at their own speeds too. If you've poked into Plat 1 a few timed with just over 72 hours, you're doing fine.

Also whenever I discuss the timeframes that generally apply to different ranks in this game, it makes me immediately question how are you supposed to sell anyone on this game if you tell them you'll be garbage until you've sunk x hundreds of hours into the game. Like, that's a crazy person thing to suggest... yet here we all are.
        It isn't really crazy though. 

Will you suck forever at this? Probably yes. Because it's a tough game. We all suck to varying degrees and that's 100% fine. 

The end goal for the majority of the player base is having fun one way or the other; for some that entails chasing clips, for some it's purely about winning no matter how pretty the gameplay looks. 

The point is you don't need to play hundreds of hours to have fun with this game.
            I told my buddy last night, "Everybody sucks at this game. Higher ranks just suck *faster*"
                Except for my teammates. They're perfect and if I fall below their standards they immediately ff
                This is very true. I whiff all the time, but I try to only take risky plays when I'm not the last man.
I'm 1300 hours and only a plat 3 on a good day, I was gold 3 for 1000 of those.
    ...oh ok then
        I don't really practice at all tbh, and I play with kb+m.

And most importantly, my IQ is a one digit number.
            well, as long as you enjoy it.
no i spent 1000 hours before gc on xbox so i dont have anything prior to 2018 on my pc account
    why don‚Äôt you link your xbox account to your pc and get your old tag
        Wait do inventories combine if I do that?
            [deleted]
                Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
                    [deleted]
                        I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
            yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
        i dont remember the login lol i gave away my xbox years ago
            If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
            oof
I'm standing up and clapping
I was plat 3 at 600 hours. Then hit champ around 900 to 1000 hours mark.  


You're entering a time where you should start seeing the light lol then you can be stuck in champ like me from 1000 hours up until 2000 hours.
250hrs here and D3. Thanks for lifting my spirits!!!
    Everyone goes at their own pace :D No problem haha
        Totally! To be fair, I ‚Äútried hard‚Äù, obsessively watched videos, with some training for like my last 150 hours of play time.
            That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
    600hrs here and G2. Thanks for fucking destroying my spirits!!!
    Wtf I'm at 1300h and D2/C1 congrats dude
Any tips to hit champ? I'm struggling at getting past diamond 3 :c
(Also 2018 gang)
    I can try. For me what helped me was analyzing my replays to find out that I need to practice my recoveries(yours might not suck though). Learning when to get softer touches on the ball or boom it. And probably what helped the most for me was setting up, hitting, and defending backboard shots. 

I hope that helps and good luck with the grind!

Edit: I should add that it is very important to not care too much about your rank. For the longest time I bordered in d3 div 3-4 and those were some of the most stressful matches for me because I was just so close. Caring less helped me focus on achieving better skill and consistency, helped me respect the skills of my opponents (one of which helped coach me a little) and overall have more fun.
Why you little, chop-busting...
Yea I have it, I consider it still on the OG side.  I still like EST 2017, 3 years is a long time, just a cool title imo - not that it's a hard indicator of hours or skill level.
    Yup 2016 is the last "OG" year IMO. Considering it didn't release on Xbox until June, 2016.
I‚Äôm c1 and can barley quick jump. My fingers don‚Äôt like the controller especially when in the air. I try and train and get 6 mins in and straight to a game I go. I‚Äôll never learn how to control my car :/ lol
    I goaltend fairly well. I love to pinch things. And I mainly work on boost conservation although it still needs tons of work. My shot accuracy is meh but I train alot on soft touch and passing as well as total field view and other player positioning.

Mechanics are for nerds lol
    That can go badly, man.
Hey that worked!

For anyone else who wants to know how to do it: you have to link your console account to epic games and then run the game once on that console.  So yes, you have to play through that stupid tutorial multiple times.
I think I left mine on the lowest rank most of the time to avoid that shit too. Never got Rocketeer on PS4 sadly.
    Rocketeer took quite a bit of effort to get when the cap was level 75. Took me ages to get iirc
        yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
        I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
            They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
            I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
            No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
                Thank you for the moral support lol
            I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
            I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
    I left mine on troubleshooter, because I have trouble shooting
Omg this^ I remember the first time I got to level 100 and could throw this title on. I‚Äôm in like my second game doing half ass aerials when a kid just chews me out over game chat for being ass. Ahhh I miss the old days
    100... You're lyin... it was level 70-75.
        I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
            74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
        It's currently 100
    He's talking about back when rocketeer actually took a crazy amount of hours, it doesn't take anywhere near as much now.
        I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
            How many hours roughly?
                To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
                    Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
                It took around 800-1200 hours for most
                It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
    Precious memories
[removed]
    I use Sherpa too because I‚Äôm always carrying my friends.
I used "Transcendent Master" sarcastically for a while until I learned how fun it was to blow people up ten times per match, and since then I've used "Demolition Demon" without a hint of sarcasm.
    Yes! What's rocket league without a healthy amount of chaos
        Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
            I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
            I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
            So we meet again. Ill get you next time.
Peppermint Powerhouse ~~f~~Porever
    Boost Hog baby
I rock Reckless because it describes me perfectly. Almost always doing something I shouldn‚Äôt be trying lol.
    I use Speed Demon so no one's surprised when I whiff at max speed
    If people used titles that described them perfectly, the ball chaser title would be a lot more common.
    Wild Card for me.

Hit a banger? Whiff an easy save? Demo the goalie? Miss the demo and put the whole team out of position?

WILD CARD, BITCHES! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Psyonix is watching
Yea, the community has evolved since then and now nobody cares about titles unless it's glowing.
    Yeah, it's sad IMO when I was on the come up in the early days I could use those to decide what role I would assume until play started and I learned  what I needed to do to best help the team.

Hell I think it defined my play style as the passer/hockey style defender.

Downside I spent so much of the early days setting up the ally-oop dunk in front of the goal and making safe clears, that I didn't spend time practicing ball control.

My oldest Est. 20** banner is something I apparently need to get from my old Xbox Account, along with all the items that weren't tradable. No longer having an Xbox makes this a challenge.

I typically just rock the OG Player title, and I can't even remember which were earned actually mean something and which were game pass rewards and shit.
        Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
            Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
I remember when black ops 2 came out. I didn't like any of the guns so I just used the Five Seven, I had a gold gun on the second night. Probably felt bad losing to the guy only running around with a pistol in FFA
Trouble Shooter

Because I have trouble shooting. That's how that works, no?
I play the title for that reason üôÇ
Yeah, I use "Trouble Shooter" for the same reason.  I'm pretty good at playing defense, and I typically play faster than other people at my skill level, but I can't shoot for shit, so I always get chirped for my atrocious shots (particularly compared to other aspects of my game), so I just say "yeh, hence the title, I have troubles shooting".
I'm silver 2. I've hit gold 1. The game reminded me that there's no fucking difference between that and bronze 2, because I've been all 3 in 2 days...
    A couple friends were playing 2v2.  They dropped from plat 1 to bronze 3 one night.  They were laughing the whole time.  Sometimes, it's better to laugh.
        I did that one night with alcohol...
            We just do it with our skills.
        I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
    Can confirm I've been legit in B3 at 8 hours, 80 hours, and again at 800 hours.
        i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
            I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
    Lmao I know that feel, but with Plat 1 all the way down to bronze. I was reminded when I played on a friend's account expecting to clean up against noobs.
    Bro i was gold 3 div 3, lost 1 game in ot, now I'm gold 2 div 3. What is the rank system?
        No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
            Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
                Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
            It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
    I have been all shades of platinum. Never diamond. Never diamond.
    It depends upon your expectations from teammates, under Plat, you can't really trust your TMs to clear or save an easy shot, as everyone is still learning the mechanics. 

Your rank pretty much is indicated by how many games you're going to play last man eternally and defend the net haha.

You get those kind of fluctuations too, I had a bitch of a time where I'd dip down to Plat 2, then up to high Dia 1, so on. 
I finally started not relying upon my teammate for consistent clears, etc (when you get to a certain level, you just expect good hits 99% of the time) and played with "I must carry our defence" in mind, was super careful not to overcommit, etc, shot up to D2 almost overnight,  then have slowly migrated back to a bit more of a trusting style, and I'm now up to champ 1. 

People can preach rotation, etc, but it just doesn't work at some ranks.
I think he was deducing the spread out from starting in 2015 and having only 200 hours in the game
Yeah anger issues and rocket league do not mix lmao
could be the reason I'm in diamond but cant aerial: I refuse to practice. I just want to hop on, win a few games, feel the good brain juice, and hop off. Being diamond is pure luck I guess.

Edit: just to clarify, i can aerial and often from weird angles, but 9 times out of 10 my car doesn't spin to get a hard shot and half the time i whiff anyway.
    I too refuse to practice, I'm never "going pro" so don't see the point, and feel like Diamond is the limit for people such as us
        I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
            I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
                Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
                    Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                        Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                        Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
                    I feel so at home in this thread!
                    This gives me hope lmao
                lol.

&#x200B;

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
                    I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
                Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
                Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
                Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
            Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
                Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
                    This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
                        Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
                That's basically my flair.
            Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
            I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
                It's called not being an adult.
                    Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
                    Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
            Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
        Depends on your definition of practice. I've never used a training pack and I only use free play to mess around while waiting for a match. I am certain that casual matches make up well under 1% of my total game play.

So it's entirely possible to go past diamond without doing any sort of concentrated practice. What I do is see what the people at my rank are doing that I can't and I try to learn and execute it all through ranked games, so I guess I could see that being "practice" of some kind.

But I think getting to GC would be another story. I've been C2/C3 for like a year and a half now and have accepted I'll need to practice if I ever want GC. But just like y'all I really don't want to put in that grind at all.
            I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
                Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
                    I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
        Diamond is still full of toxic assholes who look like smurfs... but they claim they aren‚Äôt. Except for your teammate. He‚Äôs always the lucky silver who somehow got ranked up
            Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
        I refused to practice until D3...stuck in Silver is almost inexcusable lol.
            Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
                And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
        Hell yeah. I tried the whole practice a few minutes before playing a match thing and I hated it. I'm comfortable at diamond 1. I reached diamond 2 once and I couldn't even win one match at that level so back down to diamond 1 and I'm happy.
            Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
        But freestyling and learning to freestyle is so much fun.

I refused to practice also until I downloaded Baakesmod. Now I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll spend a whole night in freeplay instead of in games.
        Dude what the hell, I don't play without a solid 20-30mins warmup in the practice and I'm topping out around plat 2-3. Just how..
    This. I'm in Gold 3 since 2017 because I just play the game. I don't even play it every day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, just for half an hour each session. I've never done any training of any kind, and I refuse to do it. I have other games to play. Rocket League is like my in-between-games game.
    This right here. I‚Äôm not working on mechanics so I can do the latest musty half cancel triple touch reset pinch. Car go brrrrrr
        WSB leaking in to Rocket League I see.
    If you play just one game of 1v1 you'll be that much tighter for the following 3v3 games.
    Feel the good brain juice? While playing this game? How
        By spamming what a save and ruining your team mates night for a mistake you made. It's clearly very enjoyable since all my team mates do it
    Are you me? Except I‚Äôm in plat 2/3. I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 (although I did stop for about two years) and I still don‚Äôt really know how to aerial. Just have never felt the motivation to learn it since I‚Äôm still having fun at the rank I‚Äôm at. 

It helps that I don‚Äôt have too many friends that play the game, and the ones that do suck worse than me so I feel no peer pressure to get better
        How dare you have fun! Rocket League is meant to be an endless, hateful grind to the top.
    I refuse to practice too but I have made it to Champ 2 just by playing. I mean if you play enough you'll definitely have better positioning, rotation and aerials at some point because those things are pretty much necessary every game. I can't dribble tho (ground nor air) because that requires practice imo, or do any fancy thing really.
Probably just playing passively or off and on. I got worse from 2016 was gold now bronze (I did move to pc so that might be the reason for that) but I took a year off to focus on overwatch and I guess I unimproved.
    people have definitely gotten better at this game. After a long hiatus i came back to silver to find everyone hitting balls out of the air. I was astonished at the time. We don't play the game the same way anymore.
        Your absolutely right its scary to see silvers hitting  ceiling resets and wavedashes. 2015 RL and 2020 RL are two different games!
            2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
            No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
            Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
                Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
                    Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
        I recently switched to PC and had to play placement matches from 0, I too was very shocked by how much better the low ranks have become
        I thought I was going crazy... Used to be diamond 2 a couple years ago and I can't crawl out of plat 1 anymore in 2s!
        Big truths all the way across ranks. Took a year hiatus myself too. Left as a C2, and returned struggling to hold D3 for a while.
Me and my friends are around Gold III, popped into Platinum I for a week or two then went back down to Gold II.

We've had the game since 2015 (or at least early 2016), but we play maybe once or twice a week. We don't practice, we don't care about learning advanced mechanics - it's just a excuse for us to have a drink and play some games. We've also had a handful of times where we've not played for several months.

It's not that surprising at all.
When I came back this summer I started at silver. Even though I started in 2015 I only had 250 hours.
    Was the same for me in season 12. Starded s1 but came back just mid S12 with 250ish hours. Now I have over a thousand üòÇ thanks corona
I go through long periods of not playing, if I don't play for half a year and come back to the same rank other people are noticeable worse.  Rank inflation is a thing in my anecdotal experience so staying the same rank implies they're getting worse even.
preach
Oh my god. You mean someone that isn‚Äôt hopelessly addicted to a car soccer?
    It... it simply cannot be!
    Hey, I can stop whenever I want!
        You can, but seriously don't. I tried it, do not recommend.
most accurate, plus no practice.
No you‚Äôre not man. I don‚Äôt think you are.
But that feeling when you hit champ and you‚Äôre so happy. Only to lose the next 3 games and go right back to D3.  Feels bad.
So not much at all for you. Not too much is expected if your sub-100 hours in game. Of course everyone progresses at their own speeds too. If you've poked into Plat 1 a few timed with just over 72 hours, you're doing fine.

Also whenever I discuss the timeframes that generally apply to different ranks in this game, it makes me immediately question how are you supposed to sell anyone on this game if you tell them you'll be garbage until you've sunk x hundreds of hours into the game. Like, that's a crazy person thing to suggest... yet here we all are.
    It isn't really crazy though. 

Will you suck forever at this? Probably yes. Because it's a tough game. We all suck to varying degrees and that's 100% fine. 

The end goal for the majority of the player base is having fun one way or the other; for some that entails chasing clips, for some it's purely about winning no matter how pretty the gameplay looks. 

The point is you don't need to play hundreds of hours to have fun with this game.
        I told my buddy last night, "Everybody sucks at this game. Higher ranks just suck *faster*"
            Except for my teammates. They're perfect and if I fall below their standards they immediately ff
            This is very true. I whiff all the time, but I try to only take risky plays when I'm not the last man.
...oh ok then
    I don't really practice at all tbh, and I play with kb+m.

And most importantly, my IQ is a one digit number.
        well, as long as you enjoy it.
why don‚Äôt you link your xbox account to your pc and get your old tag
    Wait do inventories combine if I do that?
        [deleted]
            Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
                [deleted]
                    I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
        yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
    i dont remember the login lol i gave away my xbox years ago
        If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
        oof
Everyone goes at their own pace :D No problem haha
    Totally! To be fair, I ‚Äútried hard‚Äù, obsessively watched videos, with some training for like my last 150 hours of play time.
        That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
600hrs here and G2. Thanks for fucking destroying my spirits!!!
Wtf I'm at 1300h and D2/C1 congrats dude
I can try. For me what helped me was analyzing my replays to find out that I need to practice my recoveries(yours might not suck though). Learning when to get softer touches on the ball or boom it. And probably what helped the most for me was setting up, hitting, and defending backboard shots. 

I hope that helps and good luck with the grind!

Edit: I should add that it is very important to not care too much about your rank. For the longest time I bordered in d3 div 3-4 and those were some of the most stressful matches for me because I was just so close. Caring less helped me focus on achieving better skill and consistency, helped me respect the skills of my opponents (one of which helped coach me a little) and overall have more fun.
Yup 2016 is the last "OG" year IMO. Considering it didn't release on Xbox until June, 2016.
I goaltend fairly well. I love to pinch things. And I mainly work on boost conservation although it still needs tons of work. My shot accuracy is meh but I train alot on soft touch and passing as well as total field view and other player positioning.

Mechanics are for nerds lol
That can go badly, man.
Rocketeer took quite a bit of effort to get when the cap was level 75. Took me ages to get iirc
    yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
    I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
        They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
        I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
        No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
            Thank you for the moral support lol
        I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
        I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
I left mine on troubleshooter, because I have trouble shooting
100... You're lyin... it was level 70-75.
    I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
        74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
    It's currently 100
He's talking about back when rocketeer actually took a crazy amount of hours, it doesn't take anywhere near as much now.
    I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
        How many hours roughly?
            To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
                Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
            It took around 800-1200 hours for most
            It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
Precious memories
I use Sherpa too because I‚Äôm always carrying my friends.
Yes! What's rocket league without a healthy amount of chaos
    Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
        I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
        I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
        So we meet again. Ill get you next time.
Boost Hog baby
I use Speed Demon so no one's surprised when I whiff at max speed
If people used titles that described them perfectly, the ball chaser title would be a lot more common.
Wild Card for me.

Hit a banger? Whiff an easy save? Demo the goalie? Miss the demo and put the whole team out of position?

WILD CARD, BITCHES! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Yeah, it's sad IMO when I was on the come up in the early days I could use those to decide what role I would assume until play started and I learned  what I needed to do to best help the team.

Hell I think it defined my play style as the passer/hockey style defender.

Downside I spent so much of the early days setting up the ally-oop dunk in front of the goal and making safe clears, that I didn't spend time practicing ball control.

My oldest Est. 20** banner is something I apparently need to get from my old Xbox Account, along with all the items that weren't tradable. No longer having an Xbox makes this a challenge.

I typically just rock the OG Player title, and I can't even remember which were earned actually mean something and which were game pass rewards and shit.
    Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
        Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
A couple friends were playing 2v2.  They dropped from plat 1 to bronze 3 one night.  They were laughing the whole time.  Sometimes, it's better to laugh.
    I did that one night with alcohol...
        We just do it with our skills.
    I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
Can confirm I've been legit in B3 at 8 hours, 80 hours, and again at 800 hours.
    i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
        I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
Lmao I know that feel, but with Plat 1 all the way down to bronze. I was reminded when I played on a friend's account expecting to clean up against noobs.
Bro i was gold 3 div 3, lost 1 game in ot, now I'm gold 2 div 3. What is the rank system?
    No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
        Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
            Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
        It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
I have been all shades of platinum. Never diamond. Never diamond.
It depends upon your expectations from teammates, under Plat, you can't really trust your TMs to clear or save an easy shot, as everyone is still learning the mechanics. 

Your rank pretty much is indicated by how many games you're going to play last man eternally and defend the net haha.

You get those kind of fluctuations too, I had a bitch of a time where I'd dip down to Plat 2, then up to high Dia 1, so on. 
I finally started not relying upon my teammate for consistent clears, etc (when you get to a certain level, you just expect good hits 99% of the time) and played with "I must carry our defence" in mind, was super careful not to overcommit, etc, shot up to D2 almost overnight,  then have slowly migrated back to a bit more of a trusting style, and I'm now up to champ 1. 

People can preach rotation, etc, but it just doesn't work at some ranks.
I too refuse to practice, I'm never "going pro" so don't see the point, and feel like Diamond is the limit for people such as us
    I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
        I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
            Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
                Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                    Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                    Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
                I feel so at home in this thread!
                This gives me hope lmao
            lol.

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
                I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
            Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
            Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
            Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
        Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
            Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
                This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
                    Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
            That's basically my flair.
        Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
        I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
            It's called not being an adult.
                Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
                Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
        Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
    Depends on your definition of practice. I've never used a training pack and I only use free play to mess around while waiting for a match. I am certain that casual matches make up well under 1% of my total game play.

So it's entirely possible to go past diamond without doing any sort of concentrated practice. What I do is see what the people at my rank are doing that I can't and I try to learn and execute it all through ranked games, so I guess I could see that being "practice" of some kind.

But I think getting to GC would be another story. I've been C2/C3 for like a year and a half now and have accepted I'll need to practice if I ever want GC. But just like y'all I really don't want to put in that grind at all.
        I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
            Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
                I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
    Diamond is still full of toxic assholes who look like smurfs... but they claim they aren‚Äôt. Except for your teammate. He‚Äôs always the lucky silver who somehow got ranked up
        Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
    I refused to practice until D3...stuck in Silver is almost inexcusable lol.
        Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
            And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
    Hell yeah. I tried the whole practice a few minutes before playing a match thing and I hated it. I'm comfortable at diamond 1. I reached diamond 2 once and I couldn't even win one match at that level so back down to diamond 1 and I'm happy.
        Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
    But freestyling and learning to freestyle is so much fun.

I refused to practice also until I downloaded Baakesmod. Now I enjoy it. Sometimes I'll spend a whole night in freeplay instead of in games.
    Dude what the hell, I don't play without a solid 20-30mins warmup in the practice and I'm topping out around plat 2-3. Just how..
This. I'm in Gold 3 since 2017 because I just play the game. I don't even play it every day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week, just for half an hour each session. I've never done any training of any kind, and I refuse to do it. I have other games to play. Rocket League is like my in-between-games game.
This right here. I‚Äôm not working on mechanics so I can do the latest musty half cancel triple touch reset pinch. Car go brrrrrr
    WSB leaking in to Rocket League I see.
If you play just one game of 1v1 you'll be that much tighter for the following 3v3 games.
Feel the good brain juice? While playing this game? How
    By spamming what a save and ruining your team mates night for a mistake you made. It's clearly very enjoyable since all my team mates do it
Are you me? Except I‚Äôm in plat 2/3. I‚Äôve been playing since 2015 (although I did stop for about two years) and I still don‚Äôt really know how to aerial. Just have never felt the motivation to learn it since I‚Äôm still having fun at the rank I‚Äôm at. 

It helps that I don‚Äôt have too many friends that play the game, and the ones that do suck worse than me so I feel no peer pressure to get better
    How dare you have fun! Rocket League is meant to be an endless, hateful grind to the top.
I refuse to practice too but I have made it to Champ 2 just by playing. I mean if you play enough you'll definitely have better positioning, rotation and aerials at some point because those things are pretty much necessary every game. I can't dribble tho (ground nor air) because that requires practice imo, or do any fancy thing really.
people have definitely gotten better at this game. After a long hiatus i came back to silver to find everyone hitting balls out of the air. I was astonished at the time. We don't play the game the same way anymore.
    Your absolutely right its scary to see silvers hitting  ceiling resets and wavedashes. 2015 RL and 2020 RL are two different games!
        2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
        No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
        Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
            Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
                Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
    I recently switched to PC and had to play placement matches from 0, I too was very shocked by how much better the low ranks have become
    I thought I was going crazy... Used to be diamond 2 a couple years ago and I can't crawl out of plat 1 anymore in 2s!
    Big truths all the way across ranks. Took a year hiatus myself too. Left as a C2, and returned struggling to hold D3 for a while.
Was the same for me in season 12. Starded s1 but came back just mid S12 with 250ish hours. Now I have over a thousand üòÇ thanks corona
It... it simply cannot be!
Hey, I can stop whenever I want!
    You can, but seriously don't. I tried it, do not recommend.
It isn't really crazy though. 

Will you suck forever at this? Probably yes. Because it's a tough game. We all suck to varying degrees and that's 100% fine. 

The end goal for the majority of the player base is having fun one way or the other; for some that entails chasing clips, for some it's purely about winning no matter how pretty the gameplay looks. 

The point is you don't need to play hundreds of hours to have fun with this game.
    I told my buddy last night, "Everybody sucks at this game. Higher ranks just suck *faster*"
        Except for my teammates. They're perfect and if I fall below their standards they immediately ff
        This is very true. I whiff all the time, but I try to only take risky plays when I'm not the last man.
I don't really practice at all tbh, and I play with kb+m.

And most importantly, my IQ is a one digit number.
    well, as long as you enjoy it.
Wait do inventories combine if I do that?
    [deleted]
        Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
            [deleted]
                I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
    yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
i dont remember the login lol i gave away my xbox years ago
    If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
    oof
Totally! To be fair, I ‚Äútried hard‚Äù, obsessively watched videos, with some training for like my last 150 hours of play time.
    That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
yes it took me forever and i was so sad when they changed the leveling system
I too was an og rocketeer. The leveling change made it seem like the work to reach it was invalidated. Have yet to reach GC. Sitting in Champ 1 right now. Not one to blame my teammates for L's but I swear. Solo queue makes it tougher. I have maybe 1 personal friend in Champ. And our schedules conflict. So I solo'd my way to champ. So I guess if anybody wants to play sometime lemme know. Can't promise I'll be on point every game. But I needs champ people to progress.
    They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
    I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
    No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
        Thank you for the moral support lol
    I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
    I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
I was stuck at 70-74 for so long holy shit
    74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
It's currently 100
I got the tag about a month before they reduced how long it took to get it. I still rocked it for a solid year because I was still proud of it haha
    How many hours roughly?
        To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
            Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
        It took around 800-1200 hours for most
        It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
Fairly sure demos release just as much endorphin for me as goals do at this point. Not to mention how great it feels when someone gets outwardly tilted at my (perfectly legit) playstyle and flames me in chat or ignores the actual play to chase me around the pitch. In their mind they're getting revenge against a player they perceive as toxic, but from my POV they're just giving me the highest praise possible.
    I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
    I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
    So we meet again. Ill get you next time.
Buy an xbox and return it next day lol
    Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
I did that one night with alcohol...
    We just do it with our skills.
I can't believe this actually happened to someone else. I feel so validated now, thank you for sharing.
i kinda understand the first two   
but how can you be bronze at 800???
    I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
No clue, but I honestly think it should be changed a bit. I can't even count how many times I've been dropped from Silver back to bronze because my teammate left in the first minute and it was a 2v1. It would be nice to have things like that considered.
    Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
        Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
    It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
I also refuse to practice, but made it to c1 purely because I have a shitload of hours. Now I'm facing people who start with an hour training drill, whereas I hop straight on with a half broken controller.
    I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
        Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
            Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
                Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
                Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.

            This gives me hope lmao

well, as long as you enjoy it.

    Wait so I can still use my baby skyline?
        [deleted]
            I hope we can. I don't mind not being able to use batmobile, but I rely heavily on skyline. It's perfect for me. I'd hate to not be able to use it
yup, that‚Äôs how i got my white octane from my xbox to my pc
If you know the email attached to the Xbox account you should be able to recover it. You can sign in on any internet browser.
oof
That's a huge difference in timeframes within the playerbase. More people like you are cropping up who've reached solid ranks in less time than people who've played longer, likely because of the improved training options and the cornucopia of game knowledge that has been shared since release.

If someone jumps in right now and wants to improve quickly, they have all the resources to do it. Right after release, you kinda just had to play and watch the odd video here and there. You didn't have all the custom training packs yet either (unless you were on PC, but I'm not sure when bakkesmod came out). Those have been a *huge* boon to the player base.
They changed the leveling system when I was a hair away from 75. I remember that bar barely moving after every game.
I get that it's tough but pls never sell your soul to the idea that you "need" some friends to rank up. It'll carry you, but with the lost pain comes lost lessons, and while you might be able to maintain that rank if you're careful, you won't have the fortitude to regain it once you lose it.

I know C1 is hard with a bunch of toxic people who have their identity in the game vested in a rank they're holding onto by the skin of their teeth, but C2 is way less random and a *little* less toxic and C3 is where I finally feel a tier increase in play (like once you crack through, the lower ranks become significantly easier to conquer in the future).

Sorry for rambling, I get the feeling, and playing with friends is great, but you can always succeed on your own with a bit more grind.
No you don‚Äôt! You can solo q to gc, i believe in you!
    Thank you for the moral support lol
I have the same problem, I was about to get into plat 2 in rumble and all of sudden, I start queuing with horrible teammates. I go into gold 3 and and out of nowhere, get demoted again to gold 2. I can never find good teammates, and when I do, they leave before I can party up with themüòî
I know the pain, i STRICTLY only que in standard 3s, solo. But i dont play solo standard xD. One of my friends is roughly diamond 1, and the other is maybe plat 3. I bounce between Champ 1 div 2 and Champ 2 div 4 on and off depending on the week lol.
74-75 took like a month of grind. 70-75? At least 3 or 4
How many hours roughly?
    To get the tag? I honestly don't know, it was a few years ago. I can tell you that over the past 5 years I've put 1200 hours in and have never reached higher than diamond 3.
        Don't confuse ranked with exp. Some of us have 2500 hours and ride plat season after season. Game is still fun for us.
    It took around 800-1200 hours for most
    It was pretty much 1000 steam hours to reach Rocketeer
I'm pretty fucking good at dodging demos, but I can only nod and smile in respect when I let myself get caught. People who get mad at demos just need to learn some awareness. At the higher ranks - especially watching pros play - properly timed demos are an art form.
I dont get the people that get more annoyed at demos than goals. If it wasn't a legit thing to do in ranked they would pull it out. Granted getting juggled out of the goal and to the other end of the field would be even more frustrating lol
So we meet again. Ill get you next time.
Would be a good way to get a new controller where the right thumb stick isn't starting to drift.

I'd normally flat out shoot this kind of pretty mild dishonesty immediately down...but I am getting so sick of having to replace controllers every 6-8 months. It's bullshit how poorly made they are internally (in my experience).

I'd gladly pay for the Elite 2 controller, or other custom controller makers, if I could find one of them talking about upgraded internals and externals, and throw in a 1 year totally free warranty for anything beside blatant abuse, like a rage throw.

But I'll probably just ask my brother to log into my account for me.
We just do it with our skills.
I play the game for fun mostly after work when I'm drunk and tired. I also only solo queue, so sometimes I get really bad streaks of teammates. I've gone from g2 to be in a night and bounced back the next day
Here‚Äôs a tip for you, if your teammate leaves first in a ranked match before 3:30, you don‚Äôt lose any mmr if you leave the match.
    Oh shit, I didn't know that. Thanks so much!
It was a close game, then I win a game and I'm up 1 div, but losing will gladly pummel you into the ground, maybe everyone at lower ranks should be a bit higher but they just get stuck in the storm of up and down after every game, higher ranks you have to lose of win a few games to go up or down, lower ranks, you get 5 wins in a row and all is gone in 2 losses.
I practiced some mechanical items but I‚Äôm guessing I can speak for a lot of people champ and higher. I never warm up before playing. I just jump into a ranked game and hope for the best.
    Yuppp lol. I‚Äôll start a free training right after queuing. Get in a shitty air dribble and boom in the match.
        Whiff 3 open net shots in training... yep I‚Äôm ready for ranked.
            Takes the ball up for the aerial and just fly over it not touching it once...
            Whew, glad I got those whiffs out before the real game starts.
        I feel so at home in this thread!
        This gives me hope lmao
    lol.

23h - Start seing a few videos.

23:15 - Spam my friends steam group to form a x3 party

23:30 - party formed, not a single warmup and we jump in ranked right away

00:00 - lost 2, win 1.. starting to warm up..

01:00 - our best .. maybe a few mmr up (6w,3l ?)

01:30 - we are becoming tired, lose 3 in a row and we all rage quit. Net result: between -10 and +10 mmr(every day)

next day: we hope this time will be better
        I have never related to a comment so much in my life.
    Champ 3 and I‚Äôve never practiced. The only ‚Äúpractice‚Äù I do is free play in between queues. I do watch squishy‚Äôs videos of his gameplay though, so I think I‚Äôve picked up strategies from those.
    Whenever I play I do freeplay for around 20 seconds until the ball miraculously rolls in the goal, and then go into a match. Its a great warmup
    Typically if i‚Äôm playing solo i‚Äôll just hop in free play and put a stream on in the other monitor. If i‚Äôm playing with a friend we just do cas for a while and hop off. So whenever I do play ranked I usually go up a couple divs because I do it so rarely.
Knowing how to position yourself and rotating is honestly a bigger part of winning games than pure mechanical skill.
    Speaking from experience, you still need enough mechanical skill to not completely whiff the ball like 90% of the time.
        This is true, but also speaking from experience that usually can come with time. You learn the angles. I'm by no means amazing at this game, in fact for the first 7 seasons I didn't get out of diamond. I still can't dribble, do wall-to-air shots, etc. But rotating and positioning myself has won me more games than I can count.
            Well I can‚Äôt do those things either, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn how to hit the ball.
    That's basically my flair.
Holy shit I feel that. First game of the day is always against someone who‚Äôs been playing 14 hours straight.
I don't even have an hour a day to play, how do they find an hour to practice a day.
    It's called not being an adult.
        Nah. I work full time and I could play four hours every day plus weekends if I just chose to ignore my friends.
        Being an adult doesnt mean you get no time for leisure. Being an adult with young kids, yeah, but I dont see why adults without that going on for them, wouldnt have have time to play
Hah bruh we're the same. I'm C1/C2 floater who never practices and wins purely on solid positioning and good goaltending. Can't hit a rotating aerial or really even deke people....
I'm similar. I hardly ever do any actual practice, many players platinum and up can pull off nuttier things than I can in the air. The only thing I've learned intuitively is dribbling, just by trying it in matches a lot.

I wish it was possible to learn everything else in matches.
    Yeah, even at C2 I've never learned to quick aerial and still do single jump aerials 95% of the time. These days those are being learned in plat lol. This is probably something I could address in game but it's so ingrained in me to not do it that it'd be a struggle, and I just wanna have fun
        I just learned to quick aerial and end up too high for the ball half the time in my gold matches so don't even bother lmfao
Diamond And champ 1 and 2 is full of players that have practiced those cool mechanics like air dribbling and flip resetting but will never make it to GC because they never learned to stop ball chasing or how to properly rotate. Even in Champ 3, I was still seeing people who would sit on boost pads waiting for them to come up, people who run for boost instead of a save because they‚Äôre too uncomfortable without boost to do anything, people who rotate directly under the ball for long periods of time, and people who run deep inside the goal then wait for the opponent to shoot before attempting the save. These are all terrible habits and you can‚Äôt tell any of them what they‚Äôre doing wrong because ‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôve made it this far, I must be great‚Äù
Some people just have poor hand/eye coordination and poor reaction time. Practice can only enhance those things up to a certain point.
    And on the other hand, having those things is a SERIOUS boost. I have both of those and I‚Äôm C2 playing on a keyboard and never doing drills or practicing in free play. I‚Äôm DMG in CS:GO and I don‚Äôt buy nades (they get you killed, the enemy always seems to know exactly when you pull them out). If you have the physical makeup for it, you can go far even doing things subjectively wrong.
Practice: The time I spend playing casual until I get tired of loading into 0 - 7 matches on the losing team before switch to ranked mode.
2015 player here. I have no idea what a wavedash or a flip reset are.

If a match gets going and my opponent can hit the ball from the wall, I know I'm going to lose.
No way. I refuse to believe silvers are hitting those shots. Those are smurfs. I play low plat/high gold in 2s right now, and high plat/low diamond in 3s, and in Diamond 1 people are barely hitting good ceiling shots
Wait, wavedashes? I haven't played much RL. I've only ever heard that term for melee
    Yeah, that's where the name comes from. Same concept, essentially: when you're on the wall, driving down to the ground is significantly slower than jumping off the wall, landing on two wheels, and then flipping in the direction your wheels that are in the air (typically, this means landing on your back two wheels and forward dodging). If you execute it correctly, the ground will stop you from flipping, and, instead, you will convert the momentum from the flip into forward speed.
        Oh that's sick! That's definitely really similar to a melee wavedash. Weird since the games couldn't be more different.

Thanks for the explanation!
