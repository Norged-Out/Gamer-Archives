This is good
    This is 4fit league

        It's for me?! You shouldn't have!
    It hit me
    [deleted]
        It's still good, just not perfect
        Remember when I asked
            Pepperidge Farm remembers
                Hehe
                What does it mean, my friends say that, but I don’t understand it
    No this is Patrick
i have never seen that meme template before and i actually find it really funny and slightly relatable because... just look at my rank
    its just as bad up here in gc
        I’m having trouble getting rewards after hitting GC for first time because my random solo queue teammate will whiff a save, we go down 1-0 with 4 minutes left... they will proceed to flame me and my other random teammate and then abandon match down 1-0. This occurs multiple times nightly lol
            i eventually managed to get my rewards, after much salt and tilt

it probably doesnt help that im just a kid with a short attention span, but i feel myself flaming more each time i play. id rather not be a disservice to people that might matchmake with me, so i just go off and play something singleplayer. 1v1 is garbage because my entire playstyle involves giving my teammate the ball and my brain hurts playing it. i dont like rl anymore.
                Gotta just find the right people to play with and control your mentality. Mentality is the number 1 thing that needs to be addressed before any mechanic or rotation. Once you are able to grind ranked without any negativity you will climb even more.
                    my 2s partner also quit the game eventually. lost motivation to play really
                        There’s always more! Breaks from the game aren’t bad either. I’ve taken many multiple month breaks and came back feeling better/refreshed. I’m bout to come back after a few week break because I was feeling burnt out. Heading into a tourney tomorrow I may not be 100 mechanical/rotational but my mentality will be fresh.
                            always nice after taking a few week break to be fair
                                I mean you don’t need to keep playing rl. Once I hit GC I just stopped playing due to severe burnout and now I have found enjoyment in other games!
                    Mentality is definitely the most important aspect most people don't focus on until they get to gc and realize how important it is for gaining mmr over time
                Dude I feel you. I've gotten to the point of not liking rl anymore either, the constant toxicity turned me into a toxic player too. I finally realized I wasn't having fun anymore and was just getting super tilted every time I played. The only thing I really liked doing was free play. Haven't played in about 3 weeks.
                    I felt that way and recently just disabled chat. Does wonders for my actual skill. You make a mistake here or there and when everyone else in the game freaking out and spamming quickchat isnt there to read you just... Play. Its really refreshing. I'll probably turn it back on team only next time i turn it on. Its not much better with random teammates but in higher tiers i like communicating.
                        Disabling the chat helps a lot
                    Same reason I quit playing mobas. The communities are just awful. Toxic players creating more toxic players. I really only play rocket league when friends are at my house now and we can bullshit around for a bit.
                I don't have the short attention span, but I get tilted more than I'm willing to admit lately. Mostly I turn off chat but there's nothing like having regular mates to play with in voice. You can flame as angry as you want without the random ever noticing it. I'm not the "dude, ghat guy's trash" type, but the occasional "DUDE, STOP TF CHASING" or "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE???" and my friend laughing or agreeing helps a lot. If your friends don't play RL, turning off chat still is a viable option. I'm way below your rank, so take this with a grain of salt, but in my experience there usually just isn't enough useful team chat to justify it to be turned on when I feel like the flames could get to me.
                    yeah, i turned chat back on like a month ago and it did help with kickoffs (even though i had I GOT IT in my name)
                        True, it's easy to get out of position if you go just in case and react to your mate when there's 2 options for kickoff.

But it's better for my blood pressure, so I'm willingly taking that risk sometimes^^
                I only play like four games of Rocket in a row before I have to switch games from frustration. Unless I’m playing with my club then it’s just not worth the anger
            Yeah my GC friend said people are giant pussies at GC about that. Sheesh.

People need to stop being so damn sensitive and play the game out! Mistakes happen.
            I was in the same boat as you like a week ago but turned chat off and got like 8 wins in a row just not worrying about people
            GC is really that bad? I'm glad I'm stuck in low Champ
                Low GC really is, that's where everyone is grinding for their rewards and trying to stay in GC, the toxicity there is like no other rank lol. It gets better in the 1600s
            Just sounds like normal gc to me
            I’m high C2/low C3 - was really hoping this would end by the time I got good enough to be GC
            The rewards come, I only solo q and if you really deserve the rewards you’ll get them. The climb starts from there, good luck bro
                Yay solo queuers unite
        We could've had an amazing thread but you playin
        Not as bad down here in gold
        You’re not gc, nice flex bro
        Oooo look at us were highly ranked. GROW UP.

    Man I just really don't understand all of the FFs. I've been in games where we were 3-0, the other team scores one single goal and all of a sudden my teammates are acting like we are on the Titanic.
        It’s a game of momentum for sure.

People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose. Learn from your mistakes and move onto the next play. Ignore anyone flaming you.
            >People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose.  
  
Everytime I say this they're like "how can you have fun if you're not winning" and proceed to roast me again. I mean if it wasn't that easy to leave casual matches I'd play it instead smh
                True. And I definitely have more fun winning. Haha who doesn’t? I think we can all be guilty of being tilted too. Just gotta roll with it. Finding consistent people to play with on mics has made this all easier for me.
        I'm always just like "go for a walk" or something, people get too caught up in the game. It's weird to me, I play games to relax and have fun, if its not fun don't play

Like, last week I was up 4-0 on my last game for champ rewards and both my teammates disconnected, lost 5-4 and I dropped out of champ. If I can survive that without raging out I think people should be able to survive a single goal against lol
            Ill take you to get your champ rewards bby
                lol ngl i'd be down, i didn't really expect them this season but if i can *just* qualify again before season ends tmrw for 1 game... i'm close haha
                    Just message me your name when u add
                        genuinely appreciate the offer! i was going to take you up on it but i ended up actually making it, been able to stay above the fold since a couple days after that comment 

it's a silly thing to care about but i'm happy haha ^(only took like 3 extensions of the season to get there :P)
                    Steamcommunity.com/id/reeks___/   Add me
    i felt that
        I was diamond for a good few years and then stopped playing for a while and I'm now plat 1. 

So many people just throw the toys out the pram as soon as they make one mistake. I feel it was better in diamond but I'm probably just looking with nostalgia tinted glasses.
            Gold is the worst overall rank in the game (players think they’re good but they’re terrible and have no game sense. But Plat is definitely the most toxic.
                Hooray I'm in both! I miss the silver days where you'd watch the ball float down so you can hit it.
                    Lol back when you couldn't do aerials but also couldn't dribble so you just double jumped into everything.
                        I've never actually been able to soley double jump well, second jump is always a dodge except when i aerial. Once I got to the pont where I was losing challenges because I cant double jump, I learned how to double jump aerial ironically enough.
                    Don't speak that evil, silver is purgatory. Ive had to crawl out of that nightmare a few times and sit in goal and make saves my own team is throwing at me when they arent passing it to the opposite team. 

People in silver just hit the ball just to hit the ball, they don't even know what direction their going. It is nice though when it bounces high and not one person in the game can successfully aerial so they all fly out of the way and you can just gently bonk it at the goal and watch it roll in. 

Ah silver... You're either laughing hysterically or pulling your hair out. Its chaos.
                I always found diamond to be the most toxic. That’s when people think they’re good but they’re still bad. I would miss one save and TM’s would act like I just fucked their mom in front of them. Everyone is a little more of a bro when you hit champ, but the one score forfeits are still rampant.
                    We probably have different standards considering D1 is the highest I’ve ever been ranked in doubles lol. Tbh I find the higher you go, the less toxic people are because everyone plays better so there’s generally less to get upset about. You might forget just how much of a gongshow low Plat is. It’s basically just Gold but a bit faster, so everyone’s chasing and whiffing constantly, then blaming teammates for their own mistakes.
                        It probably is bias honestly. I was in plat for like 2 weeks and I was in diamond for probably almost a year since I really don’t play consistently at all. I just remember it being an exquisite level of toxic hellhole. Honestly it might just be that RL is a toxic hellhole.
                I think people sleep on the toxicity of fresh grand champs. When you get into 1700+ people just talk less overall. But in the 1500-1600 range you get a lot of toxicity. My favorite is the very common “god I hate when I get matched with 1500s”, as if their 1660 peak makes them so much godlier. Most of the time they’re dead wrong too. Or the low 1500 who says “you’ll never hit grand champ if you keep doing xyz”, and I’m just like “judging by what bakkesmod is telling me I’m almost 200 points above you...”.
    Don't worry it does not improve at all even when you get to where I am.
        Don't worry it gets even worse here
    Don’t worry I’ve had a guy try to FF 0-0 2 mins in after I missed a double touch from the corner
        That was probably more of a joke than anything. Ive had teammates FF with 30 seconds left when we are up by 5 for the memes. Of course if i see 2/3 im for sure going to do it as well.
    If you think 4fitting early is rank related I’m sorry to burst your bubble but it’s every rank top to bottom
    I felt that
        I felt that
            I felt that
    You play on ps4 or Xbox ?  I’ve been looking for a plat 2 tm8
        switch 😳
    I'm plat 2 as well. I believe u. Yesterday the other team scored and ONCE I said go for it. As soon as i said it he ff vote and we have 4 mins and 30 secs for somthn
    *cough* Amateur.
Genuinely was 3-1 to them and we had 3 minutes left and we ended up winning but my man thought we should forfeit
    4-1, same here.

Was partied with my mate, rando voted to forfeit at 3:30 on the dot. We proceeded to win in OT and that asshat had the audacity to click party up postgame.
        The lion the witch and the audacity of this bitch
            Never Party Up with a bitch
                Love him or hate him he is spitting straight fax
        [deleted]
            That’s evil
        Met a nice dude in ranked, we played pretty good but i was on fire so i carried him pretty hard. Very polite n stuff. Next day i change my steam username (i change it like everyday to stupid things) and i solo queued to warm up. Didnt realize i solo queued into a team with him until after kickoff. So im warming up and waiting till the next goal to say "hey we met yesterday" or something like that. Then he missed a double jump aerial and ended up on the opponents side of the field with no boost. I defended one shot but i missed a save, which i'll admit was pretty easy and i messed up (but remember he did put me in that position). So im like eh whatever and im about to say hey whats up and i get an ff vote and a gg in public chat. 1-0 3:00 left or smtn like that. I dont think i have to say how fast i unfriended that loser.
    While admittedly somewhat stupid, Whenever my teammate tries to FF or we are just down by 3 or 4, I always type:

‘We are still gonna win’

It seems to get my teammates confidence back, gets mine back, and makes the opposing team a bit uneasy.

Chat in RL is a mental part of the game
        Yeah confidence is a big part to challenge your opponent
    I was in a hoops game and the score was 2-2 with 2 minutes left and my teamate wanted to forfeit
        Wtf is wrong with people its not like you were losing
            Exactly we ended up winning that game though.
I think the reason he voted is because the opponent did a sick airdribble
                Yeah you just got to have confidence in your team and yourself
    That's when you vote to ff when the countdown starts...
    Is there any benefit in not forfeiting even if you know you’re going to lose?
        Not really I don't think but if their leading by 2 goals with 1 min left it is possible to win
    My favorite is people who want to FF when your team is winning or the game is tied.

Had that happen last night.  3 min to go, game tied 0-0 and our 3rd random wanted to FF
        So last night, I had a game where up 2-0 with 2:25 left, BOTH of my teammates voted to FF, and then the entire other team FFd. Meaning out of six players, I was the only one to not click the FF button at that moment. I was so confused, but I guess we won.
        It's so dumb how quickly people give in
Punchline in title
    So frustrating
        I didn’t read the title at first and it took me a literal second to “get it” and I was very pleased. Then I read the title and it was infinitely less funny. Nooooo why did you put the punch line in the title!
            How does the joker after the joke make the joke less funny joke
    Only if you can read
        How would you understand the first 3 panels otherwise?
    For a second I thought the titles was "rocket league" and that still made sense to me lol.
    I personally wouldn't have gotten it otherwise
        You wouldn't know that because the punchline in the title took that opportunity away from you
        Life must be really unfunny
            Nope, just wouldn't equate being down 1 at the beginning of the game with forefitting because i don't play that often
                So counting up to four and saying fit woulda been hard?
                    Honestly when I first saw it I thought it was some sort of play on one fish two fish so I was looking for something that rhymed with 2 fit.
                        Because there was three fish...
    and yet it’s still funny. do you believe in miracles?
Accurate. I've never played a game where people give up so easily
    Losing 0:1 too early? Imagine what will happen in the 4 minutes left! 0:7 at least.

Losing 0:1 too late? We haven't scored in 4 minutes, how are we gonna score in 1?

At least RL lets me mute everyone by default with useful communication being available. Otherwise it would be LoL 2.0
        Yep.  I'm the "we could definitely make two goals in 30 seconds" guy,  though.  Lol
        Broke: laugh out loud

Woke: lots of love

Bespoke: league of legends
    Imagine watching a professional basketball game, home team wins the tipoff, but misses a shot. 

The visiting team rebounds, takes it down the court, and makes a layup.

The home team quits. The game has lasted 8 seconds. The player who missed the first shot calls everyone trash and immediately exits the building.
        This madem me laugh
        “smh Lebron training on main menu u should find it trash tm”
    I dunno, sometimes in magic arena people will literally scoop if they see you’re playing a deck they don’t like.
        Thought Erasure or Doom Foretold for me
            I mean to be fair I’ve been tempted to scoop after a T1 thoughtseize plenty of times. I run Azorious Aggro and sometimes an awesome hand only has one creature... and then it doesn’t.
    I remember playing a match where we were losing so bad (like 18-3 or something stupid) and the other team was begging for us to forfeit so they could move on. But otherwise it's pretty much the above...
Took me a while to get it and now I realize why I'm hard stuck
    Omg it's "forfeit" 😰
        Welcome to the club
        No it’s four fit
I don't get why people do this. I had games where i was 1:7 down and my team was able to comeback in like 3 minutes. Why the hell do they forfeit after ONE GOAL? Even in unranked winning or losing does 0% matter they join a match lets say they get scored on after 40 seconds and they instant leave. LOL
    The challenge is the best part of the game for me

But some people just want some easy win and some "gg ez" to sleep feeling badass
        I like it when enemys say "stop tryharding noob" because they lose even if i chill and then i start to really go tryhard and they stop saying anything. But the best part of the game for me is definitely when you come into a respectful lobby where everyone just want a good game giving their best and drop the "gg well played that was fun" on me.

I will never understand those "gg ez" guys
    well they not motivated to play after, so they forfeiting, happens to me sometimes
    To me, it’s not about the score. Sometimes shitty attitudes are just just ruining my day, so if my tm’s just trash talking every mistake I make, I’ll want a new one pretty quick. 

Sometimes it’s nothing against my tm8, I’m just playing like shit and really want to not play anymore. I figure offering to forfeit first is more polite than just dropping.

Other times, maybe something else is going on in the real world that requires my attention, like a work call. I can’t play for a couple min, but I don’t want a 5 minute break. There’s plenty of not-your-fault reasons that forfeits are offered, so I think it’s important to not automatically assume the worst about the person offering.
10/10 would recommend this meme
One fit, two fit

Three fit, we quit
    We quit those.
Awesome
Me: ****see the timer****

Me: We were at the verge of greatness. We were this close.
lmfao
God tier meme
Mfs don’t go for kickoff, complain at us for not getting the ball then try to forfeit. Solo ranked in a nutshell
    In forward position, go for kick off, only to look back and see both teammates speed off to the corners
        "Need boost"  oh wait... the goal is wide open?!  Who would have thought?
Mostly 7 outta 10 games they just straight up leave after one minor mistake. Not even wanting to ff.
Always toxic and salty from the strat like they are GC
I love this meme more than any other meme ever
    Thank you random stranger
        Omg omg is this THE legendary O_bloop replying to MY comment??
Oh man does that shit get me HEATED
You got the time wrong. Should be 4:55
Damn I love/hate this game.
My time is limited so if I want to lose as many games as possible I have to either leave or forfeit as quick as possible.
Lol more like 4:50
A dollar
Genius.
this is the way
Took me like 10 minutes to get it lol, 10/10 meme though
Lmao
Fuck that got me, I genuinely wasn’t expecting that.

It helped that I went straight from 3 fit to forfeit
    Going from 3 to 4, what else would you do?
        I’m dyslexic so there’s a lot of places it could of gone, most of them ending with “wait what... what does that.... oooooooooooohhhhhhh”
            It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
                It would of cost you $0 to make this bot.
            ahhh that makes sense
So true. My friends play the same way in league of legends to the point where I basically don’t want to play it anymore.

If they are getting beat early they’d rather just move onto the next one instead of trying to comeback.

If I get behind in lane or in a rocket league game it just means I have work to do.... I mean to a fucking extent sure. If my team gives up and it’s 5-0 at 3:00.
if i had money id give u the highest award
Get it to the top!
Me: "Take the shot!" Teammate: *doesn't take the shot, causing them to score a kickoff goal*    Also Teammate: "trash tm8 ffs vote tutorial in menu get good"
I wanted to press F.

FF.
It's funny cuz it's true. Talk about cancel culture. Every time I go into a 2v2 the other team scores and the team mates these days don't even give a chance to forfeit they just bail on the game and leave you to fend for your self. There have been a couple magical times where I stuck with it and got the win in 1v2 and when it has happened I laugh and think about that team mate who bailed and thought "what a dumb ass" they could have ball chased or sat motionless for the kick off and the following minutes after an got a win instead of sitting in the lobby for 3 minutes in their shame waiting to bail on another game and ruin someone else's rank. Spinless idiots.
So I played diamond 2 in 2s with a buddy the other day I wanna say this happened atleast 3 times within 10 matches..ime it’s not as bad in plat...I just feel so bad for people when it happens:/ I wanna say the worst one I had happen when in diamond 2s was we scored on them to make the score 1-1 and dude quit...
This took me too long
Some reason I read this as 4-bit at first... idk why lmao
Thought it was going to be 1 fish 2 fish, so I looked at the picture and thought:

"Blue...fit?"
    Meanwhile, my brain manages to Jimmy-Neutron-brain-blast its way to "wii fit"
Sick!
I was thinking it was the 1 fish 2 fish. So I read the last panel as blue quits, like a dummy
That's so fucking true
Ultra classy
crossfit
I had someone in trios call for a forfeit when we were drawing 1-1. I couldn't believe it.
 Now, this is epic
Who's tyrna team up on RL im silver 2
I actually laughed out loud at this
I think having slightly harsher penalties for leaving unranked matches might help this phenomenon become a little less prevalent and have the secondary effect of having slightly more people do the hard work of learning what it means (psychologically) to stick it out to the end even in rough circumstances, so then hopefully the cheap FF mentality will also be less likely to bleed into ranked.
I said 0 to 1 fit first :(
Clever meme
And it’s only gonna get worse as more people get it with Free to Play. It’s so frustrating. Who raised these quitters?
WHat a save!
What a save!
What a save!
“ff at 15 guys jngl diff”
Very nice.
this is a great creation
Hahah so true. I played a solo standard game today, and we were down 2-0 with 3:49 remaining and one of my teammates proceeded to drive around like an imbecile and steal boost and do nothing for the rest of the game. We lost 3-0

And he thought we sucked. Lol what a game
More like throw a fit
Sick, this post is just built different
Bravo sir.
[deleted]
    A large number of the people who play this game are quitters. Sometimes its because they're losing by several points, other times it they're losing by 1 or 2 points, and occasionally people forfeit when winning. I don't know why they do this, it makes no sense to me
I fucking hate when they forfeit early. If your chosing to give up early you're never going to win
I had a random 2s partner initiate a ff when we were winning 3-1. And on the flip side of that my friend and I won a 2s game because the other team ff’d when they were winning 4-0... people are weird
I quit ......????
Nice.
Why did I think Wii Fit was the answer?!
Is it just me or is the first goal always in 4:19, It always seems to score there
so true people give up way too easily in this game
This is porbably the best meme on the subreddit this far.
Good meme, did laugh
Took me too long to get, had a couple teammate quit on me In a ranked 3v3, of course i lost, but I did manage a point 1v3
3:29
HAHAHAHAH class meme
Great play on words!
    Thank you very much!

    holy fuck that was funny
    I don't comprehend.

Can you vote that early that in high ranks? In silver/gold/plat that super inconsistent people like me bounce around in it seems like you cant vote that early. 

But thats ok because usually the guy who would vote has already abandoned the match most of the time. If not he will in 10 seconds after typing out how his team is the worst even though he has 30pts or less as his total score with 0-0-0-0.
Lol
This is the one and only thing I hate about this game that is so true.
I solo queue 2’s and I always appreciate the mates who stick around after I make a couple whiffs early on and we go down 0-2 or 0-3. A lot of times we’ll come back to at least tie and eventually win. Most times I know we can at least come back and make it close, I just make dumb mistakes early. Other times though, the dudes are just outright better, and that’s when I know to FF.
I once 1v1 a duos partner of mine, the only reason i won was because i didnt fortfeit  at 1-4, he found it weird that i didnt FF bcse he was trashtalking.
We basicly had the same amount of skill with exception of mentallity
Lol
Damn
I’m guilty of trying to FF like this. It typically has nothing to do with the score though. 

I love the team vibe of the game and I can tell pretty early if people are going to chase and it’s going to be a miserable game or if they’ll pass at all.
Really, what is the reason for this? People even ff when the score is tied. Like, why even play the game if your ego is so inflated that you can’t even bear the idea of getting scored on once?
I don't think you can forfeit until 330 right?
As long as you're only 2 goals down with at least 30 seconds left, there's a chance
4:19 + 1 is 4:20 haha I get it
>Yeah, I've seen enough.
My dumbass said blue fit. Fuck lol
Well duhhh

They missed 4:20

Then you get back. 4:4 and loose it in overtime
Wow this is why I don't have fun playing RL anymore. One of the reasons anyway.
i feel attacked
at 4:19? good luck
They quit so suddenly it should be called a 5fit
My dumbass thought “bluefit” because of dr Seuss
Exactly why I stopped playing. I always left the game angry at teammates who would act like this and cost us the game, it felt like playing with 5 year olds
I see this so often, but I never understood the mindset.  Why even play ranked if you're going to crack under the pressure of being down one goal with plenty of time left on the clock?
I hate when players just leave matches. Ill keep playing at 0-9, at some point ill help them just keeps scoring cause fuck it. Its still fun to me
Blue fit?
You're missing uninstall.
I'm crying with laughter. Had a toxic teammate forfeit after 1 goal with 3 minutes remaining in 3s. We won 2-1. So satisfying.
Random teammates be like
[Literally](https://youtu.be/60mmODMo0SQ)
What? Why would you forfeit at only 0-1?
I’ve been encountering this more and more I get into diamond
I’m getting on just to use this
Ff
This happens to me so much more since I hit Diamond 2. WHY!?
I felt this deep in my exhaust...
F
I once came back from 0-6 in 1v1... and then lost 7-8
Lmao
I never got why people retire, usually when the game is a lost cause I just use it to practice riskier stuff (though I kinda suck at the game). It’s less bad to miss an aerial or fuck up a dribble when you’re losing 6-0 I guess
Aight i like this one
I don’t get it
u/Vredditdownloader
It took me a full day to get it! 
Four Fit.. I thought of someone called Fit..
And then they sit afk
Ff🙁
I still didnt get it. :(
the fact that the screenshot was taken at 4:19 instead of 4:20 is the biggest disappointment of this year
Game over man
is it free now ? I didnt had any acces to wifi for 4 days
Ff dummy
5-0 or we play it out!
It took me so long to get it I’m ashamed
Its especially ridiculous when playing the power up game mode.
Literally every game.
lol nice
lolololol 1/3rd of RL
Communism: wii fit
Makes sense to me
hahahahahahahahahaha
so true
5 is the limit for a come back
I'm having an issue with rocket league rn. I play on xbox and ever since this new update happened I cant login. It says Login processing and im assuming it won't finish. Also I'm pretty sure they restarted all of my progress. Is anyone else having the same issue?
    No
My mates be like when we are down by a goal:
One fit , two fit , three fit .... I'ma  Ragequit
My twos teammates be like
Yep when your the aggressive then your buddies get the same way....
I was expecting Wii fit
[deleted]
    By sequentially using ‘one fit, two fit, three fit’ it can only be assumed that the last square should say ‘four fit’. The words ‘four fit’ are a homophone to the word forfeit, and it’s funny because a lot of people forfeit in rocket league after getting behind just one point even if there is a lot of time to make a comeback.
        \^\^this
    When you add the numbers on the image it equals to 420 and peak athletiscism comes from blazing it 24/7
this is what i came to the rl subreddit for
Literally got scored on twice in solo standard and both my mates wanted to forfeit, we ended up winning solely because of me
1 second off from my bong rip
Not 4:20? Smh
Why is it not 4:20...?
I don’t get it 1 fit, 2 fit, 3 fit, rage quit? I mean it can’t be 4 fit it’s not 330.
    Let's not sweat the details here
        Fair this is my poor attempt at being clever.
            It's ok you tried
                That's the problem. He should've just ff'd
    It can still be forfeit because people will just stop moving or actually quit the game.
        By definition in game that isn’t a forfeit. Just a protest.
            I mean they didn't click the FF button, but by definition of forfeiting. It most certainly is forfeiting. Anyone who acts like that should have ants forced down their pee hole with a funnel.
Can’t FF at that time tho
Can’t, still 49 seconds until you can.
/r/punchlineintitle
You could have used a pic of my mom on the last one. Ngl
Four fit

In your mother.
    Just stop
maybe dont put the punchline in the title
Thanks for the title op, would never have understood the joke without it!
Good meme, although I don't understand why you would intentionally ruin it by titling the post the way you did.
What a fucking stupid title. Why are so many titles on reddit so fucking terrible
I usually don’t do that in ranked but if it’s casual and I’m down one I just leave
need a fennec help🙁
    Then get a fennec😐
u r too confident

i forfeit at 4:59 when i miss first touch at kickoff
This is 4fit league
    Leonidaskickingsomeoneinto4fitpit.mp3
    It's for me?! You shouldn't have!
It hit me
[deleted]
    It's still good, just not perfect
    Remember when I asked
        Pepperidge Farm remembers
            Hehe
            What does it mean, my friends say that, but I don’t understand it
No this is Patrick
its just as bad up here in gc
    I’m having trouble getting rewards after hitting GC for first time because my random solo queue teammate will whiff a save, we go down 1-0 with 4 minutes left... they will proceed to flame me and my other random teammate and then abandon match down 1-0. This occurs multiple times nightly lol
        i eventually managed to get my rewards, after much salt and tilt

it probably doesnt help that im just a kid with a short attention span, but i feel myself flaming more each time i play. id rather not be a disservice to people that might matchmake with me, so i just go off and play something singleplayer. 1v1 is garbage because my entire playstyle involves giving my teammate the ball and my brain hurts playing it. i dont like rl anymore.
            Gotta just find the right people to play with and control your mentality. Mentality is the number 1 thing that needs to be addressed before any mechanic or rotation. Once you are able to grind ranked without any negativity you will climb even more.
                my 2s partner also quit the game eventually. lost motivation to play really
                    There’s always more! Breaks from the game aren’t bad either. I’ve taken many multiple month breaks and came back feeling better/refreshed. I’m bout to come back after a few week break because I was feeling burnt out. Heading into a tourney tomorrow I may not be 100 mechanical/rotational but my mentality will be fresh.
                        always nice after taking a few week break to be fair
                            I mean you don’t need to keep playing rl. Once I hit GC I just stopped playing due to severe burnout and now I have found enjoyment in other games!
                Mentality is definitely the most important aspect most people don't focus on until they get to gc and realize how important it is for gaining mmr over time
            Dude I feel you. I've gotten to the point of not liking rl anymore either, the constant toxicity turned me into a toxic player too. I finally realized I wasn't having fun anymore and was just getting super tilted every time I played. The only thing I really liked doing was free play. Haven't played in about 3 weeks.
                I felt that way and recently just disabled chat. Does wonders for my actual skill. You make a mistake here or there and when everyone else in the game freaking out and spamming quickchat isnt there to read you just... Play. Its really refreshing. I'll probably turn it back on team only next time i turn it on. Its not much better with random teammates but in higher tiers i like communicating.
                    Disabling the chat helps a lot
                Same reason I quit playing mobas. The communities are just awful. Toxic players creating more toxic players. I really only play rocket league when friends are at my house now and we can bullshit around for a bit.
            I don't have the short attention span, but I get tilted more than I'm willing to admit lately. Mostly I turn off chat but there's nothing like having regular mates to play with in voice. You can flame as angry as you want without the random ever noticing it. I'm not the "dude, ghat guy's trash" type, but the occasional "DUDE, STOP TF CHASING" or "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE???" and my friend laughing or agreeing helps a lot. If your friends don't play RL, turning off chat still is a viable option. I'm way below your rank, so take this with a grain of salt, but in my experience there usually just isn't enough useful team chat to justify it to be turned on when I feel like the flames could get to me.
                yeah, i turned chat back on like a month ago and it did help with kickoffs (even though i had I GOT IT in my name)
                    True, it's easy to get out of position if you go just in case and react to your mate when there's 2 options for kickoff.

But it's better for my blood pressure, so I'm willingly taking that risk sometimes^^
            I only play like four games of Rocket in a row before I have to switch games from frustration. Unless I’m playing with my club then it’s just not worth the anger
        Yeah my GC friend said people are giant pussies at GC about that. Sheesh.

People need to stop being so damn sensitive and play the game out! Mistakes happen.
        I was in the same boat as you like a week ago but turned chat off and got like 8 wins in a row just not worrying about people
        GC is really that bad? I'm glad I'm stuck in low Champ
            Low GC really is, that's where everyone is grinding for their rewards and trying to stay in GC, the toxicity there is like no other rank lol. It gets better in the 1600s
        Just sounds like normal gc to me
        I’m high C2/low C3 - was really hoping this would end by the time I got good enough to be GC
        The rewards come, I only solo q and if you really deserve the rewards you’ll get them. The climb starts from there, good luck bro
            Yay solo queuers unite
    We could've had an amazing thread but you playin
    Not as bad down here in gold
    You’re not gc, nice flex bro
    Oooo look at us were highly ranked. GROW UP.
.
.

:'(
Man I just really don't understand all of the FFs. I've been in games where we were 3-0, the other team scores one single goal and all of a sudden my teammates are acting like we are on the Titanic.
    It’s a game of momentum for sure.

People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose. Learn from your mistakes and move onto the next play. Ignore anyone flaming you.
        >People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose.  
  
Everytime I say this they're like "how can you have fun if you're not winning" and proceed to roast me again. I mean if it wasn't that easy to leave casual matches I'd play it instead smh
            True. And I definitely have more fun winning. Haha who doesn’t? I think we can all be guilty of being tilted too. Just gotta roll with it. Finding consistent people to play with on mics has made this all easier for me.
    I'm always just like "go for a walk" or something, people get too caught up in the game. It's weird to me, I play games to relax and have fun, if its not fun don't play

Like, last week I was up 4-0 on my last game for champ rewards and both my teammates disconnected, lost 5-4 and I dropped out of champ. If I can survive that without raging out I think people should be able to survive a single goal against lol
        Ill take you to get your champ rewards bby
            lol ngl i'd be down, i didn't really expect them this season but if i can *just* qualify again before season ends tmrw for 1 game... i'm close haha
                Just message me your name when u add
                    genuinely appreciate the offer! i was going to take you up on it but i ended up actually making it, been able to stay above the fold since a couple days after that comment 

it's a silly thing to care about but i'm happy haha ^(only took like 3 extensions of the season to get there :P)
                Steamcommunity.com/id/reeks___/   Add me
i felt that
    I was diamond for a good few years and then stopped playing for a while and I'm now plat 1. 

So many people just throw the toys out the pram as soon as they make one mistake. I feel it was better in diamond but I'm probably just looking with nostalgia tinted glasses.
        Gold is the worst overall rank in the game (players think they’re good but they’re terrible and have no game sense. But Plat is definitely the most toxic.
            Hooray I'm in both! I miss the silver days where you'd watch the ball float down so you can hit it.
                Lol back when you couldn't do aerials but also couldn't dribble so you just double jumped into everything.
                    I've never actually been able to soley double jump well, second jump is always a dodge except when i aerial. Once I got to the pont where I was losing challenges because I cant double jump, I learned how to double jump aerial ironically enough.
                Don't speak that evil, silver is purgatory. Ive had to crawl out of that nightmare a few times and sit in goal and make saves my own team is throwing at me when they arent passing it to the opposite team. 

People in silver just hit the ball just to hit the ball, they don't even know what direction their going. It is nice though when it bounces high and not one person in the game can successfully aerial so they all fly out of the way and you can just gently bonk it at the goal and watch it roll in. 

Ah silver... You're either laughing hysterically or pulling your hair out. Its chaos.
            I always found diamond to be the most toxic. That’s when people think they’re good but they’re still bad. I would miss one save and TM’s would act like I just fucked their mom in front of them. Everyone is a little more of a bro when you hit champ, but the one score forfeits are still rampant.
                We probably have different standards considering D1 is the highest I’ve ever been ranked in doubles lol. Tbh I find the higher you go, the less toxic people are because everyone plays better so there’s generally less to get upset about. You might forget just how much of a gongshow low Plat is. It’s basically just Gold but a bit faster, so everyone’s chasing and whiffing constantly, then blaming teammates for their own mistakes.
                    It probably is bias honestly. I was in plat for like 2 weeks and I was in diamond for probably almost a year since I really don’t play consistently at all. I just remember it being an exquisite level of toxic hellhole. Honestly it might just be that RL is a toxic hellhole.
            I think people sleep on the toxicity of fresh grand champs. When you get into 1700+ people just talk less overall. But in the 1500-1600 range you get a lot of toxicity. My favorite is the very common “god I hate when I get matched with 1500s”, as if their 1660 peak makes them so much godlier. Most of the time they’re dead wrong too. Or the low 1500 who says “you’ll never hit grand champ if you keep doing xyz”, and I’m just like “judging by what bakkesmod is telling me I’m almost 200 points above you...”.
Don't worry it does not improve at all even when you get to where I am.
    Don't worry it gets even worse here
Don’t worry I’ve had a guy try to FF 0-0 2 mins in after I missed a double touch from the corner
    That was probably more of a joke than anything. Ive had teammates FF with 30 seconds left when we are up by 5 for the memes. Of course if i see 2/3 im for sure going to do it as well.
If you think 4fitting early is rank related I’m sorry to burst your bubble but it’s every rank top to bottom
I felt that
    I felt that
        I felt that
You play on ps4 or Xbox ?  I’ve been looking for a plat 2 tm8
    switch 😳
I'm plat 2 as well. I believe u. Yesterday the other team scored and ONCE I said go for it. As soon as i said it he ff vote and we have 4 mins and 30 secs for somthn
*cough* Amateur.
4-1, same here.

Was partied with my mate, rando voted to forfeit at 3:30 on the dot. We proceeded to win in OT and that asshat had the audacity to click party up postgame.
    The lion the witch and the audacity of this bitch
        Never Party Up with a bitch
            Love him or hate him he is spitting straight fax
    [deleted]
        That’s evil
    Met a nice dude in ranked, we played pretty good but i was on fire so i carried him pretty hard. Very polite n stuff. Next day i change my steam username (i change it like everyday to stupid things) and i solo queued to warm up. Didnt realize i solo queued into a team with him until after kickoff. So im warming up and waiting till the next goal to say "hey we met yesterday" or something like that. Then he missed a double jump aerial and ended up on the opponents side of the field with no boost. I defended one shot but i missed a save, which i'll admit was pretty easy and i messed up (but remember he did put me in that position). So im like eh whatever and im about to say hey whats up and i get an ff vote and a gg in public chat. 1-0 3:00 left or smtn like that. I dont think i have to say how fast i unfriended that loser.
While admittedly somewhat stupid, Whenever my teammate tries to FF or we are just down by 3 or 4, I always type:

‘We are still gonna win’

It seems to get my teammates confidence back, gets mine back, and makes the opposing team a bit uneasy.

Chat in RL is a mental part of the game
    Yeah confidence is a big part to challenge your opponent
I was in a hoops game and the score was 2-2 with 2 minutes left and my teamate wanted to forfeit
    Wtf is wrong with people its not like you were losing
        Exactly we ended up winning that game though.
I think the reason he voted is because the opponent did a sick airdribble
            Yeah you just got to have confidence in your team and yourself
That's when you vote to ff when the countdown starts...
Is there any benefit in not forfeiting even if you know you’re going to lose?
    Not really I don't think but if their leading by 2 goals with 1 min left it is possible to win
My favorite is people who want to FF when your team is winning or the game is tied.

Had that happen last night.  3 min to go, game tied 0-0 and our 3rd random wanted to FF
    So last night, I had a game where up 2-0 with 2:25 left, BOTH of my teammates voted to FF, and then the entire other team FFd. Meaning out of six players, I was the only one to not click the FF button at that moment. I was so confused, but I guess we won.
    It's so dumb how quickly people give in
So frustrating
    I didn’t read the title at first and it took me a literal second to “get it” and I was very pleased. Then I read the title and it was infinitely less funny. Nooooo why did you put the punch line in the title!
        How does the joker after the joke make the joke less funny joke
Only if you can read
    How would you understand the first 3 panels otherwise?
For a second I thought the titles was "rocket league" and that still made sense to me lol.
I personally wouldn't have gotten it otherwise
    You wouldn't know that because the punchline in the title took that opportunity away from you
    Life must be really unfunny
        Nope, just wouldn't equate being down 1 at the beginning of the game with forefitting because i don't play that often
            So counting up to four and saying fit woulda been hard?
                Honestly when I first saw it I thought it was some sort of play on one fish two fish so I was looking for something that rhymed with 2 fit.
                    Because there was three fish...
and yet it’s still funny. do you believe in miracles?
Losing 0:1 too early? Imagine what will happen in the 4 minutes left! 0:7 at least.

Losing 0:1 too late? We haven't scored in 4 minutes, how are we gonna score in 1?

At least RL lets me mute everyone by default with useful communication being available. Otherwise it would be LoL 2.0
    Yep.  I'm the "we could definitely make two goals in 30 seconds" guy,  though.  Lol
    Broke: laugh out loud

Woke: lots of love

Bespoke: league of legends
Imagine watching a professional basketball game, home team wins the tipoff, but misses a shot. 

The visiting team rebounds, takes it down the court, and makes a layup.

The home team quits. The game has lasted 8 seconds. The player who missed the first shot calls everyone trash and immediately exits the building.
    This madem me laugh
    “smh Lebron training on main menu u should find it trash tm”
I dunno, sometimes in magic arena people will literally scoop if they see you’re playing a deck they don’t like.
    Thought Erasure or Doom Foretold for me
        I mean to be fair I’ve been tempted to scoop after a T1 thoughtseize plenty of times. I run Azorious Aggro and sometimes an awesome hand only has one creature... and then it doesn’t.
I remember playing a match where we were losing so bad (like 18-3 or something stupid) and the other team was begging for us to forfeit so they could move on. But otherwise it's pretty much the above...
Omg it's "forfeit" 😰
    Welcome to the club
    No it’s four fit
The challenge is the best part of the game for me

But some people just want some easy win and some "gg ez" to sleep feeling badass
    I like it when enemys say "stop tryharding noob" because they lose even if i chill and then i start to really go tryhard and they stop saying anything. But the best part of the game for me is definitely when you come into a respectful lobby where everyone just want a good game giving their best and drop the "gg well played that was fun" on me.

I will never understand those "gg ez" guys
well they not motivated to play after, so they forfeiting, happens to me sometimes
To me, it’s not about the score. Sometimes shitty attitudes are just just ruining my day, so if my tm’s just trash talking every mistake I make, I’ll want a new one pretty quick. 

Sometimes it’s nothing against my tm8, I’m just playing like shit and really want to not play anymore. I figure offering to forfeit first is more polite than just dropping.

Other times, maybe something else is going on in the real world that requires my attention, like a work call. I can’t play for a couple min, but I don’t want a 5 minute break. There’s plenty of not-your-fault reasons that forfeits are offered, so I think it’s important to not automatically assume the worst about the person offering.
We quit those.
In forward position, go for kick off, only to look back and see both teammates speed off to the corners
    "Need boost"  oh wait... the goal is wide open?!  Who would have thought?
Thank you random stranger
    Omg omg is this THE legendary O_bloop replying to MY comment??
Going from 3 to 4, what else would you do?
    I’m dyslexic so there’s a lot of places it could of gone, most of them ending with “wait what... what does that.... oooooooooooohhhhhhh”
        It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
            It would of cost you $0 to make this bot.
        ahhh that makes sense
Meanwhile, my brain manages to Jimmy-Neutron-brain-blast its way to "wii fit"
A large number of the people who play this game are quitters. Sometimes its because they're losing by several points, other times it they're losing by 1 or 2 points, and occasionally people forfeit when winning. I don't know why they do this, it makes no sense to me
Thank you very much!
holy fuck that was funny
I don't comprehend.
No
By sequentially using ‘one fit, two fit, three fit’ it can only be assumed that the last square should say ‘four fit’. The words ‘four fit’ are a homophone to the word forfeit, and it’s funny because a lot of people forfeit in rocket league after getting behind just one point even if there is a lot of time to make a comeback.

I'm not the "dude, ghat guy's trash" type, but the occasional "DUDE, STOP TF CHASING" or "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE???" and my friend laughing or agreeing helps a lot. If your friends don't play RL, turning off chat still is a viable option. I'm way below your rank, so take this with a grain of salt, but in my experience there usually just isn't enough useful team chat to justify it to be turned on when I feel like the flames could get to me.
            yeah, i turned chat back on like a month ago and it did help with kickoffs (even though i had I GOT IT in my name)
                True, it's easy to get out of position if you go just in case and react to your mate when there's 2 options for kickoff.

But it's better for my blood pressure, so I'm willingly taking that risk sometimes^^
        I only play like four games of Rocket in a row before I have to switch games from frustration. Unless I’m playing with my club then it’s just not worth the anger
    Yeah my GC friend said people are giant pussies at GC about that. Sheesh.

People need to stop being so damn sensitive and play the game out! Mistakes happen.
    I was in the same boat as you like a week ago but turned chat off and got like 8 wins in a row just not worrying about people
    GC is really that bad? I'm glad I'm stuck in low Champ
        Low GC really is, that's where everyone is grinding for their rewards and trying to stay in GC, the toxicity there is like no other rank lol. It gets better in the 1600s
    Just sounds like normal gc to me
    I’m high C2/low C3 - was really hoping this would end by the time I got good enough to be GC
    The rewards come, I only solo q and if you really deserve the rewards you’ll get them. The climb starts from there, good luck bro
        Yay solo queuers unite
We could've had an amazing thread but you playin
Not as bad down here in gold
You’re not gc, nice flex bro
Oooo look at us were highly ranked. GROW UP.
.
.

:'(
It’s a game of momentum for sure.

People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose. Learn from your mistakes and move onto the next play. Ignore anyone flaming you.
    >People just need to remember it’s a game and have fun even if they lose.  
  
Everytime I say this they're like "how can you have fun if you're not winning" and proceed to roast me again. I mean if it wasn't that easy to leave casual matches I'd play it instead smh
        True. And I definitely have more fun winning. Haha who doesn’t? I think we can all be guilty of being tilted too. Just gotta roll with it. Finding consistent people to play with on mics has made this all easier for me.
I'm always just like "go for a walk" or something, people get too caught up in the game. It's weird to me, I play games to relax and have fun, if its not fun don't play

Like, last week I was up 4-0 on my last game for champ rewards and both my teammates disconnected, lost 5-4 and I dropped out of champ. If I can survive that without raging out I think people should be able to survive a single goal against lol
    Ill take you to get your champ rewards bby
        lol ngl i'd be down, i didn't really expect them this season but if i can *just* qualify again before season ends tmrw for 1 game... i'm close haha
            Just message me your name when u add
                genuinely appreciate the offer! i was going to take you up on it but i ended up actually making it, been able to stay above the fold since a couple days after that comment 

it's a silly thing to care about but i'm happy haha ^(only took like 3 extensions of the season to get there :P)

I was diamond for a good few years and then stopped playing for a while and I'm now plat 1. 

So many people just throw the toys out the pram as soon as they make one mistake. I feel it was better in diamond but I'm probably just looking with nostalgia tinted glasses.
    Gold is the worst overall rank in the game (players think they’re good but they’re terrible and have no game sense. But Plat is definitely the most toxic.
        Hooray I'm in both! I miss the silver days where you'd watch the ball float down so you can hit it.
            Lol back when you couldn't do aerials but also couldn't dribble so you just double jumped into everything.
                I've never actually been able to soley double jump well, second jump is always a dodge except when i aerial. Once I got to the pont where I was losing challenges because I cant double jump, I learned how to double jump aerial ironically enough.
            Don't speak that evil, silver is purgatory. Ive had to crawl out of that nightmare a few times and sit in goal and make saves my own team is throwing at me when they arent passing it to the opposite team. 

People in silver just hit the ball just to hit the ball, they don't even know what direction their going. It is nice though when it bounces high and not one person in the game can successfully aerial so they all fly out of the way and you can just gently bonk it at the goal and watch it roll in. 

Ah silver... You're either laughing hysterically or pulling your hair out. Its chaos.
        I always found diamond to be the most toxic. That’s when people think they’re good but they’re still bad. I would miss one save and TM’s would act like I just fucked their mom in front of them. Everyone is a little more of a bro when you hit champ, but the one score forfeits are still rampant.
            We probably have different standards considering D1 is the highest I’ve ever been ranked in doubles lol. Tbh I find the higher you go, the less toxic people are because everyone plays better so there’s generally less to get upset about. You might forget just how much of a gongshow low Plat is. It’s basically just Gold but a bit faster, so everyone’s chasing and whiffing constantly, then blaming teammates for their own mistakes.
                It probably is bias honestly. I was in plat for like 2 weeks and I was in diamond for probably almost a year since I really don’t play consistently at all. I just remember it being an exquisite level of toxic hellhole. Honestly it might just be that RL is a toxic hellhole.
        I think people sleep on the toxicity of fresh grand champs. When you get into 1700+ people just talk less overall. But in the 1500-1600 range you get a lot of toxicity. My favorite is the very common “god I hate when I get matched with 1500s”, as if their 1660 peak makes them so much godlier. Most of the time they’re dead wrong too. Or the low 1500 who says “you’ll never hit grand champ if you keep doing xyz”, and I’m just like “judging by what bakkesmod is telling me I’m almost 200 points above you...”.
Don't worry it gets even worse here
That was probably more of a joke than anything. Ive had teammates FF with 30 seconds left when we are up by 5 for the memes. Of course if i see 2/3 im for sure going to do it as well.
I felt that
    I felt that

    That’s evil
Met a nice dude in ranked, we played pretty good but i was on fire so i carried him pretty hard. Very polite n stuff. Next day i change my steam username (i change it like everyday to stupid things) and i solo queued to warm up. Didnt realize i solo queued into a team with him until after kickoff. So im warming up and waiting till the next goal to say "hey we met yesterday" or something like that. Then he missed a double jump aerial and ended up on the opponents side of the field with no boost. I defended one shot but i missed a save, which i'll admit was pretty easy and i messed up (but remember he did put me in that position). So im like eh whatever and im about to say hey whats up and i get an ff vote and a gg in public chat. 1-0 3:00 left or smtn like that. I dont think i have to say how fast i unfriended that loser.
Yeah confidence is a big part to challenge your opponent
Wtf is wrong with people its not like you were losing
    Exactly we ended up winning that game though.
I think the reason he voted is because the opponent did a sick airdribble
        Yeah you just got to have confidence in your team and yourself
Not really I don't think but if their leading by 2 goals with 1 min left it is possible to win
So last night, I had a game where up 2-0 with 2:25 left, BOTH of my teammates voted to FF, and then the entire other team FFd. Meaning out of six players, I was the only one to not click the FF button at that moment. I was so confused, but I guess we won.
It's so dumb how quickly people give in
I didn’t read the title at first and it took me a literal second to “get it” and I was very pleased. Then I read the title and it was infinitely less funny. Nooooo why did you put the punch line in the title!
    How does the joker after the joke make the joke less funny joke
How would you understand the first 3 panels otherwise?
You wouldn't know that because the punchline in the title took that opportunity away from you
Life must be really unfunny
    Nope, just wouldn't equate being down 1 at the beginning of the game with forefitting because i don't play that often
        So counting up to four and saying fit woulda been hard?
            Honestly when I first saw it I thought it was some sort of play on one fish two fish so I was looking for something that rhymed with 2 fit.
                Because there was three fish...
Yep.  I'm the "we could definitely make two goals in 30 seconds" guy,  though.  Lol
Broke: laugh out loud

Woke: lots of love

“smh Lebron training on main menu u should find it trash tm”
Thought Erasure or Doom Foretold for me
    I mean to be fair I’ve been tempted to scoop after a T1 thoughtseize plenty of times. I run Azorious Aggro and sometimes an awesome hand only has one creature... and then it doesn’t.
Welcome to the club
No it’s four fit
I like it when enemys say "stop tryharding noob" because they lose even if i chill and then i start to really go tryhard and they stop saying anything. But the best part of the game for me is definitely when you come into a respectful lobby where everyone just want a good game giving their best and drop the "gg well played that was fun" on me.

I will never understand those "gg ez" guys
"Need boost"  oh wait... the goal is wide open?!  Who would have thought?
Omg omg is this THE legendary O_bloop replying to MY comment??
I’m dyslexic so there’s a lot of places it could of gone, most of them ending with “wait what... what does that.... oooooooooooohhhhhhh”
    It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
        It would of cost you $0 to make this bot.
    ahhh that makes sense
\^\^this
Fair this is my poor attempt at being clever.
    It's ok you tried
        That's the problem. He should've just ff'd
By definition in game that isn’t a forfeit. Just a protest.
    I mean they didn't click the FF button, but by definition of forfeiting. It most certainly is forfeiting. Anyone who acts like that should have ants forced down their pee hole with a funnel.
Pepperidge Farm remembers
    Hehe
    What does it mean, my friends say that, but I don’t understand it
i eventually managed to get my rewards, after much salt and tilt

it probably doesnt help that im just a kid with a short attention span, but i feel myself flaming more each time i play. id rather not be a disservice to people that might matchmake with me, so i just go off and play something singleplayer. 1v1 is garbage because my entire playstyle involves giving my teammate the ball and my brain hurts playing it. i dont like rl anymore.
    Gotta just find the right people to play with and control your mentality. Mentality is the number 1 thing that needs to be addressed before any mechanic or rotation. Once you are able to grind ranked without any negativity you will climb even more.
        my 2s partner also quit the game eventually. lost motivation to play really
            There’s always more! Breaks from the game aren’t bad either. I’ve taken many multiple month breaks and came back feeling better/refreshed. I’m bout to come back after a few week break because I was feeling burnt out. Heading into a tourney tomorrow I may not be 100 mechanical/rotational but my mentality will be fresh.
                always nice after taking a few week break to be fair
                    I mean you don’t need to keep playing rl. Once I hit GC I just stopped playing due to severe burnout and now I have found enjoyment in other games!
        Mentality is definitely the most important aspect most people don't focus on until they get to gc and realize how important it is for gaining mmr over time
    Dude I feel you. I've gotten to the point of not liking rl anymore either, the constant toxicity turned me into a toxic player too. I finally realized I wasn't having fun anymore and was just getting super tilted every time I played. The only thing I really liked doing was free play. Haven't played in about 3 weeks.
        I felt that way and recently just disabled chat. Does wonders for my actual skill. You make a mistake here or there and when everyone else in the game freaking out and spamming quickchat isnt there to read you just... Play. Its really refreshing. I'll probably turn it back on team only next time i turn it on. Its not much better with random teammates but in higher tiers i like communicating.
            Disabling the chat helps a lot
        Same reason I quit playing mobas. The communities are just awful. Toxic players creating more toxic players. I really only play rocket league when friends are at my house now and we can bullshit around for a bit.
    I don't have the short attention span, but I get tilted more than I'm willing to admit lately. Mostly I turn off chat but there's nothing like having regular mates to play with in voice.

I'm not the "dude, ghat guy's trash" type, but the occasional "DUDE, STOP TF CHASING" or "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE???" and my friend laughing or agreeing helps a lot. If your friends don't play RL, turning off chat still is a viable option.

yeah, i turned chat back on like a month ago and it did help with kickoffs (even though i had I GOT IT in my name)
    True, it's easy to get out of position if you go just in case and react to your mate when there's 2 options for kickoff.

But it's better for my blood pressure, so I'm willingly taking that risk sometimes^^
Just message me your name when u add
    genuinely appreciate the offer! i was going to take you up on it but i ended up actually making it, been able to stay above the fold since a couple days after that comment 

it's a silly thing to care about but i'm happy haha ^(only took like 3 extensions of the season to get there :P)

Lol back when you couldn't do aerials but also couldn't dribble so you just double jumped into everything.
    I've never actually been able to soley double jump well, second jump is always a dodge except when i aerial. Once I got to the pont where I was losing challenges because I cant double jump, I learned how to double jump aerial ironically enough.
Don't speak that evil, silver is purgatory. Ive had to crawl out of that nightmare a few times and sit in goal and make saves my own team is throwing at me when they arent passing it to the opposite team. 

People in silver just hit the ball just to hit the ball, they don't even know what direction their going. It is nice though when it bounces high and not one person in the game can successfully aerial so they all fly out of the way and you can just gently bonk it at the goal and watch it roll in. 

Ah silver... You're either laughing hysterically or pulling your hair out. Its chaos.
We probably have different standards considering D1 is the highest I’ve ever been ranked in doubles lol. Tbh I find the higher you go, the less toxic people are because everyone plays better so there’s generally less to get upset about. You might forget just how much of a gongshow low Plat is. It’s basically just Gold but a bit faster, so everyone’s chasing and whiffing constantly, then blaming teammates for their own mistakes.
    It probably is bias honestly. I was in plat for like 2 weeks and I was in diamond for probably almost a year since I really don’t play consistently at all. I just remember it being an exquisite level of toxic hellhole. Honestly it might just be that RL is a toxic hellhole.
Honestly when I first saw it I thought it was some sort of play on one fish two fish so I was looking for something that rhymed with 2 fit.
    Because there was three fish...
There’s always more! Breaks from the game aren’t bad either. I’ve taken many multiple month breaks and came back feeling better/refreshed. I’m bout to come back after a few week break because I was feeling burnt out. Heading into a tourney tomorrow I may not be 100 mechanical/rotational but my mentality will be fresh.
    always nice after taking a few week break to be fair
        I mean you don’t need to keep playing rl. Once I hit GC I just stopped playing due to severe burnout and now I have found enjoyment in other games!
