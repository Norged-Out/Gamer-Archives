[[puts the rocket in rocket league]]





Yes, but they fly like they don't have an air traffic controller
    And hit the ball in random directions...
        and drive towards ball and boost like locked on missiles
            And scream like a banshee
                RHEEEEEEE

This is the way
                    I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
                        If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
                            This is the reason
                                You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                                    It's okay. I like you
                            The reason being your teammates suck!
            Locked on missiles doesn't miss their target every single time.
                Locked on to position of ball t-1 second

            How dare you not playing like a pro right away?!
            People tend to forget how they got there once they're at a high level in anything. It's especially frustrating with math teachers.
            You got it. The only way to learn is just to go for it every chance you get. We were all there at one point.
            freeplay to learn what certain buttons do while in the air, different ways to take off, and other movement basics. 

After you have a decent understanding of controls, transition to the rookie aerial training, if needed go back to freeplay to practice certain movements that  didnt work in the rookie training. 

Try out pro aerial training once you're okay at the rookie stuff, additionally; apply what you learned in real games. Repeat with all-star aerials once you're half-decent at pro.

Enjoy the skies!
                Thank you!
                This. Freeplay is your best friend. If you have RL on steam, use workshop to get maps like dribbling practice and the obstacle course for flight training. That's probably a little more advanced, but freeplay freeplay freeplay! Look up YouTube videos to learn how to practice in freeplay though.
            Don't fly in silver, focus on the basics first. I'm in gold and still only go in the air to hit a ball away from my goal or when I get a perfect pass.

I still focus on hitting with power, rotations and defense. Fancy shit is for higher ranks man.
        Bold of you to assume they hit the ball.
    as a plat can confirm
Before plat, you’re actually just playing League
    who are you, so wise in the ways of science?
        There are some who call me.. Tim
            DEATH AWAITS YOU ALL!
        Well I would be you since I just took your joke to the logical conclusion
    [deleted]
        hi
    This is true since the toxicity level on those ranks are the same as League of Legends.
    Am I doing something wrong I’m on gold and people air dribble it to the goal off the wall
Yeah all malfunctioning planes.
    Is this better or worse than a working car
        Shit half the time our cars dont work either.
    That can’t fly straight
        It gets so much worse g.
I wish I could forget everything about how to play Rocket League and go back to being a Silver so I could progressively get better at the game again.
    What prevents you from getting good now
        I'm champ 1-3 in most modes and GC in rumble. I am "good" relative to most players. I've been at that skill level for well over a year now. What prevents me from getting better? Motivation to practice. I'm a very casual player. I just want to launch the game and play a few matches.
            [removed]
                Can confirm, am at the same point and basically now I want to focus on better freestyle control, but for that I'mma have to put hours and hours into training each week.
                    Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
            I've been playing for 5 years and I can honestly say the only thing thats improved over the past three years is my decision making
                Arguably one of the most important skills in this game though (maybe unpopular opinion?). Game sense and decision making just take time to learn, you can’t sweat it out like mechanics practise.
                Sounds about right
            [deleted]
                I’m the same. You simply need to research & train to get much better than that.
        For any skill based game there exists walls and soft limits to each players ability. For instance in chess players will run into walls that take months or even years to climb. The same applies to rocket league of course. For some people they can get to plat in a single month, while others play in bronze/silver for years. You get what you put into the game. But at the higher end progression slows for everyone. No matter the effort you put in climbing becomes slow or even non existant. There is a soft cap so to speak. For me i got to plat in a month or 2. Then diamond after a year. And this is where im comftorable playing at. To get stronger would require more effort than i want or care to put in.
    You can create an account that you only play while drunk and have a drunk progression. No wait don't do that.
    As someone who very casually logs an hour a week, god do I feel so stupid missing the dumbest fucking hits.

But a few times a week I actually notice my improvement in a particular situation and it's awesome.

Being shit at this game is pretty great.
    [deleted]
    Only a month in right now.. just getting into gold and loving competitive play. I can feel myself getting better and not whiffing at everything is fun too.
    i miss the days where climbing the ladder happened so easily, the game takes so much maintenance to develop the consistency and precision now :(
I STRUGGLED to get into Plat and now that I've been here for a few months, I must say, there are a lot of people here who are worse than gold players
    HAH

I'm in this comment and I don't like it..
    The people are deffo better in terms of technical ability, but just cause you can do a double flip reset doesn't make you a good rocket league player. You need to know how to defend, rotate, pass etc.

Give me a shit but tactically aware player over a flashy but useless one any day. At least you can shit house your way to a win.
        So my teammates and I just passed through plat this season to low diamond and the number of people attempting the technical stuff has dropped off massively in favour of standard but more effective plays.
            I thinks that's probs more due to the rank adjusting cause of free to play. Give it a few months and it'll stabalise.
                Nah I would guess that they can get away with it in plat because the pace allows them to try fancy moves without issue. In diamond I’m sure it’s just too fast comparatively to go for the fancy option in place of the smart/faster but boring play
        Lethamyr is currently doing a Road to SSL series where he only supports the team and scores as little as possible, trying to be as less flashy as possible. So far he's been coasting his way up to Gold 3 with strong basics, strong positioning, and boost management. I'm sure it'll be the same up to Champ 1, where well have to begin trying a little.

Everyone should check that series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMxCAPcJijYOVBcDbanPmqgO4jWb-2XZl
    Honestly they get carried by their friends to the rank and can’t do shit alone. Seen silvers better than most plats
        You play a lot of silvers, huh?
    Can confirm. I don't play regularly at all anymore but I always place plat still, despite being worse than I used to be...
    That's because the f2p matchmaking algorithm brought in first time players into plat matches. They somehow got plat 1-2 by getting carried fully (source I have t 2 f2p friends who got plat 2 when they could barely hit a rolling ball).


However the quality now is slightly improved but still not like it used to be before f2p
    I find a lot of players in plat have either strong mechanics an ball chase/don’t know what they’re doing OR understand rotations but seem to screwup mechanically trying to make certain plays (this is me lol). I have it in my head that when I put both together I’ll move up
Get ready for the childish/selfish teammates who only care for themselves and are super ultra toxic.
    It’s fucking annoying when they make the dumbest plays but when you mess up once on a save they roast the shit out of you.
        Or those players that are mechanical gods but can’t rotate for shit, so they’ll just ball chase the whole time and spam “scoreboard” and “tm8 sucks” in chat
            [deleted]
                whats a sweat? I,ve played since the game was released and never heard that in chat once.
                    A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
                        I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
                            Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
                            It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
                                Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
                                Err, I play to have fun?
                                    Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
                            I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
                                Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
                            Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
                                I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                                    This is the way.
                                    I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
                            But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
                            Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
                            Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
                            If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
                                Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                                    Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
                        so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
                "If I'm the sweat you're the armpit salt stain."
            I try to be good about rotating and not cramping my teammates' style, but then they never rotate and either yell at me for not following through on their unpredictable setups, or just steal the ball from me when I try to set a play up :(
                That's cause your gold :P.
I used to be u and pushed past soley by being goalie/midfielder so i always had the lowest score but we won much more. It get better in plat 3/diamond+
            I love shitting on people on the other team who are shitting on their team mate.

>"Tm8 is trash"

Just a casual *"maybe it is you that is the problem"* or a "nah actually he's better than you" and everyone loses their minds lol

I mean they're only saying that to try to save face to us.
            I just played a plat tournament with my gold 3 friends (i’m plat 2) and we made them forfeit because we destroyed them 6-0 in the first 2 minutes, they triple committed every time and it was just hilarious
            Those players that whiff a challenge so hard they float away while the other team scores an easy 2v1 goal on you, then have the audacity to ragequit from getting scored on.

It happened me 3 times in a row the other day, from 3 different "players". I had to turn the game off and contemplate my entire existence for the rest of the night.
            I hate to say it but I was one of those guys. Except for the scoreboard and tm8 sucks. But still fuck those guys.
            Brooooo. This right here.  Lol can't tell you how many times we will be winning,  but some dude on the other team gets an air dribble double tap and just spams "what a save!"
            Goes both ways really. Plenty of players spamming about rotations when they're too far behind the play (or worse sat inside the goal when the ball is in the opponent's half)
        Its a response,  they are attacking you because they are insecure and think when they screw up everyone is being just as harsh in their minds, judging them, so the retaliate in kind.
        Just mute everyone. It's so easy that way. Im actually scared to touch plat after a while.
        mess ups on saves at least in my experience happen roughly 10 seconds before the actual goals happen
    I only play casual but it shits me when someone spawns at goal but they don’t stay to defend.
        Happens in competitive every fucking time, too
            Just FYI, at higher ranks sitting in the goal is considered the bad play here
                I would say that because matches/lobbies are so short people dont have a way to constructively educate each other in game on the shift in *what is the "bad play"* as you move up in ranks. It leads to a large amount of perceived toxicity because everyone just has a few seconds between plays or after to say "hey do or dont do X", which is rarely helpful without mountains of context. 

This entire game is an ever changing series of flow charts.

is this the situation, yes or no, if yes then do A, if no then do B.

people learn a certain flow chart and get comfy thinking they are playing correctly without realizing that the flow chart changes every few ranks and even if you do realize it can still be hard to change habits.
                    I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
                        If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
                            Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
                                This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                                    Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
                        That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
                            Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
                            I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
                                !@#$
                        It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
                            I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
                Who doesn't love trying to score a goal 1 v 3 in standard while *both* your teammates decide to sit in their own goal? Can't stand how passively some people play.
                    Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
                        I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
                            How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
                                They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                                    Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
                        Grow up buddy
                I'm only plat but because of that I know exactly what he means. 

The people in this rank don't go right or left they drive at you. So whichever way the ball goes 99/100 we're conceding unless we manage some crazy recovery. Or even better sometimes the ball goes to the side wall and they drive through you and put you both out of the game.
            Corner fucking boost. And then they grab the side boost leaving you stranded post kick off and blame you when the other team scores
                This has only started happening to me at plat. 

Doesn't it look super Uber omg cool when the same guy who took both corner and mid drives at the ball in the corner and smacks it that hard at the opponent's back board that you have to try and use the 36 boost you managed to collect in a 1v2 cos your team mate is on his roof somewhere?
                    This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
                        > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
                            It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
                                One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                                    Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
                                I do it instinctively now.
                        Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
                    You described me in bronze

...hold up...
        You’ll learn quickly that people lack any basic game sense. You can honestly score 10 goals a game in diamond if people were competent enough to understand how to position themselves for a counter attack.
            If they were competent enough to understanding proper positioning... they wouldn’t be in Diamond anymore.
                This is the thing when people flame you for doing rather simple mistakes or don't understand these concepts.

Bitch if I did, I wouldn't be playing in your ranks
                    In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
                        Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.

You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
                            Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
                        I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
                            Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
                                yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                                    In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
                                Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
                                This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
                                This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
                        You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
                    people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
                        My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
                            Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
                                Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                                    Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
                                sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
                    Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
                        That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
                        Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
                Diamond has a huge variation in skill. That’s why pros hate it lol
                    Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
                        People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
                    If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
                    What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
                Many in Diamond *do* understand proper positioning. The biggest issue I found throughout Diamond is the [in]consistency. You know where  to be, where you fucked up, and how you could've done it better. Then you just keep whiffing some stupid aerials or challenges that you know you shouldn't have whiffed - that were like guaranteed lay-up touches - and now you left your teammates scrambling to clean up your mess because they all expected your challenge to work and send the ball downfield.

Sometimes I get trash teammates in Diamond who seem like they came straight out of Gold. Most of the time though it feels like a consistency issue.
            It’s like they don’t understand that you need someone protecting the goal. 

I always say “got it” or “defending” etc before each match or new start but does anyone acknowledge it? Nope. It’s just a free for all and then we lose.
                Does my head in when they’re on a break away and you jockey their players into a really poor position and they still score all because your teammate wanted 100 boost rather than 85
                    Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
                        YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
                            Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
                                Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
                You need to rotate and read the game. Press high if you can and focus on where you should be in relation to your team *and* the other team. Your team doesn't need a permanent goalkeeper, they need an actual teammate and plenty of rotation.
                    If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
                [deleted]
                    This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
                        I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
                        Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
                            It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
                        PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
                            I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
                    The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
                    I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
                Yeah "I got it" never gets ackowledged. Honestly, I just started not going for kickoffs most of the time.
        What do you mean, I always get boost then go to defend... I think its dumb to not use that time to get boost if your the one back on spawn
            Communication is key. Quick chat your intentions. Problem is 99% of people don’t and they only want to score goals wether they win or lose.
            This.  If you prioritize getting the boost and getting back into position as quickly as possible, you'll be fine, unless your teammate *literally* misses the ball (and even then, half the time it goes off the crossbar because the opponent wasn't expecting that).

The problem is the people who assume that their teammate is going to WIN the kickoff, and start pushing up field immediately, only to watch the ball go sailing past them and straight into the goal.
                Yeah, exactly. There's a way to grab boost when your goal is safe. And people need to learn how to keep your nose upfield so you can track the ball while getting boost.
            Not in dubs. Always shadow center and be ready to contest.
                Yeah, I only defend on the kick off then shadow or vice versa if my rando team mate knows what’s up.
        I mean, hit the kickoff so it doesn't go straight on our goal so I can pick up a boost already.
        Grabs corner and mid boost on kickoff.
        [deleted]
            That’s not the issue. The issue is no one thinking “I should get back as it seems to be heading towards our goal”

They just hang up the other end waiting and even when it is down our end they dare not think about getting in the goal square. 

Once again, this isn’t everyone but is is most on casual.
        ... why would you stay goal for a defend on kickoff? That could instead be applied to whoever kicks off not having good kickoff control. 

If you can control the kick you have no need to have someone sit net
        Or getting boost on kickoff. You have plenty! Grab the little boost on the way to the goal. You’ll have like 40 boost, which is more than enough. Gotta save every last drop of that boost.
        The worst is when they go to get fucking boost, then you get beat on kick off and your teammate is no where to be found (even though they should still be at goal) and then they flame you for "giving up the goal".
            Them getting corner boost is fine 99% unless you completely miss your kickoff.
                I was in a game the other night, went for corner boost after saying "Go For It!" "Need Boost!" Both other guys whiffed the faceoff and I get "What a saved"
                IMO its just safer to wait to get that boost until after the kickoff. Mistakes happen
            Should be at goal? Why should THEY have to position preemptively for your failure? How is it a good move for them to play as if they expect you to fail? 

Have confidence and trust in your teammates and position accordingly. You will find more openings, better response times and better teamwork goals. You will learn to read faster and react more accurately. You will notice positionally the enemy, the ball and your teammate and react to the most likely outcome more accurately as time goes on. To assume automatically that they will fail will result in you outpositioned when they succeed, putting your teammate out on a limb on their own, potentially leading to an outnumbered counterattack against you. 


No, they should not have been ‘in goal’
        Oh my god, THIS. I swear, it's 50-50 as to whether the guy at goal leaves the goal open or stays. It's so incredibly frustrating to watch the opposing team make easy goals because people are apparently allergic to *staying on defense* for more than a few seconds.
    Man i became a plat last week, those people are more toxic than Chernobyl
        Dude I got to plat III div IV and I've been sitting there for a few weeks with my diamond I buddies who got me to where I am legitimately. The toxicity is so much more fine tuned when I make simple mistakes just because I take a week or two off and I'm a little rusty. Luckily the shit talk isn't nearly as immature or as frequent but they know the finer details of your skills so the insults get more personal. Hard to want to play this game without my team.
        Diamond is no different too
            I think Diamond I is the worst place to be. Platinum is fine up until Plat 3, Div3-4 then it gets really toxic. You got down 2 points and your teammate wants to FF when there's 4 minutes left to play. It's mad annoying.
    i learned how to stay in my lane through the pains of silver & gold. same cant be said about the guys that got carried into plat that im being matched with...
        Trust me, there’s people at every rank that shouldn’t be there, even in high c3 they sometimes seem like plat
            Same things happen in bronze.
                i have a question, how tf do you get to Bronze I
                    I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
                        This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
                            I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
                        Wow that perfectly describes me rn
                            You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
                        My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
                        I'm g3 by just doing that lol
                    I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
            I got ranked in Plat for some reason in Hoops and Singles when I’m only Silver 3 in doubles. Did NOT have a good time.
                You’ll get there eventually just keep practicing and do free play a lot
    Dude what is this? It was like a switch flipped. I had teammates just start spamming what a save and help the other team the rest of the game. Two games in a row!
        That or as soon as the other team is ahead by 1 goal with 3 minutes left, they huff and try to forfeit, leave or just stay inactive for the rest of the game.
    I watched Lethamyr's series of Bronze to Top rank and started playing super chill and let the other player score. Won 7 in a row. Went from Plat 1 Div 1 to Div 3
    This is any rank followed by III.
    Where do i find the teammates that actually care about improving?
    PLAT 1 3s/PLAT 3 RUMBLE PLAYER HERE. 

SO MANY KICKOFF GOALS SCORED AGAINST ME BECAUSE MY ASSCLOWN TEAMMATES VALUE CORNER BOOST MORE THAN OH, I DON’T KNOW, PREVENTING THE BALL FROM GOING INTO OUR NET

ALSO 1/3 OF MY TEAMMATES ARE BALLCHASERS WHO GIVE UP POSSESSION ON EVERY POINTLESS HIT SO I SPEND ALL DAY COUNTERING BOOMER CLEARS

I AINT MAD IM JUST DISAPPOINTED
        Maybe ask yourself How is the ball going straight in the net on my kickoff?
            Lol no. If I lose kickoff the ball is by definition going to be traveling toward our net. It can bounce off the wall into the net. It can fly up in the air and come down into the net. It can get stalled in the middle of the field and have another opposing player kick it straight into the net. The possibilities are endless when there’s NO GODDAMN GOALIE.
                [deleted]
                    “Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
                        He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
                            Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
    My feeling was that high gold was worse.
    Amen!!!
    Times like that are a good excuse to take a break from 2/3s and work on your 1s.
    "No. What matters is ME! LOOK AT ME I CAN DO FANCY THINGS WITH THE BALL AND FUCK YOU"

Basically everything above plat
    Yes, I think plat has gotten worse since last season too. Maybe its just me but there are some BAD players and some toxic babies.
    I am plat in normal modes and champion in rumble and I can assure you champion is much worse especially champion 2. Like half of the games your teammates will or even the opponents will spam what a safe and that kinda stuff. It does kinda help with your confidence as at some point you will just ignore everything everyone says
    Plat is honestly one of the least toxic ranks out there in my experience, at least in EU. Both gold and diamond(so far, have played like 30 matches in diamond 1) are more toxic.
    Get ready they never actually stop appearing in your games! Even at GC level they still appear!
    Get a billion cusses thrown at you for missing the ball by a centimeter.
How to dominate plat through diamond:

Play mid to back and cherry pick mistakes from your opponents and fails from your hero ball cunt teammates
    This speaks to me. I’m plat 2ish and generally find myself being the only defense in matches. Sometimes I push forward to participate in the action but we end up all committing and getting screwed on counters. Guess pushing up isn’t the path to Diamond.
        My rule always was if you are the best player on your team play mid to back, facilitate with passes, and only fully commit if you feel there is a high probability of scoring.

If you take up an air dribble, screw up, or get stuffed you can guarantee no one on your team will be there to stop an easy counter goal.

In contrast, if you see carmello go up and fail his 17th attempted ceiling shot, you can sometime score goals but almost always shut down the counter offense to allow carmello to immediately turn the ball over again
            Absolutely. It's clearly in my own best interests to believe this but I regularly have the lowest score in games we win because I just big chill waiting for a mistake from one side or the other. More often than not my teammates are humping each other and the ball so closely up and down the field it's the only real option.
            I hear that, most of my goals are garbage clean up goals but a goal is a goal and I don’t care.

The times when I do finally get paired up with some quality teammates can give me a chance at proper cycling and getting a balanced score sheet. Those moments are when I wish I virtual high five/hug button was available. I love playing with those folks.
    Good way to coast through platinum then find yourself getting stomped in diamond without the skill/speed to respond in any play. You need to jump to learn how to fly.
        V true. I’m in diamond and I feel like none of my teammates ever leave the ground.
    Bruh, this is my strat from day 1. You don't need to fly, just defend and counter attack.

(you actually need to fly later on tho)
        Definitely, this is generally how I finally got to Plat. And did it pretty easily too after a few years of been stuck in gold 2.
I’m scared and i’m not even in plat
    [removed]
        Just embrace the incoming losses. I’ve been playing casually for two or so years and I still lose rather often but I don’t think much of it. I just play to have fun. If anyone in game tells you otherwise they can buzz off
            I love it when I’m beating someone in singles and they tell me I’m trash. Or to stop bumping.
    Idk what your MMR is in Casual but mine is high enough I regularly get matched with Plat and Diamond, occasionally Champ. It's really not that big of a difference from high Gold. (Amount of people flying )
        Yeah it mostly translates as smarter placement and less whiffing as you climb the ranks. Some people have an idealized, unrealistic image of GC players in their head and are quick to trash talk us when we do the tiniest mistakes and fail to carry them with a gc title equipped.
in my experience they turn into airplanes in gold (really bad airplanes but still airplanes)
    That's me rn, an airplane which barely knows how to takeoff from runway and then proceeds to miss the ball entirely.
        Paper airplane. It gets thrown and then it’s upon fate where it lands
I've been playing for a few weeks now and while I can hit aerials okay, these demons are dribbling or adding flicks mid air. I too plan to sell my soul
    [deleted]
        I'm Est.2015 and I just hit plat for the first time a couple days ago lol
            Me too! With 270 hours to my name
                Haha. I'm at 285 hours and I started 6 months ago... Trying to hit diamond this season
                    285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
                        Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
                I'm over 430 hours so you def pick it up better than I do haha
                149, touched diamond briefly, for 2 or so games. Then got rightly smacked back down to plat 2 where I feel like I belong :p
            I'm plat 2 and started playing at the beginning of the year.
        I’m diamond in the standard ranks, but plat in some of the extra modes like hoops. Some of these plat ranks are far from legitimate. I’ve had teammates in hoops who literally can’t aerial and end the game in single-digit points. It looks like Psyonix is trying to appease the new players to keep them coming back.
            Extra modes just rank you higher than other ranks usually. I got diamond in rumble fairly easily when I was still high gold
                I know that has always been the case, but it’s extra suspect and super inconsistent right now. As a solo queuer, I can have a teammate with a green ‘champion tournament winner’ title or someone who clearly has only been playing for a month. It’s a nightmare.
                    in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
                    Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
                    Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
                        Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
                It's because fewer people play extras, right? I'd imagine that ends up slide-scaling the ranks a bit.
                Yeah I managed to get up into Plat on rumble before I was even solidly gold in 3s, and I'm still floating around the top of Silver in 2s. Is it just because the fewer ranked players in those modes?
            I believe that’s to blame from the new ranks. Was a c2 and for a good month couldn’t get out of D1/2 because of GCs and C3s. Now I’m C2 again
            Yeah on me and my friends epic account we placed plat 1 besides the fact we're both gold players in reality. We got lost our final 3 placements in plat lobbies too and it still placed us there
        Not that long ago I spent a half-dozen glorious games at Diamond 1. Then, before I knew it...Gold 3 and what just happened?
        Yeah I've probably played a little too much haha. I started end of Oct and put in around 70 hours by the time I got to Plat II. I think ranking up is gonna slow down quite a bit for me now though because it's feeling tough. I go up a division, then down a division constantly
            god damn that's amazing only 70 hours and plat 2? I am around like 30 hours and stuck in gold1-silver3 how do you get better?

                    My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
                [deleted]
                    thnx I needed that
                    3½k, also still plat;)
                He could have good teammates that he plays with, which helps tremendously
                    Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
                    Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
                        Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
                Rotate. 

Learn where to be. 

Anticipate where the ball is going. 

Play a little more defensively while the other 2 ball chase.

I'm champ 2 and can't do any of that crazy off the ceiling, aerial ballet twirly shit you see.
                    This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
                I responded to someone below with how I play too if it helps. I started Silver 2 after the unranked thingy and I think naturally I didn't ball chase from the start. I tend to pick positions based on how my teammates are because I play with just randoms online. I play a little more conservative too, sitting back and clearing, moreso in Plat as I'm still new to this rank.  As I improve in each rank, I want to reduce that and give those clearances direction or turn them into offensive runs. At least in Gold if I did, I'd push up but follow the ball width ways trying to predict the angle the ball is going. One of the things I try to do more often is to centre balls too by taking it up the side and knocking it central - you can assist a lot that way and it's not difficult to learn

The other thing is I've probably watched a lot of YouTube videos and changed my settings from the start to the ones Squishy uses

I'd say look at your positioning, try and reduce ball chasing and instead pick your angles to hit better balls. The best teams you can play with are those who rotate fluidly and you can rely on them to take turns sitting back. Plus not trying to hit every ball you/they can for the sake of it. Pick your 50/50s
                    thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
            Plat 2 after 70 hours is pretty great. I'm Plat 1 at 500 hours.
            Yeah that's because the algorithm still isn't sure where to place you. You lose a lot but also gain a lot. It's going to be a whole lot harder to rank up after your MMR stabilizes. From changing divs or entire ranks with each game, you'll now be needing 3 wins in a row to div up.
        [deleted]
            Yeah I was struggling to get past gold 3 last season, I jumped on yesterday and I got to plat 2 without feeling like the skill level was any higher than last season’s gold 2
            Well, now me hitting diamond for the first time doesn't seem as big a deal.
                Diamond in standard has been its own special kind of hell. High champs got pushed to low champ and low champs got pushed into diamond. Your diamond is actually still good. It’s the peak of the bell curve (e.g., gold/plat) that is extra iffy right now.
                I don't think this is particularly true, I was d2 before f2p and I still am. Still feels like d2. Maybe there was a big squeeze below that, but without some data it doesn't feel like it
        Haha same ikr

Meanwhile my friend started f2p and he's also plat
        I started bit less than 2 weeks ago and orginally placed in silver and finally managed to hit plat yesterday. I'm extremely competitive and spent most of my time just doing basic shooting training packs or free play to improve my mechanics. Also i already have 50 hours played.

It mostly depends on how you playe the game. Most people just play casually i usually play to improve
    I feel you, I'm at the same spot lol
    I’m at 320 hours and I have been playing since 2018 and I just got to plat 1. Fuck me.
    I’ve had it for a year and I can’t even do aerials consistently. Only been online for 1-2 months but still.
    Lol. There is only 1 god, and his name is training pack
Platinum is Rocket League purgatory
    Here I am just chilling in plat 3 because I've reached my ceiling lol. So much toxicity every other game.
        Dude, I've been clawing up and down plat two div's1-4 for the past year haha There are way too many holes in my game for diamond sadly
            You'd be surprised tbh. Honestly I felt like I was stalled at plat. Literally put hundreds of hours into the game at that rank and didn't improve, just kept occillating between high p3 and low p2. I'm d2 currently and honestly it's really just small things and rotation that got me unstuck. I think I bought into the advice to "learn a complicated mechanic to get better" that content creators often push. And honestly that made me waste so much time. Its like telling a middle schooler to try doing integral calculus to get better at algebra.
Hey they turn into airplanes in gold, they just can’t control it yet. 

From someone who keeps going from gold to plat and plat to gold
    When I first started playing rocket league, only diamonds or above could ariel regularly.

Now we got silvers who are better than me at it lmao.
        Same, except I stayed in bronze because I only played 1v1s.
            1v1s are so different tho, it's about limiting you mistakes and always being in a position to recover from one.
Planes without system checks.
Welcome to the land of champs that haven’t played enough games to be champ yet
I played all of 2 games in plat. Been a struggle making it back. It would help if I didn't drink and drive, but a man has his vices.
    I definitely play competitive until I start losing more often (aka get too drunk) and realize I should go to casual lol
I'd recommend grinding training packs and obstacle courses. (PC)

It's going to help you improve significantly over time and you will need to if you want to solo que through Plat and Diamond.
Just keep grinding you guys, it gets worth it
Just left gold 3 then had a few great games turned off my console I came back and everyone in plat is the next musty bruh I'm done.
I'm in diamond in snowday. I miss causal play :(
I just hit plat two and realized maybe I shouldn’t try too hard
I remember how proud I was to hit plat then get my ass sent back to gold 3 games later.
    Felt
Reaching champ and suddenly there’s spaceships everywhere.
Thats when interesting shit happens! keep it going! nothing better to improve your air skills that playing with people who does fly! from a humble GC from argentina, dont give up!
    [deleted]
More like gold nowadays...
[removed]
    Tell people to stop being a perma-goalie. That's something you grow out of real fast as you get better. People who perma-goalie are going nowhere fast.

If you wanna motivate them to play a bit more, rotate in behind them and give them a love tap from behind to tell them to go ahead. Other than that, just expect to lose those games and move on secure in the knowledge that you'll rise in ranks and they'll probably stay where they are.
    Yup I play 2s and have always been a better setup man than scorer. I can win the balls in the corner, stir shit up and send it to net pretty well. I’m not great but I’m not horrible, and I like the 2v2 strategy and geometry. 

Can’t tell you how many games I’ve had probably 4-5 perfect tap in goal setups go unrewarded because my teammate was in the defensive 1/3 of the field sitting motionless. 

Then without fail the first time I’m clearly beat and have no shot to win the loose ball he aerials, sails 20 feet over and wide of the ball and the other team gets a breakaway goal. 

Or when I’m possessing in the offensive corner he crashes in at max speed hitting me and the ball sending us both flying and the ball centered for a perfect pass going the other way. It’s so rare when I get paired with someone who just plays smart and predictably. 

Also there’s a huge correlation between people that sit in goal for 90% of the game and people who can’t save a medium strength shot coming directly at them. Sigh.
I had a taste of platinum for a day or two and dropped my black ass right back down. I think I’ll stay in my lane💀
I'm not even going to try and start sweating the air shit, I'm fine on the ground.
    hahaha
Been waiting in plat for mom for a long time
What about Inverted Grand Champ??
At one point I thought I would never even try to learn to ariel. I'm here now
u/ungibled2
    Ah, the good ol' days
I've seen golds fly... Not well, but they do.
Why I use Aftershock lol
They are literal heat seking rockets
Yeah. This is me.

I've been playing since release and i still can't fly decent...

At least i can wall ride?
Am awful at the game especially in the air but I somehow managed to place in plat after my placement matches and oh boi did I feel the skill gap. I just made it my mission to not get in my teammates way.
#THIS IS ROCKET LEAAAGUE
i reached diamond not flying for shit lmao just play enough defense and hope to god you can win 1-0 with some luck lmao .
I remember when I was a new player with no knowledge beyond my own bronze level games, and someone was trashtalking and asking me if I even knew how to fly. 

My response was "like that's possible".
Is this some sort of joke that i'm too nooby to understand?
Bro I had people doing like air dribbles and shit on me in gold I honestly feel like plat is easier
Ah the old days
Platinum? That's what its like at Silver.
I relate to this so much lol. I always get up to gold 3 div 4 in standard woth just solid 50s and some lucky wall plays and as soon as I get close to plat I get absolutely destroyed by a bunch of fighter jets
    Learning and practicing rotations will get you deep into plat. Also having people to play with that are a few ranks higher will help lol
        my rotations are decent actually, I just lack any mechanical skill whatsoever, but thanks for the advice
When u became champ and the ppl seem to be freestylers (including myself xd)
Pro players = a fucking ufo that defies all laws of physics
This picture is better considering the original name was supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars
Dont know wh6y that one didnt catch on
The step up from gold 3 to plat 1 was actually insane
Ahahhahaahhahaahaha
I got carried by randoms to plat 3 dropshot and the only thing the touched the floor was the ball
Um bro people fly in silver i dont get it
    they fly as well as a pickup truck driving off a cliff tho
    silvers dont fly. they fall with style
    Ya but the main point is they're flying to just make contact. Plat is where people kind of start to get the hang of taking shots and actually maneuvering in the air
lmao all these ppl acting like they got skill for goal camping
Don't know about 3's but 2v2 there aren't any real fancy aerials. In 1v1's I've encountered a few freestylers that found their way into a rank game, typically I just let them take it up and off the wall then steal it when they fail to do whatever they were attempting in their heads.

Most of the time it is just ungodly levels of toxicity and salty madness. They mad when you demo, they mad when you miss a save, they mad when they are winning, they mad if you give them a "Nice Shot" qc when they make a goal, they even mad when they mad.

If they are just being uppity/rude just hit them with that report and continue on. When they go balls through the walls flaming (talking about spamming racist, homophobic, or just straight out threats) pop a screen shot and send a ticked so Daddy psynet can put the lil bab in time out.
Lol in plat and no one goes for aerials high diamond is where its at
I'm usually in the low rankings Gold 1 or Gold 2, don't judge me please for being so bad, I'm 44 years old and married so I only play on the weekends. Some time ago I stumbled in this very good player that asked to party up, and I gladly accepted. Thanks to him we won something like 10 matches in a row and I reached Gold 3 division 4 or something.... well to me that was insane... cars flying everywhere!!!!
I’m in diamond because my mom didn’t pick me up so I picked my skills up.
Almost champ btw
you guys sound like pussies
    that's not very nice of you
        nice save!
TBF that's not even diamond....
So Gold is where all the guys are that cant even fly?
More like wannabe planes that just fly but ain't hitting shit
    damn dude you're awesome
    they still flying though and it's kinda intimidating
Lmao platinum. That's a pretty shitty rank still. It's like people have no brains on being at the right position, so if you're the only one not chasing, you gotta bail everyone most of the match.

It's fun when three strangers play in unison as if they were on comms. It's the natural rotations and relentless attacks.
    No one is saying plat is a high rank man. But we get it, you're good
I just hit plat for the first time and it’s pretty difficult cause people be doing some crazy shit in the air
Lmao same thing happened to me i qued plat solo came a guy who won tournaments and completely destroyed me .
i’m gold 3 and terrified
...like plat 4 or what?
Welcome to platinum you will never leave.
also get ready for the kids with fortnite names that go for breezi flicks and flip reset mustys non stop😐
This comment section has some very angry plat players.
I'm trying to Turbo Fly at Silver just to flex

It didn't work
Seriously I have no idea how the fuck to reset

Like I think I’m good and then I come on this sub and im like oh I suck
I’m still scared too this day, plats like vietnam
Space
I managed to get to Plat in duos like a month ago. I can barely dribble on the ground and some fuckers glue the ball to them on the air like it's nothing.
Is this a joke I'm too silver to understand?
My gf and I have been dealing with this lately, we're still casual as fuck and it also doesn't help that we get the most ball hog team mates ever!
I remember those days. Now 98% of my games are just everyone playing flight simulator.
Honestly!! My brother and I play together and once you hit plat all the chat is spammed with how garbage you are in the game from people who spend too much time caring. 

Like I’m here for fun, I like being plat but I would rather enjoy the game and be wholesome. 

My bro and I VC through discord and it’s much more fun that way.
When you finally reach diamond and the toxicity gets worse... so much worse
Lmao
They be piloting and toxiccating the whole game.
Haha I just started getting into this game after my son has been playing it for years, I just ranked in competitive Gold 1 Division 2 and I'm like....holy shit I need to start studying how to actually play this game better! At least twice a game Im muttering to myself "oh my god I suck so bad" while dudes are flying off the highest wall with pinpoint accuracy to the middle of the arena...wtf
This is great and same for hockey, that puck turns into a flying saucer
When i hit plat at 1’s i inmidiatly got destroyed 7-2 and 8-2. Plat and ranked in general scares me...
Dude I’m Gold 3 and cars fly like it’s nobody business...
As a forever champ 1-3 (been champ 1-3 since champ existed) I remember what all the other ranks were like too. And I feel like all you plats will hate diamond even more, so toxic
I get to plat div 4 and then start getting teamed with trash or toxic teamatss like bro im just trying to get past plat. I need a couple people to play with.
Im not even far in gold and there are all helicopter
When you finally get to plat 3(3v3) don't forget to make a sacrifice to RL god because then he would punish you with potatoe teammates streak way back to plat 2 div 1.
I am watching this here in gold 3 😔😔
One Winged Angels
As a low plat 1 I can confirm
.
ATTENTION PASSENGERS WE ARE GON TO HAVE A WILD RIDE PLZ BUCKLE UP AND GRAB A ENERGY DRINK DO A LINE OF COCAINE AND PREPARE TO SMASH FLYING BALLS MULTIPLE TIMES.

Also we may be blown to bits but plz don’t worry about that unless we die.
yes! holy cow this happened to me this week.  Been Never plat before, was always around mid gold.

went plat, Jeeeeebers! im rubbish at flying but my word i was out of my depth...

(this was 3v3)
I got put into a diamond lobby as a plat 2 and it was like watching a flight demonstration
And there's that guy screaming in vc
I play with my friend who is level 500 and I’m only lvl 50 so I just never realized a difference
hi nooice boi boi boi boi boi
Pretty sure that starts happening in gold
As a plat, can confirm
When you hit GC and rocket league cars turn into actual rockets.

UnInStAlL
As a new plat can confirm
Airplane scari
I really only play hoops so that's all I can speak for, but it feels like plat is where all the speedy flyers are and then diamond it slows way down but people actually hit all their shots.
I just downloaded the game 2 days ago, played 10 placement matches and got into plat 1, i was clearly lucky bc i cant fly and hit the ball lol, now im spending most time in training so my teammates dont flame at me in a ranked game
I'm plat 1 in both singles and doubles and have been at this wall for like multiple years. I think my strength is good sense of the field, minimizing mistakes, and being scrappy. But to progress I have to do all the air dribble crap the kids do and I'll just never be able to. This is my life now.

I guess I'm hoping to hear either I'm correct or the tricks are easier than I think lol
I feel like that’s what’s keeping me in plat 1. I can aerial pretty good but a lot of times higher plats just do it better than me.
Dont worry, in plat all the airplanes crash and burn.
I have that already in gold lol?
Fly like a fighter jet
Lmao
Wait until diamond where the smurfs come to play
Flying and missing takes you out of the play
Dude all I play is casuals now and I swear plats mechanics are better than a lot of champs...they just don’t understand any other part of the game lol. I’ll see them hit ceiling shots and perfectly air dribble and I’m just thinking like....how the fuck do y’all have slightly better mechanics than me and are that low of a rank lol?
“This is air traffic control car 2 you have permission to do a double ball reset-Musty flick-Backboard-Pinch”
That made me wheeze
Double jump aerials take you to the next level btw, and they are too easy to mess up
Move to Plat? Yeah that's a funny joke!

*sobs in Silver 3*
Plat? People have already begun doing that in gold.
I made it to plat (definitely my ceiling for the amount of skill I have) in 3s and I don't play 3s anymore. I'll be destroyed if I get knocked back down to gold, but I know I can't survive in plat for long.
Plats are just golds with confidence, and often over-confidence because they think they're good all of a sudden and try to air dribble and shit. I've legit seen someone pull off air dribbling in plat like it was nothing, but then after I block the shot they have no idea what to do and just hand over a free goal.
This is so true
And everyone is still a giant douchebag.
You don’t have to wait for platinum just play casual 3v3s
That happened to me but in silver...
Lmao fr fr but they get played on the ground
I felt that when i got to gold one lol
My friend had some dudeds who were salty so he 1v2 them and they had theur butts handed to them
Ahhhhhh
It’s not even like that in play people don’t know how to rotate or do nothin it’s irritating
yerreymm
Hit double x to flip
"Finally reaches Plat" I'm confused was I not supposed to immediate place plat a week into first playing the game and already be doing aerials
Ya in 2020 dec now its like silvers and thats even more terrifying
Me right now in champ
When you hit plat 3 and the airplanes turn i to frogs
Bruh golds can't hit a thing in the air
Platinum?! I think you mean silver
Yeah once I’ve reached plat that’s kinda it I’m not getting any higher then this.
You spelt silver 2 wrong
I just got to plat today and people are stupid good at this game. Like a hell of a lot better than me. I honestly don’t know what’s happening when I play
I have 20xx looking for interstellar
Hahhahaha same to meee
Lmao I just realised my user flair wasn’t p1 it was s2
I knew that the aftershock was just a Boeing 747 in disguise!
relatable
This is me at plat 3 trying to get to diamond but I don't have my pilots license
I'm plat and it's definitely more flailing than flying for me and the folks I play against
And hit the ball in random directions...
    and drive towards ball and boost like locked on missiles
        And scream like a banshee
            RHEEEEEEE

This is the way
                I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
                    If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
                        This is the reason
                            You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                                It's okay. I like you
                        The reason being your teammates suck!
        Locked on missiles doesn't miss their target every single time.
            Locked on to position of ball t-1 second
    [deleted]
        How dare you not playing like a pro right away?!
        People tend to forget how they got there once they're at a high level in anything. It's especially frustrating with math teachers.
        You got it. The only way to learn is just to go for it every chance you get. We were all there at one point.
        freeplay to learn what certain buttons do while in the air, different ways to take off, and other movement basics. 

After you have a decent understanding of controls, transition to the rookie aerial training, if needed go back to freeplay to practice certain movements that  didnt work in the rookie training. 

Try out pro aerial training once you're okay at the rookie stuff, additionally; apply what you learned in real games. Repeat with all-star aerials once you're half-decent at pro.

Enjoy the skies!
            Thank you!
            This. Freeplay is your best friend. If you have RL on steam, use workshop to get maps like dribbling practice and the obstacle course for flight training. That's probably a little more advanced, but freeplay freeplay freeplay! Look up YouTube videos to learn how to practice in freeplay though.
        Don't fly in silver, focus on the basics first. I'm in gold and still only go in the air to hit a ball away from my goal or when I get a perfect pass.

I still focus on hitting with power, rotations and defense. Fancy shit is for higher ranks man.
    Bold of you to assume they hit the ball.
as a plat can confirm
who are you, so wise in the ways of science?
    There are some who call me.. Tim
        DEATH AWAITS YOU ALL!
    Well I would be you since I just took your joke to the logical conclusion
[deleted]
    hi
This is true since the toxicity level on those ranks are the same as League of Legends.
Am I doing something wrong I’m on gold and people air dribble it to the goal off the wall
Is this better or worse than a working car
    Shit half the time our cars dont work either.
That can’t fly straight
    It gets so much worse g.
What prevents you from getting good now
    I'm champ 1-3 in most modes and GC in rumble. I am "good" relative to most players. I've been at that skill level for well over a year now. What prevents me from getting better? Motivation to practice. I'm a very casual player. I just want to launch the game and play a few matches.
        [removed]
            Can confirm, am at the same point and basically now I want to focus on better freestyle control, but for that I'mma have to put hours and hours into training each week.
                Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
        I've been playing for 5 years and I can honestly say the only thing thats improved over the past three years is my decision making
            Arguably one of the most important skills in this game though (maybe unpopular opinion?). Game sense and decision making just take time to learn, you can’t sweat it out like mechanics practise.
            Sounds about right
        [deleted]
            I’m the same. You simply need to research & train to get much better than that.
    For any skill based game there exists walls and soft limits to each players ability. For instance in chess players will run into walls that take months or even years to climb. The same applies to rocket league of course. For some people they can get to plat in a single month, while others play in bronze/silver for years. You get what you put into the game. But at the higher end progression slows for everyone. No matter the effort you put in climbing becomes slow or even non existant. There is a soft cap so to speak. For me i got to plat in a month or 2. Then diamond after a year. And this is where im comftorable playing at. To get stronger would require more effort than i want or care to put in.
You can create an account that you only play while drunk and have a drunk progression. No wait don't do that.
As someone who very casually logs an hour a week, god do I feel so stupid missing the dumbest fucking hits.

But a few times a week I actually notice my improvement in a particular situation and it's awesome.

Being shit at this game is pretty great.

Only a month in right now.. just getting into gold and loving competitive play. I can feel myself getting better and not whiffing at everything is fun too.
i miss the days where climbing the ladder happened so easily, the game takes so much maintenance to develop the consistency and precision now :(
HAH

I'm in this comment and I don't like it..
The people are deffo better in terms of technical ability, but just cause you can do a double flip reset doesn't make you a good rocket league player. You need to know how to defend, rotate, pass etc.

Give me a shit but tactically aware player over a flashy but useless one any day. At least you can shit house your way to a win.
    So my teammates and I just passed through plat this season to low diamond and the number of people attempting the technical stuff has dropped off massively in favour of standard but more effective plays.
        I thinks that's probs more due to the rank adjusting cause of free to play. Give it a few months and it'll stabalise.
            Nah I would guess that they can get away with it in plat because the pace allows them to try fancy moves without issue. In diamond I’m sure it’s just too fast comparatively to go for the fancy option in place of the smart/faster but boring play
    Lethamyr is currently doing a Road to SSL series where he only supports the team and scores as little as possible, trying to be as less flashy as possible. So far he's been coasting his way up to Gold 3 with strong basics, strong positioning, and boost management. I'm sure it'll be the same up to Champ 1, where well have to begin trying a little.

Everyone should check that series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMxCAPcJijYOVBcDbanPmqgO4jWb-2XZl
Honestly they get carried by their friends to the rank and can’t do shit alone. Seen silvers better than most plats
    You play a lot of silvers, huh?
Can confirm. I don't play regularly at all anymore but I always place plat still, despite being worse than I used to be...
That's because the f2p matchmaking algorithm brought in first time players into plat matches. They somehow got plat 1-2 by getting carried fully (source I have t 2 f2p friends who got plat 2 when they could barely hit a rolling ball).


However the quality now is slightly improved but still not like it used to be before f2p
I find a lot of players in plat have either strong mechanics an ball chase/don’t know what they’re doing OR understand rotations but seem to screwup mechanically trying to make certain plays (this is me lol). I have it in my head that when I put both together I’ll move up
It’s fucking annoying when they make the dumbest plays but when you mess up once on a save they roast the shit out of you.
    Or those players that are mechanical gods but can’t rotate for shit, so they’ll just ball chase the whole time and spam “scoreboard” and “tm8 sucks” in chat
        [deleted]
            whats a sweat? I,ve played since the game was released and never heard that in chat once.
                A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
                    I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
                        Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
                        It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
                            Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
                            Err, I play to have fun?
                                Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
                        I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
                            Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
                        Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
                            I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                                This is the way.
                                I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
                        But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
                        Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
                        Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
                        If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
                            Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                                Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
                    so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
            "If I'm the sweat you're the armpit salt stain."
        I try to be good about rotating and not cramping my teammates' style, but then they never rotate and either yell at me for not following through on their unpredictable setups, or just steal the ball from me when I try to set a play up :(
            That's cause your gold :P.
I used to be u and pushed past soley by being goalie/midfielder so i always had the lowest score but we won much more. It get better in plat 3/diamond+
        I love shitting on people on the other team who are shitting on their team mate.

>"Tm8 is trash"

Just a casual *"maybe it is you that is the problem"* or a "nah actually he's better than you" and everyone loses their minds lol

I mean they're only saying that to try to save face to us.
        I just played a plat tournament with my gold 3 friends (i’m plat 2) and we made them forfeit because we destroyed them 6-0 in the first 2 minutes, they triple committed every time and it was just hilarious
        Those players that whiff a challenge so hard they float away while the other team scores an easy 2v1 goal on you, then have the audacity to ragequit from getting scored on.

It happened me 3 times in a row the other day, from 3 different "players". I had to turn the game off and contemplate my entire existence for the rest of the night.
        I hate to say it but I was one of those guys. Except for the scoreboard and tm8 sucks. But still fuck those guys.
        Brooooo. This right here.  Lol can't tell you how many times we will be winning,  but some dude on the other team gets an air dribble double tap and just spams "what a save!"
        Goes both ways really. Plenty of players spamming about rotations when they're too far behind the play (or worse sat inside the goal when the ball is in the opponent's half)
    Its a response,  they are attacking you because they are insecure and think when they screw up everyone is being just as harsh in their minds, judging them, so the retaliate in kind.
    Just mute everyone. It's so easy that way. Im actually scared to touch plat after a while.
    mess ups on saves at least in my experience happen roughly 10 seconds before the actual goals happen
I only play casual but it shits me when someone spawns at goal but they don’t stay to defend.
    Happens in competitive every fucking time, too
        Just FYI, at higher ranks sitting in the goal is considered the bad play here
            I would say that because matches/lobbies are so short people dont have a way to constructively educate each other in game on the shift in *what is the "bad play"* as you move up in ranks. It leads to a large amount of perceived toxicity because everyone just has a few seconds between plays or after to say "hey do or dont do X", which is rarely helpful without mountains of context. 

This entire game is an ever changing series of flow charts.

is this the situation, yes or no, if yes then do A, if no then do B.

people learn a certain flow chart and get comfy thinking they are playing correctly without realizing that the flow chart changes every few ranks and even if you do realize it can still be hard to change habits.
                I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
                    If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
                        Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
                            This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                                Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
                    That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
                        Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
                        I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
                            !@#$
                    It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
                        I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
            Who doesn't love trying to score a goal 1 v 3 in standard while *both* your teammates decide to sit in their own goal? Can't stand how passively some people play.
                Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
                    I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
                        How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
                            They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                                Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
                    Grow up buddy
            I'm only plat but because of that I know exactly what he means. 

The people in this rank don't go right or left they drive at you. So whichever way the ball goes 99/100 we're conceding unless we manage some crazy recovery. Or even better sometimes the ball goes to the side wall and they drive through you and put you both out of the game.
        Corner fucking boost. And then they grab the side boost leaving you stranded post kick off and blame you when the other team scores
            This has only started happening to me at plat. 

Doesn't it look super Uber omg cool when the same guy who took both corner and mid drives at the ball in the corner and smacks it that hard at the opponent's back board that you have to try and use the 36 boost you managed to collect in a 1v2 cos your team mate is on his roof somewhere?
                This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
                    > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
                        It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
                            One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                                Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
                            I do it instinctively now.
                    Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
                You described me in bronze

...hold up...
    You’ll learn quickly that people lack any basic game sense. You can honestly score 10 goals a game in diamond if people were competent enough to understand how to position themselves for a counter attack.
        If they were competent enough to understanding proper positioning... they wouldn’t be in Diamond anymore.
            This is the thing when people flame you for doing rather simple mistakes or don't understand these concepts.

Bitch if I did, I wouldn't be playing in your ranks
                In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
                    Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
                    HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
                        Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
                    I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
                        Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
                            yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                                In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
                            Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
                            This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
                            This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
                    You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
                people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
                    My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
                        Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
                            Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                                Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
                            sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
                Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
                    That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
                    Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
            Diamond has a huge variation in skill. That’s why pros hate it lol
                Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
                    People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
                If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
                What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
            Many in Diamond *do* understand proper positioning. The biggest issue I found throughout Diamond is the [in]consistency. You know where  to be, where you fucked up, and how you could've done it better. Then you just keep whiffing some stupid aerials or challenges that you know you shouldn't have whiffed - that were like guaranteed lay-up touches - and now you left your teammates scrambling to clean up your mess because they all expected your challenge to work and send the ball downfield.

Sometimes I get trash teammates in Diamond who seem like they came straight out of Gold. Most of the time though it feels like a consistency issue.
        It’s like they don’t understand that you need someone protecting the goal. 

I always say “got it” or “defending” etc before each match or new start but does anyone acknowledge it? Nope. It’s just a free for all and then we lose.
            Does my head in when they’re on a break away and you jockey their players into a really poor position and they still score all because your teammate wanted 100 boost rather than 85
                Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
                    YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
                        Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
                            Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
            You need to rotate and read the game. Press high if you can and focus on where you should be in relation to your team *and* the other team. Your team doesn't need a permanent goalkeeper, they need an actual teammate and plenty of rotation.
                If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
            [deleted]
                This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
                    I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
                    Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
                        It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
                    PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
                        I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
                The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
                I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
            Yeah "I got it" never gets ackowledged. Honestly, I just started not going for kickoffs most of the time.
    What do you mean, I always get boost then go to defend... I think its dumb to not use that time to get boost if your the one back on spawn
        Communication is key. Quick chat your intentions. Problem is 99% of people don’t and they only want to score goals wether they win or lose.
        This.  If you prioritize getting the boost and getting back into position as quickly as possible, you'll be fine, unless your teammate *literally* misses the ball (and even then, half the time it goes off the crossbar because the opponent wasn't expecting that).

The problem is the people who assume that their teammate is going to WIN the kickoff, and start pushing up field immediately, only to watch the ball go sailing past them and straight into the goal.
            Yeah, exactly. There's a way to grab boost when your goal is safe. And people need to learn how to keep your nose upfield so you can track the ball while getting boost.
        Not in dubs. Always shadow center and be ready to contest.
            Yeah, I only defend on the kick off then shadow or vice versa if my rando team mate knows what’s up.
    I mean, hit the kickoff so it doesn't go straight on our goal so I can pick up a boost already.
    Grabs corner and mid boost on kickoff.
    [deleted]
        That’s not the issue. The issue is no one thinking “I should get back as it seems to be heading towards our goal”

They just hang up the other end waiting and even when it is down our end they dare not think about getting in the goal square. 

Once again, this isn’t everyone but is is most on casual.
    ... why would you stay goal for a defend on kickoff? That could instead be applied to whoever kicks off not having good kickoff control. 

If you can control the kick you have no need to have someone sit net
    Or getting boost on kickoff. You have plenty! Grab the little boost on the way to the goal. You’ll have like 40 boost, which is more than enough. Gotta save every last drop of that boost.
    The worst is when they go to get fucking boost, then you get beat on kick off and your teammate is no where to be found (even though they should still be at goal) and then they flame you for "giving up the goal".
        Them getting corner boost is fine 99% unless you completely miss your kickoff.
            I was in a game the other night, went for corner boost after saying "Go For It!" "Need Boost!" Both other guys whiffed the faceoff and I get "What a saved"
            IMO its just safer to wait to get that boost until after the kickoff. Mistakes happen
        Should be at goal? Why should THEY have to position preemptively for your failure? How is it a good move for them to play as if they expect you to fail? 

Have confidence and trust in your teammates and position accordingly. You will find more openings, better response times and better teamwork goals. You will learn to read faster and react more accurately. You will notice positionally the enemy, the ball and your teammate and react to the most likely outcome more accurately as time goes on. To assume automatically that they will fail will result in you outpositioned when they succeed, putting your teammate out on a limb on their own, potentially leading to an outnumbered counterattack against you. 


No, they should not have been ‘in goal’
    Oh my god, THIS. I swear, it's 50-50 as to whether the guy at goal leaves the goal open or stays. It's so incredibly frustrating to watch the opposing team make easy goals because people are apparently allergic to *staying on defense* for more than a few seconds.
Man i became a plat last week, those people are more toxic than Chernobyl
    Dude I got to plat III div IV and I've been sitting there for a few weeks with my diamond I buddies who got me to where I am legitimately. The toxicity is so much more fine tuned when I make simple mistakes just because I take a week or two off and I'm a little rusty. Luckily the shit talk isn't nearly as immature or as frequent but they know the finer details of your skills so the insults get more personal. Hard to want to play this game without my team.
    Diamond is no different too
        I think Diamond I is the worst place to be. Platinum is fine up until Plat 3, Div3-4 then it gets really toxic. You got down 2 points and your teammate wants to FF when there's 4 minutes left to play. It's mad annoying.
i learned how to stay in my lane through the pains of silver & gold. same cant be said about the guys that got carried into plat that im being matched with...
    Trust me, there’s people at every rank that shouldn’t be there, even in high c3 they sometimes seem like plat
        Same things happen in bronze.
            i have a question, how tf do you get to Bronze I
                I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
                    This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
                        I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
                    Wow that perfectly describes me rn
                        You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
                    My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
                    I'm g3 by just doing that lol
                I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
        I got ranked in Plat for some reason in Hoops and Singles when I’m only Silver 3 in doubles. Did NOT have a good time.
            You’ll get there eventually just keep practicing and do free play a lot
Dude what is this? It was like a switch flipped. I had teammates just start spamming what a save and help the other team the rest of the game. Two games in a row!
    That or as soon as the other team is ahead by 1 goal with 3 minutes left, they huff and try to forfeit, leave or just stay inactive for the rest of the game.
I watched Lethamyr's series of Bronze to Top rank and started playing super chill and let the other player score. Won 7 in a row. Went from Plat 1 Div 1 to Div 3
This is any rank followed by III.
Where do i find the teammates that actually care about improving?
PLAT 1 3s/PLAT 3 RUMBLE PLAYER HERE. 

SO MANY KICKOFF GOALS SCORED AGAINST ME BECAUSE MY ASSCLOWN TEAMMATES VALUE CORNER BOOST MORE THAN OH, I DON’T KNOW, PREVENTING THE BALL FROM GOING INTO OUR NET

ALSO 1/3 OF MY TEAMMATES ARE BALLCHASERS WHO GIVE UP POSSESSION ON EVERY POINTLESS HIT SO I SPEND ALL DAY COUNTERING BOOMER CLEARS

I AINT MAD IM JUST DISAPPOINTED
    Maybe ask yourself How is the ball going straight in the net on my kickoff?
        Lol no. If I lose kickoff the ball is by definition going to be traveling toward our net. It can bounce off the wall into the net. It can fly up in the air and come down into the net. It can get stalled in the middle of the field and have another opposing player kick it straight into the net. The possibilities are endless when there’s NO GODDAMN GOALIE.
            [deleted]
                “Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
                    He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
                        Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
My feeling was that high gold was worse.
Amen!!!
Times like that are a good excuse to take a break from 2/3s and work on your 1s.
"No. What matters is ME! LOOK AT ME I CAN DO FANCY THINGS WITH THE BALL AND FUCK YOU"

Basically everything above plat
Yes, I think plat has gotten worse since last season too. Maybe its just me but there are some BAD players and some toxic babies.
I am plat in normal modes and champion in rumble and I can assure you champion is much worse especially champion 2. Like half of the games your teammates will or even the opponents will spam what a safe and that kinda stuff. It does kinda help with your confidence as at some point you will just ignore everything everyone says
Plat is honestly one of the least toxic ranks out there in my experience, at least in EU. Both gold and diamond(so far, have played like 30 matches in diamond 1) are more toxic.
Get ready they never actually stop appearing in your games! Even at GC level they still appear!
Get a billion cusses thrown at you for missing the ball by a centimeter.
This speaks to me. I’m plat 2ish and generally find myself being the only defense in matches. Sometimes I push forward to participate in the action but we end up all committing and getting screwed on counters. Guess pushing up isn’t the path to Diamond.
    My rule always was if you are the best player on your team play mid to back, facilitate with passes, and only fully commit if you feel there is a high probability of scoring.

If you take up an air dribble, screw up, or get stuffed you can guarantee no one on your team will be there to stop an easy counter goal.

In contrast, if you see carmello go up and fail his 17th attempted ceiling shot, you can sometime score goals but almost always shut down the counter offense to allow carmello to immediately turn the ball over again
        Absolutely. It's clearly in my own best interests to believe this but I regularly have the lowest score in games we win because I just big chill waiting for a mistake from one side or the other. More often than not my teammates are humping each other and the ball so closely up and down the field it's the only real option.
        I hear that, most of my goals are garbage clean up goals but a goal is a goal and I don’t care.

The times when I do finally get paired up with some quality teammates can give me a chance at proper cycling and getting a balanced score sheet. Those moments are when I wish I virtual high five/hug button was available. I love playing with those folks.
Good way to coast through platinum then find yourself getting stomped in diamond without the skill/speed to respond in any play. You need to jump to learn how to fly.
    V true. I’m in diamond and I feel like none of my teammates ever leave the ground.
Bruh, this is my strat from day 1. You don't need to fly, just defend and counter attack.

(you actually need to fly later on tho)
    Definitely, this is generally how I finally got to Plat. And did it pretty easily too after a few years of been stuck in gold 2.
[removed]
    Just embrace the incoming losses. I’ve been playing casually for two or so years and I still lose rather often but I don’t think much of it. I just play to have fun. If anyone in game tells you otherwise they can buzz off
        I love it when I’m beating someone in singles and they tell me I’m trash. Or to stop bumping.
Idk what your MMR is in Casual but mine is high enough I regularly get matched with Plat and Diamond, occasionally Champ. It's really not that big of a difference from high Gold. (Amount of people flying )
    Yeah it mostly translates as smarter placement and less whiffing as you climb the ranks. Some people have an idealized, unrealistic image of GC players in their head and are quick to trash talk us when we do the tiniest mistakes and fail to carry them with a gc title equipped.
That's me rn, an airplane which barely knows how to takeoff from runway and then proceeds to miss the ball entirely.
    Paper airplane. It gets thrown and then it’s upon fate where it lands
[deleted]
    I'm Est.2015 and I just hit plat for the first time a couple days ago lol
        Me too! With 270 hours to my name
            Haha. I'm at 285 hours and I started 6 months ago... Trying to hit diamond this season
                285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
                    Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
            I'm over 430 hours so you def pick it up better than I do haha
            149, touched diamond briefly, for 2 or so games. Then got rightly smacked back down to plat 2 where I feel like I belong :p
        I'm plat 2 and started playing at the beginning of the year.
    I’m diamond in the standard ranks, but plat in some of the extra modes like hoops. Some of these plat ranks are far from legitimate. I’ve had teammates in hoops who literally can’t aerial and end the game in single-digit points. It looks like Psyonix is trying to appease the new players to keep them coming back.
        Extra modes just rank you higher than other ranks usually. I got diamond in rumble fairly easily when I was still high gold
            I know that has always been the case, but it’s extra suspect and super inconsistent right now. As a solo queuer, I can have a teammate with a green ‘champion tournament winner’ title or someone who clearly has only been playing for a month. It’s a nightmare.
                in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
                Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
                Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
                    Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
            It's because fewer people play extras, right? I'd imagine that ends up slide-scaling the ranks a bit.
            Yeah I managed to get up into Plat on rumble before I was even solidly gold in 3s, and I'm still floating around the top of Silver in 2s. Is it just because the fewer ranked players in those modes?
        I believe that’s to blame from the new ranks. Was a c2 and for a good month couldn’t get out of D1/2 because of GCs and C3s. Now I’m C2 again
        Yeah on me and my friends epic account we placed plat 1 besides the fact we're both gold players in reality. We got lost our final 3 placements in plat lobbies too and it still placed us there
    Not that long ago I spent a half-dozen glorious games at Diamond 1. Then, before I knew it...Gold 3 and what just happened?
    Yeah I've probably played a little too much haha. I started end of Oct and put in around 70 hours by the time I got to Plat II. I think ranking up is gonna slow down quite a bit for me now though because it's feeling tough. I go up a division, then down a division constantly
        god damn that's amazing only 70 hours and plat 2? I am around like 30 hours and stuck in gold1-silver3 how do you get better?
            [deleted]
                My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
            [deleted]
                thnx I needed that
                3½k, also still plat;)
            He could have good teammates that he plays with, which helps tremendously
                Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
                Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
                    Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
            Rotate. 

Learn where to be. 

Anticipate where the ball is going. 

Play a little more defensively while the other 2 ball chase.

I'm champ 2 and can't do any of that crazy off the ceiling, aerial ballet twirly shit you see.
                This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
            I responded to someone below with how I play too if it helps. I started Silver 2 after the unranked thingy and I think naturally I didn't ball chase from the start. I tend to pick positions based on how my teammates are because I play with just randoms online. I play a little more conservative too, sitting back and clearing, moreso in Plat as I'm still new to this rank.  As I improve in each rank, I want to reduce that and give those clearances direction or turn them into offensive runs. At least in Gold if I did, I'd push up but follow the ball width ways trying to predict the angle the ball is going. One of the things I try to do more often is to centre balls too by taking it up the side and knocking it central - you can assist a lot that way and it's not difficult to learn

The other thing is I've probably watched a lot of YouTube videos and changed my settings from the start to the ones Squishy uses

I'd say look at your positioning, try and reduce ball chasing and instead pick your angles to hit better balls. The best teams you can play with are those who rotate fluidly and you can rely on them to take turns sitting back. Plus not trying to hit every ball you/they can for the sake of it. Pick your 50/50s
                thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
        Plat 2 after 70 hours is pretty great. I'm Plat 1 at 500 hours.
        Yeah that's because the algorithm still isn't sure where to place you. You lose a lot but also gain a lot. It's going to be a whole lot harder to rank up after your MMR stabilizes. From changing divs or entire ranks with each game, you'll now be needing 3 wins in a row to div up.
    [deleted]
        Yeah I was struggling to get past gold 3 last season, I jumped on yesterday and I got to plat 2 without feeling like the skill level was any higher than last season’s gold 2
        Well, now me hitting diamond for the first time doesn't seem as big a deal.
            Diamond in standard has been its own special kind of hell. High champs got pushed to low champ and low champs got pushed into diamond. Your diamond is actually still good. It’s the peak of the bell curve (e.g., gold/plat) that is extra iffy right now.
            I don't think this is particularly true, I was d2 before f2p and I still am. Still feels like d2. Maybe there was a big squeeze below that, but without some data it doesn't feel like it
    Haha same ikr

Meanwhile my friend started f2p and he's also plat
    I started bit less than 2 weeks ago and orginally placed in silver and finally managed to hit plat yesterday. I'm extremely competitive and spent most of my time just doing basic shooting training packs or free play to improve my mechanics. Also i already have 50 hours played.

It mostly depends on how you playe the game. Most people just play casually i usually play to improve
I feel you, I'm at the same spot lol
I’m at 320 hours and I have been playing since 2018 and I just got to plat 1. Fuck me.
I’ve had it for a year and I can’t even do aerials consistently. Only been online for 1-2 months but still.
Lol. There is only 1 god, and his name is training pack
Here I am just chilling in plat 3 because I've reached my ceiling lol. So much toxicity every other game.
    Dude, I've been clawing up and down plat two div's1-4 for the past year haha There are way too many holes in my game for diamond sadly
        You'd be surprised tbh. Honestly I felt like I was stalled at plat. Literally put hundreds of hours into the game at that rank and didn't improve, just kept occillating between high p3 and low p2. I'm d2 currently and honestly it's really just small things and rotation that got me unstuck. I think I bought into the advice to "learn a complicated mechanic to get better" that content creators often push. And honestly that made me waste so much time. Its like telling a middle schooler to try doing integral calculus to get better at algebra.
When I first started playing rocket league, only diamonds or above could ariel regularly.

Now we got silvers who are better than me at it lmao.
    Same, except I stayed in bronze because I only played 1v1s.
        1v1s are so different tho, it's about limiting you mistakes and always being in a position to recover from one.
I definitely play competitive until I start losing more often (aka get too drunk) and realize I should go to casual lol

Tell people to stop being a perma-goalie. That's something you grow out of real fast as you get better. People who perma-goalie are going nowhere fast.

If you wanna motivate them to play a bit more, rotate in behind them and give them a love tap from behind to tell them to go ahead. Other than that, just expect to lose those games and move on secure in the knowledge that you'll rise in ranks and they'll probably stay where they are.
Yup I play 2s and have always been a better setup man than scorer. I can win the balls in the corner, stir shit up and send it to net pretty well. I’m not great but I’m not horrible, and I like the 2v2 strategy and geometry. 

Can’t tell you how many games I’ve had probably 4-5 perfect tap in goal setups go unrewarded because my teammate was in the defensive 1/3 of the field sitting motionless. 

Then without fail the first time I’m clearly beat and have no shot to win the loose ball he aerials, sails 20 feet over and wide of the ball and the other team gets a breakaway goal. 

Or when I’m possessing in the offensive corner he crashes in at max speed hitting me and the ball sending us both flying and the ball centered for a perfect pass going the other way. It’s so rare when I get paired with someone who just plays smart and predictably. 

Also there’s a huge correlation between people that sit in goal for 90% of the game and people who can’t save a medium strength shot coming directly at them. Sigh.
hahaha
Ah, the good ol' days
Learning and practicing rotations will get you deep into plat. Also having people to play with that are a few ranks higher will help lol
    my rotations are decent actually, I just lack any mechanical skill whatsoever, but thanks for the advice
they fly as well as a pickup truck driving off a cliff tho
silvers dont fly. they fall with style
Ya but the main point is they're flying to just make contact. Plat is where people kind of start to get the hang of taking shots and actually maneuvering in the air
that's not very nice of you
    nice save!
damn dude you're awesome
they still flying though and it's kinda intimidating
No one is saying plat is a high rank man. But we get it, you're good
and drive towards ball and boost like locked on missiles
    And scream like a banshee
        RHEEEEEEE

This is the way
            I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
                If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
                    This is the reason
                        You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                            It's okay. I like you
                    The reason being your teammates suck!
    Locked on missiles doesn't miss their target every single time.
        Locked on to position of ball t-1 second

    How dare you not playing like a pro right away?!
    People tend to forget how they got there once they're at a high level in anything. It's especially frustrating with math teachers.
    You got it. The only way to learn is just to go for it every chance you get. We were all there at one point.
    freeplay to learn what certain buttons do while in the air, different ways to take off, and other movement basics. 

After you have a decent understanding of controls, transition to the rookie aerial training, if needed go back to freeplay to practice certain movements that  didnt work in the rookie training. 

Try out pro aerial training once you're okay at the rookie stuff, additionally; apply what you learned in real games. Repeat with all-star aerials once you're half-decent at pro.

Enjoy the skies!
        Thank you!
        This. Freeplay is your best friend. If you have RL on steam, use workshop to get maps like dribbling practice and the obstacle course for flight training. That's probably a little more advanced, but freeplay freeplay freeplay! Look up YouTube videos to learn how to practice in freeplay though.
    Don't fly in silver, focus on the basics first. I'm in gold and still only go in the air to hit a ball away from my goal or when I get a perfect pass.

I still focus on hitting with power, rotations and defense. Fancy shit is for higher ranks man.
Bold of you to assume they hit the ball.
There are some who call me.. Tim
    DEATH AWAITS YOU ALL!
Well I would be you since I just took your joke to the logical conclusion
hi
Shit half the time our cars dont work either.
It gets so much worse g.
I'm champ 1-3 in most modes and GC in rumble. I am "good" relative to most players. I've been at that skill level for well over a year now. What prevents me from getting better? Motivation to practice. I'm a very casual player. I just want to launch the game and play a few matches.
    [removed]
        Can confirm, am at the same point and basically now I want to focus on better freestyle control, but for that I'mma have to put hours and hours into training each week.
            Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
    I've been playing for 5 years and I can honestly say the only thing thats improved over the past three years is my decision making
        Arguably one of the most important skills in this game though (maybe unpopular opinion?). Game sense and decision making just take time to learn, you can’t sweat it out like mechanics practise.
        Sounds about right
    [deleted]
        I’m the same. You simply need to research & train to get much better than that.
For any skill based game there exists walls and soft limits to each players ability. For instance in chess players will run into walls that take months or even years to climb. The same applies to rocket league of course. For some people they can get to plat in a single month, while others play in bronze/silver for years. You get what you put into the game. But at the higher end progression slows for everyone. No matter the effort you put in climbing becomes slow or even non existant. There is a soft cap so to speak. For me i got to plat in a month or 2. Then diamond after a year. And this is where im comftorable playing at. To get stronger would require more effort than i want or care to put in.
So my teammates and I just passed through plat this season to low diamond and the number of people attempting the technical stuff has dropped off massively in favour of standard but more effective plays.
    I thinks that's probs more due to the rank adjusting cause of free to play. Give it a few months and it'll stabalise.
        Nah I would guess that they can get away with it in plat because the pace allows them to try fancy moves without issue. In diamond I’m sure it’s just too fast comparatively to go for the fancy option in place of the smart/faster but boring play
Lethamyr is currently doing a Road to SSL series where he only supports the team and scores as little as possible, trying to be as less flashy as possible. So far he's been coasting his way up to Gold 3 with strong basics, strong positioning, and boost management. I'm sure it'll be the same up to Champ 1, where well have to begin trying a little.

Everyone should check that series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMxCAPcJijYOVBcDbanPmqgO4jWb-2XZl
You play a lot of silvers, huh?
Or those players that are mechanical gods but can’t rotate for shit, so they’ll just ball chase the whole time and spam “scoreboard” and “tm8 sucks” in chat
    [deleted]
        whats a sweat? I,ve played since the game was released and never heard that in chat once.
            A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
                I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
                    Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
                    It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
                        Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
                        Err, I play to have fun?
                            Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
                    I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
                        Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
                    Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
                        I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                            This is the way.
                            I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
                    But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
                    Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
                    Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
                    If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
                        Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                            Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
                so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
        "If I'm the sweat you're the armpit salt stain."
    I try to be good about rotating and not cramping my teammates' style, but then they never rotate and either yell at me for not following through on their unpredictable setups, or just steal the ball from me when I try to set a play up :(
        That's cause your gold :P.
I used to be u and pushed past soley by being goalie/midfielder so i always had the lowest score but we won much more. It get better in plat 3/diamond+
    I love shitting on people on the other team who are shitting on their team mate.

>"Tm8 is trash"

Just a casual *"maybe it is you that is the problem"* or a "nah actually he's better than you" and everyone loses their minds lol

I mean they're only saying that to try to save face to us.
    I just played a plat tournament with my gold 3 friends (i’m plat 2) and we made them forfeit because we destroyed them 6-0 in the first 2 minutes, they triple committed every time and it was just hilarious
    Those players that whiff a challenge so hard they float away while the other team scores an easy 2v1 goal on you, then have the audacity to ragequit from getting scored on.

It happened me 3 times in a row the other day, from 3 different "players". I had to turn the game off and contemplate my entire existence for the rest of the night.
    I hate to say it but I was one of those guys. Except for the scoreboard and tm8 sucks. But still fuck those guys.
    Brooooo. This right here.  Lol can't tell you how many times we will be winning,  but some dude on the other team gets an air dribble double tap and just spams "what a save!"
    Goes both ways really. Plenty of players spamming about rotations when they're too far behind the play (or worse sat inside the goal when the ball is in the opponent's half)
Its a response,  they are attacking you because they are insecure and think when they screw up everyone is being just as harsh in their minds, judging them, so the retaliate in kind.
Just mute everyone. It's so easy that way. Im actually scared to touch plat after a while.
mess ups on saves at least in my experience happen roughly 10 seconds before the actual goals happen
Happens in competitive every fucking time, too
    Just FYI, at higher ranks sitting in the goal is considered the bad play here
        I would say that because matches/lobbies are so short people dont have a way to constructively educate each other in game on the shift in *what is the "bad play"* as you move up in ranks. It leads to a large amount of perceived toxicity because everyone just has a few seconds between plays or after to say "hey do or dont do X", which is rarely helpful without mountains of context. 

This entire game is an ever changing series of flow charts.

is this the situation, yes or no, if yes then do A, if no then do B.

people learn a certain flow chart and get comfy thinking they are playing correctly without realizing that the flow chart changes every few ranks and even if you do realize it can still be hard to change habits.
            I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
                If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
                    Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
                        This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                            Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
                That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
                    Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
                    I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
                        !@#$
                It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
                    I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
        Who doesn't love trying to score a goal 1 v 3 in standard while *both* your teammates decide to sit in their own goal? Can't stand how passively some people play.
            Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
                I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
                    How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
                        They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                            Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
                Grow up buddy
        I'm only plat but because of that I know exactly what he means. 

The people in this rank don't go right or left they drive at you. So whichever way the ball goes 99/100 we're conceding unless we manage some crazy recovery. Or even better sometimes the ball goes to the side wall and they drive through you and put you both out of the game.
    Corner fucking boost. And then they grab the side boost leaving you stranded post kick off and blame you when the other team scores
        This has only started happening to me at plat. 

Doesn't it look super Uber omg cool when the same guy who took both corner and mid drives at the ball in the corner and smacks it that hard at the opponent's back board that you have to try and use the 36 boost you managed to collect in a 1v2 cos your team mate is on his roof somewhere?
            This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
                > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
                    It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
                        One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                            Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
                        I do it instinctively now.
                Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
            You described me in bronze

...hold up...
You’ll learn quickly that people lack any basic game sense. You can honestly score 10 goals a game in diamond if people were competent enough to understand how to position themselves for a counter attack.
    If they were competent enough to understanding proper positioning... they wouldn’t be in Diamond anymore.
        This is the thing when people flame you for doing rather simple mistakes or don't understand these concepts.

Bitch if I did, I wouldn't be playing in your ranks
            In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
                Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
                HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
                    Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
                I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
                    Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
                        yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                            In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
                        Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
                        This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
                        This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
                You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
            people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
                My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
                    Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
                        Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                            Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
                        sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
            Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
                That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
                Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
        Diamond has a huge variation in skill. That’s why pros hate it lol
            Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
                People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
            If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
            What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
        Many in Diamond *do* understand proper positioning. The biggest issue I found throughout Diamond is the [in]consistency. You know where  to be, where you fucked up, and how you could've done it better. Then you just keep whiffing some stupid aerials or challenges that you know you shouldn't have whiffed - that were like guaranteed lay-up touches - and now you left your teammates scrambling to clean up your mess because they all expected your challenge to work and send the ball downfield.

Sometimes I get trash teammates in Diamond who seem like they came straight out of Gold. Most of the time though it feels like a consistency issue.
    It’s like they don’t understand that you need someone protecting the goal. 

I always say “got it” or “defending” etc before each match or new start but does anyone acknowledge it? Nope. It’s just a free for all and then we lose.
        Does my head in when they’re on a break away and you jockey their players into a really poor position and they still score all because your teammate wanted 100 boost rather than 85
            Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
                YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
                    Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
                        Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
        You need to rotate and read the game. Press high if you can and focus on where you should be in relation to your team *and* the other team. Your team doesn't need a permanent goalkeeper, they need an actual teammate and plenty of rotation.
            If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
        [deleted]
            This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
                I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
                Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
                    It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
                PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
                    I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
            The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
            I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
        Yeah "I got it" never gets ackowledged. Honestly, I just started not going for kickoffs most of the time.
What do you mean, I always get boost then go to defend... I think its dumb to not use that time to get boost if your the one back on spawn
    Communication is key. Quick chat your intentions. Problem is 99% of people don’t and they only want to score goals wether they win or lose.
    This.  If you prioritize getting the boost and getting back into position as quickly as possible, you'll be fine, unless your teammate *literally* misses the ball (and even then, half the time it goes off the crossbar because the opponent wasn't expecting that).

The problem is the people who assume that their teammate is going to WIN the kickoff, and start pushing up field immediately, only to watch the ball go sailing past them and straight into the goal.
        Yeah, exactly. There's a way to grab boost when your goal is safe. And people need to learn how to keep your nose upfield so you can track the ball while getting boost.
    Not in dubs. Always shadow center and be ready to contest.
        Yeah, I only defend on the kick off then shadow or vice versa if my rando team mate knows what’s up.
I mean, hit the kickoff so it doesn't go straight on our goal so I can pick up a boost already.
Grabs corner and mid boost on kickoff.
[deleted]
    That’s not the issue. The issue is no one thinking “I should get back as it seems to be heading towards our goal”

They just hang up the other end waiting and even when it is down our end they dare not think about getting in the goal square. 

Once again, this isn’t everyone but is is most on casual.
... why would you stay goal for a defend on kickoff? That could instead be applied to whoever kicks off not having good kickoff control. 

If you can control the kick you have no need to have someone sit net
Or getting boost on kickoff. You have plenty! Grab the little boost on the way to the goal. You’ll have like 40 boost, which is more than enough. Gotta save every last drop of that boost.
The worst is when they go to get fucking boost, then you get beat on kick off and your teammate is no where to be found (even though they should still be at goal) and then they flame you for "giving up the goal".
    Them getting corner boost is fine 99% unless you completely miss your kickoff.
        I was in a game the other night, went for corner boost after saying "Go For It!" "Need Boost!" Both other guys whiffed the faceoff and I get "What a saved"
        IMO its just safer to wait to get that boost until after the kickoff. Mistakes happen
    Should be at goal? Why should THEY have to position preemptively for your failure? How is it a good move for them to play as if they expect you to fail? 

Have confidence and trust in your teammates and position accordingly. You will find more openings, better response times and better teamwork goals. You will learn to read faster and react more accurately. You will notice positionally the enemy, the ball and your teammate and react to the most likely outcome more accurately as time goes on. To assume automatically that they will fail will result in you outpositioned when they succeed, putting your teammate out on a limb on their own, potentially leading to an outnumbered counterattack against you. 


No, they should not have been ‘in goal’
Oh my god, THIS. I swear, it's 50-50 as to whether the guy at goal leaves the goal open or stays. It's so incredibly frustrating to watch the opposing team make easy goals because people are apparently allergic to *staying on defense* for more than a few seconds.
Dude I got to plat III div IV and I've been sitting there for a few weeks with my diamond I buddies who got me to where I am legitimately. The toxicity is so much more fine tuned when I make simple mistakes just because I take a week or two off and I'm a little rusty. Luckily the shit talk isn't nearly as immature or as frequent but they know the finer details of your skills so the insults get more personal. Hard to want to play this game without my team.
Diamond is no different too
    I think Diamond I is the worst place to be. Platinum is fine up until Plat 3, Div3-4 then it gets really toxic. You got down 2 points and your teammate wants to FF when there's 4 minutes left to play. It's mad annoying.
Trust me, there’s people at every rank that shouldn’t be there, even in high c3 they sometimes seem like plat
    Same things happen in bronze.
        i have a question, how tf do you get to Bronze I
            I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
                This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
                    I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
                Wow that perfectly describes me rn
                    You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
                My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
                I'm g3 by just doing that lol
            I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
    I got ranked in Plat for some reason in Hoops and Singles when I’m only Silver 3 in doubles. Did NOT have a good time.
        You’ll get there eventually just keep practicing and do free play a lot
That or as soon as the other team is ahead by 1 goal with 3 minutes left, they huff and try to forfeit, leave or just stay inactive for the rest of the game.
Maybe ask yourself How is the ball going straight in the net on my kickoff?
    Lol no. If I lose kickoff the ball is by definition going to be traveling toward our net. It can bounce off the wall into the net. It can fly up in the air and come down into the net. It can get stalled in the middle of the field and have another opposing player kick it straight into the net. The possibilities are endless when there’s NO GODDAMN GOALIE.
        [deleted]
            “Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
                He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
                    Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
My rule always was if you are the best player on your team play mid to back, facilitate with passes, and only fully commit if you feel there is a high probability of scoring.

If you take up an air dribble, screw up, or get stuffed you can guarantee no one on your team will be there to stop an easy counter goal.

In contrast, if you see carmello go up and fail his 17th attempted ceiling shot, you can sometime score goals but almost always shut down the counter offense to allow carmello to immediately turn the ball over again
    Absolutely. It's clearly in my own best interests to believe this but I regularly have the lowest score in games we win because I just big chill waiting for a mistake from one side or the other. More often than not my teammates are humping each other and the ball so closely up and down the field it's the only real option.
    I hear that, most of my goals are garbage clean up goals but a goal is a goal and I don’t care.

The times when I do finally get paired up with some quality teammates can give me a chance at proper cycling and getting a balanced score sheet. Those moments are when I wish I virtual high five/hug button was available. I love playing with those folks.
V true. I’m in diamond and I feel like none of my teammates ever leave the ground.
Definitely, this is generally how I finally got to Plat. And did it pretty easily too after a few years of been stuck in gold 2.
Just embrace the incoming losses. I’ve been playing casually for two or so years and I still lose rather often but I don’t think much of it. I just play to have fun. If anyone in game tells you otherwise they can buzz off
    I love it when I’m beating someone in singles and they tell me I’m trash. Or to stop bumping.
Yeah it mostly translates as smarter placement and less whiffing as you climb the ranks. Some people have an idealized, unrealistic image of GC players in their head and are quick to trash talk us when we do the tiniest mistakes and fail to carry them with a gc title equipped.
Paper airplane. It gets thrown and then it’s upon fate where it lands
I'm Est.2015 and I just hit plat for the first time a couple days ago lol
    Me too! With 270 hours to my name
        Haha. I'm at 285 hours and I started 6 months ago... Trying to hit diamond this season
            285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
                Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
        I'm over 430 hours so you def pick it up better than I do haha
        149, touched diamond briefly, for 2 or so games. Then got rightly smacked back down to plat 2 where I feel like I belong :p
    I'm plat 2 and started playing at the beginning of the year.
I’m diamond in the standard ranks, but plat in some of the extra modes like hoops. Some of these plat ranks are far from legitimate. I’ve had teammates in hoops who literally can’t aerial and end the game in single-digit points. It looks like Psyonix is trying to appease the new players to keep them coming back.
    Extra modes just rank you higher than other ranks usually. I got diamond in rumble fairly easily when I was still high gold
        I know that has always been the case, but it’s extra suspect and super inconsistent right now. As a solo queuer, I can have a teammate with a green ‘champion tournament winner’ title or someone who clearly has only been playing for a month. It’s a nightmare.
            in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
            Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
            Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
                Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
        It's because fewer people play extras, right? I'd imagine that ends up slide-scaling the ranks a bit.
        Yeah I managed to get up into Plat on rumble before I was even solidly gold in 3s, and I'm still floating around the top of Silver in 2s. Is it just because the fewer ranked players in those modes?
    I believe that’s to blame from the new ranks. Was a c2 and for a good month couldn’t get out of D1/2 because of GCs and C3s. Now I’m C2 again
    Yeah on me and my friends epic account we placed plat 1 besides the fact we're both gold players in reality. We got lost our final 3 placements in plat lobbies too and it still placed us there
Not that long ago I spent a half-dozen glorious games at Diamond 1. Then, before I knew it...Gold 3 and what just happened?
Yeah I've probably played a little too much haha. I started end of Oct and put in around 70 hours by the time I got to Plat II. I think ranking up is gonna slow down quite a bit for me now though because it's feeling tough. I go up a division, then down a division constantly
    god damn that's amazing only 70 hours and plat 2? I am around like 30 hours and stuck in gold1-silver3 how do you get better?
        [deleted]
            My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
        [deleted]
            thnx I needed that
            3½k, also still plat;)
        He could have good teammates that he plays with, which helps tremendously
            Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
            Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
                Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
        Rotate. 

Learn where to be. 

Anticipate where the ball is going. 

Play a little more defensively while the other 2 ball chase.

I'm champ 2 and can't do any of that crazy off the ceiling, aerial ballet twirly shit you see.
            This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
        I responded to someone below with how I play too if it helps. I started Silver 2 after the unranked thingy and I think naturally I didn't ball chase from the start. I tend to pick positions based on how my teammates are because I play with just randoms online. I play a little more conservative too, sitting back and clearing, moreso in Plat as I'm still new to this rank.  As I improve in each rank, I want to reduce that and give those clearances direction or turn them into offensive runs. At least in Gold if I did, I'd push up but follow the ball width ways trying to predict the angle the ball is going. One of the things I try to do more often is to centre balls too by taking it up the side and knocking it central - you can assist a lot that way and it's not difficult to learn

The other thing is I've probably watched a lot of YouTube videos and changed my settings from the start to the ones Squishy uses

I'd say look at your positioning, try and reduce ball chasing and instead pick your angles to hit better balls. The best teams you can play with are those who rotate fluidly and you can rely on them to take turns sitting back. Plus not trying to hit every ball you/they can for the sake of it. Pick your 50/50s
            thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
    Plat 2 after 70 hours is pretty great. I'm Plat 1 at 500 hours.
    Yeah that's because the algorithm still isn't sure where to place you. You lose a lot but also gain a lot. It's going to be a whole lot harder to rank up after your MMR stabilizes. From changing divs or entire ranks with each game, you'll now be needing 3 wins in a row to div up.
[deleted]
    Yeah I was struggling to get past gold 3 last season, I jumped on yesterday and I got to plat 2 without feeling like the skill level was any higher than last season’s gold 2
    Well, now me hitting diamond for the first time doesn't seem as big a deal.
        Diamond in standard has been its own special kind of hell. High champs got pushed to low champ and low champs got pushed into diamond. Your diamond is actually still good. It’s the peak of the bell curve (e.g., gold/plat) that is extra iffy right now.
        I don't think this is particularly true, I was d2 before f2p and I still am. Still feels like d2. Maybe there was a big squeeze below that, but without some data it doesn't feel like it
Haha same ikr

Meanwhile my friend started f2p and he's also plat
I started bit less than 2 weeks ago and orginally placed in silver and finally managed to hit plat yesterday. I'm extremely competitive and spent most of my time just doing basic shooting training packs or free play to improve my mechanics. Also i already have 50 hours played.

It mostly depends on how you playe the game. Most people just play casually i usually play to improve
Dude, I've been clawing up and down plat two div's1-4 for the past year haha There are way too many holes in my game for diamond sadly
    You'd be surprised tbh. Honestly I felt like I was stalled at plat. Literally put hundreds of hours into the game at that rank and didn't improve, just kept occillating between high p3 and low p2. I'm d2 currently and honestly it's really just small things and rotation that got me unstuck. I think I bought into the advice to "learn a complicated mechanic to get better" that content creators often push. And honestly that made me waste so much time. Its like telling a middle schooler to try doing integral calculus to get better at algebra.
Same, except I stayed in bronze because I only played 1v1s.
    1v1s are so different tho, it's about limiting you mistakes and always being in a position to recover from one.
my rotations are decent actually, I just lack any mechanical skill whatsoever, but thanks for the advice
nice save!
And scream like a banshee
    RHEEEEEEE

This is the way
        I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
            If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
                This is the reason
                    You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                        It's okay. I like you
                The reason being your teammates suck!
Locked on missiles doesn't miss their target every single time.
    Locked on to position of ball t-1 second
How dare you not playing like a pro right away?!
People tend to forget how they got there once they're at a high level in anything. It's especially frustrating with math teachers.
You got it. The only way to learn is just to go for it every chance you get. We were all there at one point.
freeplay to learn what certain buttons do while in the air, different ways to take off, and other movement basics. 

After you have a decent understanding of controls, transition to the rookie aerial training, if needed go back to freeplay to practice certain movements that  didnt work in the rookie training. 

Try out pro aerial training once you're okay at the rookie stuff, additionally; apply what you learned in real games. Repeat with all-star aerials once you're half-decent at pro.

Enjoy the skies!
    Thank you!
    This. Freeplay is your best friend. If you have RL on steam, use workshop to get maps like dribbling practice and the obstacle course for flight training. That's probably a little more advanced, but freeplay freeplay freeplay! Look up YouTube videos to learn how to practice in freeplay though.
Don't fly in silver, focus on the basics first. I'm in gold and still only go in the air to hit a ball away from my goal or when I get a perfect pass.

I still focus on hitting with power, rotations and defense. Fancy shit is for higher ranks man.
DEATH AWAITS YOU ALL!
[removed]
    Can confirm, am at the same point and basically now I want to focus on better freestyle control, but for that I'mma have to put hours and hours into training each week.
        Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
I've been playing for 5 years and I can honestly say the only thing thats improved over the past three years is my decision making
    Arguably one of the most important skills in this game though (maybe unpopular opinion?). Game sense and decision making just take time to learn, you can’t sweat it out like mechanics practise.
    Sounds about right
[deleted]
    I’m the same. You simply need to research & train to get much better than that.
I thinks that's probs more due to the rank adjusting cause of free to play. Give it a few months and it'll stabalise.
    Nah I would guess that they can get away with it in plat because the pace allows them to try fancy moves without issue. In diamond I’m sure it’s just too fast comparatively to go for the fancy option in place of the smart/faster but boring play
[deleted]
    whats a sweat? I,ve played since the game was released and never heard that in chat once.
        A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
            I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
                Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
                It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
                    Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
                    Err, I play to have fun?
                        Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
                I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
                    Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
                Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
                    I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                        This is the way.
                        I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
                But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
                Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
                Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
                If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
                    Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                        Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
            so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
    "If I'm the sweat you're the armpit salt stain."
I try to be good about rotating and not cramping my teammates' style, but then they never rotate and either yell at me for not following through on their unpredictable setups, or just steal the ball from me when I try to set a play up :(
    That's cause your gold :P.
I used to be u and pushed past soley by being goalie/midfielder so i always had the lowest score but we won much more. It get better in plat 3/diamond+
I love shitting on people on the other team who are shitting on their team mate.

>"Tm8 is trash"

Just a casual *"maybe it is you that is the problem"* or a "nah actually he's better than you" and everyone loses their minds lol

I mean they're only saying that to try to save face to us.
I just played a plat tournament with my gold 3 friends (i’m plat 2) and we made them forfeit because we destroyed them 6-0 in the first 2 minutes, they triple committed every time and it was just hilarious
Those players that whiff a challenge so hard they float away while the other team scores an easy 2v1 goal on you, then have the audacity to ragequit from getting scored on.

It happened me 3 times in a row the other day, from 3 different "players". I had to turn the game off and contemplate my entire existence for the rest of the night.
I hate to say it but I was one of those guys. Except for the scoreboard and tm8 sucks. But still fuck those guys.
Brooooo. This right here.  Lol can't tell you how many times we will be winning,  but some dude on the other team gets an air dribble double tap and just spams "what a save!"
Goes both ways really. Plenty of players spamming about rotations when they're too far behind the play (or worse sat inside the goal when the ball is in the opponent's half)
Just FYI, at higher ranks sitting in the goal is considered the bad play here
    I would say that because matches/lobbies are so short people dont have a way to constructively educate each other in game on the shift in *what is the "bad play"* as you move up in ranks. It leads to a large amount of perceived toxicity because everyone just has a few seconds between plays or after to say "hey do or dont do X", which is rarely helpful without mountains of context. 

This entire game is an ever changing series of flow charts.

is this the situation, yes or no, if yes then do A, if no then do B.

people learn a certain flow chart and get comfy thinking they are playing correctly without realizing that the flow chart changes every few ranks and even if you do realize it can still be hard to change habits.
        I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
            If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
                Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
                    This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                        Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
            That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
                Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
                I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
                    !@#$
            It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
                I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
    Who doesn't love trying to score a goal 1 v 3 in standard while *both* your teammates decide to sit in their own goal? Can't stand how passively some people play.
        Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
            I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
                How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
                    They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                        Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
            Grow up buddy
    I'm only plat but because of that I know exactly what he means. 

The people in this rank don't go right or left they drive at you. So whichever way the ball goes 99/100 we're conceding unless we manage some crazy recovery. Or even better sometimes the ball goes to the side wall and they drive through you and put you both out of the game.
Corner fucking boost. And then they grab the side boost leaving you stranded post kick off and blame you when the other team scores
    This has only started happening to me at plat. 

Doesn't it look super Uber omg cool when the same guy who took both corner and mid drives at the ball in the corner and smacks it that hard at the opponent's back board that you have to try and use the 36 boost you managed to collect in a 1v2 cos your team mate is on his roof somewhere?
        This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
            > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
                It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
                    One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                        Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
                    I do it instinctively now.
            Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
        You described me in bronze

...hold up...
If they were competent enough to understanding proper positioning... they wouldn’t be in Diamond anymore.
    This is the thing when people flame you for doing rather simple mistakes or don't understand these concepts.

Bitch if I did, I wouldn't be playing in your ranks
        In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
            Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
            HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
                Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
            I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
                Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
                    yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                        In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
                    Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
                    This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
                    This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
            You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
        people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
            My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
                Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
                    Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                        Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
                    sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
        Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
            That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
            Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
    Diamond has a huge variation in skill. That’s why pros hate it lol
        Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
            People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
        If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
        What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
    Many in Diamond *do* understand proper positioning. The biggest issue I found throughout Diamond is the [in]consistency. You know where  to be, where you fucked up, and how you could've done it better. Then you just keep whiffing some stupid aerials or challenges that you know you shouldn't have whiffed - that were like guaranteed lay-up touches - and now you left your teammates scrambling to clean up your mess because they all expected your challenge to work and send the ball downfield.

Sometimes I get trash teammates in Diamond who seem like they came straight out of Gold. Most of the time though it feels like a consistency issue.
It’s like they don’t understand that you need someone protecting the goal. 

I always say “got it” or “defending” etc before each match or new start but does anyone acknowledge it? Nope. It’s just a free for all and then we lose.
    Does my head in when they’re on a break away and you jockey their players into a really poor position and they still score all because your teammate wanted 100 boost rather than 85
        Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
            YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
                Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
                    Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
    You need to rotate and read the game. Press high if you can and focus on where you should be in relation to your team *and* the other team. Your team doesn't need a permanent goalkeeper, they need an actual teammate and plenty of rotation.
        If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
    [deleted]
        This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
            I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
            Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
                It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
            PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
                I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
        The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
        I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
    Yeah "I got it" never gets ackowledged. Honestly, I just started not going for kickoffs most of the time.
Communication is key. Quick chat your intentions. Problem is 99% of people don’t and they only want to score goals wether they win or lose.
This.  If you prioritize getting the boost and getting back into position as quickly as possible, you'll be fine, unless your teammate *literally* misses the ball (and even then, half the time it goes off the crossbar because the opponent wasn't expecting that).

The problem is the people who assume that their teammate is going to WIN the kickoff, and start pushing up field immediately, only to watch the ball go sailing past them and straight into the goal.
    Yeah, exactly. There's a way to grab boost when your goal is safe. And people need to learn how to keep your nose upfield so you can track the ball while getting boost.
Not in dubs. Always shadow center and be ready to contest.
    Yeah, I only defend on the kick off then shadow or vice versa if my rando team mate knows what’s up.
That’s not the issue. The issue is no one thinking “I should get back as it seems to be heading towards our goal”

They just hang up the other end waiting and even when it is down our end they dare not think about getting in the goal square. 

Once again, this isn’t everyone but is is most on casual.
Them getting corner boost is fine 99% unless you completely miss your kickoff.
    I was in a game the other night, went for corner boost after saying "Go For It!" "Need Boost!" Both other guys whiffed the faceoff and I get "What a saved"
    IMO its just safer to wait to get that boost until after the kickoff. Mistakes happen
Should be at goal? Why should THEY have to position preemptively for your failure? How is it a good move for them to play as if they expect you to fail? 

Have confidence and trust in your teammates and position accordingly. You will find more openings, better response times and better teamwork goals. You will learn to read faster and react more accurately. You will notice positionally the enemy, the ball and your teammate and react to the most likely outcome more accurately as time goes on. To assume automatically that they will fail will result in you outpositioned when they succeed, putting your teammate out on a limb on their own, potentially leading to an outnumbered counterattack against you. 


No, they should not have been ‘in goal’
I think Diamond I is the worst place to be. Platinum is fine up until Plat 3, Div3-4 then it gets really toxic. You got down 2 points and your teammate wants to FF when there's 4 minutes left to play. It's mad annoying.
Same things happen in bronze.
    i have a question, how tf do you get to Bronze I
        I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
            This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
                I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
            Wow that perfectly describes me rn
                You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
            My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
            I'm g3 by just doing that lol
        I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
I got ranked in Plat for some reason in Hoops and Singles when I’m only Silver 3 in doubles. Did NOT have a good time.
    You’ll get there eventually just keep practicing and do free play a lot
Lol no. If I lose kickoff the ball is by definition going to be traveling toward our net. It can bounce off the wall into the net. It can fly up in the air and come down into the net. It can get stalled in the middle of the field and have another opposing player kick it straight into the net. The possibilities are endless when there’s NO GODDAMN GOALIE.

        “Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
            He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
                Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
Absolutely. It's clearly in my own best interests to believe this but I regularly have the lowest score in games we win because I just big chill waiting for a mistake from one side or the other. More often than not my teammates are humping each other and the ball so closely up and down the field it's the only real option.
I hear that, most of my goals are garbage clean up goals but a goal is a goal and I don’t care.

The times when I do finally get paired up with some quality teammates can give me a chance at proper cycling and getting a balanced score sheet. Those moments are when I wish I virtual high five/hug button was available. I love playing with those folks.
I love it when I’m beating someone in singles and they tell me I’m trash. Or to stop bumping.
Me too! With 270 hours to my name
    Haha. I'm at 285 hours and I started 6 months ago... Trying to hit diamond this season
        285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
            Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
    I'm over 430 hours so you def pick it up better than I do haha
    149, touched diamond briefly, for 2 or so games. Then got rightly smacked back down to plat 2 where I feel like I belong :p
I'm plat 2 and started playing at the beginning of the year.
Extra modes just rank you higher than other ranks usually. I got diamond in rumble fairly easily when I was still high gold
    I know that has always been the case, but it’s extra suspect and super inconsistent right now. As a solo queuer, I can have a teammate with a green ‘champion tournament winner’ title or someone who clearly has only been playing for a month. It’s a nightmare.
        in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
        Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
        Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
            Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
    It's because fewer people play extras, right? I'd imagine that ends up slide-scaling the ranks a bit.
    Yeah I managed to get up into Plat on rumble before I was even solidly gold in 3s, and I'm still floating around the top of Silver in 2s. Is it just because the fewer ranked players in those modes?
I believe that’s to blame from the new ranks. Was a c2 and for a good month couldn’t get out of D1/2 because of GCs and C3s. Now I’m C2 again
Yeah on me and my friends epic account we placed plat 1 besides the fact we're both gold players in reality. We got lost our final 3 placements in plat lobbies too and it still placed us there
god damn that's amazing only 70 hours and plat 2? I am around like 30 hours and stuck in gold1-silver3 how do you get better?
    [deleted]
        My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
    [deleted]
        thnx I needed that
        3½k, also still plat;)
    He could have good teammates that he plays with, which helps tremendously
        Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
        Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
            Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
    Rotate. 

Learn where to be. 

Anticipate where the ball is going. 

Play a little more defensively while the other 2 ball chase.

I'm champ 2 and can't do any of that crazy off the ceiling, aerial ballet twirly shit you see.
        This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
    I responded to someone below with how I play too if it helps. I started Silver 2 after the unranked thingy and I think naturally I didn't ball chase from the start. I tend to pick positions based on how my teammates are because I play with just randoms online. I play a little more conservative too, sitting back and clearing, moreso in Plat as I'm still new to this rank.  As I improve in each rank, I want to reduce that and give those clearances direction or turn them into offensive runs. At least in Gold if I did, I'd push up but follow the ball width ways trying to predict the angle the ball is going. One of the things I try to do more often is to centre balls too by taking it up the side and knocking it central - you can assist a lot that way and it's not difficult to learn

The other thing is I've probably watched a lot of YouTube videos and changed my settings from the start to the ones Squishy uses

I'd say look at your positioning, try and reduce ball chasing and instead pick your angles to hit better balls. The best teams you can play with are those who rotate fluidly and you can rely on them to take turns sitting back. Plus not trying to hit every ball you/they can for the sake of it. Pick your 50/50s
        thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
Plat 2 after 70 hours is pretty great. I'm Plat 1 at 500 hours.
Yeah that's because the algorithm still isn't sure where to place you. You lose a lot but also gain a lot. It's going to be a whole lot harder to rank up after your MMR stabilizes. From changing divs or entire ranks with each game, you'll now be needing 3 wins in a row to div up.
Yeah I was struggling to get past gold 3 last season, I jumped on yesterday and I got to plat 2 without feeling like the skill level was any higher than last season’s gold 2
Well, now me hitting diamond for the first time doesn't seem as big a deal.
    Diamond in standard has been its own special kind of hell. High champs got pushed to low champ and low champs got pushed into diamond. Your diamond is actually still good. It’s the peak of the bell curve (e.g., gold/plat) that is extra iffy right now.
    I don't think this is particularly true, I was d2 before f2p and I still am. Still feels like d2. Maybe there was a big squeeze below that, but without some data it doesn't feel like it
You'd be surprised tbh. Honestly I felt like I was stalled at plat. Literally put hundreds of hours into the game at that rank and didn't improve, just kept occillating between high p3 and low p2. I'm d2 currently and honestly it's really just small things and rotation that got me unstuck. I think I bought into the advice to "learn a complicated mechanic to get better" that content creators often push. And honestly that made me waste so much time. Its like telling a middle schooler to try doing integral calculus to get better at algebra.
1v1s are so different tho, it's about limiting you mistakes and always being in a position to recover from one.
RHEEEEEEE

This is the way
    I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
        If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
            This is the reason
                You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                    It's okay. I like you
            The reason being your teammates suck!
Locked on to position of ball t-1 second
Thank you!
This. Freeplay is your best friend. If you have RL on steam, use workshop to get maps like dribbling practice and the obstacle course for flight training. That's probably a little more advanced, but freeplay freeplay freeplay! Look up YouTube videos to learn how to practice in freeplay though.
Can confirm, am at the same point and basically now I want to focus on better freestyle control, but for that I'mma have to put hours and hours into training each week.
    Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
Arguably one of the most important skills in this game though (maybe unpopular opinion?). Game sense and decision making just take time to learn, you can’t sweat it out like mechanics practise.
Sounds about right
I’m the same. You simply need to research & train to get much better than that.
Nah I would guess that they can get away with it in plat because the pace allows them to try fancy moves without issue. In diamond I’m sure it’s just too fast comparatively to go for the fancy option in place of the smart/faster but boring play
whats a sweat? I,ve played since the game was released and never heard that in chat once.
    A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
        I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
            Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
            It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
                Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
                Err, I play to have fun?
                    Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
            I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
                Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
            Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
                I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                    This is the way.
                    I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
            But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
            Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
            Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
            If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
                Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                    Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
        so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
"If I'm the sweat you're the armpit salt stain."
That's cause your gold :P.
I used to be u and pushed past soley by being goalie/midfielder so i always had the lowest score but we won much more. It get better in plat 3/diamond+
I would say that because matches/lobbies are so short people dont have a way to constructively educate each other in game on the shift in *what is the "bad play"* as you move up in ranks. It leads to a large amount of perceived toxicity because everyone just has a few seconds between plays or after to say "hey do or dont do X", which is rarely helpful without mountains of context. 

This entire game is an ever changing series of flow charts.

is this the situation, yes or no, if yes then do A, if no then do B.

people learn a certain flow chart and get comfy thinking they are playing correctly without realizing that the flow chart changes every few ranks and even if you do realize it can still be hard to change habits.
    I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
        If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
            Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
                This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                    Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
        That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
            Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
            I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
                !@#$
        It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
            I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
Who doesn't love trying to score a goal 1 v 3 in standard while *both* your teammates decide to sit in their own goal? Can't stand how passively some people play.
    Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
        I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
            How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
                They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                    Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
        Grow up buddy
I'm only plat but because of that I know exactly what he means. 

The people in this rank don't go right or left they drive at you. So whichever way the ball goes 99/100 we're conceding unless we manage some crazy recovery. Or even better sometimes the ball goes to the side wall and they drive through you and put you both out of the game.
This has only started happening to me at plat. 

Doesn't it look super Uber omg cool when the same guy who took both corner and mid drives at the ball in the corner and smacks it that hard at the opponent's back board that you have to try and use the 36 boost you managed to collect in a 1v2 cos your team mate is on his roof somewhere?
    This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
        > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
            It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
                One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                    Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
                I do it instinctively now.
        Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
    You described me in bronze

...hold up...
This is the thing when people flame you for doing rather simple mistakes or don't understand these concepts.

Bitch if I did, I wouldn't be playing in your ranks
    In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
        Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
        HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
            Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
        I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
            Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
                yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                    In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
                Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
                This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
                This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
        You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
    people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
        My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
            Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
                Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                    Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
                sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
    Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
        That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
        Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
Diamond has a huge variation in skill. That’s why pros hate it lol
    Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
        People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
    If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
    What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
Many in Diamond *do* understand proper positioning. The biggest issue I found throughout Diamond is the [in]consistency. You know where  to be, where you fucked up, and how you could've done it better. Then you just keep whiffing some stupid aerials or challenges that you know you shouldn't have whiffed - that were like guaranteed lay-up touches - and now you left your teammates scrambling to clean up your mess because they all expected your challenge to work and send the ball downfield.

Sometimes I get trash teammates in Diamond who seem like they came straight out of Gold. Most of the time though it feels like a consistency issue.
Does my head in when they’re on a break away and you jockey their players into a really poor position and they still score all because your teammate wanted 100 boost rather than 85
    Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
        YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
            Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
                Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
You need to rotate and read the game. Press high if you can and focus on where you should be in relation to your team *and* the other team. Your team doesn't need a permanent goalkeeper, they need an actual teammate and plenty of rotation.
    If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
[deleted]
    This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
        I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
        Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
            It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
        PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
            I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
    The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
    I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
Yeah "I got it" never gets ackowledged. Honestly, I just started not going for kickoffs most of the time.
Yeah, exactly. There's a way to grab boost when your goal is safe. And people need to learn how to keep your nose upfield so you can track the ball while getting boost.
Yeah, I only defend on the kick off then shadow or vice versa if my rando team mate knows what’s up.
I was in a game the other night, went for corner boost after saying "Go For It!" "Need Boost!" Both other guys whiffed the faceoff and I get "What a saved"
IMO its just safer to wait to get that boost until after the kickoff. Mistakes happen
i have a question, how tf do you get to Bronze I
    I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
        This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
            I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
        Wow that perfectly describes me rn
            You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
        My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
        I'm g3 by just doing that lol
    I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
You’ll get there eventually just keep practicing and do free play a lot

    “Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
        He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
            Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
Haha. I'm at 285 hours and I started 6 months ago... Trying to hit diamond this season
    285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
        Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
I'm over 430 hours so you def pick it up better than I do haha
149, touched diamond briefly, for 2 or so games. Then got rightly smacked back down to plat 2 where I feel like I belong :p
I know that has always been the case, but it’s extra suspect and super inconsistent right now. As a solo queuer, I can have a teammate with a green ‘champion tournament winner’ title or someone who clearly has only been playing for a month. It’s a nightmare.
    in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
    Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
    Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
        Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
It's because fewer people play extras, right? I'd imagine that ends up slide-scaling the ranks a bit.
Yeah I managed to get up into Plat on rumble before I was even solidly gold in 3s, and I'm still floating around the top of Silver in 2s. Is it just because the fewer ranked players in those modes?
[deleted]
    My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
[deleted]
    thnx I needed that
    3½k, also still plat;)
He could have good teammates that he plays with, which helps tremendously
    Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
    Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
        Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
Rotate. 

Learn where to be. 

Anticipate where the ball is going. 

Play a little more defensively while the other 2 ball chase.

I'm champ 2 and can't do any of that crazy off the ceiling, aerial ballet twirly shit you see.
    This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
I responded to someone below with how I play too if it helps. I started Silver 2 after the unranked thingy and I think naturally I didn't ball chase from the start. I tend to pick positions based on how my teammates are because I play with just randoms online. I play a little more conservative too, sitting back and clearing, moreso in Plat as I'm still new to this rank.  As I improve in each rank, I want to reduce that and give those clearances direction or turn them into offensive runs. At least in Gold if I did, I'd push up but follow the ball width ways trying to predict the angle the ball is going. One of the things I try to do more often is to centre balls too by taking it up the side and knocking it central - you can assist a lot that way and it's not difficult to learn

The other thing is I've probably watched a lot of YouTube videos and changed my settings from the start to the ones Squishy uses

I'd say look at your positioning, try and reduce ball chasing and instead pick your angles to hit better balls. The best teams you can play with are those who rotate fluidly and you can rely on them to take turns sitting back. Plus not trying to hit every ball you/they can for the sake of it. Pick your 50/50s
    thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
Diamond in standard has been its own special kind of hell. High champs got pushed to low champ and low champs got pushed into diamond. Your diamond is actually still good. It’s the peak of the bell curve (e.g., gold/plat) that is extra iffy right now.
I don't think this is particularly true, I was d2 before f2p and I still am. Still feels like d2. Maybe there was a big squeeze below that, but without some data it doesn't feel like it
I knew I was playing the game right! It’s my teammates that suck
    If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
        This is the reason
            You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
                It's okay. I like you
        The reason being your teammates suck!
Makes me glad that I am bad haha. I have never been so sucked in by a game, bought a controller a week ago just for rocket league! Been grinding and I'm plat 3 at the moment. It is honestly so fun learning new mechanics but also frustrating. (Speed flips=impossible) just wished there could be more time so I could do well in my studies whilst also grinding a rocket league! The esports scene for rl is so good too!
A term used in many games. Refering to a player who seem to be trying so hard that they are sweating.
    I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
        Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
        It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
            Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
            Err, I play to have fun?
                Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
        I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
            Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
        Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
            I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
                This is the way.
                I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
        But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
        Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
        Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
        If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
            Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
                Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
    so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
I 'm low level.

I often want to tell my teammates, "I'm going to cross the ball. Please be in position to take the shot. Don't follow me to the ball and try to cross it with me. Then we'll both be in the corner, and no one will be there to take the shot."

But I'm on console, so all I can say is "Centering!" 

That never works. Because, if the person is novice enough to follow their teammate to the opposing team's corner, they're not going to figure out what "Centering!" means.
    If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
        Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
            This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
                Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
    That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
        Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
        I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
            !@#$
    It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
        I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
Take the shot! Is my most spammed quick chat.

Edit: y'all really downvoting me for agreeing with the comment above that has like 40 upvotes...
    I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
        How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
            They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
                Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
    Grow up buddy
This happens in Silver too, and seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold. I know I should take some personal responsibility for my rank, but it gets to a point where I spawn in a kickoff position multiple times in a row and end up down 0-2 by 4:30. That's a huge disadvantage to start off at.
    > seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
        It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
            One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
                Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
            I do it instinctively now.
    Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
You described me in bronze
I don't even get the joke. But okay
    its just a bot that posts the mushroom emoji randomly throughout reddit and whenever it gets banned in enough subs it just makes a new account and repeats
In gold doubles: got told I suck because I only got 3 assists and no goals. Bitch, we're in gold. You suck too!
    Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
    HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
        Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
    I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
        Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
            yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
                In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
            Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
            This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
            This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
    You can sail a ball just before the net, but that last teammate tapping it into the open goal is enough proof for them that they're hot shit surrounded by trash.
people play car soccer like they are dogs chasing a rabbit
    My son is like that, major ball chaser, but also a great shot and decent at aerials. I tend to hang back because he doesn't understand rotation, and it works for us.
Of course we're both stuck in gold 3, but I think if he'd learn some tactics he'd be plat no problem
        Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
            Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
                Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
            sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
Half agree and half not. I recently lost enough games In a row to go from plat 2 to gold 2 and I could have sworn psyonix was trolling me. The team mates I had couldn't hit the ball and even if they did it would go 10ft in front of them to the opponent. 

Anyway. Suddenly I started getting just competent team mates. What I mean by that is they may have lacked mechanical skill but they were actually trying to win by transitioning from defence to attack and vice versa. Now I'm slightly higher in rank than when I started. 

I don't think I was playing any better or worse even though I try to stay self aware. 

So when I asked a guy in gold 2. Please stop driving into me full speed when I have the ball because you are just passing it back to them. That's totally legit. 
If they said shutup you are gold too I would shut up but I'd be quietly planning when to accidentally bump them off the ball when they were about to score.
    That's one thing, but it's when they miss this and whiff that and double commit there etc but spam "what a save" when you goof... THAT'S when I'm like dude, we are *both* down here in silver. We both suck. Piss off.
    Ya just had a similar experience. I went from diamon 1 division 1 down to plat 3 div 1 and than found a halfway decent teammate and immediately shot to diamond 2 winning like 15 games in a row.

I swear all the people who got carried to their ranks psyonix teams you up with.. if you lose 1 close overtime game in solo que all of the sudden your teammates get shittier and shittier and you lost 5 divisions.
Im in diamond now, I either win by 4 or lose by 4. No in between
    People get so tilted so fast. It's an ego thing at this point.
If you mean skill set variation(s) then hell yeah. Either you’re a spinning car wizard, decent teammate (lmao), or good situationally/making reads etc.     
    
Seems as soon as you have 2 out of three, you pretty quickly find your way out. Well, at least before this season. ***Or*** you could be like me, and have 0/3, no clue how you got here, but somehow keep winning at a 51.5% clip lol.
What do you mean pros hate it? Not to sound rude bit I don’t think pros think differently about any rank below GC, which they still think poorly of. Once you’re that high up then all the skill levels below blend into one
Bro I’ll man the goals on 45 boost. It’s all you need to defend well.
    YES
24 WILL GET YOU THERE
        Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
            Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
If only the random team mates I play with 90% of the time understood this. 

Don’t get me wrong; occasionally you’ll fluke it and end up with a team of good communicators and rotators that can and will read the play properly and don’t hog the ball.
This... Even in champ 2 I occasionally deal with the moron teammates who believe they aren't "double committing" by being no where near the play and never being aggressive.

They can't fathom the concept of me rotating back to cover the goal after setting up a play that should be a high probability contest/goal.

They play like we are two positively charged magnets who are incapable of being near each other at any power point during the match and just sit back playing D doing nothing productive.
    I love idea of someone in champ 2 literally sitting in the goal itself like they do at plat. Brings me joy and dispair all at once.
    Effectiveness aside what I've never understood is it seems a spectacularly *boring* way to play
        It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
    PTSD from their plat days when the 2/3 teammates will be going at the ball constantly. Especially in plat 3 I see constant triple commits and lack of leaving the ball to the guy behind you. 


WHY WOULD YOU TURN TOWARDS DEFENSE POSITION AND TURN BACK ON THE BALL WHEN YOU CAN SEE I'M GOING FOR IT!!!?
        I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
The issue is when you wait for opportunities to rotate onto offense, and they never occur because you have two asshats just ball-chasing and never falling back to defense. How are you supposed to be aggressive when it just leaves the goal open and end up ensuring a loss?
I do. If I spawn closest to goal I defend and I let my team mates know. If not, I attack and also let them know. 

Playing with randoms is probably not the best way to win big
I was legitimately a bronze when I started. I would charge every ball full speed, and I sucked at making contact with the ball. No game sense and no ball control will earn you a bronze rank.
    This takes me back to (real) season 1 when most players were like this. I still remember when my coworker told me that you can jump and boost to fly.  I wish I could go back.
        I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
    Wow that perfectly describes me rn
        You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
    My friend was stuck in bronze for MONTHS, it was so funny because no matter how many matches he won he could not rank up
    I'm g3 by just doing that lol
I play with my eyes closed. 

And with my feet.
“Losing kickoff when done correctly”

Oh ok genius, thanks for your kind explanation of how I’m an idiot. 

Is it really so hard for you to believe that some teammates allow kickoff goals while they are off getting corner boost? It has to be my fault?

How bout when the guy that’s supposed to be defending /started in goal charges out (along with everyone else) instead of playing defense, allowing the kickoff to end up behind my whole team? I suppose that’s my fault too, when I started on the angle and said “I got it!” 

Whatever.
    He's not saying you're an idiot. Teammates going for corner boost is okay, and if you "lose" the kickoff your teammate will have full boost and should not have a problem saving it. If your teammate is bad, then maybe it goes in anyway, but that doesn't mean corner boost is bad. Or, maybe your kickoff can be improved so that you don't get as many bad pinches or whatever. There's always something to be improved, which is partly why we try not to just blame our teammates, lots of times it all started with something we did wrong.
        Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
285 hours in 6 months? Damn, pretty impressive.  

Definitely possible for you to hit diamond this season.I hit high diamond 1 but not good enough to solidify my presence there :(
    Yeah covids been helping pump up those numbers.

My aerial game is so weak compared to others. Trying to practice but it's slow progress.

Good luck to you!
in D3 hoops, I had a colored SSL Tournament winner. 

That's right. 

Multiple SSL tourney wins.

In Diamond 3 Hoops. Sigh.
Agreed. I'll be banging in solid aerials in Hoops one after the other and the other team barely leaves the ground or can hardly counter the ball the in air. The disparity that always existed in extra modes is far worse these days than it used to be. I think that's why I've been getting more frustrated lately with certain modes than I used to. You just never know what you're gonna get in your teammates.
Yeah if you have bakkesmod you can see who the new guy is. The new players get +30 to +40 for every win compared to players who have stabilised, who get +9 to +13.
    Interesting. It’s what I figured was happening, but I’m an Xbox player with no bakkesmod. It sucks that we almost get penalized as established players, both in terms of less MMR increase and the implicit burden of carrying new players who should not be ranked where they are.
My guy. 🤘

Started in 2018. I play on the Switch. Gold was a very recent accomplishment despite hundreds of game hours.

It's a game. Am I having fun? Yes? Then I'm doing it right enough for me.
thnx I needed that
3½k, also still plat;)
Unfortunately I just play with randoms online. I definitely play more conservative because of it but I'm finding more often now there's teammates who will rotate positions and not ballchase to hit it for the sake of it. Just gotta adapt to those types of players though
Good teammates are essential in moving up in ranked. Especially once you reach plat, the difference between a good team and a bad team is very obvious
    Its frustrating for the other guy but playing with someone with a higher rank is pretty helpful

Edit: not talking about boosting, but adapting how to position, shoot n pass
This is pretty much what I've worked on. Nailing the basics and each time I move up, play more conservative until I'm skilled enough to win 50/50s, especially aerials now, and positioning myself rather than ballchase. Also because I'm playing with strangers only, adapting to them is important. Even if I can hit a ball, I'll let a teammate take it if they're coming from a better angle but also picking which 50/50s to go for depending on the position of me, the ball on pitch and the risk.
 
I still need to improve not being under the ball when it comes to aerials because I get caught out more that way now, plus inconsistency of hitting balls. Sometimes it's okay to just smash it clear but I want to have more direction (and my speed of hitting from kick off)
thanks for the advice I will try to lessen the amount of ball chasing and rotate through positions better I appreciate it
If you’re stuck in a rank, you’re there for a reason
    This is the reason
        You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
            It's okay. I like you
    The reason being your teammates suck!
I’ve always sorta disagreed with the names “try hard” and “sweat”. Why would somebody not be trying their best? I get the group of toxic people those terms are referring to, but think they need better names.
    Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
    It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
        Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
        Err, I play to have fun?
            Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
    I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
        Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
    Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
        I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
            This is the way.
            I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
    But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
    Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
    Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
    If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
        Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
            Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
so pretty much a quicker way to say they're try hard, thanks.
If they are following you to the ball it's usually best to let them do their thing and avoid double commits. Then you can clean up whatever happens.
    Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
        This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
            Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
That even happens in Plat, you go to corner and will cross and you have your two mates chasing the ball with you and also messing your pass. 

And all you can think about is that if all of us are here who the fuck is going to score and who is on defense? 

The only quick chat i want in this game is “why?” So i can spam it in those situations
    Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
    I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
        !@#$
It's also weird that consoles can't read written chat during a match.
    I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
I feel like that's kind of rude unless you are going for a pass
    How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
        They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
            Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
Grow up buddy
> seems to be a barrier for me to advance to Gold

I hate to say it, but you are not in silver because your teammate stole the corner and mid boost.

What helped me a lot (with this issue) was to start pathing in a way where I could rotate correctly and pick up the small pads at the same time.
    It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
        One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
            Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
        I do it instinctively now.
Maybe practice kickoffs? You could try hitting the ball earlier or later to avoid it getting into a dangerous position after kickoff.
its just a bot that posts the mushroom emoji randomly throughout reddit and whenever it gets banned in enough subs it just makes a new account and repeats
Also, everyone has bad days. Some days you're the Lionel Messi of Rocket League in your rank, and other days you're the toddler in pee wee league. Hell, sometimes that's the case from game to game.

....*ahem* or so I'm told...by a friend.
HOW DARE YOU BE A TEAMMATE THAT PASSES. YOU. MONSTER.
You disgust me. Learn to ballchase like the rest of the community.
For real.
    Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
I've had someone say that... except every goal they got was a goal that I at a minimum set up, and many of them were goals that I'd done that were going in, but they decided they wanted to ram the ball and take it for themselves.
    Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
        yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
            In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
        Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
        This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
        This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

    Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.

The reason being your teammates suck!
Agreed. I take tryhard as a compliment. Just means that my trying is paying off.
It is the most baffling insult ever created in my opinion. Aside from moments of actual joking/trolling, which are rare and organic, who is actually playing a competitive game to not win? Nobody. Most senseless insult ever.
    Hey, former toxic douche canoe here: 

It's a way to help thier ego for a loss. They have a high opinion of themselves, so they were saying they usually win without trying. So the only way you could have won was if you tapped into your adrenaline and played your absolute best, narrowly defeating their "i barely tried" memory of the game. 

source: I delude myself into thinking im good but get kicked out of diamond every season.
    Err, I play to have fun?
        Right but you're not intentionally trying to lose while having fun, that comes from having good close games, right?
I alsways felt like it's more about people that try so hard that they stop enjoying the game.
    Yeah, the players who put $#@%! everytime something goes wrong. They miss a shot, $#@%! You miss a shot, $#@%! The other team scores, $#@%! Kick off goes in to your teams half, $#@%! Etc

Usually they're Gold/Plat 3, Div IV and just can't quite get to the next tier so they get pissed off at absolutely anything except perfect plays. 

I sometimes get to that stage, where everything seems to go wrong and you can't be fucked, but that's when I know I need to have a few days off to forget about the game and reset.
Its more like being giga scared of making even the sightest mistake and therefore not going for any even slightly risky plays.
    I tend to play cautiously/defensively, because 2/3rds of the time my teammates never rotate back to keep someone on defense. When I venture out to take a shot on goal or whatever, I end up quickly going back to goal before the opposing team makes a long shot with nobody in place to block it. It's not ideal, and it means I tend to not make risky plays or apply offensive pressure, but I'm sick and tired of losing matches because people don't like spending any time on defense, or just don't know how to play defense in general and end up blowing 2-3 point leads.

I **LOVE** it when, once in a blue moon, I'll come across teammates that rotate effectively, don't ballchase, etc. Makes the match so much better, just smoothly rotating between positions as needed.
        This is the way.
        I don't get why someone wouldn't rotate back to defence. Like, have you ever made a top corner save off the backboard or an aerial save while flying towards goal? That shit is hype as fuck! And if you get a goal right after you feel like the best player ever.

We win as a team and we lose as a team. I can't stand the people you're referring to. Always after the ball, always slurping up boost and when you can't make a play cuz you're boost starved af they're all like "teammate sucks, must ballchase harder" when rotation is one of the most intuitive things to do.

The way I explain rotation to my lower ranked friends (we started at the same period but I spent a long time "studying") is as follows; do something with the ball, leave it and go back to midfield/defence. I know it's much more than that but that's the principle. Sometimes when we get a few good touches we seem to forget about our teammates and/or boost management being a thing. That's what makes or breaks a team!
But they only call you a try hard or sweat if your winning. It's the stupidest thing
Cuz apathy is cool. Only idiots put in effort. Or something. Idk, don’t care
Do you remember how kids were rewarded participation trophies? They're now grown up without being given participation rewards, so they resort to calling the opponent tryhard or sweatie to feel better about themselves.
If its ranked, then sure go hard all day.. but if you're in a normal lobby and acting like it's a world championship with money on the line, you suck all the fun out of the game for your teammates and the other team. You can be good at the game and enjoy it without obsessing over every pixel
    Wanting to win and acting like it’s a championship are two entirely different things. Playing casual like it’s a ranked match is a good way to refine your skills. I’m not gonna be sorry for trying to do what I started the game up for, win.
        Yes? That's my entire point. There's plenty of people in normals who act like it's the end of the world if you don't play like a professional in a normals game and flame the shit out of you.

You signed up for unranked, you don't get to be angry when not everyone is as try hard as you
Yeah, that's how I end up being benchwarmer.
    This is me. I either end up 500 points or 50, depending on if I can trust my teammates to rotate.
        Both your teammates literally never rotating back so you have to decide whether to stay back and cover your half or triple commit since they’re getting nothing done ball chasing together. Then get flamed for having 24 points
Happens in diamond 3 - champ1 too.  I always tell people that mechanical skill means almost nothing until you get past champ.  The only things you need to be able to do are hit the ball hard, and hit it in the right direction.  Everything else comes down to positioning.  Sure that save/shot looked impossible, but if you were in the right spot all you had to do was flip into the ball.  Your teammate just left the net to challenge? Then hang back for a moment to see how the challenge goes, be ready to make a save or clear the ball.  Someone is in net? Rotate BEHIND THEM. Someone is on the back wall? Don't go up there. Your teammate is carrying the ball down the side of the field? Be center for a pass. Your teammate is carrying mid? Be far enough back to follow up if he is challenged.

Also, if you are hard stuck at a rank, figure out what you are doing wrong, watch your replays etc.  If you aren't ranking up it is ALWAYS your fault.  No matter how "bad" your team is, there is always something you could have done better.  You cant change your shitty teammates, you can only change you.
I personally use the swear quick chat in those situations. Managed to get some teammates actually realise their mistake
    !@#$
I’m on PS4 and I can read written chat. Can also write my own chat too
How? If they're the closest one to the ball and they don't go for it, they need to know they should go for the ball lol.
    They are probably making a judgement call if they don't know they are the closest to the ball. I feel like if you aren't in comms then it's too slow to quickchat that unless you're going back for a rotation. Or they could be doing a fake challenge to bait out a touch from the other team.
        Bro I'm talking about like a dead ball that they could easily hit but they just let the other team take.
It for sure adds up quick when you get a sense of where they are and consistently move for them.
    One thing I'm working on remembering is that I think you should always be doing something, like getting in position or actively hitting the ball. Getting boost should just happen while you are doing the other things, it shouldn't be a primary focus.

That, and managing boost in the first place so you don't need to actually grab as many.
        Yeah good point, even if it’s just making an adjustment to the angle of play you should never be idle.
    I do it instinctively now.
Yeah, how dare anyone have to spend all their time on defense because the asshats you get teamed with don't defend, and the few times you can leave defense it's to try setting up a shot on goal or something! Ugh.
Wait till you get higher and you start to realize how many goals happened as a direct result of your placement or challenge, but was secured by your other two teammates assisting and making the goal, so you look like you did nothing. Good times.

Oh well. As long as I win, I don't care about MVP.
    yeah. Also, side note, I had one tourney where I got shoved in a plat tourney as a silver with my team of another silver and a gold.

We won quals against a team of plat tournament winners... 5-1.

That day I learned that rank doesn't necessarily mean much.
        In most games ranks are just a sign of how much time you invest. Sure, talent and skill matters too, but even the best player won't get very far if he only plays a game or two per day. That is until you get to Master equivalent of the game. These people are legit good and from there it is a battle of skill that only gets harder the further you move up.
    Having lost a couple games from last minute saves, I now "confirm" most goals I think I can without botching it.

Score aside, you know you did the work, I know you did the work and most importantly if I didnt I'm probably a bad teammate anyway.
    This. If I'm on a team with ballchasers or people who just refuse to fall back to defense at any point, I just stick to defense and rack up a few points with saves and maybe make an assist or two.

It really sucks that the game doesn't reward points for blocking or other defensive plays that don't result in *saves*. I've warded off countless passes setting up shots on goal, shots that didn't get close enough to be considered shots on goal, etc. Meanwhile I end up with 300 points at the end while the ballchasers manage to bumble a few shots in and outscore me. *sigh*
    This is my biggest pet peeve with scores.  

Take the ball in your corner, chip their first team mate, aerial over the second, get a perfect placement on the back board for your team mate to aerial... they miss and lightly tap it, your other team mate then casually rolls in and taps it in..

You: +20
Team mate 1: +55
Team mate 2: +120
Well put your dad boots on and tell him to stop playing like a selfish little brat. You let him continue this sorta playstyle without harsh criticism, he's gonna learn from it and grow up to be a greedy twat.
    Yes, it's just as simple as that.
He's had plenty of advice, he's just 10 so he doesn't listen.
        Then it's time to stop giving advice, and start dolling out discipline. Next time he plays a selfish game (causing you to lose), disconnect his controller, and make him watch you play by yourself for awhile.

And if you happen to get a random teammate that actually tries to play a nice team-oriented game, add him to friends, and tell your son *"I think this is my new Rocket League partner. See how he plays?"*
    sounds harsh but yeah, I played soccer as a kid and every coach would...well coach us.  Not in a harsh way, but you know...it's a game.  Coach was kinda hard on us but we loved him...he always put me on defense and I got kinda upset cause I was never the one making shots.  If only I knew.
Exactly 12 is enough to make a save
    Bingo 6 boost is plenty to do the job
It is...also frustrating. These players never are never around to take effortless contests so it almost always comes down to a 50/50 at goal.

They think they are playing conservatively, but in actuality are very high risk allowing the offense to develop that close to the goal.

I by no means am saying to recklessly chase, but you have to trust your teammate and apply peopper tempo based on reads. You cannot sit back and just try to stop an offense
I've got PTSD from the silver/gold days of being tackled/bumped by team mates only for them to welly it in to the other teams corner and down your end...
I missed those days, but I first hopped on in 2017. Even then, the skill breakdown was so different than it is now.
You're probably forgetting what it means to be truly bad. Do you hit the ball more than 50% of the time you drive at it? Do you *ever* circle back to defend? Congrats, you aren't a bronze anymore.
Sorry to you and u/illegaltoast for the rant, I will try to be a better rocket league player and human. :)
You joke but it's true, I was D2 when I was going hard on the game and I took a break because everyone at the time said taking a break was "the best thing". Haven't gotten out of plat 2 because I'm a worse player now. I'm that bad team mate :(
    It's okay. I like you
