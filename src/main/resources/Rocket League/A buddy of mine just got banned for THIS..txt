[[A buddy of mine just got banned for THIS.]]





Welp lesson learned right? Don't say extremely offensive things and you won't get banned.
    Yeah Mac N Cheese is sacred around these parts
        Can't be slandering mac and cheese like that, what's wrong with OPs friend.
            OP and their friend should re-evaluate their life choices
                It's cheesy but you should noodle what you're spooning out.
                    yep, people get lazy and overcook so their noodles shift from al dente to all dented
                OP should re-evaluate their choice of friends
            I resent that! In print it's libel.
        Now Skeeter, he ain’t hurtin’ nobody!
        It should be sacred around all parts
        Just like tendies
    Glad to see they are actually policing this crap.

    I know right? Jeez, the audacity of some people.
“I understand”
    [deleted]
        If I were to be banned from a game, and the message were anything remotely close to this, I’d never click the button, I’d just close the game. And if I’m required to click the button, looks like I’ll never be playing that game again. I’m incredibly stubborn.
            League of legends tried to force me to TYPE "i understand" into a box after it warned me for "going afk" in a game.   The game in question was (because DCs and / or teammates quitting) 2 vs 5.  And i didn't even go AFK per se, I just went a while without fighting because it ended up mostly being 1v4 and getting close enough to fight would cause me instant death.     
      
Just like you, there was definitely a 0% chance I was going to type "I understand" into their bullshit little box.

            So your revenge for being banned is to stay banned?
                It’s not revenge, it’s just that I’m not taking shit from some game. I’m not going to admit wrongdoing under any circumstances if I didn’t do it, and I won’t take lip from some game. My family is a bunch of stubborn bastards, and I definitely have that trait
                    Counterpoint, who cares about “taking shit” from a game. When I see these I laugh to myself, type “I understand” don’t care and move on. Rather type that than not play a game, like cutting your own foot off to spite yourself. Riot doesn’t care if you do or don’t type it.
                    But the games not insulting you, it's just an automated message it sends when it thinks wrongdoing was done, if it doesn't apply to you just do whatever to get passed it and move on. If anything pick a fight with whoever falsely reported you to trigger the games response
                        The game isn’t insulting me, but someone programmed it to seem insulting. Luckily, this is an issue I’ve never encountered and don’t plan to, but I know this is how I would act.
                            That's true haha, it is intended to be insulting to racists and stuff but y'know, probably unnecessary
            God that's stupid
        r/assholedesign - in this case especially lol.
    This phrase is a meme amongst my group of friends. One of the guys has gotten banned multiple times for being a toxic little shit (he has a heart of gold but he is kind of an edgelord while playing competitive games, bless his soul), and every time he posts a screenshot with the I understand message we piss ourselves laughing. 

Now we just say "I understand" in the most serious poker face we can whenever someone we have the slightest argument. Works every time

        And to that, maybe offer a title? One that shows his patience, the timing, the ability to follow instructions, but most importantly how to properly dish out honesty when you're just boiled and you know when there's bad macaroni:

Al dente
        What if OP's friend had bad frost bite as a kid and lost some digits.... No need to be lack-toes intolerant people.
            I’m sorry man but this was just terrible
                A for effort, F for content
                    Affort. Fontent.
                    Toe-far of a reach?
                    May his pun rest in soul
                        Trapped in pungatory for eternity
                A good pun is like a good macaroni dinner.  In pasta bowl.
                    That was better. The first one was unacceptable dog shit and may God have mercy on your soul.
                        Better be nice or you'll get a Parma ban.
                            Now this was quality
                            That joke was a bit cheesy.
                            The oregano post has a point though
                    Except we like our puns like some like their pasta.

Al dente.
                    2 D's for a double dose of that pimpin

            You're reaching real far for that pun.
                You're right, sometimes it's just pesto leave it alone.

Horrible acting!! Just horrible. But, he's married to my sister, so you see my predicament - He needs an award. No, not an Academy, we'll give him a smaller one suitable to his abilities. Yes, just set up an entire new category of awards for horrible actors so he can be included in it, that's the ticket. Make it so.

        A parm ban. It‘s pretty cheesy.
            I now want to make Mac and cheese with parm and mozzarella instead of cheddar, just to see how it would turn out
                Use whitecheddar instead of monzzarella
                    ^ Everybody else shut up and listen to this guy. Full stop.
                    This guys macs
         I wouldn't be surprised
        It does, I actually read the whole thing in two hours
    Suffer not the mac and cheese haters to live.
Seems deserved to me
    Honestly, some real psychos out there these days
        Ikr
Prolly shouldn't be your buddy anymore ..
    Seriously I would stay far away OP. I read a report somewhere once that 9/10 sociopaths do not like Mac and cheese. OP STAY AWAY
        Only mac and cheese haters haters deal in absolutes.
            He is a bold one
 He only got banned for spelling macaroni wrong.
    Plot twist, he loves macaroni and cheese.  He was only complaining about the imaginary product macoroni and cheese.
        Maybe "macoroni" is some new slur we're not aware of.
            Wild guess here, but - maybe it recognises "coron" as part of "corona", as in the phrase "go die of corona".

That's the only thing I can think of...
        > imaginary product macoroni and cheese.

Made with malk
But someone is racist to me but doesnt get banned. Ok psyonix
    Right?! It's so scuffed
        It's scuffed enough that I got queued up with the same toxic player from the enemy team after I reported him. 

At least I could report him twice.
            Yeah I have no fucking clue why we dont have Overwatch's "avoid as teammate" feature... I have had more than one night of RL ruined by being matched with the same toxic person 3+ games in a row. I can report them all I want, it just means they MIGHT get chat banned LATER. doesnt stop them from ruining the game, being toxic, or throwing on purpose, etc.

I just dont get it. It is one of the issues that actively gets worse as you get better too, as theres only so many Champion+ level players per server, so you wind up seeing the same people sometimes frequently, especially if you play at a particular time somewhat consistently.
                I don't know if it works for Rocket League, but some PS4 games won't matchmake you with players you blocked on PSN.

A good way to avoid getting matched with the same players if you're playing the same mode at the same time is to wait a couple minutes before you search for a new game. You're much more likely to be matched with the same people if you end a match and go right back into matchmaking at the same time.
                I say if you block someone it should auto-mute them permanently.

Wanna be toxic?  Go ahead but eventually ain't nobody even gonna see your chat
            You guys just taught me my favorite new cuss-word. It’s scuffed up!

                Not to be the pedantic guy but unless it's actually been widely appropriated to a new meaning I'm pretty sure scuffed is gamer slang for a player mistake in executing part of their play. I guess it's kind of a natural extension of "this person fucked up" to "this company fucked up" but it's fun to watch a word better than "slaps" gain traction
                    Scuffed is what your shoes get if you play football on the pavement.
                    It’s not really a gamer thing, rodeo type dudes have been saying it a hot minute.
                        Army thing, too. Not sure about other branches. But if someone says "yea yall are gettin scuffed up today." That means you're about to do pushups or whatever exercise for a hot minute.
            Yet this community viscerally opposes the 'avoid as teammate' feature.
                So much so that psyonix have now installed a feature that forces you to play with the same toxic player for five games in a row. That way they salve their consciences by forcing people to play 'nicely' together.
                I've mostly heard support, but maybe we're ending up in different threads.
            It's called muting him. Its not hard I promise.
    This is with Psyonix's new detection system from the new update. So atleast on the bright side, the game should now detect people being racist much better and they will be banned
        this is also a photoshop though.
            https://i.imgur.com/2OggKejg.jpg
            Wait people would do that? Post photoshopped content on the internet?
    [deleted]
        Yet I reported someone for calling me a cotton picking farm chimp and nothing happened
            I think it takes two reports to trigger
                So I can mute everyone but one and go to town with the racism with no consequences?  Cool feature 👌 /s
                    Muting would prevent you from seeing their response/chat... But not them seeing your racist shit.
    Why you have to be samad? It’s only game.
    Do you honestly think this is real?
    When its a joke and evey one fuck you up the ass
    Too bad your race isn't macaroni and cheese
    I don't think you get rights until at least gold.
    Mac lives matter.
        Thats racist
I don’t see the problem here
    It was only for a single day.
        Got off easy
    He misspelled “macaroni.”
        Holy shit I just noticed that. what a sicko that person is.
This is literally a blurry photoshop using Calibri text. Also it's flaired as meme day, so...
    I didn’t realize so few people can tell the differences between fonts.
        Maybe they just thought that text box has a different font
        I'm gonna be real with you I don't have rocket league I just saw it browsing reddit and thought it was funny
            Same here, it's on frontpage now too
    OP probably actually got banned, but it was for saying the N Word and not this "Macaroni" lie.
        He's a complete **M**ac**ORON**i in my opinion.
    Just about to say that...
    Not to mention this was on twitter 6 hours before he posted it on reddit. Stolen content too
Just because I keep reading comments from people who think this is real: It's not. Use some common sense.
The amount of people that take this seriously despite the flair and obvious edit is astounding
Deserved it
They thought they were being clever, intentionally misspelling "macaroni" to avoid the filter. Nice try, punk!
If only that’s how reports were handled now, a buddy of mine and I got banned for 3 days and weren’t given an explanation of why or what we did to get banned in the first place
    I got banned for caliing someone "dumb. " After they called my playstyle "dumb. " Psyonix labeled it as "abusive behavior"
        Since epic bought pysonix rocket league has been shit. The censorship, shit servers, blueprints.
        [deleted]
            This community never ceases to amaze me. Almost everytime I play this game I encounter some pretty nasty stuff and the report button does literally nothing.
    My buddy and I tested it. Theres an auto moderator now banning off team chat and in empty lobbies. Just turn your chats off boys and move to discord
    That literally just happened to me and the ban is over tomorrow night. I even sent them a support ticket asking for an explanation of what I said because they didn’t tell me and they just responded and said “we are not rescinding any bans”.
        Exactly the same for me and I cant recall anything Offensive I said.
    Same it happened yesterday and I’m still pissed. I barely even use game chat
    do not worry you are not alone in any way , it sucks
Not sure what’s wrong here...
    Ma**coron**i **a**nd cheese


Coronavirus or related, are forbidden.
    A bad shoop for karma
Ma(coron)i (a)nd cheese

That's why I'm guessing? I don't know how their system works lol
    Could have been punishment for misspelling mac**a**roni?
        More game companies should be doing that, kids and teenagers would improve their spelling so quickly ...
        That word is actually censored. Or at least it was for the longest time hence why they misspelled it?
            Weird. I know maricon is a homophobic slur in Spanish. I wonder if it thinks you are trying to say that?
    I read maind cheese and went wtf could you possibly be talking about. But I'm dumb so carry on
        Main D cheese
        sbeve
    It's probably photoshopped
    No lol its a photoshop for karma
Send him to the gulags
    Take him to the Roquefort and have crows Pecorino his eyes out for that Munster of an opinion!
        Well howdy doodly neighbor
This is the most offensive thing I’ve ever seen.
Why are you booing me:

I’m right...
Burn the witch!
 He deserved it. Mac n cheese is the best
Yeah, that's a reportable offense. Ban served and deserved.
Justified sentence.

Diss mac and cheese, you're gonna get got.
He's wrong you know
Bc Mac and cheese IS GOOD
i feel like i’m gonna get absolutely abused if i admit that i’ve never tried mac and cheese.
    Nah, just means you're in for a treat.
    Pretty mind blowing that you’ve made it to adulthood without ever having it. It’s such a staple meal.
Well what kind? Box is crap, cheap and worthless. 

Homemade Mac and cheese that uses fresh ground cheese, a beshemal sauce, topped with bread crumbs, including some sliced garlic is pure heaven.
    .... ground cheese??
    What else are you serving up in Cafe Pretentious?
        Lol pretentious. Béchamel is just flour butter and milk heated together. Then you put cheese in it and add noods when you done. Not difficult and truly does taste better... but alas... i also like the boxed powdered kind. Heres the heresy part though... i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.
            >i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.

A true man of culture. Add some peas in there for an even more budget gourmet meal.
            Nah don’t kid yourself. Tuna in Mac n cheese sounds pretty alright to me.
                And peas. My partner HATES if i even mention this meal hahahaha
                    Bruh, my dad does cheesy red potatoes and peas for St Patrick's Day.

I'm pretty sure peas in macaroni and cheese is bomb. I mean, I've put peas in carbonara and they were good
                Basically tuna casserole, which slaps, no?
        The difference between real fresh cheese and powdered chemicals is huge.
Your friend is a sick person and he deserved that ban.
Why are you friends with this person!?!?
He fucking deserves it
I don’t see the issue
Completely justified.
fuck him bro he should be perma banned /s
Did you get [Kraft Punk’d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ucpOQYJICYI)?
My friend got a 10 day ban from saying I’m Mexican.
This has to be photo shopped loll
Your buddy is lucky. Back in the olden days they would burn people for heresy.
I feel like they just ban anyone that gets reported now 🤦‍♂️
What kind of monster doesn't like Mac and Cheese. Should be a permaban
Well, I can't say he didn't deserve it.  That's blasphemy.
Justice served Mac and cheese is delicious
I understand.
sorry bud, punishment fits the crime
Press X to doubt
Was that the guy's username?
I never even had macaroni in cheese. It's not a thing over here, but instead we have pasta bake with cheese.

Ah yeah... I almost forgot... That's a shitty photoshop (the chat log is in a brighter white than the rest of the text) and it probably also should be marked as such, since I assume that there are quite a few people that actually believe this shit.
Lmao I wouldn't even be mad
Yea, he deserves that ban. Mac and cheese is the shit.
He had it coming
Me and my teammate both just reported a team in doubles for spamming n-word variations in the chat. Trolls are out in droves
I had some salty randoms in standard competitive last night try to forfeit less than a minute in and down by only 2. Tried to type "no, deal with it." Their filters apparently block anything you type that has "DEAL" anywhere in it. I'm sure there's a "reason" I just don't know it lol.

Edit: less, not was lol.
    [deleted]
It seems cheesy
Deserved it
Consider him lucky it wasn't a lifetime ban,
Good
I disagree with it only being a day long, perma ban this man mac and cheese is fantastic.
Mac an Cheese lives matter
This is from Twitter right?
I understand.
/r/unpopularopinions
Mods, ban /u/fernweh10 from this sub for reposting this hate. We are good folk here!
Yeah they have gone so soft since they sold out to Epic. I got banned for a compliment.
If I made and ran any game, I wouldn't even bother moderating chat or censorship.  I would just have age verification and two buckets.  Under 18, chat enabled to and from friends only, say what you want to your friends that's between you two.  Over 18... say whatever you want.... we are all adults... have at it.  There would be no censorship police, development, expense, or a report button for player chat related issues.
He fucking deserved it
Loose interpretation of hate speech
I am just astonished, I can’t even fathom this type of behavior.
They haven't had good macoroni and cheese then. We always do a pan in the oven, 2lb brick of sharp cheddar sliced and layered throughout, and top it off with french fried onions. Delicious every time.
I mean I understand,  he deserved it.
When you speak such blasphemy a ban is certainly in order.
You tried to mispell macaroni to evade the ban feature as well, no luck though.  Hope you learned your lesson.
This... got to the top post of all time. And it’s not even close. That’s amazing
This is top post on rl reddit all time. Look it up
Holy shit, top all time despite this being photoshopped
Your buddy didn't get banned for this. I literally made this meme 8 days ago and posted it into a facebook group. I have proof.
Is there a button for "I dont understand?"
Understandable, have a great day.

Fuck all the people in this comment section saying that mac and cheese is good, YOU'RE WRONG. 

Mac and cheese is absolutely disgusting

I would have perm banned him for that he deserves it
I see no issue here

“A buddy of yours” it’s been the image for a year
Please tell me this is real
    it’s real, don’t read below the line

___
(it’s not real)
I’m actually offended
I agree with this. I like noodles and cheese but its just to much cheese imo. I'd rather have spaghetti
    You're insane.
        Maybe but that has nothing to do with my opinion on mac and cheese.
    Mods please, do something.
        I'm on the case
This is a cheesy whey to get ewe banned! Hopefully the mods will brie gouda and remove that impasta ban. You ricotta be kidding me if they dont.
Lifetime ban. Mac and cheese is bomb
The new bans are out of control
Ahahahaha big bruh moment😂
Lmao
I'm glad the new filters for racist content are working psyonix
hes right
Also on Xbox "rude" is censored
Wow I didnt know the players I've reported get messages like that lol
Lmao
Good.
Gooood
Bruh this got me pissing myself laughing while crying because my hey fever is so bad at three in the morning! 😂😂
Woah, slow down there buddy. Atleast put a NSFW tag on or something cause that statement was really offensive.
It’s heracy of the highest order to not like mac and cheese
Nice one psyonix // epic  games
It’s funny until you realize that Psyonix literally bans users for the meme
Well deserved ban
Only 1 day!? He should be perma banned!!!! 11!!1!5!!/s
I love the fact that the guy saw his comment and was like
"Thats it, this time youve gone too far buddy"
And reported him
Rightfully so, jackass!
I got a 72 hour ban with no excuse
Reasonable
Justified, you vile discussing  person.
Seems fair to me
I cant believe you used the C-word
You should completely understand
Good riddance.
Be thankful it isn’t perma
He misspelled macaroni, obviously.
Lol
Legit just got a 72 hour ban because of some moron thinking I was smurfing in an unranked game. For context, he was Bronze(apparently just got the game)  and me and my teammate are both S3.
Sounds like the system doing its job then, you heathen.
I’m sorry but your friend lowkey deserved it. An opinion like that deserves a ban tbh
They got off easy
/r/madlad
I got banned for 72 hours for saying “Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter”
I'm guessing this is automated of some sort based on the assumption that someone's name is "Macaroni and cheese". 

Still tho ...
I believe it was a just ban
as a Wisconsinite I approve of this ban, that's hate speech right there
They dialed up their sensitivity to crack down on racism. It’ll end up in a good place.
Some guy I know got banned for over a week recently because he was queuing with a guy who said some toxic stuff (something along the lines of I hope you die in a horrible crash). Funny thing is that he didn't say anything and the toxic guy didn't even get a warning.
Oh i saw this earlier i think it was from veru or whatever
what a monster, he deserves 10 years
This shits awesome. At least it wasn’t someone trying to convince the guy a melt is a grilled cheese.
It didnt even give me a reason, I just banned me to ban me
I also understand.
Honestly he should spend the next 24 hours rethinking his life choices.  I mean, what kind of a sick..... smh.
deserved
Worthy.
Don’t blame him
wat is that
There are very few sentences that would more deserving of a ban in my opinion...
Your buddy is a psycho for saying that, also I got banned for saying pigeons are robots
He gets what he gets!⚰️
ThIs iS r0cKet LeAgUe
Dude I got banned for saying "the kids nuts" after he hit a flip reset.
They remind me of my current days in RL
At least it’s only 1 day. Mine is 72 hours and I got 35 hours left
racist prick.. Dox him!
To be fair.... That is pretty incendiary... Mac and Cheese has always been there when I've been low.
good
The whole system is dumb. It bleeps out "pls" for some reason so I gotta stumble to type "please" on a controller. Yet people run around with racist and offensive screen names and nothing happens.
Good. They're a monster
As he should have been
This would have been awesome if you'd had a 5 minute ban, just a dev playing around.
I said fag and got banned for 6 days wth man this game sucks
    Justified. GFY
The game is fundamentally broken and now they pull this shit
I mean, that's pretty offensive
I got banned for 3 days for saying shut up
Mm font do be a bit off doe
Well deserved
Well, we don't have time for that kind of shit in the world.

Good riddance.
I love how the only option is “I understand”.
I UNDERSTAND
OP there's a difference between being banned and being suspended.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
Seems like Psyonix really likes mac and cheese
New system is fucked up
While I personally agree, I've learned the hard way that this isn't an opinion you should share openly. It appears he has learned the same now.
They went too easy on him.
He gets what he deserves
I UNDERSTAND
“Why are you booing me? I’m right!”
They deserved it
Rip
This post would get insta-locked in /r/amitheasshole because "your friend" is an asshole.
They remind me of my current days in RL
Rennet is an abomination.
I got a 72h ban the other day... but don't even know what I said. It didn't tell me, and support won't answer my requests, so I don't know how to not do it again ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

(I'm not a toxic player, never target players or say racial slurs, etc.)

Psyonix has gotten really ban happy lately I guess
Your friend should have gotten worse than just a day.

Mac and cheese is life
This is lactose intolerance and we as a people should strive to be better.
In chat I can't say macaroni all I get is ********
Offensive that he can't spell macaroni?
How can you say that when there are 1000s of different kinds of mac and cheese?  Lime do you not like noodles and cheese?  That's weird
he’s not wrong
They should have got the ip ban and maybe even a swat or two. Thems be fighting words right there...
You really told them
/s
Psyonix / epic and every other game is really taking a hyper sensitive approach here
This is justice
He deserved it
A kid hit me with the what a save in solos today when he hit a goal with 3 seconds left making the final score 11-1 me. Politely told him his mom should’ve swallowed him. Still waiting on that van hammer to come through
Spelling error you should be glad you aren't banned for life.
Good
I honestly wanna know how they even got to talking about this lol
Everyone is allowed their own opinions of course, but I think your friends opinion is a tad too strong /s
No he right though, he would've fucked up if he had said Macaroni and Butter was gross tho, that shit is GOLDEN. Ez 1 year ban.
you should feel honored
My buddy (PS4) and I (PC) played against a team (both PC) two days ago and one of the players on the other team got mad about losing and said:

\- fucking cunts

and then

\- bitches

I then said "haha get rekt".

My friend couldn't even see their chat or respond but he got a 72 hour ban after the game.  Shit makes no sense.
I got it!
I got it!
Defending...
Is this real? Or am i missing some double innuendo?
wow that's fucking pathetic


i hope ur friend learns their lesson and reforms and becomes a more respectful member of the community
That'll teach you!
Rocket leagues been dishing these out lately. Miss the old Xbox days :(
Why is the font different tho
Lol I would of let this ban go through too. You can't just say that man
Looks pretty deserved to me
Why are you booing him he's right.
He deserves it
Deserved it.

Bruhhhh that's cheesy
“A buddy of mine”
That is extremely offensive
Should’ve been a lifetime ban tbh
That is the most offensive statement I have seen in my whole life. I believe this goes past prison, and straight to the death penalty. Mac and Cheese is amazing and it is blasphemy to criticize its holiness. A ban is well deserved.
did you get banned?

edit: spelling
I UNDERSTAND
Lmao
Ok, ok, you got me. Sheesh.
I report everyone who starts shouting noob. 

They only do it when losing too.

My 1v1 games might be a bit unconventional but I get it do much after winning. That I just started reporting everyone who says it more than once.
Understandable
Someone has a sense of humor.
i don't see the problem
Let your friend know I'm making fucking mac and cheese, and nobody can stop me.
What an absolute potty mouth!
Truly this is a sign that the internet is reaching peak toxicity. Why else would one spout off such hateful words at strangers. What have we become
Is this real or an edit?
I swear to god everyone’s a fucking pussy now
I'm ok with this.
Harsh, but fair.
Macaroni is listed as a cuss word. If you type it chat will bleep it out
Sorry I was so salty, I fell 10 docs that night, I'm play 2 again ._.
One of the few bans I agree with. And by that I mean agreeing to ban this *******
And he deserved it.
Should have been perma for that comment that’s sacrilege.
They remind me of my early days in RL
It ain’t mine!”
He totally deserved this
...and their ban was deserved. Your friend is on the wrong side of history.
At least they told him why he was banned, I didn't even get that 🤣
“I understand” like they’re saying “I hope you know what you did” and you’re supposed to say “yeah, you’re right, I’m in the wrong here”
You shoulda had Mac and cheese before Kraft made 40 or so ever cheaper versions of it.   It used to be great.
I’m with the reporter 😜
AHAHAHAHAAH OMG Thank you for sharing this. And people think I'm dramatic when I say free speech is dead. Is this not the death of free speech? G-- D---.
Probably got banned for the 'and'
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
Either someone having fun, or they’ve outsourced their reporting to some random company in Asia
Why are bannings for in game language even a thing, muting exists.
 Rightly so
wtf they didn’t show me  what i said to get banned
He went over the line. Get a bowl of mac and cheese and think about what he has done! /s
It really doesn’t matter what he likes to eat and what not. Cuz in reality, that person got banned for saying his oppinion and did not hurt anyone with said oppinion. All we see is a faceless target for jokes, but that guy was following the rules and still he got penalized by the system. Sounds familiar?
If you play with fire, you get burned.
I just got 72 hrs 🤷
LMFAO
That’s too good for him if you ask me
Ban justified! No blasphemy allowed!
I’m offended and hungry. Thanks, asshole.
Good. He's a monster.
I appreciate every perspective of this synchro strike
You should of gotten a perm ban
Well, it is 2020 after all...
As I responded to the tweet several hours ago, should have been permanent
I got a 3 day ban for literally nothing, didn’t tell me what I got banned for
Serves you right.
2020 racism
In a server with some Americans I see?
Yeesh, just one day? You got off easy pal.
I just got banned for absolutely destroying two toxic fools who called a guy in the lobby a fag. 

After wrecking their shit for 3 games I said "I dont like people who say "fag"".

With quotes. And banned for 3 days.
[deleted]
Yo I’ve seen that name in a game before, is it a common name or did I meet your friend?
Lol what game is this? Is it a game about cheese?
They remind me of my current days in RL
Good riddance
I understand
Your heretic friend is lucky he isn't getting swatted!
Babies and little kids love Mac n Cheese. Never forget.
He deserves it
Blasphemy!
He got off with a light punishment
Omg 😳
Well he did deserve it.
If you don't like mac and cheese then you dont deserve to live
Boo this individual!!!
Maybe he shouldn’t blatantly scream out hate speech like that. People like your friend is the reason we have war.
Yeah no wonder.. Mac n cheese is life!
I got banned multiple times for saying "macaque soup"
Should've been 1 year
How fucking dare you say that
HAHAHAHA
Justified
.....you sonuvabeech!
I make really good baked mac n cheese, how dare you! Seriously, it's worlds apart. Add all your favorite herbs and spices, a shitload of cheese and maybe some rotisserie chicken. It's the best!
On the flip side I got banned after forfeiting a 1 v 2 I lost after my opponent quit at like 4 mins left
Good. They deserved it.
Deserved
HAHAHAHA!!!! Bethesda?
Well, if rules say you can be banned if several people find your comment offensive...
They're not wrong, your bud is going straight to the 9th circle.
Your buddy just hasn't had good mac and cheese
That's kinda' hilarious, but only because I don't play Rocket League myself.
If you ask me that's a permaban
I got 3 day ban for no reason
Don't mess with macaroni and cheese, bro.
Probably cause it was spelled wrong, fuckin cheesehead.
I guarantee you we’re playing a player named macaroni and cheese.
Your "buddy" is Satan
Whatever judged that to be bannable was being nice. Your friend should be happy the punishment wasn't worse.
Its fair. Cant believe he said that
Should be a lifetime ban from steam.
Yeah Mac N Cheese is sacred around these parts
    Can't be slandering mac and cheese like that, what's wrong with OPs friend.
        OP and their friend should re-evaluate their life choices
            It's cheesy but you should noodle what you're spooning out.
                yep, people get lazy and overcook so their noodles shift from al dente to all dented
            OP should re-evaluate their choice of friends
        I resent that! In print it's libel.
    Now Skeeter, he ain’t hurtin’ nobody!
    It should be sacred around all parts

Glad to see they are actually policing this crap.

    If I were to be banned from a game, and the message were anything remotely close to this, I’d never click the button, I’d just close the game. And if I’m required to click the button, looks like I’ll never be playing that game again. I’m incredibly stubborn.
        League of legends tried to force me to TYPE "i understand" into a box after it warned me for "going afk" in a game.   The game in question was (because DCs and / or teammates quitting) 2 vs 5.  And i didn't even go AFK per se, I just went a while without fighting because it ended up mostly being 1v4 and getting close enough to fight would cause me instant death.     
      
Just like you, there was definitely a 0% chance I was going to type "I understand" into their bullshit little box.
            i UnDeRstAnD
                Wakarimashta.
        So your revenge for being banned is to stay banned?
            It’s not revenge, it’s just that I’m not taking shit from some game. I’m not going to admit wrongdoing under any circumstances if I didn’t do it, and I won’t take lip from some game. My family is a bunch of stubborn bastards, and I definitely have that trait
                Counterpoint, who cares about “taking shit” from a game. When I see these I laugh to myself, type “I understand” don’t care and move on. Rather type that than not play a game, like cutting your own foot off to spite yourself. Riot doesn’t care if you do or don’t type it.
                But the games not insulting you, it's just an automated message it sends when it thinks wrongdoing was done, if it doesn't apply to you just do whatever to get passed it and move on. If anything pick a fight with whoever falsely reported you to trigger the games response
                    The game isn’t insulting me, but someone programmed it to seem insulting. Luckily, this is an issue I’ve never encountered and don’t plan to, but I know this is how I would act.
                        That's true haha, it is intended to be insulting to racists and stuff but y'know, probably unnecessary
        God that's stupid
    r/assholedesign - in this case especially lol.
This phrase is a meme amongst my group of friends. One of the guys has gotten banned multiple times for being a toxic little shit (he has a heart of gold but he is kind of an edgelord while playing competitive games, bless his soul), and every time he posts a screenshot with the I understand message we piss ourselves laughing. 

Now we just say "I understand" in the most serious poker face we can whenever someone we have the slightest argument. Works every time
[deleted]
    And to that, maybe offer a title? One that shows his patience, the timing, the ability to follow instructions, but most importantly how to properly dish out honesty when you're just boiled and you know when there's bad macaroni:

Al dente
    What if OP's friend had bad frost bite as a kid and lost some digits.... No need to be lack-toes intolerant people.
        I’m sorry man but this was just terrible
            A for effort, F for content
                Affort. Fontent.
                Toe-far of a reach?
                May his pun rest in soul
                    Trapped in pungatory for eternity
            A good pun is like a good macaroni dinner.  In pasta bowl.
                That was better. The first one was unacceptable dog shit and may God have mercy on your soul.
                    Better be nice or you'll get a Parma ban.
                        Now this was quality
                        That joke was a bit cheesy.
                        The oregano post has a point though

Al dente.
                2 D's for a double dose of that pimpin

    A parm ban. It‘s pretty cheesy.
        I now want to make Mac and cheese with parm and mozzarella instead of cheddar, just to see how it would turn out
            Use whitecheddar instead of monzzarella
                ^ Everybody else shut up and listen to this guy. Full stop.
                This guys macs
     I wouldn't be surprised
    It does, I actually read the whole thing in two hours
Suffer not the mac and cheese haters to live.
Honestly, some real psychos out there these days
    Ikr
Seriously I would stay far away OP. I read a report somewhere once that 9/10 sociopaths do not like Mac and cheese. OP STAY AWAY
    Only mac and cheese haters haters deal in absolutes.
        He is a bold one
Plot twist, he loves macaroni and cheese.  He was only complaining about the imaginary product macoroni and cheese.
    Maybe "macoroni" is some new slur we're not aware of.
        Wild guess here, but - maybe it recognises "coron" as part of "corona", as in the phrase "go die of corona".

That's the only thing I can think of...
    > imaginary product macoroni and cheese.

Made with malk
Right?! It's so scuffed
    It's scuffed enough that I got queued up with the same toxic player from the enemy team after I reported him. 

At least I could report him twice.
        Yeah I have no fucking clue why we dont have Overwatch's "avoid as teammate" feature... I have had more than one night of RL ruined by being matched with the same toxic person 3+ games in a row. I can report them all I want, it just means they MIGHT get chat banned LATER. doesnt stop them from ruining the game, being toxic, or throwing on purpose, etc.

I just dont get it. It is one of the issues that actively gets worse as you get better too, as theres only so many Champion+ level players per server, so you wind up seeing the same people sometimes frequently, especially if you play at a particular time somewhat consistently.
            I don't know if it works for Rocket League, but some PS4 games won't matchmake you with players you blocked on PSN.

A good way to avoid getting matched with the same players if you're playing the same mode at the same time is to wait a couple minutes before you search for a new game. You're much more likely to be matched with the same people if you end a match and go right back into matchmaking at the same time.
            I say if you block someone it should auto-mute them permanently.

Wanna be toxic?  Go ahead but eventually ain't nobody even gonna see your chat
        You guys just taught me my favorite new cuss-word. It’s scuffed up!

            Not to be the pedantic guy but unless it's actually been widely appropriated to a new meaning I'm pretty sure scuffed is gamer slang for a player mistake in executing part of their play. I guess it's kind of a natural extension of "this person fucked up" to "this company fucked up" but it's fun to watch a word better than "slaps" gain traction
                Scuffed is what your shoes get if you play football on the pavement.
                It’s not really a gamer thing, rodeo type dudes have been saying it a hot minute.
                    Army thing, too. Not sure about other branches. But if someone says "yea yall are gettin scuffed up today." That means you're about to do pushups or whatever exercise for a hot minute.
        Yet this community viscerally opposes the 'avoid as teammate' feature.
            So much so that psyonix have now installed a feature that forces you to play with the same toxic player for five games in a row. That way they salve their consciences by forcing people to play 'nicely' together.
            I've mostly heard support, but maybe we're ending up in different threads.
        It's called muting him. Its not hard I promise.
This is with Psyonix's new detection system from the new update. So atleast on the bright side, the game should now detect people being racist much better and they will be banned
    this is also a photoshop though.
        https://i.imgur.com/2OggKejg.jpg
        Wait people would do that? Post photoshopped content on the internet?
[deleted]
    Yet I reported someone for calling me a cotton picking farm chimp and nothing happened
        I think it takes two reports to trigger
            So I can mute everyone but one and go to town with the racism with no consequences?  Cool feature 👌 /s
                Muting would prevent you from seeing their response/chat... But not them seeing your racist shit.
Why you have to be samad? It’s only game.
Do you honestly think this is real?
When its a joke and evey one fuck you up the ass
Too bad your race isn't macaroni and cheese
I don't think you get rights until at least gold.
Mac lives matter.
    Thats racist
It was only for a single day.
    Got off easy
He misspelled “macaroni.”
    Holy shit I just noticed that. what a sicko that person is.
I didn’t realize so few people can tell the differences between fonts.
    Maybe they just thought that text box has a different font
    I'm gonna be real with you I don't have rocket league I just saw it browsing reddit and thought it was funny
        Same here, it's on frontpage now too
OP probably actually got banned, but it was for saying the N Word and not this "Macaroni" lie.
    He's a complete **M**ac**ORON**i in my opinion.
Just about to say that...
Not to mention this was on twitter 6 hours before he posted it on reddit. Stolen content too
I got banned for caliing someone "dumb. " After they called my playstyle "dumb. " Psyonix labeled it as "abusive behavior"
    Since epic bought pysonix rocket league has been shit. The censorship, shit servers, blueprints.
    [deleted]
        This community never ceases to amaze me. Almost everytime I play this game I encounter some pretty nasty stuff and the report button does literally nothing.
My buddy and I tested it. Theres an auto moderator now banning off team chat and in empty lobbies. Just turn your chats off boys and move to discord
That literally just happened to me and the ban is over tomorrow night. I even sent them a support ticket asking for an explanation of what I said because they didn’t tell me and they just responded and said “we are not rescinding any bans”.
    Exactly the same for me and I cant recall anything Offensive I said.
Same it happened yesterday and I’m still pissed. I barely even use game chat
do not worry you are not alone in any way , it sucks
Ma**coron**i **a**nd cheese


Coronavirus or related, are forbidden.
A bad shoop for karma
Could have been punishment for misspelling mac**a**roni?
    More game companies should be doing that, kids and teenagers would improve their spelling so quickly ...
    That word is actually censored. Or at least it was for the longest time hence why they misspelled it?
        Weird. I know maricon is a homophobic slur in Spanish. I wonder if it thinks you are trying to say that?
I read maind cheese and went wtf could you possibly be talking about. But I'm dumb so carry on
    Main D cheese
    sbeve
It's probably photoshopped
No lol its a photoshop for karma
Take him to the Roquefort and have crows Pecorino his eyes out for that Munster of an opinion!
    Well howdy doodly neighbor
Nah, just means you're in for a treat.
Pretty mind blowing that you’ve made it to adulthood without ever having it. It’s such a staple meal.
.... ground cheese??
What else are you serving up in Cafe Pretentious?
    Lol pretentious. Béchamel is just flour butter and milk heated together. Then you put cheese in it and add noods when you done. Not difficult and truly does taste better... but alas... i also like the boxed powdered kind. Heres the heresy part though... i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.
        >i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.

A true man of culture. Add some peas in there for an even more budget gourmet meal.
        Nah don’t kid yourself. Tuna in Mac n cheese sounds pretty alright to me.
            And peas. My partner HATES if i even mention this meal hahahaha
                Bruh, my dad does cheesy red potatoes and peas for St Patrick's Day.

I'm pretty sure peas in macaroni and cheese is bomb. I mean, I've put peas in carbonara and they were good
            Basically tuna casserole, which slaps, no?
    The difference between real fresh cheese and powdered chemicals is huge.

Horrible acting!! Just horrible. But, he's married to my sister, so you see my predicament - He needs an award. No, not an Academy, we'll give him a smaller one suitable to his abilities. Yes, just set up an entire new category of awards for horrible actors so he can be included in it, that's the ticket. Make it so.

Gouda one!
A parm ban. It‘s pretty cheesy.
    I now want to make Mac and cheese with parm and mozzarella instead of cheddar, just to see how it would turn out
        Use whitecheddar instead of monzzarella
            ^ Everybody else shut up and listen to this guy. Full stop.
            This guys macs
 I wouldn't be surprised
It does, I actually read the whole thing in two hours

Only mac and cheese haters haters deal in absolutes.
    He is a bold one
Maybe "macoroni" is some new slur we're not aware of.
    Wild guess here, but - maybe it recognises "coron" as part of "corona", as in the phrase "go die of corona".

That's the only thing I can think of...
> imaginary product macoroni and cheese.

Made with malk
It's scuffed enough that I got queued up with the same toxic player from the enemy team after I reported him. 

At least I could report him twice.
    Yeah I have no fucking clue why we dont have Overwatch's "avoid as teammate" feature... I have had more than one night of RL ruined by being matched with the same toxic person 3+ games in a row. I can report them all I want, it just means they MIGHT get chat banned LATER. doesnt stop them from ruining the game, being toxic, or throwing on purpose, etc.

I just dont get it. It is one of the issues that actively gets worse as you get better too, as theres only so many Champion+ level players per server, so you wind up seeing the same people sometimes frequently, especially if you play at a particular time somewhat consistently.
        I don't know if it works for Rocket League, but some PS4 games won't matchmake you with players you blocked on PSN.

A good way to avoid getting matched with the same players if you're playing the same mode at the same time is to wait a couple minutes before you search for a new game. You're much more likely to be matched with the same people if you end a match and go right back into matchmaking at the same time.
        I say if you block someone it should auto-mute them permanently.

Wanna be toxic?  Go ahead but eventually ain't nobody even gonna see your chat
    You guys just taught me my favorite new cuss-word. It’s scuffed up!

        Not to be the pedantic guy but unless it's actually been widely appropriated to a new meaning I'm pretty sure scuffed is gamer slang for a player mistake in executing part of their play. I guess it's kind of a natural extension of "this person fucked up" to "this company fucked up" but it's fun to watch a word better than "slaps" gain traction
            Scuffed is what your shoes get if you play football on the pavement.
            It’s not really a gamer thing, rodeo type dudes have been saying it a hot minute.
                Army thing, too. Not sure about other branches. But if someone says "yea yall are gettin scuffed up today." That means you're about to do pushups or whatever exercise for a hot minute.
    Yet this community viscerally opposes the 'avoid as teammate' feature.
        So much so that psyonix have now installed a feature that forces you to play with the same toxic player for five games in a row. That way they salve their consciences by forcing people to play 'nicely' together.
        I've mostly heard support, but maybe we're ending up in different threads.
    It's called muting him. Its not hard I promise.
this is also a photoshop though.
    https://i.imgur.com/2OggKejg.jpg
    Wait people would do that? Post photoshopped content on the internet?
Yet I reported someone for calling me a cotton picking farm chimp and nothing happened
    I think it takes two reports to trigger
        So I can mute everyone but one and go to town with the racism with no consequences?  Cool feature 👌 /s
            Muting would prevent you from seeing their response/chat... But not them seeing your racist shit.
Thats racist
Got off easy
Holy shit I just noticed that. what a sicko that person is.
Maybe they just thought that text box has a different font
I'm gonna be real with you I don't have rocket league I just saw it browsing reddit and thought it was funny
    Same here, it's on frontpage now too
He's a complete **M**ac**ORON**i in my opinion.
Since epic bought pysonix rocket league has been shit. The censorship, shit servers, blueprints.
[deleted]
    This community never ceases to amaze me. Almost everytime I play this game I encounter some pretty nasty stuff and the report button does literally nothing.
Exactly the same for me and I cant recall anything Offensive I said.
More game companies should be doing that, kids and teenagers would improve their spelling so quickly ...
That word is actually censored. Or at least it was for the longest time hence why they misspelled it?
    Weird. I know maricon is a homophobic slur in Spanish. I wonder if it thinks you are trying to say that?
Main D cheese
sbeve
Well howdy doodly neighbor
Lol pretentious. Béchamel is just flour butter and milk heated together. Then you put cheese in it and add noods when you done. Not difficult and truly does taste better... but alas... i also like the boxed powdered kind. Heres the heresy part though... i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.
    >i like a can of tuna in my mac n cheese.

A true man of culture. Add some peas in there for an even more budget gourmet meal.
    Nah don’t kid yourself. Tuna in Mac n cheese sounds pretty alright to me.
        And peas. My partner HATES if i even mention this meal hahahaha
            Bruh, my dad does cheesy red potatoes and peas for St Patrick's Day.

I'm pretty sure peas in macaroni and cheese is bomb. I mean, I've put peas in carbonara and they were good
        Basically tuna casserole, which slaps, no?
The difference between real fresh cheese and powdered chemicals is huge.
Maybe but that has nothing to do with my opinion on mac and cheese.
I'm on the case
OP and their friend should re-evaluate their life choices
    It's cheesy but you should noodle what you're spooning out.
        yep, people get lazy and overcook so their noodles shift from al dente to all dented
    OP should re-evaluate their choice of friends
I resent that! In print it's libel.
League of legends tried to force me to TYPE "i understand" into a box after it warned me for "going afk" in a game.   The game in question was (because DCs and / or teammates quitting) 2 vs 5.  And i didn't even go AFK per se, I just went a while without fighting because it ended up mostly being 1v4 and getting close enough to fight would cause me instant death.     
      
Just like you, there was definitely a 0% chance I was going to type "I understand" into their bullshit little box.
    i UnDeRstAnD
        Wakarimashta.
So your revenge for being banned is to stay banned?
    It’s not revenge, it’s just that I’m not taking shit from some game. I’m not going to admit wrongdoing under any circumstances if I didn’t do it, and I won’t take lip from some game. My family is a bunch of stubborn bastards, and I definitely have that trait
        Counterpoint, who cares about “taking shit” from a game. When I see these I laugh to myself, type “I understand” don’t care and move on. Rather type that than not play a game, like cutting your own foot off to spite yourself. Riot doesn’t care if you do or don’t type it.
        But the games not insulting you, it's just an automated message it sends when it thinks wrongdoing was done, if it doesn't apply to you just do whatever to get passed it and move on. If anything pick a fight with whoever falsely reported you to trigger the games response
            The game isn’t insulting me, but someone programmed it to seem insulting. Luckily, this is an issue I’ve never encountered and don’t plan to, but I know this is how I would act.
                That's true haha, it is intended to be insulting to racists and stuff but y'know, probably unnecessary
God that's stupid
I’m sorry man but this was just terrible

        Toe-far of a reach?
        May his pun rest in soul

    A good pun is like a good macaroni dinner.  In pasta bowl.
        That was better. The first one was unacceptable dog shit and may God have mercy on your soul.
            Better be nice or you'll get a Parma ban.
                Now this was quality
                That joke was a bit cheesy.

        Except we like our puns like some like their pasta.

Al dente.
