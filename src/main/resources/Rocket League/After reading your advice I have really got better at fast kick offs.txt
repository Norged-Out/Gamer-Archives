[[After reading your advice I have really got better at fast kick offs]]





Made me laugh in a meeting. Thank you!
    Made me fart at my boss, also Thank You!
        Made me fart in a bag and throw it over the cubicle wall
            I came multiple times and summoned the tooth fairy
                Do you cum human teeth?
                    Don’t worry about that.
                        *I'm really really really worried about that.*
                            So is his doctor
                                As his doctor I can say this is totally normal
                Made me vomit Jesus H. Christ and time travel 60 days into the future, thanks!
        I bust out laughing
    My man is watching rocket league clips in the middle of a meeting. Got his priorities straight.
    Made me laugh hard enough to push a poop out. Thank you!
    I thought he was serious and was waiting to be impressed only to see him f up twice 😂😂😂😂
        Haha this has me rolling for some reason. If I was on his team for this, I would have been dying.
        Same
    OMG HAHAHAHA TWIINS MAN
Perfectly cut
    r/onesecondbeforedisast
        Could easily be in r/gifsthatkeepongiving
            Nah that's for gifs that have so much going on in a single loop it feels like a movie. This is more r/bettereveryloop
    It really is, just long enough to see the disaster and fast enough that you can watch again and again.  Its brilliant.
    Good thing the video was cut before an own goal could happen, whew 😮‍💨
    He's lucky not to OG there tbh
This is the best RL clip (together with the title) of 2023 🤣
God damn ! I wasn't ready for that

![gif](giphy|10JhviFuU2gWD6)
Never let them know your next move
    And there's only one way to do that
        Meth?
            By not knowing your next move, yourself.  Meth counts.

Edit* took me a few tries to get good words.
                I hate when the good words hide in my mouth and not my brains for making keyboard words.
            ![gif](giphy|1nCfZ1mDXGcyk)
    The enemy can't know what we're doing if we don't.
Ending the clip before the ball entered the net did it for me.
    The rage quit
    I think OP would've shown it if it was an OG. I'm sure the ball went high 👍
Apologies for chuckling at your misfortune. That was gold.
    Give the guy some credit, that was peak Plat for sure.
        Looks like C3 to me
            I see people try this corkscrew method constantly, yet they almost never hit the ball before me just driving straight up to it. 

I’m assuming it’s a proper thing in champion ?
                If executed perfectly he would hit the ball first as he would have more speed than a normal boost and flip. Those who can do it well enough can get a powerful shot off at goal. 

OP is showing us a new meta.
                    I mean, he got a powerful shot off at goal too, he just didn't hit it first.
                In my experience usually someone at C2 or higher rank can do it the proper way more consistently, and if you aren't doing the proper speedflip opposite to them, or just driving while boosting, you'll be cleanly beat to the ball on kickoff. You won't even be able to get any touch if opponent does an ideal speed flip in such cases.
                Lol no

Lots of people try it, few can connect consistently, and those who can have no variability, so it's easily countered
                what is corkscrew method?
                    What OP tried and failed in the clip. Usually they land right in front/hit the ball
                yeah in c2 i can do them with like 60% effectiveness, if i mess up its a kickoff of death for my teammate directly into our corner lol
    *platinum
Nb tbh, u made it in. Just next time opposite direction
    have you ever finished a match where you scored \*every\* goal and it was 2-1 against? :-)
        I feel called out. My regular teammates bring this up every time it happens. 

They really should get a new teammate.
            What's wrong with those guys
When you give a champ advice to a gold.
A goal’s a goal 😂
More posts like this, please. Thank you and excellent play!
LOL
i lol'd
😂 C O M E D Y 😂
Post of the year
Siiiick!
This is great 😂😂 thank you for sharing
Lmao I’m dying
If I had a dollar for every time I’ve done this I’d have many dollars. Thanks for the laugh
thank goodness the video paused or else the ball would've gone in😓
What's it feel like to peak so high?
![gif](giphy|10yXFkBJ0MwGQ0)


No matter the rank, no matter how good, this has happened to all of us, nice one mate 😅
    No I have never own goaled a redirect from kick-off.
        Missing out tbh. Best bit is when you make everyone watch the full replay.
        Look at Mr. no own goals over here! You will one day I guarantee it.
            I never said I haven't own goaled, I've just never own goaled a redirected  kickoff that's skill only SSL have.
r/meirl
This is absolute gold lol
    You are completely right in more ways than one
        Wdym?? look at that amazing redirect, gotta be at least grandsilver
Fast kickoffs don't seem to give you any advantage. In fact it seems to give you the opposite. I have never attempted a fast kickoff ever. However, almost every single opponent that does a fast kickoff ends up hitting the ball right at me and bounces off my normal kickoff, sending the ball into their zone anyway lol.

Slow kickoffs are better. Change my mind.
    if they get the first touch and you miss it could be devastating as you're flying the opposite way.
        They always get first touch and it's rarely bad for me.
            Yeah, it still seems like a 50/50 to me whenever they do it (low diamond). a 0.25 second earlier hit isn't going to be the difference between me hitting and missing unless I'm trying to do some weird funny shit or wasn't paying attention and started late
    I'm with you. Never have tried and never felt necessary to learn to do it. I'm a high diamond and in 2 years of almost daily playing, I think 2 or 3 I've encountered someone that did it so perfect I couldn't touch the ball at kick off. Is just not worth it.
Maybe it didn't go in? Maybe a 3rd player pops out of the wall and saves it
r/perfectlycutscreams
This is absolutely brilliant, please add the "to be continued". Meme at the end hahaha

Nailed it
Where’d you find this clip of me 😂
What was the original advice I’m curious
    Probably not that
bro the cut was in the perfect time, thanks for making me laugh
Cinematic masterpiece. 10/10
This is your teammates fault left always goes no matter what.
That's halfway done... Now you just need to do that on the other goal! Hahaha \o
Ayo lol
![gif](giphy|uv7Y6e1tDuiL82Eu1i)
never played this game, what was that goofy and seemingly random corkscrew jump that the car did? you get hit with a blue shell? how so early in a match?
    You can flip around to gain momentum, smack the ball and what not. Think he was trying to do a front flip to gain speed but accidentally backflipped
    its a dodge. why he did it, \*shrugs\*

(P.S. YOU'VE NEVER PLAYER ROCKET LEAGUE!!!)
As my friend Bruno always says, "we're just giving ourselves a challenge."
Rocket League is the best. What other game or sport has so many ridiculous moments.
There's only up from here
You got a laugh out of me 😂
This is quality. wasnt expecting that - literally LOL'd
Lol
gg
Insane mechanics
Lol the way you cut this made it so much funnier
That was a perfect cut lmao
Lmao
exquisite form.
Laughing to tears here.

Quality content.

Nice one!
    Don't know what it was but I haven't laughed that hard about a post in ages
LMAO
lmao
All I see is that you scored with a fast kickoff
Ayooooo
Me. Definitely me.
Honestly the funniest thing I’ve seen all day
Thanks for the morning chuckle 🤭
truly inspiring
I was not ready for that hahaha
It's like you were asked to excute order 66 mid-kickoff
Damn, that one got me good! LMAO XD
Aye man, that got me
What a perfectly crafted post. Kickoff starts immediately after the average person finishes reading the title to witness *the incident*, and the perfect cutoff at the end before the inevitable own goal only adds to the comedy.

Truly an art piece
I feel your pain. I’ve made it up to C1 and still haven’t looked into how to do these bc I know this is how it’d end 😂
This is rocket league
What a save.
Perfect header
This was my exact response:   \*nods\*  "Perfect." \*more nodding\*
roblox: OOOOOOOOOOF
It's hilarious how perfect this shot is.
Lmao thanks OP
its been a bit since ive had a good laugh on a reddit vid. this one caught me off guard. thank you for this
This made me laugh really well. Thank you
My fucking sides
Nice shot!
Better than me LUL
This is the most This is Rocket League! series of events. Fuckin nailed it bub.
😂😂 u had me with the title not gone lie. Nice shot!
This is truly a rocket league moment, good stuff
This is quality 😂😂😂
The question is:  why do we all laugh on reddit, but everyone ragequits in game?!
LMAO 🤣
Siiiick!!!
Ahahahhaha class thanks
This is Rl in a nut shell
You just made me choke on my boba. Thanks. Lol

Excellent work

If this were my duo and I made first contact I’d somehow still get blamed.
this got a damn good laugh out of me thank you
Next stop: RLCS
So helpful!!! 😂
Funniest title and video combo I've seen in ages. That was legendary
Calculated
lmfao
I just burst out laughing on a flight lmao

Thanks for this! Your speed flip looks great btw!
What a save!
I must be getting rotation coaching lessons from you
Nice one !
"No problem. This is Rocket League. Close one."
I know what the "spanish" kickoff strat is; maybe we could call this one the "Tunisian "?
Fuck. I literally laughed out loud. I have legitimately laughed out loud reading reddit *maybe* 5 times in 10 years.
lol that's awesome.
r/badrocketleaguegoals

This would be one of the best posts that sub has seen
 A goal is a goal, no matter which hole
Nice Shot! What A Save!
This gives me hope for my own non existent rocket league skills
Average bronze lobbies:
Own goals always look so smooth, or deliberate.
This is what I came for. It's more beautiful than I Could have ever imagined.
lmfao
Nice shot!

Nice shot!

Nice shot!
Nice shot!
chef's kiss
i don’t play rocket league but this was funny
hahaha! It’s always a laugh when it happens to somebody else
LMAOOOO
Rarely do I laugh out loud literally on any post about anything. Especially rocket league ones. But this got me. So good!
Thank you for this!
Lmao this is the only post all day that made me actually laugh.
jajajajajajajjaaj tremendo!
This is Rocket League!
Thank you for this needed a laugh
Hahhahahhahahhahah. The speed on that flip was insane.
that was fast
![gif](giphy|LOcPt9gfuNOSI|downsized)
Damn, needed this laugh today.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
![gif](giphy|MUeQeEQaDCjE4)
Glad the video ended, you almost own goal'd, traitor.
This shit gets better each watch
"Nice shot!"
Ope
Man your teammate shouldn’t have gone for it
You made my day. Thanks for the laugh lol!
👨🏼‍🦲
50% of the time it works every time 😉
And that’s where you swear hard at the screen! Lol.
best clip of 23.
I just laughed out loud at work. Ok time to get off reddit.
To be fair, kick-off wasn’t even his. It was his teammate. Left always goes.
Some reason i never bothered to learn it and im in champ
story of my fuckin life 💀
Best damn thing I've seen in a while. Thanks for the laugh!
I haven't ever laughed this hard in my whole life
I mean it was a cool shot kinda but hella funny though 🤣🤣🤣
💀💀💀💀💀
This is one of those own goals where you start spamming "skip" before the replay even happens and when no one skips you have to look away pretending it didn't happen.
Too much skill bro
Perfected it
Nice Shot!
The teammates I get in tournaments
Amazing way to go 2 nil down at 4.17. Insta forfeit lol
Bruh..
This genuinely made me laugh out loud well played!!!
I don’t have a video to prove but I was literally telling my friend got to do speed flips, he told me let’s go in a 2s and try it out. The first time he tried it, he went too far left, making it pinch off the wall at around 80mph and it grazed my roof and flew into the goal, the time didn’t even go down by a second.

Edit: First time he tried it in a real game.
Why is this so relatable?
Oh neat, someone is sharing what they learned. I'd like to get better at kickoff, let's see what they do here aaaand.... okay then 😂😂
Meanwhile I'm at champ 2, give or take, and still not flipping until I'm at the ball. Lol
happens to the best of us
Your TM instantly left the game didn’t he
r/meirl
Calculated!
Peak performance right here.
I wouldn't even be mad at you but I would be roasting your ass for sure
LMAO
Finally a good post on this smurfing subreddit
r/unexpected rocket league edition so many of us had to chuckle
I hope you blamed your teammate for not covering that, then FF immediately.
I uncontrollably laughed at this for a good two minutes. I needed that thank you lmao
LOL.....get the fuck outta here "ME'
Murphy's law
This is absolutely hilarious. I don't now what i was expecting but it definitely wasn't that.
Bruh the ending was cut perfectly LOL
wild
I love the early cut away too.
NRG will be calling!
The sound that came out of my face as I finished reading the title at the same time as your redirect
Nice Shot!
yes...
😂😂😂
I am fucking cackling, this is the perfect post
Friggin LOL. Love this post
Damn teammate, “what a save” am I right!? psssh 🙄
Gc2 here, you’re doing amazing!!!
Whoops…

    

https://tenor.com/bntQm.gif
Skills to pay the bills as they say
I needed this today. Thank you hahaha
Jesus effin' Christ I peed myself, thank you very much XD
This is the first Reddit post in weeks that actually made an “lol” an actual chuckle and not a sharp nasal exhale.
The speed with which I would quit....this made me do big lol
Wrong goal 😂
Speedflips no clue how yo do them tried many times and practise and still can't, lol
“Calculated”
Laughing out loud hahahaha.  Well played
I laughed so hard, a mf pulled a helmet off my head talking bout some "welcome back"
lmaooo
Done the same too. Just pretend no one seen. And be the first to skip the replay
Perfection
200 IQ play right there!
Assuming this pinched off your post into the opponents net
why am i banned when i played a whole game
Nailed it 👍
*proceeds to what a save teammate 3 times and forfeit*
I’m sorry it was perfectly cut
Pls teach me how you do it
😂😂😂
Honestly great pass
Keep this up, soon you’ll be on your way to Plat
U killed me🤣🤣🤣🤣
I keep getting back to this post, it's so good
    [deleted]
        No, this is perfection as it is! Every second to the cut
That was definitely fast!
This is so perfect 🤣
This is late but thanks, might be the funniest rocket league post I've ever seen
Made me fart at my boss, also Thank You!
    Made me fart in a bag and throw it over the cubicle wall

Wdym?? look at that amazing redirect, gotta be at least grandsilver
They always get first touch and it's rarely bad for me.
    Yeah, it still seems like a 50/50 to me whenever they do it (low diamond). a 0.25 second earlier hit isn't going to be the difference between me hitting and missing unless I'm trying to do some weird funny shit or wasn't paying attention and started late
No, this is perfection as it is! Every second to the cut
I came multiple times and summoned the tooth fairy
    Do you cum human teeth?
        Don’t worry about that.
            *I'm really really really worried about that.*
                So is his doctor
                    As his doctor I can say this is totally normal
    Made me vomit Jesus H. Christ and time travel 60 days into the future, thanks!
Nah that's for gifs that have so much going on in a single loop it feels like a movie. This is more r/bettereveryloop
By not knowing your next move, yourself.  Meth counts.

Edit* took me a few tries to get good words.
    I hate when the good words hide in my mouth and not my brains for making keyboard words.

I see people try this corkscrew method constantly, yet they almost never hit the ball before me just driving straight up to it. 

I’m assuming it’s a proper thing in champion ?
    If executed perfectly he would hit the ball first as he would have more speed than a normal boost and flip. Those who can do it well enough can get a powerful shot off at goal. 

OP is showing us a new meta.
        I mean, he got a powerful shot off at goal too, he just didn't hit it first.
    In my experience usually someone at C2 or higher rank can do it the proper way more consistently, and if you aren't doing the proper speedflip opposite to them, or just driving while boosting, you'll be cleanly beat to the ball on kickoff. You won't even be able to get any touch if opponent does an ideal speed flip in such cases.
    Lol no

Lots of people try it, few can connect consistently, and those who can have no variability, so it's easily countered
    what is corkscrew method?
        What OP tried and failed in the clip. Usually they land right in front/hit the ball
    yeah in c2 i can do them with like 60% effectiveness, if i mess up its a kickoff of death for my teammate directly into our corner lol
What's wrong with those guys
