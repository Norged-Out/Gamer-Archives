    No dad we're losing because you're fucking ballchasing
        I fucked grandma
            🤫
    My dad helped guide me thru Zelda 2 on the NES, I will help guide him to Musty Flick in 2020
    No dad but this one guy keeps saying he fuck my mom every night
        Yeah I do say that to you every night dont I son? Bahahaha!!!
    AYE-AYE CAPTAIN!
my son and I play sometimes and are champ level but weve never actually worked on set plays.  he kinda just aggressively ball chases and does his flippy stuff and I play good position and make nice passes
    Haha sounds like the perfect dynamic
        That’s the kind of team I feel like can do well.  I was C3 playing with a friend who is mechanically way beyond me (he is mid tier GC).  I play good position, ready for passes, rotate appropriately, and don’t double commit.  I only recently started to off the wall air dribble and ceiling shots are mystical to me.

C3...  but then playing by myself, I maintained C3 for a while and then slowly dropped.  Alllllll the way to Plat 3 (while still C2 in Standard).  

The further down I went, the more my teammates blamed me. Lol.  And from my view, I’m sitting there watching them chase the ball and call me a ball chaser when I see them fail to rotate out after like 3 challenges on the ball and I think they are finally rotating out only to turn back.

I’m back to D1 or D2 by myself now, readjusted to my teammates.  

I miss my friend.  He hasn’t been on in a while.
            bad times ahead.

maybe no computer. 

maybe no home.

i will go way, but we are two of soul.

i will return.
                I didnt come here to cry :'(
                    pow right in the feels
                    we never do, yet this quote always hits us
                Is Mell My Fingers. No Mell is not my fingers

/s I know what it says.
            My regular doubles partner is like this. He insists that if he’s working the ball im supposed to just sit back and wait for the center. Even if the ball gets behind him and goes for corner boost I’m not supposed to touch it back in. I’m supposed to wait then go back to goal if he looses. We’re stuck at Gold 2.
                oof lmao, your partners an idiot
                Unless you REALLY like him, you should definitely get a new partner
                    For real.

There does not seem like anything useful going on here
                Theres definitely instances where it might be okay to chill in the corner, *eg.* the enemy has no chance of winning a 5050 and your tm8s far-ish away. But generally, if you whiff your corner play, your teammate *should* be in position to attempt a play (challenge or shadow) while you position to protect the net

                    Ok but like why bring politics into this?
            I played 2s with a friend for like the first two years RL was out, and when he stopped playing I just never really wanted to play it solo queueing. It just didn't feel right.

It's painful when you lose your doubles partner.
            This. Everytime I fall below d3, everyone calls me a ballchaser
            I literally quit rocket league because of that. 


The community is toxic sometimes. I played for 2 years and it was the most fun a video game ever brought me. The toxicity of the players is fucking bad. I played last month for shits and giggles and the chat was off the wall. 

Yes I know you can block them but still uncalled for.
            I think if u can drop down from c3 all the way to plat, you don't belong in champion
                Good team combos go a long way
                    For real. I ranked from plat 3 to diamond 2 playing with a random who I had good chemistry with. Guy was really toxic in our first game, but we got paired like 4 games in a row and won all of them so I was like dude.. party up with me? And he was like sure and I got there in one day on the largest win streak I’ve ever had. Then we lost a few and he started being toxic again so I unfriended him and haven’t seen him since. Ah, rocket league
                Yeah, well, that’s just like, your opinion, man.

E:  but seriously, together we were beating GCs regularly.  And I would end up with MVP a third of the time.  It’s not like he did alllll the work, but we really jived well and just knew what the other was going to do.
                    I believe you man, y’all had chemistry and were better Than the sum of your parts
                    Trust me, you definitely didn't deserve to be champion if you deranked to plat. I'm not exactly mechanically great at the game but I have a hard time losing games two ranks below what I'm usually at if I'm even remotely trying.

                            Yes, it may be awkward but if you have the ability to be in GC, then it shouldn't even remotely be an issue to play around diamonds to win games.
                                [deleted]
                                    How’d u get that username, that’s dope
                                Sometimes if I fall into diamond, I play worse coz I’m trying to rotate and give my teammate space. And then they suck and we lose. Basically I’m overly nice because I expect too much from them. I have to play more aggressively (but still avoid double commits) to run diamond games and get back to champ. It can be tricky to find the right pace when you fall below your rank, in my experience.
                                    This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
                                You’re focusing on mechanics and not team play.  My point is both are equally important and when you master both is when you’re a GC.  My team play is heightened.  My ground mechanics are good (can dribble the crap out of just about anyone.  I can’t air dribble well or do ceiling shots, and defending off the backboard I’m inconsistent.
                                    It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack. 
Look at Squishy when he plays with randos, sometimes the rando gets mvp because Squishy just set up that perfect centre ball 18 times in a row and the rando just hammered it home.
                                    I'm not focusing on mechanics. You don't need good mechanics to get out of diamond. Mine are shit and I have no trouble getting out of the rank if I ever find myself in it. And you certainly don't need to be able to air dribble to get out of diamond (or any rank really).
                            Is your reddit tag really u/Tuesday ? Damn lmao
                        To be fair when I'm at a friend's place who is diamond and I play a game on his rank (around dia 1/2) I have a hard time to win if I use the same mentality/game plan as I would on GC.

Of course when I start to chase I win, but that's just because I'm way faster
                            Oh yeah, it's certainly awkward as hell to play around people who clearly barely think half the time and you have to change up your method a bit to get the wins. But to derank to plat from gc when you stop playing with your premade, you never deserved gc to begin with.
                                I mean when that guy perfected his supportive playstyle but is dogsh*t at carrying himself, I could imagine he would drop a lot when you solo q. But I agree that GC to plat is a bit too much
                                    thats kind of the point though, supporting a GC isn't the same as being a GC. It just makes it easier for a GC to carry you. It sounds harsh but its just a brutal reality that rocket league is about fluid transitions between offense and defense and if you are unable to convert possessions into goals and need to always rely on your team to score off plays you make then you're just being carried. Most decent champ players can learn to be passing focused if they have a GC on their team that they can just constantly set up for goals but that won't help them improve if they can't take powerful and accurate shots themselves or have powerful and accurate placement on aerials.
                                    Hey now, I didn’t drop from GC to plat.

It was from C3 to plat.  Lol

I wasn’t there long but damn do I hate D1 and D2
                        If he got there without having to be carried every game then he deserves to be there.

I'm very similar to OP in terms of play style but only ever solo queue and have been bouncing between D2 to C3 in standard since season 8/9. Currently high C2 but it would only take a string of games with people not playing as a team or just sheer bad luck to send me back down to ranks were it seems even harder to have a win streak.
                            It's annoying when that happens isn't it? I was dipping from diamond to plat 3 for a while and nearly dipped into plat 2. 
I finally got sick of it and started just playing last man back, I'd only shoot on open nets or clearances, wouldn't overcommit ever. 

With just that one change I was back in D1 within a day, as teammates stopped bleeding goals and I was easily able to keep out the relatively weak shots at Plat level.
                        It sounds like he is incapable of any form of solo carrying at that level. If he's truely a defensive player and passer then the issue is probably around him being unable to actually convert opportunities into goals by himself which means he relies on the other teammates. That can be an issue. I know i struggle more playing in mid to high diamond than i do champ1 and 2 and its mainly because my strength is around my speed and setting up teammates. I can dribble and shoot when the opportunity is there but Diamond and their stupid as hell rotations throw me off which lead to low scoring games going into overtime where Champ 1 feels more like a stomp once my teammates stop being stupid.
                I solo queue exclusively. I've dropped from C3 down to D1 a couple of times, but made it back eventually. You actually have to change your play style in order to climb back up. It can be tough
                A team with good dynamics is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts.
                At the same time in champ 3 you cannot win with just 1 good player and then a play 3 player... at least not regularly
            Are we the same person? Literally story of my life.
            I was low diamond got knocked back down to gold a couple times.  The more you lose, the more tilted you get, and the worse your teammates get, and it just feels impossible to put a solid win streak together so you can recover.
            Hmu man. I've no mechanical skill but great rotations, passes, and very rarely get bad 50s
            this sounds exactly like what happens to me.  I play amazing in champ with fellow good players but solo queue will have me to plat3/D1 in no time and I'll get blamed for not being able to read my tm8s big brain plays
        It’s literally the Sizz/Rizzo playstyle lol
    My son is 6 and I just tell him to demo everyone
        My six year old and I play with bots and I just turned them up to “pro”. He loves rocket league!
            I do this with my wife lol.
                What is this wife DLC?
                    Yea I got the child bundle and I might refund honesty.
    God I can’t wait to have a son.
        God I can’t wait to have a dad.
            Son it's me your dad. Where is my Father's Day gift?
        Imagine your wife not wanting your kid to play video games...
            *divorce intensifies*
            Thank god she plays more than me then!
                It would be cool to have parents who like video games
                    I haven't played video games with my dad since he got me N64 around 20 years ago. Everything nowadays gives him a headache from all the moving around.
                        I can't relate enough XD. I'm a PC player but everytime I play on my PS4 he baits me away from the tv and takes the controller. Literally 1 minute in, "Oh come on HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS!" "**I CAN'T EVEN SEE MYSELF [NANI]**"
                            My parents used to call all my games „Nindumbo“ even if they weren’t Nintendo lol
                                Thats the most boomer shit i've ever heard.
                        Well time to find a new dad
                    My dad is such a boomer he literally did worse than recruit bots on bo2. I honestly doubt he'd make it past gold but who knows maybe he just secretly has insane game sense or something.
                My mom and I used to play Hydro Thunder and Tony Hawk Pro Skater alllllll the time back on the PS1. I’ll have to buy her a PS4 when the THPS remake comes out (I really hope it has a multiplayer).
            This guy knows what’s up
            [deleted]
            I know someone with a wife like this... It’s very sad.
            Or your wife not wanting kids at all...
        The first few years are.... Tough. Instead of playing games, you'll get thrown up on.
Instead of playing catch, you'll get shat on. 
Got used to changing a nappy and have a boy? Prepare for the piss fountain. 
Sleep? Nah.
Sleep during the day to recover? Double nah.
When the grandparents take him, think you'll have time to rest? The house needs cleaning. Crack on. 
Oh the kids back, he's shat himself. Your parents haven't changed him. Crack on. 

This goes on for maybe 2 years?
            Can confirm

Source: am a dad
            Yeah, as a currently childless adult I'm still plenty busy enough with the house. There's always something to do even outside of work. I can't imagine what state my home would be in with a baby around. Enjoy that free time, kids!
        It's not just have a son. I have two. They totally suck at games until they are around 10. At least I hope it's ten, because it sure isn't 8.
            cannot confirm, have a 10 year old that's still very much bronze
                I love how many dads there are on this subreddit
                    don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing RL with my son and he asks me to play as well.....but we mostly stick to games vs the bots.

it's still great bonding time as I spend the time after he goes to bed trying to be a 35 year old GC.
                    It’s just because the ladies love a gamer
        My husband and 4 year old daughter play rocket league and other games all the time!
        Has son. Son: "dad can we go play real soccer?"
            Not until you practice your air dribbles Timmy
                countless times while watching soccer i scream at the tv do a aerial dribble no one can stop you. its frustrating
        ....I cant wait to have a dad ....
        Son or daughter or whatever, my kid(s) will hopefully be gamers. If not, that’s cool...yep
    i love these father/son storys


honestly so heart warming to hear🥺
    Man that's how my buddy and I play.  When he's on I'm fine in champ and when he's not I sink to plat lmfao
        I'm the opposite when I solo q I get in a tryhard mindset but when I'm with friends I trust them more and it usually doesn't work as well
    This is me and my buddy. He is a beast in front of goal but can come up short on his wall hits/dribbles.

I attac, he protec, all the wins we collec.
    Omg this sounds exactly like me and my younger brother. Me being you and my brother being your son. Saucy skills + good fundamentals = fun times
    Is your dad Sizz?
    “His flippy stuff” haha I love it
    Frickin ball chasers
    are you me and my son?
    Do you ever fantasize about  what your  rank would be if you had had a nice child instead?
    My son is 14 now, has 1/3 of my hours and we're exactly the same!
        almost same here! he is 15 and I have like 6000 hours and he has 1500 lol
    Sounds like rizzo and sizz
    You're the center midfielder he needs in his life :D
    Very similar (although diamond rank) we call it striker son and defensive dad!
    My son and I also play but he’s 6 so he puck chases and occasionally hits me while laughing very hard.
    omg please post some game footage
    Wow, you genuinely can stomach a ball chaser and not a bat an eye. Unconditional love doesn’t allow you. I’m jealous.
    The perfect dad. Way to go man!
My friend and I play and our user names are “Thanks Dad” and “Don’t Tell Mom”

We may have to borrow this move for doubles
    Make sure you give it back to him after
        Heh
    If you changed one to "Please Daddy" the tone would shift dramatically.
My son has trouble even hitting the ball still... he has only played a couple games, and he's improving.. 

We were playing heatseeker. I was sitting in the goal, and he was just outside,  trying to block the incoming ball.  Everytime he missed he would say "dad! Oh good save." And a couple "dad! Oh I got it! Yes!"
    Sweet :)
    Wholesome :)
    That's pretty much the opposite of me and my kid, he's plat and I'm unranked. He'll 1 v 2 me and his sister and crush us lol.
        it's surprisingly easy to do that sort of thing if you're playing against people worse than you, a little consistency / skill goes a LONG way in rocket league
    [deleted]
        That's why the controllers stay on top of the TV stand....

...Or maybe it's because Dad was up until 3:30 doing heatseekers and didn't want to wake up yet. Maybe. 

Either way, my 6 year old barely even stays on task... Timer counts, I serve, they return, and... He's gone.

"Milo? Where were you?"

"Daddy, I find this cool glitch where you can drive on the roof!"
            man why cant my dad be like yall lmao
My dad can barely drive a real car. Pretty sure his rocket league game would suffer. I’m jealous.
    It's funny, my dad taught me so much about cars. Drag raced, etc, always had performance cars, always had a 60's GTO (varying years, but had at least one at all times in my life), but now that I've got a son I recently picked up my "dream dad car", a Giulia Quadrifoglio. 

Drive up 9 hours to visit my dad to show him I learned the lessons of cool dad cars well, and I know my motor revs quick but damn did he miss shifts like he was a teenager who doesn't know what a clutch is. 

...My car is paddle shifted. Sigh, guess I gotta get him on RL.
I play with my dad too. He's been playing for a few years and is still bronze. He may actually be silver now but he won't go much higher. It's still fun to play sometimes. 

Once in a while the matchmaking will do its job and we will get a string of really good games that are close.

It's a real treasure to play with a parent/child.
    I’m hoping to have something like this with my future children. My mom and dad never did much gaming themselves and they never try it because “their hand-eye coordination sucks” I just can’t get them to try a video game and I know they might not be that great but I live in a family of 4 as the only person that play video games.
        Haha yeah. They aren't wrong too! First game I ayed with my dad was the original Cod. He just sat in front of a tree and said how life like it looked and those trees look horrendous now!

My mom got into a few games as well. Some were plants (plats?) vs zombies, bejewelled and machinarum.

And yes, my first is 16 mo this old. I can't wait to share my gaming experience with him and join him to create his experience with whatever the future of our hobby holds.
    Same with mine. We got the game together 4 years ago. He’s still bronze and I’m gc. I made a second account to play ranked with him though. It’s pretty nice to stay in touch with the family through Video games while I’m away at college
        Our roles are reversed (I'm C3 and my son is Bronze).  It felt dirty creating a second account to play ranked with him.  But I'm pretty good about playing like a Bronze when we play together.
            Yes same for me. It’s a strictly no sweat account (unless people are being toxic) and I let him challenge most balls while I sit back on defense and boom clears. We win about 50% of games and have fun doing it
Great pass. Nice shot
    What a save!
        What a save!

Great, I wish I will have a son kicking it with me
    I'm imagining a wild future where your stereotypical sports dad is pushing RL. No son! You get in there and you practice yer got dang musty flicks! Ain't no school gonna give money to a kid that can't flick!
        You wanna go to that party? Only if you beat me in a 1v1.
            ゴ^ゴ^^ゴ^^^ゴ
        And he always tells the story of how he would've made it pro if he didn't break his thumb that one time.
            If coach woulda put me in game 5, we'd be CRL champions. No doubt in my mind.
                How much you wanna bet I can flick it over ‘em mountains?

Slap butt, for all the veterans out there.
    Came here looking for this
Love the fact that's you and your father!

I want to believe that's a good bonding activity for you guys!

(I get frustrated a lot by teammates, I can see that going very wrong if it was my father lol)
    *Misses open net while down one with 10 seconds left*

“...go to your room.”
        “But we’re already in my room!”
    My 24 year old son and I have never been super close. But when he visits, he brings his PS4 and we play for a few hours (we are both Plat I in doubles).

It's one of my favorite things to do.
        That's so sweet :) I know your son cherishes those moments.
        Yo, this is kinda unrelated to the sub but I hear that kinda thing being said by the children usually, not the parent because it's usually inferred that burden of having a close relationship between child and parent would lie mostly on the parent so you don't really hear a parent admit to not having close relationship with their offspring. That's why I thought it was super interesting that you'd say that as a parent. What do you think made it this way for you guys?
            He was my toughest - oldest of three kids, always in trouble (minor stuff) until he got to be 16-ish. His younger sister and brother were just easier and we connected better I guess.

It's not a great thing to admit.
                It's admirable to be honest to yourself as well as to others.
                    Thanks, man.
            "I fucked his mom." -OP, Probably.
                Well, yes but also other things
        I had a step-dad until I was 19. Then they split. I'm almost 30 now wishing I had *some* kinda paternal relationship. I'm getting supremely jealous of the idea of being able to play something with "dad". 

I'm going to start taking applications. 🤷‍♂️
    I get frustrated with teammates too.

When my son wasnt very good, it came out at times... 

He's way better now... even goes up for aerials, and demos well. Love telling opponents they got beat by a 9yr old.

We both still suck at dribbling.
    I’ve found that when I’m teamed up with someone I simply have so much more fun that the mistakes aren’t an issue.
Me and my buddy do the same but I just line up with the goal and he pounds my pipes!
    
>and he pounds my pipes!

are we.. are we still talking about Rocket League?
        We all play on our lunch break at work. We hired a guy who said he could play. He could not. Constantly ran into us. Thus the term “pipe pounding” was born. You’re free to use it.
    Sounds enjoyable.
        It’s too personal to capture on film.
You are playing for over 4 years and you still use camera shake?
*four years of camera shake*
    That's all I was thinking when I was watching this
    I was thinking this too
    And default POV
Nice funhaus flag
    Ehhhhh gotta represent!
    I rewatched a few times so I could see if it was funhaus, it looked like it but couldn't get a good shot. Funhaus is the only gaming channel I've ever really liked, one of the only channels I've consistently watched for a while as well it's great.
        Yeah, I saw a orange circle and assumed it was funhaus. But yeah, funhaus is one of the only reasons I watch YouTube anymore. There's been so many great memories from the channel. My favorite is quoting funhaus to my clueless friends
            "Ska became before reggae only because I allowed it" never fails to confuse!



Easily one of the most quotable channels in my opinion, I find myself not even meaning to sometimes it just comes naturally lol
                "There is no oral etiquette, we get it and that's it!"
There's so many times in day to day life where I'm reminded of a funhaus quote.
4 years are not enough to change camera settings
"Superduper Kill" - thats so "dad-like" xD
Nice flag.
My dad said he was going out to buy me Rocket League 5 years ago and still ain’t made it back from
the store yet.
:)
Hit em with the father-son combo
Wait, are you telling me you can do this consistently?
    Yeah you can, me and my buddy use this kickoff a lot.
    My brother and I do this. We call it "the play!"
Ah the classic reverse leap frog maneuver,well done indeed.
200 IQ play
this is amazing tell us more about playing with a dad.
    Sad but you get my upvote
w h o l e s o m e
Wholly shit I wish my dad didn’t sit on his arse saying he’d rather play forza
    Honestly, the game doesn't really matter. Focus on your dad. Will you look back and regret not spending some time gaming just because he likes a different car game? Maybe he will play some RL after a Forza sesh.
        Yeah, we have a great relationship, we play golf together regularly, his gaming point of view is just a bit different that’s all 😂
    Does he play Horizon, Motorsport or both? Either way ask him if he can flip his car in Forza.
Good play but jesus christ fix ur camera settings
This is some inazuma 11 shit
that's amazing haha
I've been done like this recently and was amazed, might have been you lol.
You didn't kill them you superduper killed them
Superduper goal
Damn wish I could do this with my dad
    My dad and I had a similar play but it was was more like:

*Dad left the match*
    Cat was like: "I have a dad"
almost makes me want to bring a kid into this world. 

solid move
    Raising a sniveling child born unto my own image? Meh. 

Growing a rocket league teammate from scratch? Yeaaaa
My 13 year old son is at the point now where he has gotten good and confident enough to be competitive, but it has made him a chaser.  Just trying to calm him down and make him rotate more, but we still have a blast even when we lose.
Peekaboo!
My friend and I call this the "stop n pop"
4 years with camera shake and hasn’t changed camera settings, that’s nutty.
Classic!
So you've been playing for 4 years... And you STILL have camera shake on
He didn't tell him to disable cs, he just want him to do it
That's awesome that your dad plays too. You're a lucky guy!
I do it with my brothers. One of them says "Stop the ball" on the kickoff so I try to do a kickoff that blocks the most angles so he can cheat and do that.
Your dads name is superduper killer? Damn, what a cool dad.
Good ol' slap butt
Nice shot!
But what You're REALLY saying is he always goes high and you always go low
This is what me and my brother do all the time too. He calls it a hang shot and it’s beautiful when it works out.
The ol shake n bake
My friend and I do pretty much the same thing except he hits me into the ball for a pool shot
That's sick my man!
Same. My brother and I call it the stale mate. In 3s a person always follows up for it instead of getting a boost. It doesn't happen all the time but we're over 50 percent on at least the taking the shot so we figure it's worth it
This is planned? Damn!
Idk what rank you are but my duos parter an I used to get soo many cheap goals like this.  But once we reached about D3/C1 it doesn't really work too often anymore.  The opponent taking the kickoff doesn't really allow the ball to stall like that, plus the other opponent is usually fast enough to grab the back boost and make it back for the save.
Me and my GF do this together, we call it the “creep”.

We also have other sayings when we play.

Fumbling around in the net is “Turtling”

If the ball is going in “slut”

If the ball misses the net “virgin”

Getting demo’d is “blasted”
4 years with those camera settings? Hold up
I LOVE playing with my 12 year old step-son.  He likes it too, though he sometimes gets a little annoyed because I'm not nearly as good as he is.  But playing with him is just a blast.
This is so basic, ppl upvoting just for your dad
The father and son fake we should call this
"I love it when a plan comes together" - OP's dad, probably.
That is one of the simplest, purest, most beautiful plays I have ever seen.
That was clean as hell
KNOCK IT IN, DAD!  SIIIICK!
Me and my brother’s signature move is missing the ball.
Thats so cool man, wish my dad would play games with me
That’s fire
there’s a snowy map?
You guys just gave me the best 2s tactic. Thank you.
The ole Settle and Smash kickoff. Nice
Aye the funhaus flag! I've never seen anyone else use it!
Enjoy this time and the bond it gives you with your old man. My dad and I used to bond through gaming together, and this post made me miss him desperately. 

Nice moves though
Whew. Thought you copied mine, the old ram him into the ball method. What a save!
Just putting this out there, my dad bought Hellfire lmao. He said “don’t tell mom or she’ll kill me”
and the funhaus flog to rep
You’ve been playing for 4 years? That’s quite the long match
You and your dad?  Epic!!   I miss my dad. Keep playin boys 👍
I'm jealous
Very noice if I could give more than one like I definitely would
Me and a buddy do a similar thing, but usually it entails one of us just straight up ramming the ball full speed while yelling
Imagine having a parent that doesn't think videogames are made by the devil, for "sinners" to play.
my dad introduced the game to me when i was like 12 :) been playing since s1 and still play with him every time possible even though our skill difference is pretty large now
Thats fucking awesome! I play games with my dad too( cod, blur, mario party, stuff like that), gotta love parents that are willing to dive into their kids interests
u/vredditdownloader
Awesome goal, love the FH aerial too
That's awesome
Teamwork makes the dream work
And that’s on having dad.... 😢
Teach me the ways please?!!!
I wish my parents would take an interest in the things that I like to do lol 🥲
    Took me years of convincing him to play. Keep expressing your interest to them. I’m sure someday they will listen :)
Nice 👍, but PLEASE turn off camera shake
    He might like it, its not up to others to tell him to turm it off😳😂
        Agreed, I know it's nice advice and probably one of the first things committed players do

But going full <<PLEASE turn it off>> it's just disrespectful. If it bothers you, it's your problem. If you wanted to give solid advice, there are better ways
            exactly, I feel some people think because they take the game seriously, everyone else has too, life dont work lile that lol
4 years and you still have camera shake on, how do you live?
A signature move that only works if your opponent sucks at kickoff... lol. 9/10 driving completely straight into the ball is not going to do what you want it to. Cool idea to use against people that don’t care about how the kickoff goes tho. Good synergy.
Been playing with camera shake on for 4 years?🤨 im amazed just at that alone
Been playing for 4 years. But still use camera shake
Oh, oh no... *camera shake on*
4 years and still using those camera settings? Lol
Camera shake
4 years with camera shake
Not just yours, it's a solid strategy but easily defensible.
That looked 100% accidental
Calculator
Bruh XD
[Son, is that you?](https://www.gifyourgame.com/ManyShabbySamuraigoroh)
I wish I had a dad
I have a similar one but i just bump the ball to a side and my friend scores a goal from the middle
God, the execution was godlike.
Me and my buddy call that the "shake n bake"
That's fireeeeee
My roommate and I do the same thing and call it "the special." Any extra hits and it's a "special, extra mayo," sometimes with "pickle on the side."
That name sounds norwegian. are u norwegian? jus wondring
me & my bro do this all the time! all about timing that jump
Holy shit this game is 4 years old already? Now I feel old
Other team should know better than to have the free player charge for the ball in duos.
I have only played rocket league once, so I’m terrible at it, but this was really cool to watch. How successful is this move?
Me and my 2's teammate (D3 in 2's) use this often (maybe not the hopping part, the cheating part). It is astonishing how effective this is.
My dad’s signature move is abandoning the game after 1 goal is scored
Next you need to pick it in the air lol
By the time I was born (im the youngest of 4), my dad had developed back problems that prevented him from playing sports with me growing up, so he played video games with me instead, and those are some of the best memories I have of my childhood.  Makes me really happy to see that there are many dads out there doing the same.  Y'all are the real MVPs.
That’s a nice move
My friends and I do that too. Usually when we need a goal we try to hit the opposing player head on to stop the ball for a free shot on goal for the guy starting in front of goal. Has proved clutch! Also can work against you if he arrives too late.

We also do the “pinch” with the four people set up out wide and we both try to hit the same part of the ball that’s closest to our goal. If we hit it right it puts the ball in front of the opposing goal and sometimes we score an absolute banger. The highest I can remember is a 97 mph goal from it. It is also clutch.
Good shit
Holy fuck this has been mine and my friends strategy for 4 years. We call it the Pancake, used to be more effective in bronze
Non-player here.

Did you guys just break the game
This made my day
AYY FUNHAUS
What’s this term “dad” someone explain?
I'm not crying you're crying
That shit was CLEAN
Must be nice to play videogames with your dad. Mine just yells at me and we resent each other everyday.
Is your surname associated to a part of a boat?
I understand why you think that
4 years in and still those cam settings??
***Embrace the stupidity and just enjoy dad jokes
Slick af
Hell yeah, pigeon squad loves to execute that move too!!
Thats some high risk high reward shit.
Shake and bake
Calculated.
That is so so cool.
what a combo
Nasty.
My son is 4 right now. I cannot wait for him to be of age when we can realistically play together...

...daddy needs to be carried
RESONANCE!
That’s awesome that your dad plays with you. He sounds like a great person !
Dope that you and your dad play video games together.
I think this may be the first time I’ve seen someone other than myself using the Funhaus flag
Haha I played this once and was so bad at it every other player left the session.
good ole disjointed double rush
May I suggest a very basic, yet much better kickoff that will serve you well until at least champ:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoTCU1fwBAU&feature=youtu.be&t=200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoTCU1fwBAU&feature=youtu.be&t=200)
How often does that work
The ol’ one two as Martin Tyler would say it.
My thoughts exactly. This isn’t “🖕”
Pretty sure this is everyone's go to move LOL but congrats on you and you dad gaming together.
Your signature move relies on luck and hope that they dont sit back and defend?
Shake and bake!
Great video and great goal 🥰

But a tip from me for a better experience from the game, turn off the camera shake
My friend and I have been doing that a lot now but I will allow your copyright over the signature move
when this first came out pa4 had it free, one of the best freebies evee
I play with my 6 year old step son. He’s actually getting surprisingly good!
that's awesome! I love team kickoffs where there is a plan. do you have any tips to make sure the ball just dies @ midfield? or is it more just try your best to hit it dead center and have tm8 cheat up and just hope it works out and the ball gets killed and doesn't pinch out? curious to know!

also, try this one: when you guys are lined up side-by-side parallel in front of the net: have 1 of you boost + dodge into the other. the extra launch gives you time to beat the enemy to the kickoff ball.
Simple yet effective
That’s the ol fakker rush
I thought u wew going for a left eave dash. U faked me through a vid sir, congrats!
Signature move? Everybody does this
Shake and Bake!!!
We got BRUCES GOOSES AND HIS SON ADAMS MADAMS
Thats EVIL, i love it. The ball being stopped happens to me soooo often but my teammates are never coordinated enough to do something like this. Its just...perfect! Take an upvote my friend
4 years but default camera settings.
Perfect deception!

I like that you block the shot/clear with your jump. Most players will focus on the player with the moving nameplate. The fact that he rushes in straight from net keeps his nameplate steady. 

Curious how it works out, if the kickoff doesn't deaden the ball in the middle. As the goalie's momentum is screaming down midfield, I ask, what is the backup plan?
we call that the "chip skylark"
The titles better then the clip.
Slapbutt
How often can you pull this off? Do people try to counter it after you land?
me and my friend have a similar one, just that one of us is just standing in fron of the ball and the other bumps into the one standing. believe it or not we made a couple of goals with this tactic.
This is much better than the dad playing Warzone with his 6 yr old! Awesome move too!
SHAKE AND BAKE
Pretty good
Savage!
Holy crap I deadlifted 405!
Shake and Bake!
why are the graphics so goooood
I see Funhaus flag, I upvote
(X) doubt
Shake and bake
Shake n' Bake!
10/10
Now it's my move 😈
Shake and Bake
That's not signature, that's basic? Everyone I know, trys to accomplish that easy 3 second win.
That is actually many peoples strategy. Although very cool, it’s nothing new.
.



I yoinked the rest of last weekends gp
Was that screen shake bullshit setting. So 4 years in and you still have that enabled. That's what I got from the video
how do you play for 4 years and still have camera shake on
My duo partner and I do something similar! We call it 'live and die by the sword' because we're not nearly as in sync as you both are and sometimes we score and other times.....
Well played. I'm lucky to hit the ball when I want to lol
I bet when you have a son as well you ll be a great 3s team
rad.
They have family ties.

Edit http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600831h.html
My brother in law and I have been playing since it was released on Xbox and this is the kick off we strive for. Almost guaranteed goal.
Flying V formation
Sick!
Been playing 4 years and still using camera shake? What kind of monster are you?
Watched this while listening to dudesoup lol
Should definitely do a montage of just this play.

 Seriously.
As a Dad that also plays RL with his son, I approve of this and will definitely steal this strategy.

The best part about playing video games with your son as he goes from teen to adult is the smack talk, especially when I tell him I'm going to have sex with his Mom later.
That’s sick
I got into this game because my kid got it for free with his video card. 2 years later he has 1 hour, I have 860 :/
Turn camera shake off and increase your fov
That was clean!
Beside that move i love that you play together i too am waiting so i can play with my son, his gonna be 10 soon but we only have one computer and the wife does not want me to buy a pc for him lol
Hey man, nice shot.
That is the most wholesome dope shit I ever saw
The slap butt
Useful shot that, useful
Its so wholesome and cool to see a dad and his kid(s) play games, i remember my dad and me playing some tank game with eachother/against eachother.
Sick
Me and my friend do this except I’m first and I don’t jump. I flip into the ball and he bumps me so hard we smash the ball into the goal its so fun when it works
I got champ for the first time off this move
Noyce.
Freaking Siiick
This "YOU" player is God tier.
That’s awesome to see father and son bonding on a video game. Rather than the dad getting mad because his son is on video games.
Me and may dad also play RL together.  We used to only play CoD together, then we both started playing RL together and have been for years now
I like it
The friends I play with call the freezer
Cool
I’ve been playing hide and seek for 12 years
Looking at these comments makes me wish my dad would play with me 😔
Ahhhh the good ol’ slapbutt with dad
Personally I don't like rocket league, but the fact that you and your dad have a signature move is pretty fucking badass.
You have to have a dad.
Whew.
Username checks out.
The slapbutt
That’s awesome 😄
Glorious
We have the same moove with my brother lol
I wanna be the kind of dad that plays Rocket League with his son
The Stall and Ball
Thats awesome
That is so dirty...I love it
So cool to see it all come together like that!
Ok that’s nice
Good ol peek a boo
4 years and still has camera shake on smh
How is it snow and it's now snow day? Is this a tournament match?
Good ol' Slap Butt
Does your dad have alpha boost??
My son is almost 2. I can't wait to get a controller in his hands for some seriously fun memories. Thank you for the inspiring post stranger!
Ah, so you're the duo that so thoroughly pumbled my asshole...

No dad but this one guy keeps saying he fuck my mom every night
    Yeah I do say that to you every night dont I son? Bahahaha!!!
AYE-AYE CAPTAIN!
Haha sounds like the perfect dynamic
    That’s the kind of team I feel like can do well.  I was C3 playing with a friend who is mechanically way beyond me (he is mid tier GC).  I play good position, ready for passes, rotate appropriately, and don’t double commit.  I only recently started to off the wall air dribble and ceiling shots are mystical to me.

C3...  but then playing by myself, I maintained C3 for a while and then slowly dropped.  Alllllll the way to Plat 3 (while still C2 in Standard).  

The further down I went, the more my teammates blamed me. Lol.  And from my view, I’m sitting there watching them chase the ball and call me a ball chaser when I see them fail to rotate out after like 3 challenges on the ball and I think they are finally rotating out only to turn back.

I’m back to D1 or D2 by myself now, readjusted to my teammates.  

I miss my friend.  He hasn’t been on in a while.
        bad times ahead.

maybe no computer. 

maybe no home.

i will go way, but we are two of soul.

i will return.
            I didnt come here to cry :'(
                pow right in the feels
                we never do, yet this quote always hits us
            Is Mell My Fingers. No Mell is not my fingers

/s I know what it says.
        My regular doubles partner is like this. He insists that if he’s working the ball im supposed to just sit back and wait for the center. Even if the ball gets behind him and goes for corner boost I’m not supposed to touch it back in. I’m supposed to wait then go back to goal if he looses. We’re stuck at Gold 2.
            oof lmao, your partners an idiot
            Unless you REALLY like him, you should definitely get a new partner
                For real.

There does not seem like anything useful going on here
            Theres definitely instances where it might be okay to chill in the corner, *eg.* the enemy has no chance of winning a 5050 and your tm8s far-ish away. But generally, if you whiff your corner play, your teammate *should* be in position to attempt a play (challenge or shadow) while you position to protect the net
            [deleted]
                Ok but like why bring politics into this?
        I played 2s with a friend for like the first two years RL was out, and when he stopped playing I just never really wanted to play it solo queueing. It just didn't feel right.

It's painful when you lose your doubles partner.
        This. Everytime I fall below d3, everyone calls me a ballchaser
        I literally quit rocket league because of that. 


The community is toxic sometimes. I played for 2 years and it was the most fun a video game ever brought me. The toxicity of the players is fucking bad. I played last month for shits and giggles and the chat was off the wall. 

Yes I know you can block them but still uncalled for.
        I think if u can drop down from c3 all the way to plat, you don't belong in champion
            Good team combos go a long way
                For real. I ranked from plat 3 to diamond 2 playing with a random who I had good chemistry with. Guy was really toxic in our first game, but we got paired like 4 games in a row and won all of them so I was like dude.. party up with me? And he was like sure and I got there in one day on the largest win streak I’ve ever had. Then we lost a few and he started being toxic again so I unfriended him and haven’t seen him since. Ah, rocket league
            Yeah, well, that’s just like, your opinion, man.

E:  but seriously, together we were beating GCs regularly.  And I would end up with MVP a third of the time.  It’s not like he did alllll the work, but we really jived well and just knew what the other was going to do.
                I believe you man, y’all had chemistry and were better Than the sum of your parts
                Trust me, you definitely didn't deserve to be champion if you deranked to plat. I'm not exactly mechanically great at the game but I have a hard time losing games two ranks below what I'm usually at if I'm even remotely trying.

                        Yes, it may be awkward but if you have the ability to be in GC, then it shouldn't even remotely be an issue to play around diamonds to win games.
                            [deleted]
                                How’d u get that username, that’s dope
                            Sometimes if I fall into diamond, I play worse coz I’m trying to rotate and give my teammate space. And then they suck and we lose. Basically I’m overly nice because I expect too much from them. I have to play more aggressively (but still avoid double commits) to run diamond games and get back to champ. It can be tricky to find the right pace when you fall below your rank, in my experience.
                                This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
                            You’re focusing on mechanics and not team play.  My point is both are equally important and when you master both is when you’re a GC.  My team play is heightened.  My ground mechanics are good (can dribble the crap out of just about anyone.  I can’t air dribble well or do ceiling shots, and defending off the backboard I’m inconsistent.
                                It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack. 
Look at Squishy when he plays with randos, sometimes the rando gets mvp because Squishy just set up that perfect centre ball 18 times in a row and the rando just hammered it home.
                                I'm not focusing on mechanics. You don't need good mechanics to get out of diamond. Mine are shit and I have no trouble getting out of the rank if I ever find myself in it. And you certainly don't need to be able to air dribble to get out of diamond (or any rank really).
                        Is your reddit tag really u/Tuesday ? Damn lmao
                    To be fair when I'm at a friend's place who is diamond and I play a game on his rank (around dia 1/2) I have a hard time to win if I use the same mentality/game plan as I would on GC.

Of course when I start to chase I win, but that's just because I'm way faster
                        Oh yeah, it's certainly awkward as hell to play around people who clearly barely think half the time and you have to change up your method a bit to get the wins. But to derank to plat from gc when you stop playing with your premade, you never deserved gc to begin with.
                            I mean when that guy perfected his supportive playstyle but is dogsh*t at carrying himself, I could imagine he would drop a lot when you solo q. But I agree that GC to plat is a bit too much
                                thats kind of the point though, supporting a GC isn't the same as being a GC. It just makes it easier for a GC to carry you. It sounds harsh but its just a brutal reality that rocket league is about fluid transitions between offense and defense and if you are unable to convert possessions into goals and need to always rely on your team to score off plays you make then you're just being carried. Most decent champ players can learn to be passing focused if they have a GC on their team that they can just constantly set up for goals but that won't help them improve if they can't take powerful and accurate shots themselves or have powerful and accurate placement on aerials.
                                Hey now, I didn’t drop from GC to plat.

It was from C3 to plat.  Lol

I wasn’t there long but damn do I hate D1 and D2
                    If he got there without having to be carried every game then he deserves to be there.

I'm very similar to OP in terms of play style but only ever solo queue and have been bouncing between D2 to C3 in standard since season 8/9. Currently high C2 but it would only take a string of games with people not playing as a team or just sheer bad luck to send me back down to ranks were it seems even harder to have a win streak.
                        It's annoying when that happens isn't it? I was dipping from diamond to plat 3 for a while and nearly dipped into plat 2. 
I finally got sick of it and started just playing last man back, I'd only shoot on open nets or clearances, wouldn't overcommit ever. 

With just that one change I was back in D1 within a day, as teammates stopped bleeding goals and I was easily able to keep out the relatively weak shots at Plat level.
                    It sounds like he is incapable of any form of solo carrying at that level. If he's truely a defensive player and passer then the issue is probably around him being unable to actually convert opportunities into goals by himself which means he relies on the other teammates. That can be an issue. I know i struggle more playing in mid to high diamond than i do champ1 and 2 and its mainly because my strength is around my speed and setting up teammates. I can dribble and shoot when the opportunity is there but Diamond and their stupid as hell rotations throw me off which lead to low scoring games going into overtime where Champ 1 feels more like a stomp once my teammates stop being stupid.
            I solo queue exclusively. I've dropped from C3 down to D1 a couple of times, but made it back eventually. You actually have to change your play style in order to climb back up. It can be tough
            A team with good dynamics is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts.
            At the same time in champ 3 you cannot win with just 1 good player and then a play 3 player... at least not regularly
        Are we the same person? Literally story of my life.
        I was low diamond got knocked back down to gold a couple times.  The more you lose, the more tilted you get, and the worse your teammates get, and it just feels impossible to put a solid win streak together so you can recover.
        Hmu man. I've no mechanical skill but great rotations, passes, and very rarely get bad 50s
        this sounds exactly like what happens to me.  I play amazing in champ with fellow good players but solo queue will have me to plat3/D1 in no time and I'll get blamed for not being able to read my tm8s big brain plays
    It’s literally the Sizz/Rizzo playstyle lol
My son is 6 and I just tell him to demo everyone
    My six year old and I play with bots and I just turned them up to “pro”. He loves rocket league!
        I do this with my wife lol.
            What is this wife DLC?
                Yea I got the child bundle and I might refund honesty.
God I can’t wait to have a son.
    God I can’t wait to have a dad.
        Son it's me your dad. Where is my Father's Day gift?
    Imagine your wife not wanting your kid to play video games...
        *divorce intensifies*
        Thank god she plays more than me then!
            It would be cool to have parents who like video games
                I haven't played video games with my dad since he got me N64 around 20 years ago. Everything nowadays gives him a headache from all the moving around.
                    I can't relate enough XD. I'm a PC player but everytime I play on my PS4 he baits me away from the tv and takes the controller. Literally 1 minute in, "Oh come on HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS!" "**I CAN'T EVEN SEE MYSELF [NANI]**"
                        My parents used to call all my games „Nindumbo“ even if they weren’t Nintendo lol
                            Thats the most boomer shit i've ever heard.
                    Well time to find a new dad
                My dad is such a boomer he literally did worse than recruit bots on bo2. I honestly doubt he'd make it past gold but who knows maybe he just secretly has insane game sense or something.
            My mom and I used to play Hydro Thunder and Tony Hawk Pro Skater alllllll the time back on the PS1. I’ll have to buy her a PS4 when the THPS remake comes out (I really hope it has a multiplayer).
        This guy knows what’s up
        [deleted]
        I know someone with a wife like this... It’s very sad.
        Or your wife not wanting kids at all...
    The first few years are.... Tough. Instead of playing games, you'll get thrown up on.
Instead of playing catch, you'll get shat on. 
Got used to changing a nappy and have a boy? Prepare for the piss fountain. 
Sleep? Nah.
Sleep during the day to recover? Double nah.
When the grandparents take him, think you'll have time to rest? The house needs cleaning. Crack on. 
Oh the kids back, he's shat himself. Your parents haven't changed him. Crack on. 

This goes on for maybe 2 years?
        Can confirm

Source: am a dad
        Yeah, as a currently childless adult I'm still plenty busy enough with the house. There's always something to do even outside of work. I can't imagine what state my home would be in with a baby around. Enjoy that free time, kids!
    It's not just have a son. I have two. They totally suck at games until they are around 10. At least I hope it's ten, because it sure isn't 8.
        cannot confirm, have a 10 year old that's still very much bronze
            I love how many dads there are on this subreddit
                don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing RL with my son and he asks me to play as well.....but we mostly stick to games vs the bots.

it's still great bonding time as I spend the time after he goes to bed trying to be a 35 year old GC.
                It’s just because the ladies love a gamer
    My husband and 4 year old daughter play rocket league and other games all the time!
    Has son. Son: "dad can we go play real soccer?"
        Not until you practice your air dribbles Timmy
            countless times while watching soccer i scream at the tv do a aerial dribble no one can stop you. its frustrating
    ....I cant wait to have a dad ....
    Son or daughter or whatever, my kid(s) will hopefully be gamers. If not, that’s cool...yep
i love these father/son storys


honestly so heart warming to hear🥺
Man that's how my buddy and I play.  When he's on I'm fine in champ and when he's not I sink to plat lmfao
    I'm the opposite when I solo q I get in a tryhard mindset but when I'm with friends I trust them more and it usually doesn't work as well
This is me and my buddy. He is a beast in front of goal but can come up short on his wall hits/dribbles.

I attac, he protec, all the wins we collec.
Omg this sounds exactly like me and my younger brother. Me being you and my brother being your son. Saucy skills + good fundamentals = fun times
Is your dad Sizz?
“His flippy stuff” haha I love it
Frickin ball chasers
are you me and my son?
Do you ever fantasize about  what your  rank would be if you had had a nice child instead?
My son is 14 now, has 1/3 of my hours and we're exactly the same!
    almost same here! he is 15 and I have like 6000 hours and he has 1500 lol
Sounds like rizzo and sizz
You're the center midfielder he needs in his life :D
Very similar (although diamond rank) we call it striker son and defensive dad!
My son and I also play but he’s 6 so he puck chases and occasionally hits me while laughing very hard.
omg please post some game footage
Wow, you genuinely can stomach a ball chaser and not a bat an eye. Unconditional love doesn’t allow you. I’m jealous.
The perfect dad. Way to go man!
Make sure you give it back to him after
    Heh
If you changed one to "Please Daddy" the tone would shift dramatically.
Sweet :)
Wholesome :)
That's pretty much the opposite of me and my kid, he's plat and I'm unranked. He'll 1 v 2 me and his sister and crush us lol.
    it's surprisingly easy to do that sort of thing if you're playing against people worse than you, a little consistency / skill goes a LONG way in rocket league
[deleted]
    That's why the controllers stay on top of the TV stand....

...Or maybe it's because Dad was up until 3:30 doing heatseekers and didn't want to wake up yet. Maybe. 

Either way, my 6 year old barely even stays on task... Timer counts, I serve, they return, and... He's gone.

"Milo? Where were you?"

"Daddy, I find this cool glitch where you can drive on the roof!"
        man why cant my dad be like yall lmao
It's funny, my dad taught me so much about cars. Drag raced, etc, always had performance cars, always had a 60's GTO (varying years, but had at least one at all times in my life), but now that I've got a son I recently picked up my "dream dad car", a Giulia Quadrifoglio. 

Drive up 9 hours to visit my dad to show him I learned the lessons of cool dad cars well, and I know my motor revs quick but damn did he miss shifts like he was a teenager who doesn't know what a clutch is. 

...My car is paddle shifted. Sigh, guess I gotta get him on RL.
I’m hoping to have something like this with my future children. My mom and dad never did much gaming themselves and they never try it because “their hand-eye coordination sucks” I just can’t get them to try a video game and I know they might not be that great but I live in a family of 4 as the only person that play video games.
    Haha yeah. They aren't wrong too! First game I ayed with my dad was the original Cod. He just sat in front of a tree and said how life like it looked and those trees look horrendous now!

My mom got into a few games as well. Some were plants (plats?) vs zombies, bejewelled and machinarum.

And yes, my first is 16 mo this old. I can't wait to share my gaming experience with him and join him to create his experience with whatever the future of our hobby holds.
Same with mine. We got the game together 4 years ago. He’s still bronze and I’m gc. I made a second account to play ranked with him though. It’s pretty nice to stay in touch with the family through Video games while I’m away at college
    Our roles are reversed (I'm C3 and my son is Bronze).  It felt dirty creating a second account to play ranked with him.  But I'm pretty good about playing like a Bronze when we play together.
        Yes same for me. It’s a strictly no sweat account (unless people are being toxic) and I let him challenge most balls while I sit back on defense and boom clears. We win about 50% of games and have fun doing it

    (PC) [H] son [W] TW octane
Came here looking for this
*Misses open net while down one with 10 seconds left*

“...go to your room.”
    “But we’re already in my room!”
My 24 year old son and I have never been super close. But when he visits, he brings his PS4 and we play for a few hours (we are both Plat I in doubles).

It's one of my favorite things to do.
    That's so sweet :) I know your son cherishes those moments.
    Yo, this is kinda unrelated to the sub but I hear that kinda thing being said by the children usually, not the parent because it's usually inferred that burden of having a close relationship between child and parent would lie mostly on the parent so you don't really hear a parent admit to not having close relationship with their offspring. That's why I thought it was super interesting that you'd say that as a parent. What do you think made it this way for you guys?
        He was my toughest - oldest of three kids, always in trouble (minor stuff) until he got to be 16-ish. His younger sister and brother were just easier and we connected better I guess.

It's not a great thing to admit.
            It's admirable to be honest to yourself as well as to others.
                Thanks, man.
        "I fucked his mom." -OP, Probably.
            Well, yes but also other things
    I had a step-dad until I was 19. Then they split. I'm almost 30 now wishing I had *some* kinda paternal relationship. I'm getting supremely jealous of the idea of being able to play something with "dad". 

I'm going to start taking applications. 🤷‍♂️
I get frustrated with teammates too.

When my son wasnt very good, it came out at times... 

He's way better now... even goes up for aerials, and demos well. Love telling opponents they got beat by a 9yr old.

We both still suck at dribbling.
I’ve found that when I’m teamed up with someone I simply have so much more fun that the mistakes aren’t an issue.

>and he pounds my pipes!

are we.. are we still talking about Rocket League?
    We all play on our lunch break at work. We hired a guy who said he could play. He could not. Constantly ran into us. Thus the term “pipe pounding” was born. You’re free to use it.
Sounds enjoyable.
    It’s too personal to capture on film.
That's all I was thinking when I was watching this
I was thinking this too
And default POV
Ehhhhh gotta represent!
I rewatched a few times so I could see if it was funhaus, it looked like it but couldn't get a good shot. Funhaus is the only gaming channel I've ever really liked, one of the only channels I've consistently watched for a while as well it's great.
    Yeah, I saw a orange circle and assumed it was funhaus. But yeah, funhaus is one of the only reasons I watch YouTube anymore. There's been so many great memories from the channel. My favorite is quoting funhaus to my clueless friends
        "Ska became before reggae only because I allowed it" never fails to confuse!



Easily one of the most quotable channels in my opinion, I find myself not even meaning to sometimes it just comes naturally lol
            "There is no oral etiquette, we get it and that's it!"
There's so many times in day to day life where I'm reminded of a funhaus quote.
Yeah you can, me and my buddy use this kickoff a lot.
My brother and I do this. We call it "the play!"
Sad but you get my upvote
Honestly, the game doesn't really matter. Focus on your dad. Will you look back and regret not spending some time gaming just because he likes a different car game? Maybe he will play some RL after a Forza sesh.
    Yeah, we have a great relationship, we play golf together regularly, his gaming point of view is just a bit different that’s all 😂
Does he play Horizon, Motorsport or both? Either way ask him if he can flip his car in Forza.
My dad and I had a similar play but it was was more like:

*Dad left the match*
Cat was like: "I have a dad"
Raising a sniveling child born unto my own image? Meh. 

Growing a rocket league teammate from scratch? Yeaaaa
Took me years of convincing him to play. Keep expressing your interest to them. I’m sure someday they will listen :)
He might like it, its not up to others to tell him to turm it off😳😂
    Agreed, I know it's nice advice and probably one of the first things committed players do

But going full <<PLEASE turn it off>> it's just disrespectful. If it bothers you, it's your problem. If you wanted to give solid advice, there are better ways
        exactly, I feel some people think because they take the game seriously, everyone else has too, life dont work lile that lol

Yeah I do say that to you every night dont I son? Bahahaha!!!
That’s the kind of team I feel like can do well.  I was C3 playing with a friend who is mechanically way beyond me (he is mid tier GC).  I play good position, ready for passes, rotate appropriately, and don’t double commit.  I only recently started to off the wall air dribble and ceiling shots are mystical to me.

C3...  but then playing by myself, I maintained C3 for a while and then slowly dropped.  Alllllll the way to Plat 3 (while still C2 in Standard).  

The further down I went, the more my teammates blamed me. Lol.  And from my view, I’m sitting there watching them chase the ball and call me a ball chaser when I see them fail to rotate out after like 3 challenges on the ball and I think they are finally rotating out only to turn back.

I’m back to D1 or D2 by myself now, readjusted to my teammates.  

I miss my friend.  He hasn’t been on in a while.
    bad times ahead.

maybe no computer. 

maybe no home.

i will go way, but we are two of soul.

i will return.

            we never do, yet this quote always hits us
        Is Mell My Fingers. No Mell is not my fingers

/s I know what it says.
    My regular doubles partner is like this. He insists that if he’s working the ball im supposed to just sit back and wait for the center. Even if the ball gets behind him and goes for corner boost I’m not supposed to touch it back in. I’m supposed to wait then go back to goal if he looses. We’re stuck at Gold 2.
        oof lmao, your partners an idiot
        Unless you REALLY like him, you should definitely get a new partner
            For real.

There does not seem like anything useful going on here
        Theres definitely instances where it might be okay to chill in the corner, *eg.* the enemy has no chance of winning a 5050 and your tm8s far-ish away. But generally, if you whiff your corner play, your teammate *should* be in position to attempt a play (challenge or shadow) while you position to protect the net
        [deleted]
            Ok but like why bring politics into this?
    I played 2s with a friend for like the first two years RL was out, and when he stopped playing I just never really wanted to play it solo queueing. It just didn't feel right.

It's painful when you lose your doubles partner.
    This. Everytime I fall below d3, everyone calls me a ballchaser
    I literally quit rocket league because of that. 


The community is toxic sometimes. I played for 2 years and it was the most fun a video game ever brought me. The toxicity of the players is fucking bad. I played last month for shits and giggles and the chat was off the wall. 

Yes I know you can block them but still uncalled for.
    I think if u can drop down from c3 all the way to plat, you don't belong in champion
        Good team combos go a long way
            For real. I ranked from plat 3 to diamond 2 playing with a random who I had good chemistry with. Guy was really toxic in our first game, but we got paired like 4 games in a row and won all of them so I was like dude.. party up with me? And he was like sure and I got there in one day on the largest win streak I’ve ever had. Then we lost a few and he started being toxic again so I unfriended him and haven’t seen him since. Ah, rocket league
        Yeah, well, that’s just like, your opinion, man.

E:  but seriously, together we were beating GCs regularly.  And I would end up with MVP a third of the time.  It’s not like he did alllll the work, but we really jived well and just knew what the other was going to do.
            I believe you man, y’all had chemistry and were better Than the sum of your parts
            Trust me, you definitely didn't deserve to be champion if you deranked to plat. I'm not exactly mechanically great at the game but I have a hard time losing games two ranks below what I'm usually at if I'm even remotely trying.

                    Yes, it may be awkward but if you have the ability to be in GC, then it shouldn't even remotely be an issue to play around diamonds to win games.
                        [deleted]
                            How’d u get that username, that’s dope
                        Sometimes if I fall into diamond, I play worse coz I’m trying to rotate and give my teammate space. And then they suck and we lose. Basically I’m overly nice because I expect too much from them. I have to play more aggressively (but still avoid double commits) to run diamond games and get back to champ. It can be tricky to find the right pace when you fall below your rank, in my experience.
                            This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
                        You’re focusing on mechanics and not team play.  My point is both are equally important and when you master both is when you’re a GC.  My team play is heightened.

                            It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack. 
Look at Squishy when he plays with randos, sometimes the rando gets mvp because Squishy just set up that perfect centre ball 18 times in a row and the rando just hammered it home.
                            I'm not focusing on mechanics. You don't need good mechanics to get out of diamond. Mine are shit and I have no trouble getting out of the rank if I ever find myself in it. And you certainly don't need to be able to air dribble to get out of diamond (or any rank really).
                    Is your reddit tag really u/Tuesday ? Damn lmao
                To be fair when I'm at a friend's place who is diamond and I play a game on his rank (around dia 1/2) I have a hard time to win if I use the same mentality/game plan as I would on GC.

Of course when I start to chase I win, but that's just because I'm way faster
                    Oh yeah, it's certainly awkward as hell to play around people who clearly barely think half the time and you have to change up your method a bit to get the wins. But to derank to plat from gc when you stop playing with your premade, you never deserved gc to begin with.
                        I mean when that guy perfected his supportive playstyle but is dogsh*t at carrying himself, I could imagine he would drop a lot when you solo q. But I agree that GC to plat is a bit too much
                            thats kind of the point though, supporting a GC isn't the same as being a GC. It just makes it easier for a GC to carry you. It sounds harsh but its just a brutal reality that rocket league is about fluid transitions between offense and defense and if you are unable to convert possessions into goals and need to always rely on your team to score off plays you make then you're just being carried. Most decent champ players can learn to be passing focused if they have a GC on their team that they can just constantly set up for goals but that won't help them improve if they can't take powerful and accurate shots themselves or have powerful and accurate placement on aerials.
                            Hey now, I didn’t drop from GC to plat.

It was from C3 to plat.  Lol

I wasn’t there long but damn do I hate D1 and D2
                If he got there without having to be carried every game then he deserves to be there.

I'm very similar to OP in terms of play style but only ever solo queue and have been bouncing between D2 to C3 in standard since season 8/9. Currently high C2 but it would only take a string of games with people not playing as a team or just sheer bad luck to send me back down to ranks were it seems even harder to have a win streak.
                    It's annoying when that happens isn't it? I was dipping from diamond to plat 3 for a while and nearly dipped into plat 2. 
I finally got sick of it and started just playing last man back, I'd only shoot on open nets or clearances, wouldn't overcommit ever. 

With just that one change I was back in D1 within a day, as teammates stopped bleeding goals and I was easily able to keep out the relatively weak shots at Plat level.
                It sounds like he is incapable of any form of solo carrying at that level. If he's truely a defensive player and passer then the issue is probably around him being unable to actually convert opportunities into goals by himself which means he relies on the other teammates. That can be an issue. I know i struggle more playing in mid to high diamond than i do champ1 and 2 and its mainly because my strength is around my speed and setting up teammates. I can dribble and shoot when the opportunity is there but Diamond and their stupid as hell rotations throw me off which lead to low scoring games going into overtime where Champ 1 feels more like a stomp once my teammates stop being stupid.
        I solo queue exclusively. I've dropped from C3 down to D1 a couple of times, but made it back eventually. You actually have to change your play style in order to climb back up. It can be tough
        A team with good dynamics is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts.
        At the same time in champ 3 you cannot win with just 1 good player and then a play 3 player... at least not regularly
    Are we the same person? Literally story of my life.
    I was low diamond got knocked back down to gold a couple times.  The more you lose, the more tilted you get, and the worse your teammates get, and it just feels impossible to put a solid win streak together so you can recover.
    Hmu man. I've no mechanical skill but great rotations, passes, and very rarely get bad 50s
    this sounds exactly like what happens to me.  I play amazing in champ with fellow good players but solo queue will have me to plat3/D1 in no time and I'll get blamed for not being able to read my tm8s big brain plays
It’s literally the Sizz/Rizzo playstyle lol
My six year old and I play with bots and I just turned them up to “pro”. He loves rocket league!
    I do this with my wife lol.
        What is this wife DLC?
            Yea I got the child bundle and I might refund honesty.
God I can’t wait to have a dad.
    Son it's me your dad. Where is my Father's Day gift?
Imagine your wife not wanting your kid to play video games...
    *divorce intensifies*
    Thank god she plays more than me then!
        It would be cool to have parents who like video games
            I haven't played video games with my dad since he got me N64 around 20 years ago. Everything nowadays gives him a headache from all the moving around.
                I can't relate enough XD. I'm a PC player but everytime I play on my PS4 he baits me away from the tv and takes the controller. Literally 1 minute in, "Oh come on HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS!" "**I CAN'T EVEN SEE MYSELF [NANI]**"
                    My parents used to call all my games „Nindumbo“ even if they weren’t Nintendo lol
                        Thats the most boomer shit i've ever heard.
                Well time to find a new dad
            My dad is such a boomer he literally did worse than recruit bots on bo2. I honestly doubt he'd make it past gold but who knows maybe he just secretly has insane game sense or something.
        My mom and I used to play Hydro Thunder and Tony Hawk Pro Skater alllllll the time back on the PS1. I’ll have to buy her a PS4 when the THPS remake comes out (I really hope it has a multiplayer).

    I know someone with a wife like this... It’s very sad.
    Or your wife not wanting kids at all...
The first few years are.... Tough. Instead of playing games, you'll get thrown up on.
Instead of playing catch, you'll get shat on. 
Got used to changing a nappy and have a boy? Prepare for the piss fountain. 
Sleep? Nah.
Sleep during the day to recover? Double nah.
When the grandparents take him, think you'll have time to rest? The house needs cleaning. Crack on. 
Oh the kids back, he's shat himself. Your parents haven't changed him. Crack on. 

This goes on for maybe 2 years?
    Can confirm

Source: am a dad
    Yeah, as a currently childless adult I'm still plenty busy enough with the house. There's always something to do even outside of work. I can't imagine what state my home would be in with a baby around. Enjoy that free time, kids!
It's not just have a son. I have two. They totally suck at games until they are around 10. At least I hope it's ten, because it sure isn't 8.
    cannot confirm, have a 10 year old that's still very much bronze
        I love how many dads there are on this subreddit
            don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing RL with my son and he asks me to play as well.....but we mostly stick to games vs the bots.

it's still great bonding time as I spend the time after he goes to bed trying to be a 35 year old GC.
            It’s just because the ladies love a gamer
My husband and 4 year old daughter play rocket league and other games all the time!
Has son. Son: "dad can we go play real soccer?"
    Not until you practice your air dribbles Timmy
        countless times while watching soccer i scream at the tv do a aerial dribble no one can stop you. its frustrating
....I cant wait to have a dad ....
Son or daughter or whatever, my kid(s) will hopefully be gamers. If not, that’s cool...yep
I'm the opposite when I solo q I get in a tryhard mindset but when I'm with friends I trust them more and it usually doesn't work as well
almost same here! he is 15 and I have like 6000 hours and he has 1500 lol
Heh
it's surprisingly easy to do that sort of thing if you're playing against people worse than you, a little consistency / skill goes a LONG way in rocket league
That's why the controllers stay on top of the TV stand....

...Or maybe it's because Dad was up until 3:30 doing heatseekers and didn't want to wake up yet. Maybe. 

Either way, my 6 year old barely even stays on task... Timer counts, I serve, they return, and... He's gone.

"Milo? Where were you?"

"Daddy, I find this cool glitch where you can drive on the roof!"
    man why cant my dad be like yall lmao
Haha yeah. They aren't wrong too! First game I ayed with my dad was the original Cod. He just sat in front of a tree and said how life like it looked and those trees look horrendous now!

My mom got into a few games as well. Some were plants (plats?) vs zombies, bejewelled and machinarum.

And yes, my first is 16 mo this old. I can't wait to share my gaming experience with him and join him to create his experience with whatever the future of our hobby holds.
Our roles are reversed (I'm C3 and my son is Bronze).  It felt dirty creating a second account to play ranked with him.  But I'm pretty good about playing like a Bronze when we play together.
    Yes same for me. It’s a strictly no sweat account (unless people are being toxic) and I let him challenge most balls while I sit back on defense and boom clears. We win about 50% of games and have fun doing it

(PC) [H] son [W] TW octane
“But we’re already in my room!”
That's so sweet :) I know your son cherishes those moments.
Yo, this is kinda unrelated to the sub but I hear that kinda thing being said by the children usually, not the parent because it's usually inferred that burden of having a close relationship between child and parent would lie mostly on the parent so you don't really hear a parent admit to not having close relationship with their offspring. That's why I thought it was super interesting that you'd say that as a parent. What do you think made it this way for you guys?
    He was my toughest - oldest of three kids, always in trouble (minor stuff) until he got to be 16-ish. His younger sister and brother were just easier and we connected better I guess.

It's not a great thing to admit.
        It's admirable to be honest to yourself as well as to others.
            Thanks, man.
    "I fucked his mom." -OP, Probably.
        Well, yes but also other things
I had a step-dad until I was 19. Then they split. I'm almost 30 now wishing I had *some* kinda paternal relationship. I'm getting supremely jealous of the idea of being able to play something with "dad". 

I'm going to start taking applications. 🤷‍♂️
We all play on our lunch break at work. We hired a guy who said he could play. He could not. Constantly ran into us. Thus the term “pipe pounding” was born. You’re free to use it.
It’s too personal to capture on film.
Yeah, I saw a orange circle and assumed it was funhaus. But yeah, funhaus is one of the only reasons I watch YouTube anymore. There's been so many great memories from the channel. My favorite is quoting funhaus to my clueless friends
    "Ska became before reggae only because I allowed it" never fails to confuse!



Easily one of the most quotable channels in my opinion, I find myself not even meaning to sometimes it just comes naturally lol
        "There is no oral etiquette, we get it and that's it!"
There's so many times in day to day life where I'm reminded of a funhaus quote.
Yeah, we have a great relationship, we play golf together regularly, his gaming point of view is just a bit different that’s all 😂
Agreed, I know it's nice advice and probably one of the first things committed players do

But going full <<PLEASE turn it off>> it's just disrespectful. If it bothers you, it's your problem. If you wanted to give solid advice, there are better ways
    exactly, I feel some people think because they take the game seriously, everyone else has too, life dont work lile that lol

        pow right in the feels
        we never do, yet this quote always hits us
    Is Mell My Fingers. No Mell is not my fingers

/s I know what it says.
My regular doubles partner is like this. He insists that if he’s working the ball im supposed to just sit back and wait for the center. Even if the ball gets behind him and goes for corner boost I’m not supposed to touch it back in. I’m supposed to wait then go back to goal if he looses. We’re stuck at Gold 2.
    oof lmao, your partners an idiot
    Unless you REALLY like him, you should definitely get a new partner
        For real.

There does not seem like anything useful going on here
    Theres definitely instances where it might be okay to chill in the corner, *eg.* the enemy has no chance of winning a 5050 and your tm8s far-ish away. But generally, if you whiff your corner play, your teammate *should* be in position to attempt a play (challenge or shadow) while you position to protect the net
    [deleted]
        Ok but like why bring politics into this?
I played 2s with a friend for like the first two years RL was out, and when he stopped playing I just never really wanted to play it solo queueing. It just didn't feel right.

It's painful when you lose your doubles partner.
This. Everytime I fall below d3, everyone calls me a ballchaser
I literally quit rocket league because of that. 


The community is toxic sometimes. I played for 2 years and it was the most fun a video game ever brought me. The toxicity of the players is fucking bad. I played last month for shits and giggles and the chat was off the wall. 

Yes I know you can block them but still uncalled for.
I think if u can drop down from c3 all the way to plat, you don't belong in champion
    Good team combos go a long way
        For real. I ranked from plat 3 to diamond 2 playing with a random who I had good chemistry with. Guy was really toxic in our first game, but we got paired like 4 games in a row and won all of them so I was like dude.. party up with me? And he was like sure and I got there in one day on the largest win streak I’ve ever had. Then we lost a few and he started being toxic again so I unfriended him and haven’t seen him since. Ah, rocket league
    Yeah, well, that’s just like, your opinion, man.

E:  but seriously, together we were beating GCs regularly.  And I would end up with MVP a third of the time.  It’s not like he did alllll the work, but we really jived well and just knew what the other was going to do.
        I believe you man, y’all had chemistry and were better Than the sum of your parts
        Trust me, you definitely didn't deserve to be champion if you deranked to plat. I'm not exactly mechanically great at the game but I have a hard time losing games two ranks below what I'm usually at if I'm even remotely trying.

                Yes, it may be awkward but if you have the ability to be in GC, then it shouldn't even remotely be an issue to play around diamonds to win games.
                    [deleted]
                        How’d u get that username, that’s dope
                    Sometimes if I fall into diamond, I play worse coz I’m trying to rotate and give my teammate space. And then they suck and we lose. Basically I’m overly nice because I expect too much from them. I have to play more aggressively (but still avoid double commits) to run diamond games and get back to champ. It can be tricky to find the right pace when you fall below your rank, in my experience.
                        This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
                    You’re focusing on mechanics and not team play.  My point is both are equally important and when you master both is when you’re a GC.  My team play is heightened.  My ground mechanics are good (can dribble the crap out of just about anyone.  I can’t air dribble well or do ceiling shots, and defending off the backboard I’m inconsistent.
                        It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack. 
Look at Squishy when he plays with randos, sometimes the rando gets mvp because Squishy just set up that perfect centre ball 18 times in a row and the rando just hammered it home.

Unless you REALLY like him, you should definitely get a new partner
    For real.

There does not seem like anything useful going on here
Theres definitely instances where it might be okay to chill in the corner, *eg.* the enemy has no chance of winning a 5050 and your tm8s far-ish away. But generally, if you whiff your corner play, your teammate *should* be in position to attempt a play (challenge or shadow) while you position to protect the net

    Ok but like why bring politics into this?
Good team combos go a long way
    For real. I ranked from plat 3 to diamond 2 playing with a random who I had good chemistry with. Guy was really toxic in our first game, but we got paired like 4 games in a row and won all of them so I was like dude.. party up with me? And he was like sure and I got there in one day on the largest win streak I’ve ever had. Then we lost a few and he started being toxic again so I unfriended him and haven’t seen him since. Ah, rocket league
Yeah, well, that’s just like, your opinion, man.

E:  but seriously, together we were beating GCs regularly.  And I would end up with MVP a third of the time.  It’s not like he did alllll the work, but we really jived well and just knew what the other was going to do.
    I believe you man, y’all had chemistry and were better Than the sum of your parts
    Trust me, you definitely didn't deserve to be champion if you deranked to plat. I'm not exactly mechanically great at the game but I have a hard time losing games two ranks below what I'm usually at if I'm even remotely trying.

            Yes, it may be awkward but if you have the ability to be in GC, then it shouldn't even remotely be an issue to play around diamonds to win games.

                Sometimes if I fall into diamond, I play worse coz I’m trying to rotate and give my teammate space. And then they suck and we lose. Basically I’m overly nice because I expect too much from them. I have to play more aggressively (but still avoid double commits) to run diamond games and get back to champ. It can be tricky to find the right pace when you fall below your rank, in my experience.
                    This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
                You’re focusing on mechanics and not team play.  My point is both are equally important and when you master both is when you’re a GC.  My team play is heightened.  My ground mechanics are good (can dribble the crap out of just about anyone.  I can’t air dribble well or do ceiling shots, and defending off the backboard I’m inconsistent.
                    It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack. 
Look at Squishy when he plays with randos, sometimes the rando gets mvp because Squishy just set up that perfect centre ball 18 times in a row and the rando just hammered it home.
                    I'm not focusing on mechanics. You don't need good mechanics to get out of diamond. Mine are shit and I have no trouble getting out of the rank if I ever find myself in it. And you certainly don't need to be able to air dribble to get out of diamond (or any rank really).
            Is your reddit tag really u/Tuesday ? Damn lmao
        To be fair when I'm at a friend's place who is diamond and I play a game on his rank (around dia 1/2) I have a hard time to win if I use the same mentality/game plan as I would on GC.

Of course when I start to chase I win, but that's just because I'm way faster
            Oh yeah, it's certainly awkward as hell to play around people who clearly barely think half the time and you have to change up your method a bit to get the wins. But to derank to plat from gc when you stop playing with your premade, you never deserved gc to begin with.
                I mean when that guy perfected his supportive playstyle but is dogsh*t at carrying himself, I could imagine he would drop a lot when you solo q. But I agree that GC to plat is a bit too much
                    thats kind of the point though, supporting a GC isn't the same as being a GC. It just makes it easier for a GC to carry you. It sounds harsh but its just a brutal reality that rocket league is about fluid transitions between offense and defense and if you are unable to convert possessions into goals and need to always rely on your team to score off plays you make then you're just being carried. Most decent champ players can learn to be passing focused if they have a GC on their team that they can just constantly set up for goals but that won't help them improve if they can't take powerful and accurate shots themselves or have powerful and accurate placement on aerials.
                    Hey now, I didn’t drop from GC to plat.

It was from C3 to plat.  Lol

I wasn’t there long but damn do I hate D1 and D2
        If he got there without having to be carried every game then he deserves to be there.

I'm very similar to OP in terms of play style but only ever solo queue and have been bouncing between D2 to C3 in standard since season 8/9. Currently high C2 but it would only take a string of games with people not playing as a team or just sheer bad luck to send me back down to ranks were it seems even harder to have a win streak.
            It's annoying when that happens isn't it? I was dipping from diamond to plat 3 for a while and nearly dipped into plat 2. 
I finally got sick of it and started just playing last man back, I'd only shoot on open nets or clearances, wouldn't overcommit ever. 

With just that one change I was back in D1 within a day, as teammates stopped bleeding goals and I was easily able to keep out the relatively weak shots at Plat level.
        It sounds like he is incapable of any form of solo carrying at that level. If he's truely a defensive player and passer then the issue is probably around him being unable to actually convert opportunities into goals by himself which means he relies on the other teammates. That can be an issue. I know i struggle more playing in mid to high diamond than i do champ1 and 2 and its mainly because my strength is around my speed and setting up teammates. I can dribble and shoot when the opportunity is there but Diamond and their stupid as hell rotations throw me off which lead to low scoring games going into overtime where Champ 1 feels more like a stomp once my teammates stop being stupid.
I solo queue exclusively. I've dropped from C3 down to D1 a couple of times, but made it back eventually. You actually have to change your play style in order to climb back up. It can be tough
A team with good dynamics is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts.
At the same time in champ 3 you cannot win with just 1 good player and then a play 3 player... at least not regularly
What is this wife DLC?
    Yea I got the child bundle and I might refund honesty.
It would be cool to have parents who like video games
    I haven't played video games with my dad since he got me N64 around 20 years ago. Everything nowadays gives him a headache from all the moving around.
        I can't relate enough XD. I'm a PC player but everytime I play on my PS4 he baits me away from the tv and takes the controller. Literally 1 minute in, "Oh come on HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS!" "**I CAN'T EVEN SEE MYSELF [NANI]**"
            My parents used to call all my games „Nindumbo“ even if they weren’t Nintendo lol
                Thats the most boomer shit i've ever heard.
        Well time to find a new dad
    My dad is such a boomer he literally did worse than recruit bots on bo2. I honestly doubt he'd make it past gold but who knows maybe he just secretly has insane game sense or something.
My mom and I used to play Hydro Thunder and Tony Hawk Pro Skater alllllll the time back on the PS1. I’ll have to buy her a PS4 when the THPS remake comes out (I really hope it has a multiplayer).
I love how many dads there are on this subreddit
    don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing RL with my son and he asks me to play as well.....but we mostly stick to games vs the bots.

it's still great bonding time as I spend the time after he goes to bed trying to be a 35 year old GC.
    It’s just because the ladies love a gamer
countless times while watching soccer i scream at the tv do a aerial dribble no one can stop you. its frustrating

I mean when that guy perfected his supportive playstyle but is dogsh*t at carrying himself, I could imagine he would drop a lot when you solo q. But I agree that GC to plat is a bit too much
    thats kind of the point though, supporting a GC isn't the same as being a GC. It just makes it easier for a GC to carry you. It sounds harsh but its just a brutal reality that rocket league is about fluid transitions between offense and defense and if you are unable to convert possessions into goals and need to always rely on your team to score off plays you make then you're just being carried. Most decent champ players can learn to be passing focused if they have a GC on their team that they can just constantly set up for goals but that won't help them improve if they can't take powerful and accurate shots themselves or have powerful and accurate placement on aerials.
    Hey now, I didn’t drop from GC to plat.

It was from C3 to plat.  Lol

I wasn’t there long but damn do I hate D1 and D2
Thats the most boomer shit i've ever heard.
*the crowd goes wild*
👀
Na zdrovje!
How’d u get that username, that’s dope
This happens all the way up. I've just hit gc (normally mid champ 3) but I dropped to ~1250 mmr a month ago. I had to turn off the part of my brain that trusts my teammates before being able to climb out.

Realistically just be aware of what the average player at your level is capable of and you'll be ready when they inevitably fuck it. It's not like gc isn't full of dumb mistakes and misses either.
It sounds like he set you up for a lot of things and overcompensated for the areas you lack.
