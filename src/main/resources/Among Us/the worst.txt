[[the worst]]





When that happens we vote the cheater out and keep playing
    [deleted]
        *Guys it's purple, vote him out*

#Oh shit. he wasn't the impostor. oh well.
            Whenever this happens to me (as an honest mistake) i always start the next round of discussion with "So, elephant in the room...." or if i'm imp it's more like "Well this is awkward." In pubmatches people's memory is usually so short theyve moved on anyways.
                If I‚Äôm imp after this I kill someone in a group immediately after, then cop to it and false accuse someone as being the other imp. Trying to play it off like a rage quit kinda thing because I got caught lying.
                    If i am the imposter and I get caught I simply name another innocent person as my another imposter and boom I take 1 more with me
                        I did that once and took 2 people with me.
                            How did you take 2 with you?
Also can you teach me to be that sneaky?? üòá
                                Someone believed that the person I picked was the imposter. Everyone said if that person wasn't the imposter, they would pick him.

He didn't have a good time.
                                I think he was playing 3 imps.
Tip:If u see some1 alone and ur the imp sabotuage lights so there is no chance someone sees u doing it.
If they didnt discover the body sabotuage the doors where the body is at if there is no door do electric again and u might get away with 2 kills :)))

Edit:Woah my best was 10 thx for 50 upvotes i though every people that knew the game well will do that so they wouldnt upvote it.
                                    Nope. It was a 2 imposter game. It just the person I picked also happened to be another non-imposter's pick.
                            There's nothing quite like the feeling of playing imposter and seeing one crewmember accuse another crewmember with the ol' "if it's not him vote me" and knocking out two birds with one stone.
                Dude they won't even remember that for the last two meetings purple got 2 innocent crewmates kicked off for no reason.

"Hey anyone else think purple accuses incorrectly a lot?"

"Soo skip?"
                    I experience this a lot on the other hand. I‚Äôll have concrete evidence against an impostor and vote them off first round, just for all the crewmates to forget and vote me for nonsensical reasons 2-3 rounds later. And it‚Äôs never an impostor trying to throw me under the bus, it‚Äôs always dumb crewmates
                        Crew mates kill more crew mates than the imposters do.
                        Ifkr
                In public matches it's usually safe to assume they just aren't good at the game and are just randomly accusing
                Just say you‚Äôre 30% sure every time you accuse someone and admit mistakes.
                    No one does this. This dumbasses just type 100% and think they just deafeted somebody.
                        everybody is so used to believing what people say in real life that they don't check evidence and easily believe "oh I saw cyan did it"
                    Once I killed someone and someone else came in. I called the body and said "i saw purple over the body!!" and Purple was saying he saw me over the body, but since I called the report button, people were inclined to believe me. I even said "Well, no, I didn't see the body split in half in front of me, but he was standing over it, so I'm 90% sure it's them." It wasn't them! Oh no :( Someone I was in electrical with when my kill cooldown was counting vouched for me and went "i guess last round must have been a vent kill then."  
I won that game :)
                One time I thought I was dead, opened chat, and saw who the imps were. When a body was reported, I didn‚Äôt say anything and refused to vote since I knew who the imps were and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it for them
            Oh no!

Anyway-
            Omg yesterday that was me! I decided to be pink to raise my chances for imposter and they kept kicking me! I wasnt even imposter
            >Oh shit, he wasn't the impostor, ~~oh well~~ *disconnects*.

FTFY
            I wasnt imposter idiot.
            Oh no!


Anyways.
            Gotta disable saying if it was an imposter or not on ejection. It's the best way.
        My friend did this his first game I was playing with him. Told him I‚Äôd only tell people or accuse if I found evidence personally it was him. Like cleared everyone else, saw him actually kill/vent or something along those lines
        Just let the impostor get the victory. Tyey deserve it if someone had to reduce to cheating to reveal who they were
        They could always be lying, anyway. It's shouldn't be that hard to convince yourself they might not be the imposter.
        Yeah but pretending is far more fun than throwing away a game because of a cheater . I would also kick him from the lobby for the next match
        I mean, it‚Äôs better than to stop playing. Also you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre lying about being told who the impostor is, just assume that they‚Äôre lying and falsely incriminating someone.
        It is what I normally do. If I am the one who someone snitches to, I just go chill in elect or if I see the imp, I walk into a room with him.

I absolutely hate cheaters.
        If this happens I always convince my teammates to not report, just try to finish tasks before they're getting killed.
        Just gotta play until anyone else gets proof. Treat it as cyan is sus
        I had this the other day the last guy gave me the win as he said it was unfair I killed one guy and he said my friend told me purple killed him I play in the same room as my wife when we‚Äôre playing with friends and I don‚Äôt even talk too her unless we‚Äôre both dead what‚Äôs the point in playing you don‚Äôt get any rewards for winning it‚Äôs just pointless too cheat
    I played last night and caught white killing right as I came around the corner. It became clear that everyone was voting for him so he says, ‚ÄúOkay fine it was me, but it‚Äôs also Lime.‚Äù

No one even suspected Lime up until that point and he could‚Äôve won the game sinc there were only five of us left. We ended up voting out the snitch and letting Lime take the win. Fuck them cheaters.
        I was imposter with some stranger a few days ago. In the lobby he had complained about the fact there were 2 imposters. As soon as he could call a meeting he did and said he saw me kill someone. The best thing about it was the fact I hadn't even killed yet.

Even worse was the girl who kept saying she saw me vent or kill for several games. Why? I had (rightfully) accused her boyfriend a few games ago. The others believed her most of the time, I ended up getting thrown out of the ship several times.

I hate people.
            I played a game last night where someone kept doing that. But not out of spite. Just losers that kept calling meetings claiming they saw someone vent or that so and so was following them. I got called out for following someone (I wasn‚Äôt). Got voted off-not imposter. Next game got called out for faking weapons task (I wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm not dumb enough to fake visual tasks as imposter). Got voted off‚Äînot imposter. This went on several rounds. I was got annoyed and I‚Äôm discussion the game leader told me to stfu. So I quit.
                And then there's the people who call a meeting 5 seconds into the game and tell everyone who both the impostors are without them even having done anything
                    Early meeting callers automatically get the boot vote.


And I like to pretend I'm at the airlock door smiling and waving goodbye.

        >‚ÄúOkay fine it was me, but it‚Äôs also Lime.‚Äù

Ngl I do this every single game I'm an impostor and I get caught. Like I'll get belligerent and everything.

Only difference is I always blame a crewmate lol
            I was so ready to downvote you lol
                he had us in the first half, not gonna lie
                He‚Äôs a true imposter
            Always blame crew mates
                Always. If u wanna hear the messed up thing I did with this the just ask
            If you play with the same people a lot you can blame your actual teammate as well. They'll stop believing you and assume whoever you named isn't the imposter.

Pro strats.
            Yeah I do the same never my imposter bud tho
            That's a legit tactic though.
            I‚Äôm going to do this from now on. No crew mate is safe.
            "Why the fuck didnt you double kill ___?"
        My biggest pet peeve is the people who are outted and they just quit right then and there. No dramatic pause to see the animation, just boom , quit. These are the lamest people on the planet I swear.
            I always call them cowards when they quit.
            Especially as they can sabotage when dead. They can be very useful to the living imp.
            I played with the lamest person on Earth about a week ago. We voted out his partner, and he was the only person who didn't vote for him. So, I called an emergency meeting immediately after and had everyone vote him out. We win.  


He complained in the lobby that we voted him out without any valid reasoning and then kicked me from the game.
                They obviously haven't played clue
        I wish the two imposters couldn't see the other one. I think that would solve a lot of these problems.
            [deleted]
                What if trying to kill them, revealed them as an imposter instead
                    What if being able to kill the other imp was a game mechanic
            Yeah that should be an option in match set up.
            Conversely it can make for great/hilarious gameplay when they know.

Blue went off on Green last night in one of my games as he was getting voted out, basically "Well, you know what, Green is the other one. Screw you Green, you are the worst partner ever and I only got caught because you're so dumb, I want you to lose!"

So we instantly voted Green out next. Then we appeared back on ship and Yellow proceeded to rip my head off and Blue and Yellow won. Blue played us like a fiddle
            Nah i think the ability to help your friend lie is helpful and needed
    We have three rules on Discord: mute when not in a meeting.

Mute when dead.

You can only blame someone during the meeting, not before or after.

If anyone gets called out like this bullshit up here, we just vote like crazy to end the match.
        lol i made a dead chat and alive chat, muted until voting if you die you go to dead chat and can vibe with your ghost pals
            Same except the ghosts come back to alive chat during the meeting (but muted) so we can listen to the fighting.
                yup samme lol
            Do you wait till meeting to go to ghost chat?
        I had a game with just some siblings and one of their SOs once, with everyone in discord.

That was the greatest because we actually managed to talk about non related stuff during the rounds, do all the blaming and evidence during the meeting, and go back to other stuff during typical more times.

It was the best way to play, but obviously can't work with any randos.
    Yup.  I‚Äôve even lost a few games just to get them off the ship.
        Same. I hate this so much and i love that the lobbys im in also dislike it so we kinda throw the match to boot them out.
        I literally lied about someone venting just to get a cheater off a ship who admitted it.
    yup
    Wow that sounds nice. I called someone out for cheating when they snitched on me for killing their friend. Everyone still voted me out and the host didn't even kick them in the lobby afterward.
        This game needs banlists.
            Ya it would at least be nice to have usernames set in stone so there can at least be a community-kept list. And I don't recall them mentioning reporting features in the planned updates unfortunately.
                I'd also be ok with a reputation system: the more you get vote-kicked from games, the more you end up playing with people who were themselves vote-kicked from games.
                    Even better, people who abandon the game the instant they know they are not imp. I hate losing because we only have 2 crew suddenly after people leave.
                    Or, you earn a reputation, similar to reddit, and game hosts can set a minimum reputation level to join.
    when i play with people in person or on a call we dont tell each other who killed us
    But that doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything. The game is ruined since you know the imposter
    Eltoiat was not an impostor

Oh no! 
Anyway...
    The one time we caught this I got made and called them out for cheating and I got banned from the group.
    And then at the end of the game they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI tOLd YOu guYS iT WaS cYaN!!‚Äù

It‚Äôs like no shit, we‚Äôre not playing the game to get a cheap win we‚Äôre playing for fun
        Lmao it‚Äôs crazy how some people don‚Äôt understand this
    I would argue they should be kicked from the game. Every. Single. One. Of them.
    We don't play we just vote cyan finish the match and in the lobby kick those two and then start the match
. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ä¢„ÄÄ    „ÄÄÔæü„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÇ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ.

    Butt* fuck that guy
        In space, nobody can hear you scream.
            Yeah but they would never say no in space.


Because of the implication
        r/SuddenlyGay
    It was Eltiost
    Eltiost
Played public with my mates and I finally got imposter. I killed one in comms while lights where out and suddenly when the body got reported black jumped on me instantly saying that he saw me kill. My other imposter friend jumps in and says how when lights are off and body was found in comms and him and black where together in cams the entire time. 

Black switches it up to saying that he saw me vent, when I never vented that game, and still convinces people that I'm the imposter and voted me off. I couldn't figure out how he knew it was me, how he saw me vent when I never did. I asked him in the lobby after the game finished and he began dodging the question and just gloat saying that I got "detectived". 

He then fucked up by letting it slip that him and the guy I killed where brothers playing together. That's when I had two options. Ban him from lobby for ghosting, or I could play the long game and wait til the game where he gets imp just so I can randomly vote him off. Of course, being the adult, I decided to just tell him he ghosted and ban him. I totally did not wait 5 games just to give him a taste of his own medicine.
    I hope Among Us 2 will have 12 year old protection AKA bans and timeouts for cheaters and dodgers.
        [deleted]
            Nice!
                yeah, i think they said that the content made for the sequel will just be reused for a big update on this game
            Yup!
        Idk if you heard, but they canceled AU2. They decided to take all the ideas for 2 and will use them to improve AU1.
        There is a 5 minute ban time for dodgers
            Now you get the "its me vote me. I'm impos vote me"

Edit: I always try to convince others not to vote him and just ignore him when that happens
    Whenever I know someone is 100% teaming with someone, I‚Äôd just say ‚Äúweird, why are there multiple devices on the same WiFi router‚Äù and do some other hacky shit
    I had basically the same thing happen to me. I killed a guy in electrical with no one around, then vented to security, again with no one around and had enough time to kill another guy in security by the time the body in electrical was reported.

Guy then says I did it and they saw me vent on cams, only there are no cams in electrical, and I literally vented into the security room and no one was there.

So naturally I get voted off, then he and the guy I killed both left the game. Really ruined the game for me and I haven't played since. Like, obviously I was the imposter but they straight up lied about how they knew it was me.
        I feel your pain. Unfortunately since this game became super popular every public match has become this way. I‚Äôm happy I at least got a few hours on it weeks ago before it blew up to the point where it is now.
    Those people are the worst. I play in the same room as my fiance because we play before going to bed, but we never look at screens, talk, or cheat. If either of us die, we don't out the imp that kill us. Cheating ruins the game for everyone.
    I had the same thing but with 4 people talking on discord. I got imposter, didnt even kill a single person or vent, and after 15 sec an emergency meeting was called and they voted me off because "they got the feeling i was imposter". Such fucking dumbfucks
They have evolved:

> "insert color" did it trust me, vote me next if not him
    [deleted]
        > when I called a meeting to vote out the liar, I was voted out for being blood-thirsty.


God I hate that.
            God i hate people who arent meta enough to call the "X DID IT I SAW HIM" bluff. Not really, but i wanted build on your "i hate that"-vibe.

Trying to make votes happen quickly is "impostor 101". It happens in all games like this, secret hitler, warewolf, Among Us.

If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting then chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor.
                2/3 chances of being voted out if you call the meeting
                    Called a meeting because there were 3 crew mates and 2 impostors left so clearly we have to vote someone out or lose. They voted me out and lost.
                Thats why Im always the voice of reason. Whether imp or crew I'm always "skip if we're not sure, don't give imps a free kill" Doesn't work with idiot players, but with a rational bunch it keeps suspicion off me.
                    In my games I‚Äôve noticed the imp always tries to skip to ‚Äúremove suspicion ‚Äú
                >If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor

Right, stupid or impostor really doesn‚Äôt narrow it down at all chief
                    I know it doest, but it does show that taking things slow until you are sure you really want to lynch someone is usually better. Since you can probably narrow it down and at least exclude one of the first 2.
                This is actually incredibly dumb. I was voted out twice for witnessing and reporting the first kill. There is never a situation where a sane imposter would bluff on the first kill because they'd be voted out next round.
                    And thats something an impostor could use to their advantage. Hard accuse someone else the first round and since no sane impostor would do that - people would  be inclinded to agree.

Lynching someone because one person says they are the impostor is always usually bad. If you play 10 people 1 impostor it could be ok, since its ok to take chances. If you are down to 7 people including 2 impostors then perhaps you want more than one witness and/or accuser.
                        But what happens on the next round for this imposter?  I understand why an imposter would bluff with 4 ppl left but any more than that and they'll be out the next round.
        I got voted out because someone swore they saw me vent. I didn‚Äôt vent the entire game. I was the imposter, but still pissed someone lied and said I vented.
            Someone said I walked out of the room where the dead body was and I got ejected. They lied. I vented out of the room where the body was and he definitely didn‚Äôt see that
                He could have seen a glitched version of you. I saw Wildcat the other day get called out by Nogla due to a weird glitch where it looked like he vented into the body when he was venting in the corner.
            Haha thats the worst! I've been accused of venting twice while innocent and its so annoying. I always thought if that happened to me while actually the imposter how upset id be lmao.
            That also happened to me once. I was the one who made that round, and he got kicked, them he returned cause apparently he either had a friend in game telling him code or he remembered the code. I ended up banning him.
            Had this exact thing happen to me, and then the person who had been killed told me the person who lied was his sister and he told her I killed him. Told the group once we were back in the lobby and everyone acted like I was the asshole for being upset that people were cheating.
            Same, first imposter game in 4 hours and I got voted off by two separate lies (and these weren't randoms, they were friends who legitimately believed in what they saw).

The first said I must have vented out of XYZ room (I had not vented at all that game) and the other said I was "the only one who stayed behind at vitals, kinda sus" which also never happened. Actually, I thought they'd sus me because I was the only one who didn't get caught inside admin when the door closed.
            Often in public lobbies they can be sure it‚Äôs you for other reasons, that won‚Äôt convince everyone else, so they lie and they they saw you vent. 

As long as they‚Äôre not cheating, it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy, if annoying.
            Even worse, I was purple crew mate, and cyan said first vote ‚Äúhow do I go into vent like purple?‚Äù. 

I replied ‚Äúlies, but nice tactic‚Äù thinking he was imposter. 
Like, if he was imposter it‚Äôs a good move!

I got voted out and later he got ejected and wasn‚Äôt the imposter? 

What the hell?
        >Only works if you're 3

Why? The person you are voting out will BE the impostor, there's no reason to vote out discord informer next
            They're ruining the game, so vote them out.
                They‚Äôre more impostor than the impostor
        Also only works with confirms on. I play with confirms off specifically to defeat this move as it is way too powerful and puts way too much power in the hands of the crew.
            It still works with confirms off as long as there is only one impostor
            This is the only way to play
    I say exactly this every time I witness something that 100% indicts someone as being the Impostor (if I see a kill, if I see someone vent, etc).

I feel like it‚Äôs the best and only way to emphasize that I‚Äôm positive about what I saw, and to avoid being accused of lying/ framing someone for personal gain.

Why is this being looked down upon?
        [deleted]
            just fyi the weapons task where you shoot the meteors can verify you since you can see the guns shooting while you do it. I think fixing shields also like lights up so that's another way.
        Yeah. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs X or me next‚Äù is SOP if you have solid in-game reason. Not prima face evidence of cheating. 

Now when you KNOW you had a clean kill, and the person saying it was nowhere near, and they REFUSE to give a WHY its you in chat. That‚Äôs  Sus.
            that's not sus, that's discord.

and that's why I hate this game now
        >Why is this being looked down upon?

Because you should *include the 100% damning action in your call-out*. There's a mile's difference between "I saw Green vent" and "VOTE GREEN TRUST ME U CAN KICK ME IF NOT"
            Well, yeah, I do. Maybe I just misread the context of the comment I replied to
                Yeah, it sounds like that might be the case. We're talking about people using voice chat to ruin the game - when the guy above you said "they've evolved", he means that specific ambiguous phrasing allows cheaters to call the Imp out in a way that's less incriminating.   
       
If you've witnessed and included an actual cause for suspicion, I think everybody's cool with that.
                    Ah gotcha, makes sense now. Appreciate the clarification
            For those of us playing on tablets or phones, writing out the whole logic chain can be very time consuming, and often the first accusation gets the most weight in Among Us, so you want to get it out fast.

I‚Äôve also explained things in detail and have the idiots in my lobby say that it was SuS that I had such a convoluted explanation. 

Yes, if it‚Äôs as simple as green vent, sure. 

If it‚Äôs, I saw green run past me towards electrical, then I ran to medbay after stopping briefly in security, and he was coming out of medbay, and I don‚Äôt think he could have gotten there in time, so I think he vented. 

That took me 25 seconds to type out on an iPad. People would think i was calling for no reason if I took 25 seconds to get my accusation out.
        1. People definitely will not vote them out next round.
2. It's not proof of anything.
3. You can just lie and say this knowing it's unlikely they'll vote you out for getting it wrong.
        Yes exactly. There are 8 crewmates and 2 imposters. A 1 for 1 trade (one crewmate gets voted out+one imposter) is a very good deal.
        It's looked down upon when someone says it, but they are lying about it. If this happens to you as a Crewmate, it's annoying af.
    I was playing as imposter and killed someone, then got away and attained an alibi. When the body is reported, lime accuses me with no reasoning except ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù

I‚Äôm still seething with anger.
        [deleted]
            then you get trolls who call meetings just to waste people's time.
                The worst is people who call meetings/throw accusations because I followed them. Like you're way safer if I'm here because they NEED a double kill to get both of us but go get stabbed on your own I guess
                    I really fucking hate those people.

like dude, I'm standing 6 feet away from you just in case you're the imp, but I'm staying with you so we're both safe; if one of us dies, we know 1 of the imps. fucking idiots though, I swear. Whenever someone reports a body or calls a meeting, the person I'm following goes "/u/ILoveWildlife hella sus, keeps following me" and I get voted out
                        Good strat if you're an imposter and want to lose a tail without leaving a body though
                            yeah but it's easier to just kill the person following you around. People rarely pay attention to who's following who
                    [deleted]
                        Yeah literally the only thing that confirms a player for a vote is being seen by another player when the kill happens. I don't get why people don't understand this. It's very frustrating.
                This is why I only give players one emergency meeting each.
                Which is why we vote the time waster out
                [deleted]
            People throwing accusations without being able to justify them and others following them blindly seems way too realistic for a video game.
            That is why I never play with randoms anymore. Every match goes like this.

*I am a crew member [red] and someone found a dead body*

**Blue:** Where? 

**[Reporter] Cyan:** It‚Äôs red.

*Blue has voted*

*Cyan has voted*

*Orange has voted*

*Brown has voted*

**Red [Me]:** Wtf why?!? 

*Red was not the imposter, two imposters remain*
            I was in a game today. 4 ppl saw me scan first round, we talked about it. 3 people left, I saw the kill, but he reported first and said that I killed him. Before I even typed more than 1 massage saying I saw him kill and that I scanned before and confirmed safe I got voted off. All withing 10 sec of allowing the vote. It's such a shame because it was a good lobby but then it instantly puts a bitter taste in your mouth and you won't want to play anymore.
        That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt play this game with randoms

It literally gets me to the point where I want to scream at some of these guys. 

Baseless accusations followed by being loud mouth assholes and preventing 1) me from defending myself then 2) preventing anyone else in the discord from talking. 

One dude was so sure I was an imp one game and I said ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not the imp at the end of the game, you‚Äôre a pretty pink princess bitch and have to change your name to PPPB. Guess who rage left at the end of the game when I wasn‚Äôt shown as an imp.
    >"insert color" did it trust me, vote me next if not him

That is stupid like,why? You know people aren't going to do it because they want to play the game
        Yeah, someone did this to me recently, like they had zero evidence

Except the guy clearly was on Discord with another one
        My friend does it bud. He gets away with it everytime too..
        Usually people say this when they are 100% sure it's someone, be it because the saw them kill/vent, or if they are scum, their friend told them on discord. But it's a legit tactic. If I see someone kill, and people don't believe me enough, I'll say vote me next if it isn't him, because I know it's him. Only works if confirm eject is off tho.
        It think it's the blind "trust me" part because it indicates that he didn't actually see shit but is cheating by talking to a friend IRL who is in the lobby and got killed.
The only time it's acceptable to share who the imposter is, is when you are a ghost talking to the other ghosts
    So, I always play over discord, so I seldom use chat. I assume ghost chat is for ghosts only right? Cause that would be a glaring issue if not. Lol
        Only ghosts can see other ghosts talk.
            Perfect, thanks.
                And ghosts can also see what the living are saying. They see both.
                    Ok yeah, I knew that just from the logs, just was afraid to type in case somebody seen it. Don't wanna ruin the game!
            One time I encountered a glitch where a living person could see ghost chat.
I see that "dummy" in the background. This was in freeplay!
    Why does it matter, I mean it does happen in real games
        More of an observation than anything else
This happened to me today. I killed yellow in electrical and black instantly called a meeting and told everyone his friend said irl that green killed him. There should be pemalty for ruining the game like that.
    Flip it around. Kill yellow in electrical, call a meeting, say you're on voice chat with yellow and <random dude> killed him.
        I mean thats good but they always use technique: If not green then its black. 
So now its 50-50 of u Will be The first voted out, If yes then gg, if no then u can do sabotage lights or etc and kill one more atleast before they Will call mesting. And then i can say that The other is Pink for example so 2 crewmates out LMAO
    Just say "vote him out for cheating" or something like that
    Perma kids who do this tbh
I‚Äôve had that happen to me. Needless to say, I pissed.
    Yeah. Wait a long time to become imposter and within a few mins it‚Äôs game over
        Happened to me yesterday

Cams were off, white alone inside of nav, everyone was separated: the perfect crime. I closed the doors and did the deed, immediately jumping into the vents to wait it out. A solid 30 seconds passed with no one reporting the body, I'm thinking to myself ahh what a nice kill. All of a sudden red walks up to the body. "SeaPickles did it i saw him kill".

NO YOU DIDNT BRO THERES NO POSSIBLE WAY YOU SAW THAT AND THEN WAITED 30 SECONDS TO REPORT. Turns out after they voted me out I talked to the ghost and he was just hurling insults at me, calling me noob and much worse, it sucked dude players like this ruin the game for everyone
            Yeah one time yellow said that green was walking away from the body, but we voted green and it wasn't green. At the next meeting yellow said they swore they saw green and hurled insults at everyone in ALL CAPS, then left the game.
                He may have actually seen green. There is some bug, or exploit, where players can be another players color.
                    The problem we had was that yellow verbally assaulted everyone in all caps for zero reason
    You pissed? Bro why would you share that info with us
        People need to know details.
Almost downvoted this post because of how pissed that made me.
    Don't worry, it was faked anyways. OP made a dummy session, you can see the names behind the chat.
        Yeah but this still happens regularly and it‚Äôs annoying
    This kept happening to me earlier with major & major 1 full on said I killed his friend. (I did tho) the lobby weren‚Äôt having his shit tho and ejected him it was brilliant
Ah yes, Dummy 1
come on. no cheating
EMERGENCY MEETING!!

Purple out.
i play on facetime with my girlfriend and dont mute so we can chat idly while playing. we absolutely do NOT tell each other when we've been killed or who killed us unless we're both dead, the closest ive gotten to snitching has been when i made a noise of surprise when i got offed and she said, 'you got killed, didnt you?' CHEATING BY TELLING OTHERS WHATS GOING ON RUINS THE GAME AND SEVERS THE FUN IN HALF FOR EVERYONE. its ok to chat on voice while playing, BUT MUTE EVERYONE WHO PREFERS TO STAY QUIET AND DONT TALK ABOUT THE GAME. if we know something we technically shouldnt, we dont bring it into conversation with the other players and play dumb so the games only really ruined for us. its that simple.
    I play with my bf on the phone so we can talk when we *both* die. We stay on mute until both of us are dead so we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs the impostor. We‚Äôll just be walking around together and I‚Äôll be feeling safe, then BAM he cuts my fucking head off when we‚Äôre alone. Makes me die laughing
    Me and my boyfriend do this, we‚Äôre unmute the whole time and usually tell each other when we die but not who. If we‚Äôre crewmates I always follow him around to make him paranoid lmao
I just got into a situation like this and instead of voting the impostor everyone voted him just because he was an asshole.
    But you have to kick them out not airlock. Or they just refuse to finish tasks as a ghost out of spite. 

Same for AFKs. I said we needed to kick an AFK to finish a game and the morons took that to mean airlock him.
        i have to confess to not doing tasks as a ghost when i am voted out with no evidence at all
    I've been in the final 3 when a guy said he was 9n a discord and that cyan was the impostor, i was like, well that sucks now im going to lose, and voted for the cheater, intentionally losing the game, he was pissed that he lost, and probably learned nothing
Actually a true story, I was playing and someone screen cheated with their friend, there were two imps and 5 people left.

We just voted out the screen cheated
    Another true story, I died and my friend asked who the imposter was, I lied and made him accuse somebody else and everybody voted him out later. Ngl it was a good sacrifice.
I'm using that technique when I'm impostor, then they vote out some poor soul esp. when confirm ejects was off
    You are doing god's work.
    Yeah I always take one of them with me. ‚ÄúRed was the other imposter‚Äù
        "Orange is the other imposter! I dunno why he snitched on me. Vote him out after me so we can get a new game."

Everyone complains that I ruined the game and curses me. I get voted. Orange still denies everything and gets voted.

"Orange was not An Imposter"

Apologize to Orange in Ghost chat.
            Satan is waiting for you in hell
    Oh my god it would be such a great troll to tell people "I'm on voice chat with orange and he told me black killed him" when it was actually me who killed orange
        well  when youre an imp you gotta throw everything when you are getting cornered
            Yeah, I have no problem with lies about discord calls or whatever. There is still no way to verify anything anyone says, so there is no harm in saying anything to try and get out.
This same thing happened to me when I was imposter and there were just the three of us left.  
The last innocent who didn't cheat voted the cheater out and said "I'd rather lose to imposter than win by cheating"  
I told that person so many times I appreciated them.
I play with my friends on call in public. But if someone says who is impostor. I ban them for a whole day on discord. ƒ∞f they accidentally say it l give them 1 more chance.
    [deleted]
        They say "I was so scared and it accidentally slip from my mouth."I still give them a chance though if they use the same excuse again. I ban them a whole day.
            Ah, ok thanks
                Nice Profile picture my dude
                    Thanks
            "FUCK I NEW IT WAS YELLOW" _oop_
    I was with 2 friends on discord, while being on a public server. 1 ratted me out, i immediately had to kill the other to stop them from throwing the game
    weird having to parent your friends
What a piece of shit, I absolutely hate people that do this
[deleted]
    My wife and I play next to each other. If one of us is the imposter we just don‚Äôt accuse each other in game and let the other play their game out. Honestly one of us is rarely the imposter anyway. 

Last night was the first time we broke that rule because the other team had three people in discord and they were calling out imposters with no evidence when one of them died. So for a game I played stupid and kept accusing one of them. We got down to four people, two of them, me and my wife as the imposter. The were both voting for her and getting belligerent in chat making up seeing her vent when she never did so we would both vote for one of them to tie until she killed them to win the game.
    Dang, these people are harsh. I wasnt even thinking about headphones, I was just reading a wholesome anecdote about what sounds like a sweet fiance
    My boyfriend and I play in the same room (sorry, its just the way our office is set up!) as well and we always try to play super fair in game if we accidentally see each others screens or if something. Its so much more fun to play the way its intended. I hate it when people talk through discord, it totally ruins the game :/.
        yeah same! we are silent while playing and have our screens apart. It's very satisfying when I get away with being imposter with him in the same room lol
    You could mute the game.. I‚Äôve never played with volume
        [deleted]
            Sorry for all the people grilling you
            Use headphones
            Use headphones then.
    Ignore the neckweirds
    Heyyyy I do the same! Mostly I just forget to mute, but my fiance and I play late at night when we're about to fall asleep so we just turn our screens away. If he accidentally hears because I forgot to mute, he plays it off and won't vote me unless he has in game proof (ie If someone sees me vent, he'll be right on board to vote me off, or if I fake the wrong task, he'll call an emergency meeting and get me outta there lol)

I wish people would get off your ass for this though, sensory issues aren't something you can help. You clearly have said you can't mute it because it seriously messes with you so why would putting in headphone and not wearing them help? Also you said that wearing headphones just isn't a thing your brain lets you do, so why get up in arms about it?
    You can scream to the top of your lungs when you kill someone so that he doesn‚Äôt hear it, and just move on like nothing happened without even mentioning it.

Eventually he‚Äôll be deaf and won‚Äôt be able to hear when you kill someone without you screaming. Problem solved!
    Damn y'all being rude for no reason I don't think this isn't cheating this is just cute and wholesome :3
    I think the reason people seem to be up in arms is that it seems to negatively effect your fianc√© and they‚Äôre sticking up for him in a way. 

Yes, it‚Äôs sweet that they don‚Äôt call you out but the argument being made is that if you could lower your tablet volume, or sit farther away, or maybe play some music during, this could be a more enjoyable experience for your fianc√©. 

If I was playing with someone and had to pretend I didn‚Äôt know they were imposter, that‚Äôs not fun.

It‚Äôs silly, but I think that‚Äôs where everyone is coming from.
        [deleted]
            Eh seems sus, vote dandy-lou ;)
    Ngl that's how it should be
    You‚Äôre fine my Fianc√© and I play in the same room constantly rn due to space restraints. I don‚Äôt have headphones rn and we‚Äôre usually in eyesight of each other‚Äôs screens. We put our blinders on and pretend not to know each other until we‚Äôre both dead haha
        haha ikr literally the "pretend I do not see" meme

It's really not that hard to ignore/pretend you didn't. My fiance has killed me plenty of times when I knew he was the imposter because of accidentally seeing/hearing something, I'm not gonna throw suspicion towards someone without evidence, otherwise that just makes ME look suspicious.
            Exactly! And it‚Äôs just not fun to start a witch hunt. Happy cake day!!!
    Headphones. Headphones.
    Just make him play sitting on the crapper, like the rest of us.
    [deleted]
        Sound like she has sensory issues and not hearing would mess with her too much, so I'm guessing there's something about headphones that does the same
        Because he doesn't want to. Lmao that's it.
            Or change rooms or work together on one device
Joined a group and they immediately sussed me, straight up said that their friend told them on vc. I admitted because I didn't want to play with cheaters and told them to just vote me, idc. It ended up being a tie so I got to last another round, the oxygen went out and they lost lmao

Someone even said "just vote so black will stop complaining" like of course I'm going to complain, you dickbag cheaters.

Someone else cheated in our favor (made it so they can see who's imposter) and I made it clear how I felt about that and bullied him out. He was defending it, saying it was fun. No.
Some bitch claimed I was the impostor and that I was on my phone sitting next to him. 

I was on my pc. 

He wasn't even the impostor.

He lied for nothing.

????
remember guys, there's a KICK PLAYER button right next to the chatbox
I plag with my family on this game sometimes and my mom is like" why don't i tell you who kiled me" i said no don't do that, " why?", you are looked down upon in this world for such thoughts
    Yesterday I had a game with a perfect kill and was voted out because some kids mom told on me lol
This is the kind of shit that happened in the first year it came out,I'm sadden to know that those type of people are still around
Just don't say that
so everyone agrees to vote him off, right?
like literally! just stfuuuu pleaseee
Purple was not the impostor.... no one cares he is a professional retard
Id literally only ever do this as imposter but guess that makes me sus
[Purple was not the Imposter]
This happened to me and half of people voted for me and half voted for him. I killed him in front of everyone next round and told them to vote me out. Best lobby I‚Äôve ever been in.
What if we partial do this. Where we go "Fuck I just died in medical"
    Probably not the best, but far from the type of cheating shown in the meme. They‚Äôll probably report your body anyway.
    Any communication with your team after your death is cheating. The game only lets you talk to teammates while your alive so calling your death location is still an unfair advantage.
Me and my friends do this. We stay in call so it‚Äôs harder to lie about being imposter. It‚Äôs rlly fun when one of us is imposter but when we are all innocent or die we shut up or just don‚Äôt mention. Cheating like that is just pathetic.
In one game some kid did that like 3 rounds in a row so I got my friend in the game and l did the same thing to him when he got impostor
I accidentally cheated once and found out who was imposter. I didn't tell anyone and continued playing like I had no idea 

We lost. But better then being a cheater
I have felt worse, in a game I was the impostor and I killed one and no one found out that Iwas the impostoe but then the orange speaks and said that I was the impostor because I have killed ia other account. This guy have two fucking account so he can tell who is the impostor when the impostor kill his other account. It was just wtf. p.s. dorry for my bad english I am italian
"everyone disliked that"

dankmemes is leaking
    Oh god oh fuck
\[Everyone hates that kid.\]
Hello, exterminator here, I'll go and get em if you encounter them. Killing at 15x speed with Axey mods
Tip: try to use this as an exscuse if you are imposter. If the lobby members would fall for it, varies by lobby.
Why do people do this? Pls someone tell me!
    They want to play with their friends, but they don't really care about other people's enjoyment of the game.
    They want to "win", because winning is fun. Any method used to win is acceptable to them because their fun is more important than anyone elses.

Also trolling. They play the game to piss other people off as a power trip.
"Its just a game, don't get mad at us bro lmfaoooo"
"Other people do it so why can't we?"
"You're mad because you're 12 bro, no one cares"
Who's heard these responses from the cheaters?
The people who play are children, I just say that that‚Äôs not possible and they believe me every time.
Congratualtions, you earned the "Guy who ruined the game badge"
Almost as bad as people who start an emergency meeting right when the game starts.
That happened to me yesterday. It was left and one was like "it was yellow my friend told me" and then thay both voted,I was so mad
Last night guy running the game and his ‚ÄúWifey‚Äù were playing. (Her actual character name.)

Not only did he blatantly ignore her venting. (I saw it as ghost, and a live player reported it but hubby‚Äôs silence while being present cast doubt in the chat.)

But then on the next game after the first kill (white), Wifey chats ‚ÄúWhite is my husband and he says pink is the imposter‚Äù. To their credit the rest of us ignored it and tried to play normal. To the point pink won.  Gave Wifey shit in the next lobby and got kicked.
The worst is actually when people leave the match as soon as it starts because they‚Äôre not the imposter.
i was imposter and i killed white, then someone calls an emergency meeting. they say it‚Äôs me, because they were watching whites livestream. i got voted off. fuck those guys
As an OG in Among us, This is basically how you become the lowest scum In the game
Votes purple out.

*Eltiost was not the imposter.*

Everyone:

Oh no,

Anyways.
"I saw *Color* vent."

After calling an emergency meeting 10s into the round.
dummy 1 dummy 2
People who do this are stupid
There are one game I killed white and pink report and said white told him it was me in call. I‚Äôm like what‚Äôs the fun if you cheat like that in this game.
Kill him, kill him now.
They are scum bags and ruined the fun for every one else, when I see people do that I tell the other crew mates to vote them off no matter who the imposter was ratted out by cheater
What do people even get out of this
This happened to me once, it took me an hour to get impostor and when I killed cyan and reported the body, brown said this. "Guys it's white my brother told me." "He got killed guys it's white" I get voted off. Then next round, my impostor teamate killed a guy, brown said this. "Guys it's cyan my brother is a ghost."
What's worse? The person who tells people who the impostor is over discord or the crewmember who helps his impostor friend win by intentionally lying?
Happened to me once, just gave up and said "seriously? You're cheating?
Had two guys who swore they didn't know eachother, orange and yellow. they stuck together like glue the whole game then yellow killed in front of brown and orange swore up and down that it was brown. We voted out yellow and he was imp. I kicked orange for lying and then yellow left as well. It's super annoying.
If you do this, just find a different game to ruin. There‚Äôs literally no point to this as there is no reward system
I hate when this happens- even when i play with my cousins , everyone goes to a room alone , and then if im the imposter and kill one of them the other one starts saying that im the imposter üôÑ I HATE IT
    Same, I was over to a friends house, some ppl I don‚Äôt recognize too. I got imposter, I killed one of them when sabotaging the lights. They then said ‚ÄúIT WAS PURPLE IT WAS PURPLE!‚Äù (My color was purple) So I got ejected immediately.
If people do this they deserve to be voted off first.
This happened to me! The person who cheated had the nerve to ask ‚Äúhow am I cheating?‚Äù 
Somehow, they still lost LOL
This is why I dont play with friends.
My friends and I play with randoms in a discord, but we dont say anything if we are the imposter, or we get killed by the imposter. we just keep quiet, that's what makes the game fun, I hate people who do this
Dude last night a brother and sister were in our group and were playing mobile sitting next to each other.  Every time orange was killed, blue would start saying "It's red, he just killed my sister!!!"  At first we thought it was a joke, but we eventually found out he was correct, and we promptly piled on the cheater and kicked him
This happened to me yesterday and this guy jusy could NOT wrap his head around how that‚Äôs cheating and ruins the game. I was so mad at him that whatever chance I got I made his game miserable until he left the game.
This is why I stopped playing in public servers
so, did you vote the cheater out
I was playing in this one match and some guy kept saying to watch his tik toks and follow his instagram and we would just vote him off each round and the other crewmates would keep insulting him to stop. Then the guy that made the server eventually kicked him.
People who do this kind of thing don't use consent
Had a hacker in my lobby last night tell us for 3 rounds who the imposters were. Not a fun game at all. He legitimately told us he was hacking the game ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yeah......no
Once I got a whole squad of 6 members named form 1 to 6, and I killed one of them, they all gaslighted me with no proofs. It's sad.
This happened to me the other day, we just kicked them from the game. We even let the imposter stay another round to be fair.
I played about 3h tryna get imposter.I kill a guys sister.u know wat happened
Exactly what happened in my match, I was imp and this other imp kept saying it was me but then he got voted out, then he told his friend on discord that I‚Äôm other imp so yea. Frick him.
Happened to me before and instead of the lobby voting out the impostor, they voted out the cheater and let the impostor win. Not mad the impostor won though
"Hey guys! Why is my name red? And why is AG74683s name red too?!"
You know what else is garbage? "Vote me, I don't want to be Impostor." Are you serious, man? You're so unhappy with your role that you throw the game before anything fun happens?
I‚Äôd vote him off just to spite. Except I‚Äôve been in those games and the other crew mates voted me off and left them in the game. So I quit and went searching for another crew.
One time a red guy was impostor and a purple guy was telling us constantly that his friend got killed by red and he told him on discord, we all unanimously agreed to not vote red and either skip or vote someone else out, the purple guy left and red won.
y'know what I hate? whenever I'm imposter and the other imposter calls me out for being imposter and we lose
I got banned for saying that's cheating XD
This happened once in a game, we literally just skipped the vote and I put together some real proof
I had this happen to me too, I killed brown and then lime reported and said that it was me because she was looking at her sister's phone. like BRUH wth, that's considered cheating. this ppl piss me off.
What if Eltiost was the impostor, it's a good tactic, just say oh no my friend confused the color, now he doesn't remember, or my friend lied to me
Somone one did this and we all voted him off. Next game, I perminately banned the both of them. Cheater's never win.
I played a game last night and I was the imposter with Orange. I killed someone, orange reported the body and then said he saw me kill and then vent. He wasn't there, didn't see me kill. I didn't vent. He just wanted to be an asshole and rat me out. Confirm ejections weren't even on so it's not like anyone could confirm he was telling the truth. Still got voted out.
When I'm host I just remove them.
I just played an imposter game, and the first guy I killed outed me on voice chat. I know I was the imposter but that betrayal was rough.
Me and my friends played with discord since typing takes time. I got imposter on the first round and got the smoothest kill. It turns out that it was my friend's nephew that I snapped its neck and immediately turned to babbled on my friend's mic. Goddamn I was so salty over a kid that I kinda felt my blood boil.
If your gonna play together don't snitch it makes the game stupid
snitches get stitches
HAAHAHA I SEE DUMMIES 1 AND 3 IN THE BACK
My friends and I discord, but we swore to each other to never tell someone who killed them. We mainly do it to have conversations.
Try being in a lobby then suddenly the buttons pressed and 3 people vote, why I ask? "we discussed in discord"... Oh OK, so what are the rest of us meant to do? Be the npcs for you and your friends? Banned all of them
one time White killed me then told everyone it was yellow, and that I was friends with white. See Yellow is my friend whenever I play, I always play with friends, so it was a dead giveaway it was white. I didn‚Äôt tell them, so it wasn‚Äôt cheating, just a shit lie.
This is how a friend got me killed he decided to scream my name while we were in a call with another person, so I could have possibly played it off if he wouldn't have screamed my name to the other person.
Boot him
I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs right he‚Äôs going off first. Voted purple
I play with my husband and his friends (they're on Discord), and we have a rule that you CANNOT give info away, exception being if you get murdered and say "oh great that sucks!" Or something along those lines. Because if you're dead, ofc you're not the imp lmao. Basically, play as if we're not in Discord. There have been plenty of times where husband and his friend conspired to take me out and I had no clue, it's more fun that way lol üòÇ

One time we did go into a public lobby, and 4 of the players were clearly cheating on Discord. They even admitted it in the end. So it was the 4 of us vs the 4 of them, and we ended up deciding to work together during those matches to get the 2 randos to vote with us. The cheaters didn't even realize we were doing it too until the end. It was actually pretty wild lol
i sit in discord with my friends but if they're dead the fucking mute. I HATE THAT PEOPLE DO THIS SHIT. i literally play next to my boyfriend on p.c. and i just don't look at his screen... it's not hard
Yeah this ruins the game. Last night I had a group of people in my game, one person sat in emergency button and when one of their friends were killed they immediately pressed it, no chatting just all vote for me.
I hate these fuckers. One time I got voted because a kid PUBLICLY stated his cousin (that I killed in that game) told him I was the impostor. Then when I called them out they kept laughing at me for being "salty".

If only I could give wedgies through the internet.
Cyan: Voted out
Cyan was the Imposter
1 imposter remaining
Imposter: Say goodnight mother fucker
if you do this, you deserve to die or get voted off in the game
Just have Cyan kill him
This a pussy move
Then they say: *huh kick me next if I was wrong*
Whenever this happens, vote out the cheater.
hOw dO yOu vEnT lIkE cYaN? iM nEw. hAHa
i just downloaded discord and my friend said we should play among us and tell each other who‚Äôs the impostor,i of course said that would be cheating
honestly is it so hard just to play the game normally
My kid did this once. Told him to never do it again. He hasn't.
Douchebags
Thats when you vote cyan and then click that little kick button for purple. Fuckem both.
If everyone on the server is on discord and you have rules, it enhances the game.

If you‚Äôre a screen-sniping pussy-shriveling crotch goblin troglodyte, you‚Äôre the guy in the picture
I play while on call with my wife and the first time we ever played I was imposter so I killed her lol.
i use that plague doctor mask and say ‚Äò i couldn‚Äôt see through my mask sorry‚Äô
This guy tried arguing with me about how it wasn‚Äôt wrong to do this and I was just telling him calmly (because he was so mad) that you‚Äôre literally getting told who the imposter is by your friend, who does. That‚Äôs cheating. He resorted to calling me names because he didn‚Äôt know what to say and he says I ruin the game for people when I was calling HIM out for ruining the game for other people. He told everyone I was the imposter because I killed his friend and still nobody voted me because of him it was so funny lol
My friends and I chat while in game but don't tell each other if we're impostor and don't rat out who killed us. I also kick these people as host after a game if it's obvious they've done it
If I had a dollar for the amount of times I‚Äôve locked the doors, killed someone, and someone else across the ship calls an emergency meeting before the doors even unlock to say they saw it happen right in front of them & bet their life on it, I‚Äôd have enough money to send the devs to implicate anti-cheat.
This happened to me recently.  I killed white, and a emergency meeting was called after by our orange player named Naruto saying he knew I killed white because they were in discord together and he told them.  I somehow didn't get voted out (whether because they didn't want to reward the cheater or just didn't believe him I couldn't tell) and went on kill another person and survive another round of voting to win the game.  

Aftergame lobby I ask him how it felt to cheat and lose anyway, and they both immediately leave.  Rest of the players were like "wow they are SALTY" but it still wasn't a fun experience.

tldr if you see an orange player name Naruto kick them because they are a cheater.
Yalls a cheata
The worst is people with 2 accounts.
That is the worst, its even worse when they are not the imp.
u/Dedebott lol
    Lol
snitches are bitches üòÇ
My vote would be on purple.
insta ban him plz
Once I was in a *public* game as imposter. About a min in and I hadn't killed anyone but someone called meeting. Dead silence, no one was typing in chat "Hey what's up? What's going on?" I type and about 20s later after noone typing anything, everyone voted me off. No doubt they were all talking elsewhere all buddy buddy
Did you know people hack the game, like there was a video of some guy proudly saying he hacked the game and can kick people and see the imposter
Omg this happened yesterday a sister called emergency meeting was like its so so because my brother just died and told me. Ugh
Like this crap happens often 
Once I was in mach and guy is like lime killed my friend we are on discord talking (there were five of us)
And we were eh okay and we voted him out and lime wasn't even an Impostor so from that perspective it was a great plan and niba won that round.
So me and my friends play on discord, and when they die sometimes they scream who, but I never say anything unless I actually see it happen because I know I‚Äôd hate for that to happen to me as imposter.
was playing in a lobby with some people. thought they were cool. then black is like "red is the imposter. red and white". and I ask how he knows and he goes "I can see on whites screen irl"

after the game I responded "exposing your friend, that's pretty cringe" and then he kicked me
Someone did this the other day and I suggested we kick them. They weren't kicked and most crewmates left. The host called me the b-word, said it was my fault everyone left and banned me. 

This isn't always an easy game to play.
This is when I use the nice votekick feature
People who do this are legitimate trash.
Just vote purple lmao
Just kick them off the game. Hate those people..
Worst thing that happened me as an imposter was getting sold out by my imposter teammate. Had a clean kill, no witnesses, not near a camera and my imposter buddy saw me  vent as he came into the room. Proceeded to report the body and out that he saw me vent (I was 100 percent clear and in the free). As I was getting voted off I admit I got pissed off and outed him aswell. He admitted that he did it to prove his innocence (now i wouldn't have minded if this was close to the end of the game and i was already suspect, but this was literally the first kill of the game, just made no sense)
This is my little brother , I hate playing with him. Last time he was taking a peak at my sister‚Äôs screen and told me she was the impostor, she proceeded to get him voted out lol.
My friends and I will all be in discord while we play together. We mute until it‚Äôs time for a meeting, and we mute when we die until the game is over. There‚Äôs no reason to cheat on a game like this, it literally just ruins the fun.
I wish instantly people would just ban/kick/vote these people out
My friends and I play in discord all the time,  but we don‚Äôt say who killed us or who the imposter is people who do that suck
I hate when people do this
People like that are the worst honestly
I had this happen to me. Unfortunately it was a random lobby so people didnt vote the cheater out. I was angry because it was the first time i got impostor in over 2 days.
This just happened to me and right now I'm on Reddit to calm the fuck down
Eltiost was ejected.
Even as a new player I knew not to do that, this guy is just a borderline asshole
I feel like this game is only good when you go to discord servers that aren't meant to play the game right. Join public lobbies is a fucking joke.
I‚Äôve had someone do this to me when I WASN‚ÄôT EVEN IN DISCORD WITH THEM
i like to be in a call with my friend when im playing but i wouldnt cheat because that just ruins the game, i just hate the stereotype that if you are talking to someone you are cheating. we arent telling each other anything we literally just want to talk but everyone instantly assumes that we are cheating
Purple sounding pretty sus
Or if you are imposter and the other imposter tells who is imposter and the leaves
Yesterday I played a random game and a 4 stack kept trolling and told everyone they saw me vent when I wasn't even an impostor
I had the same the but one of them had a brother and ruin the game so I killed who had a little brother so him will not give me away as the imposter
Surprisingly I haven't run into anybody doing this yet.
that‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt play the game with discord.
Me and my one friend play while were on a call all the time, and we constantly make fun of people like this. It's just so toxic. Let people have fun.
People like this deserve to have their pc destroyed
It‚Äôs funny because they could also be lying and be the imposter just trying to get cyan out because cyan is sus of him in which case is a good strategy
Why is this true on a scary level
My rule is: I'll tell my friend but they wont accuse until there I'd actual evidence.
This totally takes the fun out of finding the imposter :(
No, everyone hates this. It eliminates the fun from the game.
This literally ruins the thrill of the game.
Imagine thinking the point of games is getting to the victory screen instead of just playing the mf game
My friends tell me who killed them so I when they do I make a point to help the imposter win
One time I was imposter with another person and I killed someone alone in medbay and then I hear very faintly "It's [insert colour] I'm dead in medbay"
I hate those types of people.
these people don‚Äôt deserve to play.
Guess we killing purple and giving Cyan the W.
Just had this happen to me this morning... I just wanna have fun as imp and these hilarious people are like, ‚Äúnah‚Äù
Just played with two guys like that. This is what I did as imposter:

I didn‚Äôt kill those two people( black and red) and would follow other people.

The two guys split up, but I was able to trick one of them into voting out the other. After this happened, I killed that second guy, and was clear of them.
I have had games like this most people just vote out who said that and then play like nothing happened, we pretend that he was lying and that we have no idea and actually try and find out for ourselves to see if it is that person or not
I see. You are also a discouraged individual in search of justice. I tip my hat to you.
They need to get banned fr
I had a game like this end in a really satisfying way. 2 imp round, other had been caught and voted out early. There‚Äôs four of us left. An emergency meeting is called and two of the four accuse me. I ask for proof, and they say their friend (my most recent kill) told them. I say ‚Äúwell cheating is fun :\‚Äù. White agrees with me apparently because he quietly votes for one of them so we tie. This happens twice over until one of them leaves the game and I kill the other right at the button. We may have been on opposing teams, but white was my true teammate that round. <3
Once I had some friend's friends who wasn't on vc and purposely voted for me out when they knew who the imposter was. Cheaters on this game sucks, ruins the entire experience.
What‚Äôs the point in even playing this game if you are going to have someone tell you who the imposter is.
People that do that are the worst and shouldn‚Äôt be able to play the game
Just vote tue guy out and keep playing and if it was the actual impostor kick him
lol i was teaching my lady the game the other day and first game everyone was sus cuz she was learning and slow lol
Does no one else see the free play Dummies in the background?
Kick him
This is why I rarely enjoy playing Among Us with my friends irl.
    have you asked them to not be dickbags
And what happanned to the rule of No talking is allowed to keep it fair between the impostor and the crewmate
at that point, vote out purple. i love democracy.
Yeah literally the worst
Yeah that clearly happened to me when I was the murderer.
sometimes me and friend talk during the game but we dont say who the imposter is if we get killed
This ruins the game and I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd be satisfied cheating. This and arguing like that moron XQC
not funny
If you‚Äôre going to do this, at least try to put some blame on the killer and dont say you‚Äôre on discord
Everyone vote purple
What sucks more is when a whole party is on discord and they don't talk in text chat. One time one of my friends got randomly voted out by a group of people and they didn't say why they were sus of him in text they did not say anything
I play with my friends and we don't mute in the call, but if we get killed we just said that we are dead but not who did it
I played a game yesterday and there were 3 people who were all together and the imposter was venting in front of us.  Then they all started trolling and started making the votes even and the game went on for like 15 extra minutes because they were helping each other, so annoying
*Shhhhhhhh*
I hope he trips over and falls onto a brick head first
my friend always used to spoil it for me, it was really annoying
Remember, there's a vote kick button that appears under the chat button while chat is open! Takes three players voting regardless of the number alive
This kinda happened to my group last night where one of the new players vented I front of everyone but we just ignored it as she did it by accident so we just moved on
This makes playing with randoms the worst. I was imposter one game, literally walked down the right side to weapons/nav with like 3 other people at the very start. I killed no one, as obviously would be stupid amongst so many others. Body is reported 2 seconds later by black and says its engine. 

Straight away just starts spamming 'pink, pink, pink, pink.' without any proof or reason. 

Like I was an imposter, but I didn't even see or kill the other person. Sometimes people are so stupid and clearly in some kind of chat and are terrible at hiding it
Yeah I just kick em from the game at that point. Definitely ruins the game
This happened to me once and i said it was cheating and the entire lobby was like ‚Äúhow lol‚Äù and then i just left
Bruh this happened to me and then everyone voted me off, then the guy had the audacity to say lol to me
that's such a dick move honestly
Dude this happens and I'm like thats unfair and then the cheaters are always the host for some reason and they kick ME out instead of them
Dude I played with one of these people, no one did anything about it and they just cheated the whole way through
Happened to me once when apparently someone screen peaked their friend who I had already killed. I called them out on it and left before they could vote me off.
"Even if it was Cyan you're still a piece of garbage and we're banning you and your friend."
Purple was the impostor
Public lobied shouldnt have codes
immediately eject people like that and they will catch on
I stop talking after im dead cause well that's just shit
We ban him whenever that happens yeah it ruins the game but whatever it won‚Äôt happen again
Relatable
I‚Äôd vote him out just for that
When you make a meme on free play because you don‚Äôt want to find an actual example. I‚Äôm joking around. It‚Äôs a good meme either way.
Haha, playing with friends on discord is so much more fun that playing blind.
This happened to me when I was playing among us and I was the imposter, I kill brown, in the chat someone say it was me with perfect detail HOW I kill brown and in the end it made him look super sus because you described with perfect detail how I kill this person that very sus.
[deleted]
    *Guys it's purple, vote him out*

#Oh shit. he wasn't the impostor. oh well.
        Whenever this happens to me (as an honest mistake) i always start the next round of discussion with "So, elephant in the room...." or if i'm imp it's more like "Well this is awkward." In pubmatches people's memory is usually so short theyve moved on anyways.
            If I‚Äôm imp after this I kill someone in a group immediately after, then cop to it and false accuse someone as being the other imp. Trying to play it off like a rage quit kinda thing because I got caught lying.
                If i am the imposter and I get caught I simply name another innocent person as my another imposter and boom I take 1 more with me
                    I did that once and took 2 people with me.
                        How did you take 2 with you?
Also can you teach me to be that sneaky?? üòá
                            Someone believed that the person I picked was the imposter. Everyone said if that person wasn't the imposter, they would pick him.

He didn't have a good time.
                            I think he was playing 3 imps.
Tip:If u see some1 alone and ur the imp sabotuage lights so there is no chance someone sees u doing it.
If they didnt discover the body sabotuage the doors where the body is at if there is no door do electric again and u might get away with 2 kills :)))

Edit:Woah my best was 10 thx for 50 upvotes i though every people that knew the game well will do that so they wouldnt upvote it.
                                Nope. It was a 2 imposter game. It just the person I picked also happened to be another non-imposter's pick.
                        There's nothing quite like the feeling of playing imposter and seeing one crewmember accuse another crewmember with the ol' "if it's not him vote me" and knocking out two birds with one stone.
            Dude they won't even remember that for the last two meetings purple got 2 innocent crewmates kicked off for no reason.

"Hey anyone else think purple accuses incorrectly a lot?"

"Soo skip?"
                I experience this a lot on the other hand. I‚Äôll have concrete evidence against an impostor and vote them off first round, just for all the crewmates to forget and vote me for nonsensical reasons 2-3 rounds later. And it‚Äôs never an impostor trying to throw me under the bus, it‚Äôs always dumb crewmates
                    Crew mates kill more crew mates than the imposters do.
                    Ifkr
            In public matches it's usually safe to assume they just aren't good at the game and are just randomly accusing
            Just say you‚Äôre 30% sure every time you accuse someone and admit mistakes.
                No one does this. This dumbasses just type 100% and think they just deafeted somebody.
                    everybody is so used to believing what people say in real life that they don't check evidence and easily believe "oh I saw cyan did it"
                Once I killed someone and someone else came in. I called the body and said "i saw purple over the body!!" and Purple was saying he saw me over the body, but since I called the report button, people were inclined to believe me. I even said "Well, no, I didn't see the body split in half in front of me, but he was standing over it, so I'm 90% sure it's them." It wasn't them! Oh no :( Someone I was in electrical with when my kill cooldown was counting vouched for me and went "i guess last round must have been a vent kill then."  
I won that game :)
            One time I thought I was dead, opened chat, and saw who the imps were. When a body was reported, I didn‚Äôt say anything and refused to vote since I knew who the imps were and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it for them
        Oh no!

Anyway-
        Omg yesterday that was me! I decided to be pink to raise my chances for imposter and they kept kicking me! I wasnt even imposter
        >Oh shit, he wasn't the impostor, ~~oh well~~ *disconnects*.

FTFY
        I wasnt imposter idiot.
        Oh no!


Anyways.
        Gotta disable saying if it was an imposter or not on ejection. It's the best way.
    My friend did this his first game I was playing with him. Told him I‚Äôd only tell people or accuse if I found evidence personally it was him. Like cleared everyone else, saw him actually kill/vent or something along those lines
    Just let the impostor get the victory. Tyey deserve it if someone had to reduce to cheating to reveal who they were
    They could always be lying, anyway. It's shouldn't be that hard to convince yourself they might not be the imposter.
    Yeah but pretending is far more fun than throwing away a game because of a cheater . I would also kick him from the lobby for the next match
    I mean, it‚Äôs better than to stop playing. Also you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre lying about being told who the impostor is, just assume that they‚Äôre lying and falsely incriminating someone.
    It is what I normally do. If I am the one who someone snitches to, I just go chill in elect or if I see the imp, I walk into a room with him.

I absolutely hate cheaters.
    If this happens I always convince my teammates to not report, just try to finish tasks before they're getting killed.
    Just gotta play until anyone else gets proof. Treat it as cyan is sus
    I had this the other day the last guy gave me the win as he said it was unfair I killed one guy and he said my friend told me purple killed him I play in the same room as my wife when we‚Äôre playing with friends and I don‚Äôt even talk too her unless we‚Äôre both dead what‚Äôs the point in playing you don‚Äôt get any rewards for winning it‚Äôs just pointless too cheat
I played last night and caught white killing right as I came around the corner. It became clear that everyone was voting for him so he says, ‚ÄúOkay fine it was me, but it‚Äôs also Lime.‚Äù

No one even suspected Lime up until that point and he could‚Äôve won the game sinc there were only five of us left. We ended up voting out the snitch and letting Lime take the win. Fuck them cheaters.
    I was imposter with some stranger a few days ago. In the lobby he had complained about the fact there were 2 imposters. As soon as he could call a meeting he did and said he saw me kill someone. The best thing about it was the fact I hadn't even killed yet.

Even worse was the girl who kept saying she saw me vent or kill for several games. Why? I had (rightfully) accused her boyfriend a few games ago. The others believed her most of the time, I ended up getting thrown out of the ship several times.

I hate people.
        I played a game last night where someone kept doing that. But not out of spite. Just losers that kept calling meetings claiming they saw someone vent or that so and so was following them. I got called out for following someone (I wasn‚Äôt). Got voted off-not imposter. Next game got called out for faking weapons task (I wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm not dumb enough to fake visual tasks as imposter). Got voted off‚Äînot imposter. This went on several rounds. I was got annoyed and I‚Äôm discussion the game leader told me to stfu. So I quit.
            And then there's the people who call a meeting 5 seconds into the game and tell everyone who both the impostors are without them even having done anything
                Early meeting callers automatically get the boot vote.


And I like to pretend I'm at the airlock door smiling and waving goodbye.
        [deleted]
    >‚ÄúOkay fine it was me, but it‚Äôs also Lime.‚Äù

Ngl I do this every single game I'm an impostor and I get caught. Like I'll get belligerent and everything.

Only difference is I always blame a crewmate lol
        I was so ready to downvote you lol
            he had us in the first half, not gonna lie
            He‚Äôs a true imposter
        Always blame crew mates
            Always. If u wanna hear the messed up thing I did with this the just ask
        If you play with the same people a lot you can blame your actual teammate as well. They'll stop believing you and assume whoever you named isn't the imposter.

Pro strats.
        Yeah I do the same never my imposter bud tho
        That's a legit tactic though.
        I‚Äôm going to do this from now on. No crew mate is safe.
        "Why the fuck didnt you double kill ___?"
    My biggest pet peeve is the people who are outted and they just quit right then and there. No dramatic pause to see the animation, just boom , quit. These are the lamest people on the planet I swear.
        I always call them cowards when they quit.
        Especially as they can sabotage when dead. They can be very useful to the living imp.
        I played with the lamest person on Earth about a week ago. We voted out his partner, and he was the only person who didn't vote for him. So, I called an emergency meeting immediately after and had everyone vote him out. We win.  


He complained in the lobby that we voted him out without any valid reasoning and then kicked me from the game.
            They obviously haven't played clue
    I wish the two imposters couldn't see the other one. I think that would solve a lot of these problems.
        [deleted]
            What if trying to kill them, revealed them as an imposter instead
                What if being able to kill the other imp was a game mechanic
        Yeah that should be an option in match set up.
        Conversely it can make for great/hilarious gameplay when they know.

Blue went off on Green last night in one of my games as he was getting voted out, basically "Well, you know what, Green is the other one. Screw you Green, you are the worst partner ever and I only got caught because you're so dumb, I want you to lose!"

So we instantly voted Green out next. Then we appeared back on ship and Yellow proceeded to rip my head off and Blue and Yellow won. Blue played us like a fiddle
        Nah i think the ability to help your friend lie is helpful and needed
We have three rules on Discord: mute when not in a meeting.

Mute when dead.

You can only blame someone during the meeting, not before or after.

If anyone gets called out like this bullshit up here, we just vote like crazy to end the match.
    lol i made a dead chat and alive chat, muted until voting if you die you go to dead chat and can vibe with your ghost pals
        Same except the ghosts come back to alive chat during the meeting (but muted) so we can listen to the fighting.
            yup samme lol
        Do you wait till meeting to go to ghost chat?
    I had a game with just some siblings and one of their SOs once, with everyone in discord.

That was the greatest because we actually managed to talk about non related stuff during the rounds, do all the blaming and evidence during the meeting, and go back to other stuff during typical more times.

It was the best way to play, but obviously can't work with any randos.
Yup.  I‚Äôve even lost a few games just to get them off the ship.
    Same. I hate this so much and i love that the lobbys im in also dislike it so we kinda throw the match to boot them out.
    I literally lied about someone venting just to get a cheater off a ship who admitted it.
yup
Wow that sounds nice. I called someone out for cheating when they snitched on me for killing their friend. Everyone still voted me out and the host didn't even kick them in the lobby afterward.
    This game needs banlists.
        Ya it would at least be nice to have usernames set in stone so there can at least be a community-kept list. And I don't recall them mentioning reporting features in the planned updates unfortunately.
            I'd also be ok with a reputation system: the more you get vote-kicked from games, the more you end up playing with people who were themselves vote-kicked from games.
                Even better, people who abandon the game the instant they know they are not imp. I hate losing because we only have 2 crew suddenly after people leave.
                Or, you earn a reputation, similar to reddit, and game hosts can set a minimum reputation level to join.
when i play with people in person or on a call we dont tell each other who killed us
But that doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything. The game is ruined since you know the imposter
Eltoiat was not an impostor

Oh no! 
Anyway...
The one time we caught this I got made and called them out for cheating and I got banned from the group.
And then at the end of the game they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI tOLd YOu guYS iT WaS cYaN!!‚Äù

It‚Äôs like no shit, we‚Äôre not playing the game to get a cheap win we‚Äôre playing for fun
    Lmao it‚Äôs crazy how some people don‚Äôt understand this
I would argue they should be kicked from the game. Every. Single. One. Of them.
We don't play we just vote cyan finish the match and in the lobby kick those two and then start the match
This needs to become a private match setting lol
Butt* fuck that guy
    In space, nobody can hear you scream.
        Yeah but they would never say no in space.


Because of the implication
    r/SuddenlyGay
It was Eltiost

I hope Among Us 2 will have 12 year old protection AKA bans and timeouts for cheaters and dodgers.
    [deleted]
        Nice!
            yeah, i think they said that the content made for the sequel will just be reused for a big update on this game
        Yup!
    Idk if you heard, but they canceled AU2. They decided to take all the ideas for 2 and will use them to improve AU1.
    There is a 5 minute ban time for dodgers
        Now you get the "its me vote me. I'm impos vote me"

Edit: I always try to convince others not to vote him and just ignore him when that happens
Whenever I know someone is 100% teaming with someone, I‚Äôd just say ‚Äúweird, why are there multiple devices on the same WiFi router‚Äù and do some other hacky shit
I had basically the same thing happen to me. I killed a guy in electrical with no one around, then vented to security, again with no one around and had enough time to kill another guy in security by the time the body in electrical was reported.

Guy then says I did it and they saw me vent on cams, only there are no cams in electrical, and I literally vented into the security room and no one was there.

So naturally I get voted off, then he and the guy I killed both left the game. Really ruined the game for me and I haven't played since. Like, obviously I was the imposter but they straight up lied about how they knew it was me.
    I feel your pain. Unfortunately since this game became super popular every public match has become this way. I‚Äôm happy I at least got a few hours on it weeks ago before it blew up to the point where it is now.
Those people are the worst. I play in the same room as my fiance because we play before going to bed, but we never look at screens, talk, or cheat. If either of us die, we don't out the imp that kill us. Cheating ruins the game for everyone.
I had the same thing but with 4 people talking on discord. I got imposter, didnt even kill a single person or vent, and after 15 sec an emergency meeting was called and they voted me off because "they got the feeling i was imposter". Such fucking dumbfucks
[deleted]
    > when I called a meeting to vote out the liar, I was voted out for being blood-thirsty.


God I hate that.
        God i hate people who arent meta enough to call the "X DID IT I SAW HIM" bluff. Not really, but i wanted build on your "i hate that"-vibe.

Trying to make votes happen quickly is "impostor 101". It happens in all games like this, secret hitler, warewolf, Among Us.

If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting then chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor.
            2/3 chances of being voted out if you call the meeting
                Called a meeting because there were 3 crew mates and 2 impostors left so clearly we have to vote someone out or lose. They voted me out and lost.
            Thats why Im always the voice of reason. Whether imp or crew I'm always "skip if we're not sure, don't give imps a free kill" Doesn't work with idiot players, but with a rational bunch it keeps suspicion off me.
                In my games I‚Äôve noticed the imp always tries to skip to ‚Äúremove suspicion ‚Äú
            >If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor

Right, stupid or impostor really doesn‚Äôt narrow it down at all chief
                I know it doest, but it does show that taking things slow until you are sure you really want to lynch someone is usually better. Since you can probably narrow it down and at least exclude one of the first 2.
            This is actually incredibly dumb. I was voted out twice for witnessing and reporting the first kill. There is never a situation where a sane imposter would bluff on the first kill because they'd be voted out next round.
                And thats something an impostor could use to their advantage. Hard accuse someone else the first round and since no sane impostor would do that - people would  be inclinded to agree.

Lynching someone because one person says they are the impostor is always usually bad. If you play 10 people 1 impostor it could be ok, since its ok to take chances. If you are down to 7 people including 2 impostors then perhaps you want more than one witness and/or accuser.
                    But what happens on the next round for this imposter?  I understand why an imposter would bluff with 4 ppl left but any more than that and they'll be out the next round.
    I got voted out because someone swore they saw me vent. I didn‚Äôt vent the entire game. I was the imposter, but still pissed someone lied and said I vented.
        Someone said I walked out of the room where the dead body was and I got ejected. They lied. I vented out of the room where the body was and he definitely didn‚Äôt see that
            He could have seen a glitched version of you. I saw Wildcat the other day get called out by Nogla due to a weird glitch where it looked like he vented into the body when he was venting in the corner.
        Haha thats the worst! I've been accused of venting twice while innocent and its so annoying. I always thought if that happened to me while actually the imposter how upset id be lmao.
        That also happened to me once. I was the one who made that round, and he got kicked, them he returned cause apparently he either had a friend in game telling him code or he remembered the code. I ended up banning him.
        Had this exact thing happen to me, and then the person who had been killed told me the person who lied was his sister and he told her I killed him. Told the group once we were back in the lobby and everyone acted like I was the asshole for being upset that people were cheating.
        Same, first imposter game in 4 hours and I got voted off by two separate lies (and these weren't randoms, they were friends who legitimately believed in what they saw).

The first said I must have vented out of XYZ room (I had not vented at all that game) and the other said I was "the only one who stayed behind at vitals, kinda sus" which also never happened. Actually, I thought they'd sus me because I was the only one who didn't get caught inside admin when the door closed.
        Often in public lobbies they can be sure it‚Äôs you for other reasons, that won‚Äôt convince everyone else, so they lie and they they saw you vent. 

As long as they‚Äôre not cheating, it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy, if annoying.
        Even worse, I was purple crew mate, and cyan said first vote ‚Äúhow do I go into vent like purple?‚Äù. 

I replied ‚Äúlies, but nice tactic‚Äù thinking he was imposter. 
Like, if he was imposter it‚Äôs a good move!

I got voted out and later he got ejected and wasn‚Äôt the imposter? 

What the hell?
    >Only works if you're 3

Why? The person you are voting out will BE the impostor, there's no reason to vote out discord informer next
        They're ruining the game, so vote them out.
            They‚Äôre more impostor than the impostor
    Also only works with confirms on. I play with confirms off specifically to defeat this move as it is way too powerful and puts way too much power in the hands of the crew.
        It still works with confirms off as long as there is only one impostor
        This is the only way to play
I say exactly this every time I witness something that 100% indicts someone as being the Impostor (if I see a kill, if I see someone vent, etc).

I feel like it‚Äôs the best and only way to emphasize that I‚Äôm positive about what I saw, and to avoid being accused of lying/ framing someone for personal gain.

Why is this being looked down upon?
    [deleted]
        just fyi the weapons task where you shoot the meteors can verify you since you can see the guns shooting while you do it. I think fixing shields also like lights up so that's another way.
    Yeah. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs X or me next‚Äù is SOP if you have solid in-game reason. Not prima face evidence of cheating. 

Now when you KNOW you had a clean kill, and the person saying it was nowhere near, and they REFUSE to give a WHY its you in chat. That‚Äôs  Sus.
        that's not sus, that's discord.

and that's why I hate this game now
    >Why is this being looked down upon?

Because you should *include the 100% damning action in your call-out*. There's a mile's difference between "I saw Green vent" and "VOTE GREEN TRUST ME U CAN KICK ME IF NOT"
        Well, yeah, I do. Maybe I just misread the context of the comment I replied to
            Yeah, it sounds like that might be the case. We're talking about people using voice chat to ruin the game - when the guy above you said "they've evolved", he means that specific ambiguous phrasing allows cheaters to call the Imp out in a way that's less incriminating.   
       
If you've witnessed and included an actual cause for suspicion, I think everybody's cool with that.
                Ah gotcha, makes sense now. Appreciate the clarification
        For those of us playing on tablets or phones, writing out the whole logic chain can be very time consuming, and often the first accusation gets the most weight in Among Us, so you want to get it out fast.

I‚Äôve also explained things in detail and have the idiots in my lobby say that it was SuS that I had such a convoluted explanation. 

Yes, if it‚Äôs as simple as green vent, sure. 

If it‚Äôs, I saw green run past me towards electrical, then I ran to medbay after stopping briefly in security, and he was coming out of medbay, and I don‚Äôt think he could have gotten there in time, so I think he vented. 

That took me 25 seconds to type out on an iPad. People would think i was calling for no reason if I took 25 seconds to get my accusation out.
    1. People definitely will not vote them out next round.
2. It's not proof of anything.
3. You can just lie and say this knowing it's unlikely they'll vote you out for getting it wrong.
    Yes exactly. There are 8 crewmates and 2 imposters. A 1 for 1 trade (one crewmate gets voted out+one imposter) is a very good deal.
    It's looked down upon when someone says it, but they are lying about it. If this happens to you as a Crewmate, it's annoying af.
I was playing as imposter and killed someone, then got away and attained an alibi. When the body is reported, lime accuses me with no reasoning except ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù

I‚Äôm still seething with anger.
    [deleted]
        then you get trolls who call meetings just to waste people's time.
            The worst is people who call meetings/throw accusations because I followed them. Like you're way safer if I'm here because they NEED a double kill to get both of us but go get stabbed on your own I guess
                I really fucking hate those people.

like dude, I'm standing 6 feet away from you just in case you're the imp, but I'm staying with you so we're both safe; if one of us dies, we know 1 of the imps. fucking idiots though, I swear. Whenever someone reports a body or calls a meeting, the person I'm following goes "/u/ILoveWildlife hella sus, keeps following me" and I get voted out
                    Good strat if you're an imposter and want to lose a tail without leaving a body though
                        yeah but it's easier to just kill the person following you around. People rarely pay attention to who's following who
                [deleted]
                    Yeah literally the only thing that confirms a player for a vote is being seen by another player when the kill happens. I don't get why people don't understand this. It's very frustrating.
            This is why I only give players one emergency meeting each.
            Which is why we vote the time waster out
            [deleted]
        People throwing accusations without being able to justify them and others following them blindly seems way too realistic for a video game.
        That is why I never play with randoms anymore. Every match goes like this.

*I am a crew member [red] and someone found a dead body*

**Blue:** Where? 

**[Reporter] Cyan:** It‚Äôs red.

*Blue has voted*

*Cyan has voted*

*Orange has voted*

*Brown has voted*

**Red [Me]:** Wtf why?!? 

*Red was not the imposter, two imposters remain*
        I was in a game today. 4 ppl saw me scan first round, we talked about it. 3 people left, I saw the kill, but he reported first and said that I killed him. Before I even typed more than 1 massage saying I saw him kill and that I scanned before and confirmed safe I got voted off. All withing 10 sec of allowing the vote. It's such a shame because it was a good lobby but then it instantly puts a bitter taste in your mouth and you won't want to play anymore.
    That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt play this game with randoms

It literally gets me to the point where I want to scream at some of these guys. 

Baseless accusations followed by being loud mouth assholes and preventing 1) me from defending myself then 2) preventing anyone else in the discord from talking. 

One dude was so sure I was an imp one game and I said ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not the imp at the end of the game, you‚Äôre a pretty pink princess bitch and have to change your name to PPPB. Guess who rage left at the end of the game when I wasn‚Äôt shown as an imp.
>"insert color" did it trust me, vote me next if not him

That is stupid like,why? You know people aren't going to do it because they want to play the game
    Yeah, someone did this to me recently, like they had zero evidence

Except the guy clearly was on Discord with another one
    My friend does it bud. He gets away with it everytime too..
    Usually people say this when they are 100% sure it's someone, be it because the saw them kill/vent, or if they are scum, their friend told them on discord. But it's a legit tactic. If I see someone kill, and people don't believe me enough, I'll say vote me next if it isn't him, because I know it's him. Only works if confirm eject is off tho.
    It think it's the blind "trust me" part because it indicates that he didn't actually see shit but is cheating by talking to a friend IRL who is in the lobby and got killed.
So, I always play over discord, so I seldom use chat. I assume ghost chat is for ghosts only right? Cause that would be a glaring issue if not. Lol
    Only ghosts can see other ghosts talk.
        Perfect, thanks.
            And ghosts can also see what the living are saying. They see both.
                Ok yeah, I knew that just from the logs, just was afraid to type in case somebody seen it. Don't wanna ruin the game!
        One time I encountered a glitch where a living person could see ghost chat.
Why does it matter, I mean it does happen in real games
    More of an observation than anything else
Flip it around. Kill yellow in electrical, call a meeting, say you're on voice chat with yellow and <random dude> killed him.
    I mean thats good but they always use technique: If not green then its black. 
So now its 50-50 of u Will be The first voted out, If yes then gg, if no then u can do sabotage lights or etc and kill one more atleast before they Will call mesting. And then i can say that The other is Pink for example so 2 crewmates out LMAO
Just say "vote him out for cheating" or something like that
Perma kids who do this tbh
Yeah. Wait a long time to become imposter and within a few mins it‚Äôs game over
    Happened to me yesterday

Cams were off, white alone inside of nav, everyone was separated: the perfect crime. I closed the doors and did the deed, immediately jumping into the vents to wait it out. A solid 30 seconds passed with no one reporting the body, I'm thinking to myself ahh what a nice kill. All of a sudden red walks up to the body. "SeaPickles did it i saw him kill".

NO YOU DIDNT BRO THERES NO POSSIBLE WAY YOU SAW THAT AND THEN WAITED 30 SECONDS TO REPORT. Turns out after they voted me out I talked to the ghost and he was just hurling insults at me, calling me noob and much worse, it sucked dude players like this ruin the game for everyone
        Yeah one time yellow said that green was walking away from the body, but we voted green and it wasn't green. At the next meeting yellow said they swore they saw green and hurled insults at everyone in ALL CAPS, then left the game.
            He may have actually seen green. There is some bug, or exploit, where players can be another players color.
                The problem we had was that yellow verbally assaulted everyone in all caps for zero reason
You pissed? Bro why would you share that info with us
    People need to know details.
Don't worry, it was faked anyways. OP made a dummy session, you can see the names behind the chat.
    Yeah but this still happens regularly and it‚Äôs annoying
This kept happening to me earlier with major & major 1 full on said I killed his friend. (I did tho) the lobby weren‚Äôt having his shit tho and ejected him it was brilliant
I play with my bf on the phone so we can talk when we *both* die. We stay on mute until both of us are dead so we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs the impostor. We‚Äôll just be walking around together and I‚Äôll be feeling safe, then BAM he cuts my fucking head off when we‚Äôre alone. Makes me die laughing
Me and my boyfriend do this, we‚Äôre unmute the whole time and usually tell each other when we die but not who. If we‚Äôre crewmates I always follow him around to make him paranoid lmao
But you have to kick them out not airlock. Or they just refuse to finish tasks as a ghost out of spite. 

Same for AFKs. I said we needed to kick an AFK to finish a game and the morons took that to mean airlock him.
    i have to confess to not doing tasks as a ghost when i am voted out with no evidence at all
I've been in the final 3 when a guy said he was 9n a discord and that cyan was the impostor, i was like, well that sucks now im going to lose, and voted for the cheater, intentionally losing the game, he was pissed that he lost, and probably learned nothing
Another true story, I died and my friend asked who the imposter was, I lied and made him accuse somebody else and everybody voted him out later. Ngl it was a good sacrifice.
You are doing god's work.
Yeah I always take one of them with me. ‚ÄúRed was the other imposter‚Äù
    "Orange is the other imposter! I dunno why he snitched on me. Vote him out after me so we can get a new game."

Everyone complains that I ruined the game and curses me. I get voted. Orange still denies everything and gets voted.

"Orange was not An Imposter"

Apologize to Orange in Ghost chat.
        Satan is waiting for you in hell
Oh my god it would be such a great troll to tell people "I'm on voice chat with orange and he told me black killed him" when it was actually me who killed orange
    well  when youre an imp you gotta throw everything when you are getting cornered
        Yeah, I have no problem with lies about discord calls or whatever. There is still no way to verify anything anyone says, so there is no harm in saying anything to try and get out.
[deleted]
    They say "I was so scared and it accidentally slip from my mouth."I still give them a chance though if they use the same excuse again. I ban them a whole day.
        Ah, ok thanks
            Nice Profile picture my dude
                Thanks
        "FUCK I NEW IT WAS YELLOW" _oop_
I was with 2 friends on discord, while being on a public server. 1 ratted me out, i immediately had to kill the other to stop them from throwing the game
weird having to parent your friends
My wife and I play next to each other. If one of us is the imposter we just don‚Äôt accuse each other in game and let the other play their game out. Honestly one of us is rarely the imposter anyway. 

Last night was the first time we broke that rule because the other team had three people in discord and they were calling out imposters with no evidence when one of them died. So for a game I played stupid and kept accusing one of them. We got down to four people, two of them, me and my wife as the imposter. The were both voting for her and getting belligerent in chat making up seeing her vent when she never did so we would both vote for one of them to tie until she killed them to win the game.
Dang, these people are harsh. I wasnt even thinking about headphones, I was just reading a wholesome anecdote about what sounds like a sweet fiance
My boyfriend and I play in the same room (sorry, its just the way our office is set up!) as well and we always try to play super fair in game if we accidentally see each others screens or if something. Its so much more fun to play the way its intended. I hate it when people talk through discord, it totally ruins the game :/.
    yeah same! we are silent while playing and have our screens apart. It's very satisfying when I get away with being imposter with him in the same room lol
You could mute the game.. I‚Äôve never played with volume
    [deleted]
        Sorry for all the people grilling you
        Use headphones
        Use headphones then.
Ignore the neckweirds
Heyyyy I do the same! Mostly I just forget to mute, but my fiance and I play late at night when we're about to fall asleep so we just turn our screens away. If he accidentally hears because I forgot to mute, he plays it off and won't vote me unless he has in game proof (ie If someone sees me vent, he'll be right on board to vote me off, or if I fake the wrong task, he'll call an emergency meeting and get me outta there lol)

I wish people would get off your ass for this though, sensory issues aren't something you can help. You clearly have said you can't mute it because it seriously messes with you so why would putting in headphone and not wearing them help? Also you said that wearing headphones just isn't a thing your brain lets you do, so why get up in arms about it?
You can scream to the top of your lungs when you kill someone so that he doesn‚Äôt hear it, and just move on like nothing happened without even mentioning it.

Eventually he‚Äôll be deaf and won‚Äôt be able to hear when you kill someone without you screaming. Problem solved!
Damn y'all being rude for no reason I don't think this isn't cheating this is just cute and wholesome :3
I think the reason people seem to be up in arms is that it seems to negatively effect your fianc√© and they‚Äôre sticking up for him in a way. 

Yes, it‚Äôs sweet that they don‚Äôt call you out but the argument being made is that if you could lower your tablet volume, or sit farther away, or maybe play some music during, this could be a more enjoyable experience for your fianc√©. 

If I was playing with someone and had to pretend I didn‚Äôt know they were imposter, that‚Äôs not fun.

It‚Äôs silly, but I think that‚Äôs where everyone is coming from.
    [deleted]
        Eh seems sus, vote dandy-lou ;)
Ngl that's how it should be
You‚Äôre fine my Fianc√© and I play in the same room constantly rn due to space restraints. I don‚Äôt have headphones rn and we‚Äôre usually in eyesight of each other‚Äôs screens. We put our blinders on and pretend not to know each other until we‚Äôre both dead haha
    haha ikr literally the "pretend I do not see" meme

It's really not that hard to ignore/pretend you didn't. My fiance has killed me plenty of times when I knew he was the imposter because of accidentally seeing/hearing something, I'm not gonna throw suspicion towards someone without evidence, otherwise that just makes ME look suspicious.
        Exactly! And it‚Äôs just not fun to start a witch hunt. Happy cake day!!!
Headphones. Headphones.
Just make him play sitting on the crapper, like the rest of us.
[deleted]
    Sound like she has sensory issues and not hearing would mess with her too much, so I'm guessing there's something about headphones that does the same
    Because he doesn't want to. Lmao that's it.
        Or change rooms or work together on one device
Yesterday I had a game with a perfect kill and was voted out because some kids mom told on me lol
Probably not the best, but far from the type of cheating shown in the meme. They‚Äôll probably report your body anyway.
Any communication with your team after your death is cheating. The game only lets you talk to teammates while your alive so calling your death location is still an unfair advantage.
Oh god oh fuck
They want to play with their friends, but they don't really care about other people's enjoyment of the game.
They want to "win", because winning is fun. Any method used to win is acceptable to them because their fun is more important than anyone elses.

Also trolling. They play the game to piss other people off as a power trip.
Same, I was over to a friends house, some ppl I don‚Äôt recognize too. I got imposter, I killed one of them when sabotaging the lights. They then said ‚ÄúIT WAS PURPLE IT WAS PURPLE!‚Äù (My color was purple) So I got ejected immediately.
Lol
have you asked them to not be dickbags
*Guys it's purple, vote him out*

#Oh shit. he wasn't the impostor. oh well.
    Whenever this happens to me (as an honest mistake) i always start the next round of discussion with "So, elephant in the room...." or if i'm imp it's more like "Well this is awkward." In pubmatches people's memory is usually so short theyve moved on anyways.
        If I‚Äôm imp after this I kill someone in a group immediately after, then cop to it and false accuse someone as being the other imp. Trying to play it off like a rage quit kinda thing because I got caught lying.
            If i am the imposter and I get caught I simply name another innocent person as my another imposter and boom I take 1 more with me
                I did that once and took 2 people with me.
                    How did you take 2 with you?
Also can you teach me to be that sneaky?? üòá
                        Someone believed that the person I picked was the imposter. Everyone said if that person wasn't the imposter, they would pick him.

He didn't have a good time.
                        I think he was playing 3 imps.
Tip:If u see some1 alone and ur the imp sabotuage lights so there is no chance someone sees u doing it.
If they didnt discover the body sabotuage the doors where the body is at if there is no door do electric again and u might get away with 2 kills :)))

Edit:Woah my best was 10 thx for 50 upvotes i though every people that knew the game well will do that so they wouldnt upvote it.
                            Nope. It was a 2 imposter game. It just the person I picked also happened to be another non-imposter's pick.
                    There's nothing quite like the feeling of playing imposter and seeing one crewmember accuse another crewmember with the ol' "if it's not him vote me" and knocking out two birds with one stone.
        Dude they won't even remember that for the last two meetings purple got 2 innocent crewmates kicked off for no reason.

"Hey anyone else think purple accuses incorrectly a lot?"

"Soo skip?"
            I experience this a lot on the other hand. I‚Äôll have concrete evidence against an impostor and vote them off first round, just for all the crewmates to forget and vote me for nonsensical reasons 2-3 rounds later. And it‚Äôs never an impostor trying to throw me under the bus, it‚Äôs always dumb crewmates
                Crew mates kill more crew mates than the imposters do.
                Ifkr
        In public matches it's usually safe to assume they just aren't good at the game and are just randomly accusing
        Just say you‚Äôre 30% sure every time you accuse someone and admit mistakes.
            No one does this. This dumbasses just type 100% and think they just deafeted somebody.
                everybody is so used to believing what people say in real life that they don't check evidence and easily believe "oh I saw cyan did it"
            Once I killed someone and someone else came in. I called the body and said "i saw purple over the body!!" and Purple was saying he saw me over the body, but since I called the report button, people were inclined to believe me. I even said "Well, no, I didn't see the body split in half in front of me, but he was standing over it, so I'm 90% sure it's them." It wasn't them! Oh no :( Someone I was in electrical with when my kill cooldown was counting vouched for me and went "i guess last round must have been a vent kill then."  
I won that game :)
        One time I thought I was dead, opened chat, and saw who the imps were. When a body was reported, I didn‚Äôt say anything and refused to vote since I knew who the imps were and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it for them
    Oh no!

Anyway-
    Omg yesterday that was me! I decided to be pink to raise my chances for imposter and they kept kicking me! I wasnt even imposter
    >Oh shit, he wasn't the impostor, ~~oh well~~ *disconnects*.

FTFY
    I wasnt imposter idiot.
    Oh no!


Anyways.
    Gotta disable saying if it was an imposter or not on ejection. It's the best way.
My friend did this his first game I was playing with him. Told him I‚Äôd only tell people or accuse if I found evidence personally it was him. Like cleared everyone else, saw him actually kill/vent or something along those lines
Just let the impostor get the victory. Tyey deserve it if someone had to reduce to cheating to reveal who they were
They could always be lying, anyway. It's shouldn't be that hard to convince yourself they might not be the imposter.
Yeah but pretending is far more fun than throwing away a game because of a cheater . I would also kick him from the lobby for the next match
I mean, it‚Äôs better than to stop playing. Also you don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre lying about being told who the impostor is, just assume that they‚Äôre lying and falsely incriminating someone.
It is what I normally do. If I am the one who someone snitches to, I just go chill in elect or if I see the imp, I walk into a room with him.

I absolutely hate cheaters.
If this happens I always convince my teammates to not report, just try to finish tasks before they're getting killed.
Just gotta play until anyone else gets proof. Treat it as cyan is sus
I had this the other day the last guy gave me the win as he said it was unfair I killed one guy and he said my friend told me purple killed him I play in the same room as my wife when we‚Äôre playing with friends and I don‚Äôt even talk too her unless we‚Äôre both dead what‚Äôs the point in playing you don‚Äôt get any rewards for winning it‚Äôs just pointless too cheat
I was imposter with some stranger a few days ago. In the lobby he had complained about the fact there were 2 imposters. As soon as he could call a meeting he did and said he saw me kill someone. The best thing about it was the fact I hadn't even killed yet.

Even worse was the girl who kept saying she saw me vent or kill for several games. Why? I had (rightfully) accused her boyfriend a few games ago. The others believed her most of the time, I ended up getting thrown out of the ship several times.

I hate people.
    I played a game last night where someone kept doing that. But not out of spite. Just losers that kept calling meetings claiming they saw someone vent or that so and so was following them. I got called out for following someone (I wasn‚Äôt). Got voted off-not imposter. Next game got called out for faking weapons task (I wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm not dumb enough to fake visual tasks as imposter). Got voted off‚Äînot imposter. This went on several rounds. I was got annoyed and I‚Äôm discussion the game leader told me to stfu. So I quit.
        And then there's the people who call a meeting 5 seconds into the game and tell everyone who both the impostors are without them even having done anything
            Early meeting callers automatically get the boot vote.


And I like to pretend I'm at the airlock door smiling and waving goodbye.

>‚ÄúOkay fine it was me, but it‚Äôs also Lime.‚Äù

Ngl I do this every single game I'm an impostor and I get caught. Like I'll get belligerent and everything.

Only difference is I always blame a crewmate lol
    I was so ready to downvote you lol
        he had us in the first half, not gonna lie
        He‚Äôs a true imposter
    Always blame crew mates
        Always. If u wanna hear the messed up thing I did with this the just ask
    If you play with the same people a lot you can blame your actual teammate as well. They'll stop believing you and assume whoever you named isn't the imposter.

Pro strats.
    Yeah I do the same never my imposter bud tho
    That's a legit tactic though.
    I‚Äôm going to do this from now on. No crew mate is safe.
    "Why the fuck didnt you double kill ___?"
My biggest pet peeve is the people who are outted and they just quit right then and there. No dramatic pause to see the animation, just boom , quit. These are the lamest people on the planet I swear.
    I always call them cowards when they quit.
    Especially as they can sabotage when dead. They can be very useful to the living imp.
    I played with the lamest person on Earth about a week ago. We voted out his partner, and he was the only person who didn't vote for him. So, I called an emergency meeting immediately after and had everyone vote him out. We win.  


He complained in the lobby that we voted him out without any valid reasoning and then kicked me from the game.
        They obviously haven't played clue
I wish the two imposters couldn't see the other one. I think that would solve a lot of these problems.
    [deleted]
        What if trying to kill them, revealed them as an imposter instead
            What if being able to kill the other imp was a game mechanic
    Yeah that should be an option in match set up.
    Conversely it can make for great/hilarious gameplay when they know.

Blue went off on Green last night in one of my games as he was getting voted out, basically "Well, you know what, Green is the other one. Screw you Green, you are the worst partner ever and I only got caught because you're so dumb, I want you to lose!"

So we instantly voted Green out next. Then we appeared back on ship and Yellow proceeded to rip my head off and Blue and Yellow won. Blue played us like a fiddle
    Nah i think the ability to help your friend lie is helpful and needed
lol i made a dead chat and alive chat, muted until voting if you die you go to dead chat and can vibe with your ghost pals
    Same except the ghosts come back to alive chat during the meeting (but muted) so we can listen to the fighting.
        yup samme lol
    Do you wait till meeting to go to ghost chat?
I had a game with just some siblings and one of their SOs once, with everyone in discord.

That was the greatest because we actually managed to talk about non related stuff during the rounds, do all the blaming and evidence during the meeting, and go back to other stuff during typical more times.

It was the best way to play, but obviously can't work with any randos.
Same. I hate this so much and i love that the lobbys im in also dislike it so we kinda throw the match to boot them out.
I literally lied about someone venting just to get a cheater off a ship who admitted it.
This game needs banlists.
    Ya it would at least be nice to have usernames set in stone so there can at least be a community-kept list. And I don't recall them mentioning reporting features in the planned updates unfortunately.
        I'd also be ok with a reputation system: the more you get vote-kicked from games, the more you end up playing with people who were themselves vote-kicked from games.
            Even better, people who abandon the game the instant they know they are not imp. I hate losing because we only have 2 crew suddenly after people leave.
            Or, you earn a reputation, similar to reddit, and game hosts can set a minimum reputation level to join.
Lmao it‚Äôs crazy how some people don‚Äôt understand this
In space, nobody can hear you scream.
    Yeah but they would never say no in space.


Because of the implication

[deleted]
    Nice!
        yeah, i think they said that the content made for the sequel will just be reused for a big update on this game
    Yup!
Idk if you heard, but they canceled AU2. They decided to take all the ideas for 2 and will use them to improve AU1.
There is a 5 minute ban time for dodgers
    Now you get the "its me vote me. I'm impos vote me"

Edit: I always try to convince others not to vote him and just ignore him when that happens
I feel your pain. Unfortunately since this game became super popular every public match has become this way. I‚Äôm happy I at least got a few hours on it weeks ago before it blew up to the point where it is now.
> when I called a meeting to vote out the liar, I was voted out for being blood-thirsty.


God I hate that.
    God i hate people who arent meta enough to call the "X DID IT I SAW HIM" bluff. Not really, but i wanted build on your "i hate that"-vibe.

Trying to make votes happen quickly is "impostor 101". It happens in all games like this, secret hitler, warewolf, Among Us.

If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting then chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor.
        2/3 chances of being voted out if you call the meeting
            Called a meeting because there were 3 crew mates and 2 impostors left so clearly we have to vote someone out or lose. They voted me out and lost.
        Thats why Im always the voice of reason. Whether imp or crew I'm always "skip if we're not sure, don't give imps a free kill" Doesn't work with idiot players, but with a rational bunch it keeps suspicion off me.
            In my games I‚Äôve noticed the imp always tries to skip to ‚Äúremove suspicion ‚Äú
        >If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor

Right, stupid or impostor really doesn‚Äôt narrow it down at all chief
            I know it doest, but it does show that taking things slow until you are sure you really want to lynch someone is usually better. Since you can probably narrow it down and at least exclude one of the first 2.
        This is actually incredibly dumb. I was voted out twice for witnessing and reporting the first kill. There is never a situation where a sane imposter would bluff on the first kill because they'd be voted out next round.
            And thats something an impostor could use to their advantage. Hard accuse someone else the first round and since no sane impostor would do that - people would  be inclinded to agree.

Lynching someone because one person says they are the impostor is always usually bad. If you play 10 people 1 impostor it could be ok, since its ok to take chances. If you are down to 7 people including 2 impostors then perhaps you want more than one witness and/or accuser.
                But what happens on the next round for this imposter?  I understand why an imposter would bluff with 4 ppl left but any more than that and they'll be out the next round.
I got voted out because someone swore they saw me vent. I didn‚Äôt vent the entire game. I was the imposter, but still pissed someone lied and said I vented.
    Someone said I walked out of the room where the dead body was and I got ejected. They lied. I vented out of the room where the body was and he definitely didn‚Äôt see that
        He could have seen a glitched version of you. I saw Wildcat the other day get called out by Nogla due to a weird glitch where it looked like he vented into the body when he was venting in the corner.
    Haha thats the worst! I've been accused of venting twice while innocent and its so annoying. I always thought if that happened to me while actually the imposter how upset id be lmao.
    That also happened to me once. I was the one who made that round, and he got kicked, them he returned cause apparently he either had a friend in game telling him code or he remembered the code. I ended up banning him.
    Had this exact thing happen to me, and then the person who had been killed told me the person who lied was his sister and he told her I killed him. Told the group once we were back in the lobby and everyone acted like I was the asshole for being upset that people were cheating.
    Same, first imposter game in 4 hours and I got voted off by two separate lies (and these weren't randoms, they were friends who legitimately believed in what they saw).

The first said I must have vented out of XYZ room (I had not vented at all that game) and the other said I was "the only one who stayed behind at vitals, kinda sus" which also never happened. Actually, I thought they'd sus me because I was the only one who didn't get caught inside admin when the door closed.
    Often in public lobbies they can be sure it‚Äôs you for other reasons, that won‚Äôt convince everyone else, so they lie and they they saw you vent. 

As long as they‚Äôre not cheating, it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy, if annoying.
    Even worse, I was purple crew mate, and cyan said first vote ‚Äúhow do I go into vent like purple?‚Äù. 

I replied ‚Äúlies, but nice tactic‚Äù thinking he was imposter. 
Like, if he was imposter it‚Äôs a good move!

I got voted out and later he got ejected and wasn‚Äôt the imposter? 

What the hell?
>Only works if you're 3

Why? The person you are voting out will BE the impostor, there's no reason to vote out discord informer next
    They're ruining the game, so vote them out.
        They‚Äôre more impostor than the impostor
Also only works with confirms on. I play with confirms off specifically to defeat this move as it is way too powerful and puts way too much power in the hands of the crew.
    It still works with confirms off as long as there is only one impostor
    This is the only way to play
[deleted]
    just fyi the weapons task where you shoot the meteors can verify you since you can see the guns shooting while you do it. I think fixing shields also like lights up so that's another way.
Yeah. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs X or me next‚Äù is SOP if you have solid in-game reason. Not prima face evidence of cheating. 

Now when you KNOW you had a clean kill, and the person saying it was nowhere near, and they REFUSE to give a WHY its you in chat. That‚Äôs  Sus.
    that's not sus, that's discord.

and that's why I hate this game now
>Why is this being looked down upon?

Because you should *include the 100% damning action in your call-out*. There's a mile's difference between "I saw Green vent" and "VOTE GREEN TRUST ME U CAN KICK ME IF NOT"
    Well, yeah, I do. Maybe I just misread the context of the comment I replied to
        Yeah, it sounds like that might be the case. We're talking about people using voice chat to ruin the game - when the guy above you said "they've evolved", he means that specific ambiguous phrasing allows cheaters to call the Imp out in a way that's less incriminating.   
       
If you've witnessed and included an actual cause for suspicion, I think everybody's cool with that.
            Ah gotcha, makes sense now. Appreciate the clarification
    For those of us playing on tablets or phones, writing out the whole logic chain can be very time consuming, and often the first accusation gets the most weight in Among Us, so you want to get it out fast.

I‚Äôve also explained things in detail and have the idiots in my lobby say that it was SuS that I had such a convoluted explanation. 

Yes, if it‚Äôs as simple as green vent, sure. 

If it‚Äôs, I saw green run past me towards electrical, then I ran to medbay after stopping briefly in security, and he was coming out of medbay, and I don‚Äôt think he could have gotten there in time, so I think he vented. 

That took me 25 seconds to type out on an iPad. People would think i was calling for no reason if I took 25 seconds to get my accusation out.
1. People definitely will not vote them out next round.
2. It's not proof of anything.
3. You can just lie and say this knowing it's unlikely they'll vote you out for getting it wrong.
Yes exactly. There are 8 crewmates and 2 imposters. A 1 for 1 trade (one crewmate gets voted out+one imposter) is a very good deal.
It's looked down upon when someone says it, but they are lying about it. If this happens to you as a Crewmate, it's annoying af.
[deleted]
    then you get trolls who call meetings just to waste people's time.
        The worst is people who call meetings/throw accusations because I followed them. Like you're way safer if I'm here because they NEED a double kill to get both of us but go get stabbed on your own I guess
            I really fucking hate those people.

like dude, I'm standing 6 feet away from you just in case you're the imp, but I'm staying with you so we're both safe; if one of us dies, we know 1 of the imps. fucking idiots though, I swear. Whenever someone reports a body or calls a meeting, the person I'm following goes "/u/ILoveWildlife hella sus, keeps following me" and I get voted out
                Good strat if you're an imposter and want to lose a tail without leaving a body though
                    yeah but it's easier to just kill the person following you around. People rarely pay attention to who's following who
            [deleted]
                Yeah literally the only thing that confirms a player for a vote is being seen by another player when the kill happens. I don't get why people don't understand this. It's very frustrating.
        This is why I only give players one emergency meeting each.
        Which is why we vote the time waster out
        [deleted]
    People throwing accusations without being able to justify them and others following them blindly seems way too realistic for a video game.
    That is why I never play with randoms anymore. Every match goes like this.

*I am a crew member [red] and someone found a dead body*

**Blue:** Where? 

**[Reporter] Cyan:** It‚Äôs red.

*Blue has voted*

*Cyan has voted*

*Orange has voted*

*Brown has voted*

**Red [Me]:** Wtf why?!? 

*Red was not the imposter, two imposters remain*
    I was in a game today. 4 ppl saw me scan first round, we talked about it. 3 people left, I saw the kill, but he reported first and said that I killed him. Before I even typed more than 1 massage saying I saw him kill and that I scanned before and confirmed safe I got voted off. All withing 10 sec of allowing the vote. It's such a shame because it was a good lobby but then it instantly puts a bitter taste in your mouth and you won't want to play anymore.
That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt play this game with randoms

It literally gets me to the point where I want to scream at some of these guys. 

Baseless accusations followed by being loud mouth assholes and preventing 1) me from defending myself then 2) preventing anyone else in the discord from talking. 

One dude was so sure I was an imp one game and I said ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not the imp at the end of the game, you‚Äôre a pretty pink princess bitch and have to change your name to PPPB. Guess who rage left at the end of the game when I wasn‚Äôt shown as an imp.
Yeah, someone did this to me recently, like they had zero evidence

Except the guy clearly was on Discord with another one
My friend does it bud. He gets away with it everytime too..
Usually people say this when they are 100% sure it's someone, be it because the saw them kill/vent, or if they are scum, their friend told them on discord. But it's a legit tactic. If I see someone kill, and people don't believe me enough, I'll say vote me next if it isn't him, because I know it's him. Only works if confirm eject is off tho.
It think it's the blind "trust me" part because it indicates that he didn't actually see shit but is cheating by talking to a friend IRL who is in the lobby and got killed.
Only ghosts can see other ghosts talk.
    Perfect, thanks.
        And ghosts can also see what the living are saying. They see both.
            Ok yeah, I knew that just from the logs, just was afraid to type in case somebody seen it. Don't wanna ruin the game!
    One time I encountered a glitch where a living person could see ghost chat.
More of an observation than anything else
I mean thats good but they always use technique: If not green then its black. 
So now its 50-50 of u Will be The first voted out, If yes then gg, if no then u can do sabotage lights or etc and kill one more atleast before they Will call mesting. And then i can say that The other is Pink for example so 2 crewmates out LMAO
Happened to me yesterday

Cams were off, white alone inside of nav, everyone was separated: the perfect crime. I closed the doors and did the deed, immediately jumping into the vents to wait it out. A solid 30 seconds passed with no one reporting the body, I'm thinking to myself ahh what a nice kill. All of a sudden red walks up to the body. "SeaPickles did it i saw him kill".

NO YOU DIDNT BRO THERES NO POSSIBLE WAY YOU SAW THAT AND THEN WAITED 30 SECONDS TO REPORT. Turns out after they voted me out I talked to the ghost and he was just hurling insults at me, calling me noob and much worse, it sucked dude players like this ruin the game for everyone
    Yeah one time yellow said that green was walking away from the body, but we voted green and it wasn't green. At the next meeting yellow said they swore they saw green and hurled insults at everyone in ALL CAPS, then left the game.
        He may have actually seen green. There is some bug, or exploit, where players can be another players color.
            The problem we had was that yellow verbally assaulted everyone in all caps for zero reason
People need to know details.
Yeah but this still happens regularly and it‚Äôs annoying
i have to confess to not doing tasks as a ghost when i am voted out with no evidence at all
"Orange is the other imposter! I dunno why he snitched on me. Vote him out after me so we can get a new game."

Everyone complains that I ruined the game and curses me. I get voted. Orange still denies everything and gets voted.

"Orange was not An Imposter"

Apologize to Orange in Ghost chat.
    Satan is waiting for you in hell
well  when youre an imp you gotta throw everything when you are getting cornered
    Yeah, I have no problem with lies about discord calls or whatever. There is still no way to verify anything anyone says, so there is no harm in saying anything to try and get out.
They say "I was so scared and it accidentally slip from my mouth."I still give them a chance though if they use the same excuse again. I ban them a whole day.
    Ah, ok thanks
        Nice Profile picture my dude
            Thanks
    "FUCK I NEW IT WAS YELLOW" _oop_
yeah same! we are silent while playing and have our screens apart. It's very satisfying when I get away with being imposter with him in the same room lol
[deleted]
    Sorry for all the people grilling you
    Use headphones
    Use headphones then.
[deleted]
    Eh seems sus, vote dandy-lou ;)
haha ikr literally the "pretend I do not see" meme

It's really not that hard to ignore/pretend you didn't. My fiance has killed me plenty of times when I knew he was the imposter because of accidentally seeing/hearing something, I'm not gonna throw suspicion towards someone without evidence, otherwise that just makes ME look suspicious.
    Exactly! And it‚Äôs just not fun to start a witch hunt. Happy cake day!!!
Sound like she has sensory issues and not hearing would mess with her too much, so I'm guessing there's something about headphones that does the same
Because he doesn't want to. Lmao that's it.
    Or change rooms or work together on one device
Whenever this happens to me (as an honest mistake) i always start the next round of discussion with "So, elephant in the room...." or if i'm imp it's more like "Well this is awkward." In pubmatches people's memory is usually so short theyve moved on anyways.
    If I‚Äôm imp after this I kill someone in a group immediately after, then cop to it and false accuse someone as being the other imp. Trying to play it off like a rage quit kinda thing because I got caught lying.
        If i am the imposter and I get caught I simply name another innocent person as my another imposter and boom I take 1 more with me
            I did that once and took 2 people with me.
                How did you take 2 with you?
Also can you teach me to be that sneaky?? üòá
                    Someone believed that the person I picked was the imposter. Everyone said if that person wasn't the imposter, they would pick him.

He didn't have a good time.
                    I think he was playing 3 imps.
Tip:If u see some1 alone and ur the imp sabotuage lights so there is no chance someone sees u doing it.
If they didnt discover the body sabotuage the doors where the body is at if there is no door do electric again and u might get away with 2 kills :)))

Edit:Woah my best was 10 thx for 50 upvotes i though every people that knew the game well will do that so they wouldnt upvote it.
                        Nope. It was a 2 imposter game. It just the person I picked also happened to be another non-imposter's pick.
                There's nothing quite like the feeling of playing imposter and seeing one crewmember accuse another crewmember with the ol' "if it's not him vote me" and knocking out two birds with one stone.
    Dude they won't even remember that for the last two meetings purple got 2 innocent crewmates kicked off for no reason.

"Hey anyone else think purple accuses incorrectly a lot?"

"Soo skip?"
        I experience this a lot on the other hand. I‚Äôll have concrete evidence against an impostor and vote them off first round, just for all the crewmates to forget and vote me for nonsensical reasons 2-3 rounds later. And it‚Äôs never an impostor trying to throw me under the bus, it‚Äôs always dumb crewmates
            Crew mates kill more crew mates than the imposters do.
            Ifkr
    In public matches it's usually safe to assume they just aren't good at the game and are just randomly accusing
    Just say you‚Äôre 30% sure every time you accuse someone and admit mistakes.
        No one does this. This dumbasses just type 100% and think they just deafeted somebody.
            everybody is so used to believing what people say in real life that they don't check evidence and easily believe "oh I saw cyan did it"
        Once I killed someone and someone else came in. I called the body and said "i saw purple over the body!!" and Purple was saying he saw me over the body, but since I called the report button, people were inclined to believe me. I even said "Well, no, I didn't see the body split in half in front of me, but he was standing over it, so I'm 90% sure it's them." It wasn't them! Oh no :( Someone I was in electrical with when my kill cooldown was counting vouched for me and went "i guess last round must have been a vent kill then."  
I won that game :)
    One time I thought I was dead, opened chat, and saw who the imps were. When a body was reported, I didn‚Äôt say anything and refused to vote since I knew who the imps were and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it for them
Oh no!

Anyway-
Omg yesterday that was me! I decided to be pink to raise my chances for imposter and they kept kicking me! I wasnt even imposter
>Oh shit, he wasn't the impostor, ~~oh well~~ *disconnects*.

FTFY
I wasnt imposter idiot.
Oh no!


Anyways.
Gotta disable saying if it was an imposter or not on ejection. It's the best way.
I played a game last night where someone kept doing that. But not out of spite. Just losers that kept calling meetings claiming they saw someone vent or that so and so was following them. I got called out for following someone (I wasn‚Äôt). Got voted off-not imposter. Next game got called out for faking weapons task (I wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm not dumb enough to fake visual tasks as imposter). Got voted off‚Äînot imposter. This went on several rounds. I was got annoyed and I‚Äôm discussion the game leader told me to stfu. So I quit.
    And then there's the people who call a meeting 5 seconds into the game and tell everyone who both the impostors are without them even having done anything
        Early meeting callers automatically get the boot vote.


And I like to pretend I'm at the airlock door smiling and waving goodbye.

I was so ready to downvote you lol
    he had us in the first half, not gonna lie
    He‚Äôs a true imposter
Always blame crew mates
    Always. If u wanna hear the messed up thing I did with this the just ask
If you play with the same people a lot you can blame your actual teammate as well. They'll stop believing you and assume whoever you named isn't the imposter.

Pro strats.
Yeah I do the same never my imposter bud tho
That's a legit tactic though.
I‚Äôm going to do this from now on. No crew mate is safe.
"Why the fuck didnt you double kill ___?"
I always call them cowards when they quit.
Especially as they can sabotage when dead. They can be very useful to the living imp.
I played with the lamest person on Earth about a week ago. We voted out his partner, and he was the only person who didn't vote for him. So, I called an emergency meeting immediately after and had everyone vote him out. We win.  


He complained in the lobby that we voted him out without any valid reasoning and then kicked me from the game.
    They obviously haven't played clue

Yeah that should be an option in match set up.
Conversely it can make for great/hilarious gameplay when they know.

Blue went off on Green last night in one of my games as he was getting voted out, basically "Well, you know what, Green is the other one. Screw you Green, you are the worst partner ever and I only got caught because you're so dumb, I want you to lose!"

So we instantly voted Green out next. Then we appeared back on ship and Yellow proceeded to rip my head off and Blue and Yellow won. Blue played us like a fiddle
Nah i think the ability to help your friend lie is helpful and needed

Do you wait till meeting to go to ghost chat?

    2/3 chances of being voted out if you call the meeting
        Called a meeting because there were 3 crew mates and 2 impostors left so clearly we have to vote someone out or lose. They voted me out and lost.
    Thats why Im always the voice of reason. Whether imp or crew I'm always "skip if we're not sure, don't give imps a free kill" Doesn't work with idiot players, but with a rational bunch it keeps suspicion off me.
        In my games I‚Äôve noticed the imp always tries to skip to ‚Äúremove suspicion ‚Äú
    >If someone tries to be really hasty with accusing people and voting chances are they are either right, stupid or the impostor

Right, stupid or impostor really doesn‚Äôt narrow it down at all chief
        I know it doest, but it does show that taking things slow until you are sure you really want to lynch someone is usually better. Since you can probably narrow it down and at least exclude one of the first 2.
    This is actually incredibly dumb. I was voted out twice for witnessing and reporting the first kill. There is never a situation where a sane imposter would bluff on the first kill because they'd be voted out next round.
        And thats something an impostor could use to their advantage. Hard accuse someone else the first round and since no sane impostor would do that - people would  be inclinded to agree.

Lynching someone because one person says they are the impostor is always usually bad. If you play 10 people 1 impostor it could be ok, since its ok to take chances. If you are down to 7 people including 2 impostors then perhaps you want more than one witness and/or accuser.
            But what happens on the next round for this imposter?  I understand why an imposter would bluff with 4 ppl left but any more than that and they'll be out the next round.
Someone said I walked out of the room where the dead body was and I got ejected. They lied. I vented out of the room where the body was and he definitely didn‚Äôt see that
    He could have seen a glitched version of you. I saw Wildcat the other day get called out by Nogla due to a weird glitch where it looked like he vented into the body when he was venting in the corner.
Haha thats the worst! I've been accused of venting twice while innocent and its so annoying. I always thought if that happened to me while actually the imposter how upset id be lmao.
That also happened to me once. I was the one who made that round, and he got kicked, them he returned cause apparently he either had a friend in game telling him code or he remembered the code. I ended up banning him.
Had this exact thing happen to me, and then the person who had been killed told me the person who lied was his sister and he told her I killed him. Told the group once we were back in the lobby and everyone acted like I was the asshole for being upset that people were cheating.
Same, first imposter game in 4 hours and I got voted off by two separate lies (and these weren't randoms, they were friends who legitimately believed in what they saw).

The first said I must have vented out of XYZ room (I had not vented at all that game) and the other said I was "the only one who stayed behind at vitals, kinda sus" which also never happened. Actually, I thought they'd sus me because I was the only one who didn't get caught inside admin when the door closed.
Often in public lobbies they can be sure it‚Äôs you for other reasons, that won‚Äôt convince everyone else, so they lie and they they saw you vent. 

As long as they‚Äôre not cheating, it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy, if annoying.
Even worse, I was purple crew mate, and cyan said first vote ‚Äúhow do I go into vent like purple?‚Äù. 

I replied ‚Äúlies, but nice tactic‚Äù thinking he was imposter. 
Like, if he was imposter it‚Äôs a good move!

I got voted out and later he got ejected and wasn‚Äôt the imposter? 

What the hell?
They're ruining the game, so vote them out.
    They‚Äôre more impostor than the impostor
It still works with confirms off as long as there is only one impostor
This is the only way to play
just fyi the weapons task where you shoot the meteors can verify you since you can see the guns shooting while you do it. I think fixing shields also like lights up so that's another way.
that's not sus, that's discord.

and that's why I hate this game now
Well, yeah, I do. Maybe I just misread the context of the comment I replied to
    Yeah, it sounds like that might be the case. We're talking about people using voice chat to ruin the game - when the guy above you said "they've evolved", he means that specific ambiguous phrasing allows cheaters to call the Imp out in a way that's less incriminating.   
       
If you've witnessed and included an actual cause for suspicion, I think everybody's cool with that.
        Ah gotcha, makes sense now. Appreciate the clarification
For those of us playing on tablets or phones, writing out the whole logic chain can be very time consuming, and often the first accusation gets the most weight in Among Us, so you want to get it out fast.

I‚Äôve also explained things in detail and have the idiots in my lobby say that it was SuS that I had such a convoluted explanation. 

Yes, if it‚Äôs as simple as green vent, sure. 

If it‚Äôs, I saw green run past me towards electrical, then I ran to medbay after stopping briefly in security, and he was coming out of medbay, and I don‚Äôt think he could have gotten there in time, so I think he vented. 

That took me 25 seconds to type out on an iPad. People would think i was calling for no reason if I took 25 seconds to get my accusation out.
then you get trolls who call meetings just to waste people's time.
    The worst is people who call meetings/throw accusations because I followed them. Like you're way safer if I'm here because they NEED a double kill to get both of us but go get stabbed on your own I guess
        I really fucking hate those people.

like dude, I'm standing 6 feet away from you just in case you're the imp, but I'm staying with you so we're both safe; if one of us dies, we know 1 of the imps. fucking idiots though, I swear. Whenever someone reports a body or calls a meeting, the person I'm following goes "/u/ILoveWildlife hella sus, keeps following me" and I get voted out
            Good strat if you're an imposter and want to lose a tail without leaving a body though
                yeah but it's easier to just kill the person following you around. People rarely pay attention to who's following who
        [deleted]
            Yeah literally the only thing that confirms a player for a vote is being seen by another player when the kill happens. I don't get why people don't understand this. It's very frustrating.
    This is why I only give players one emergency meeting each.
    Which is why we vote the time waster out
    [deleted]
People throwing accusations without being able to justify them and others following them blindly seems way too realistic for a video game.
That is why I never play with randoms anymore. Every match goes like this.

*I am a crew member [red] and someone found a dead body*

**Blue:** Where? 

**[Reporter] Cyan:** It‚Äôs red.

*Blue has voted*

*Cyan has voted*

*Orange has voted*

*Brown has voted*

**Red [Me]:** Wtf why?!? 

*Red was not the imposter, two imposters remain*
I was in a game today. 4 ppl saw me scan first round, we talked about it. 3 people left, I saw the kill, but he reported first and said that I killed him. Before I even typed more than 1 massage saying I saw him kill and that I scanned before and confirmed safe I got voted off. All withing 10 sec of allowing the vote. It's such a shame because it was a good lobby but then it instantly puts a bitter taste in your mouth and you won't want to play anymore.
Perfect, thanks.
    And ghosts can also see what the living are saying. They see both.
        Ok yeah, I knew that just from the logs, just was afraid to type in case somebody seen it. Don't wanna ruin the game!
One time I encountered a glitch where a living person could see ghost chat.
Yeah one time yellow said that green was walking away from the body, but we voted green and it wasn't green. At the next meeting yellow said they swore they saw green and hurled insults at everyone in ALL CAPS, then left the game.
    He may have actually seen green. There is some bug, or exploit, where players can be another players color.
        The problem we had was that yellow verbally assaulted everyone in all caps for zero reason
Satan is waiting for you in hell
Yeah, I have no problem with lies about discord calls or whatever. There is still no way to verify anything anyone says, so there is no harm in saying anything to try and get out.
Ah, ok thanks
    Nice Profile picture my dude
        Thanks
"FUCK I NEW IT WAS YELLOW" _oop_
Sorry for all the people grilling you
Use headphones
Use headphones then.
Eh seems sus, vote dandy-lou ;)
Exactly! And it‚Äôs just not fun to start a witch hunt. Happy cake day!!!
Or change rooms or work together on one device
If I‚Äôm imp after this I kill someone in a group immediately after, then cop to it and false accuse someone as being the other imp. Trying to play it off like a rage quit kinda thing because I got caught lying.
    If i am the imposter and I get caught I simply name another innocent person as my another imposter and boom I take 1 more with me
        I did that once and took 2 people with me.
            How did you take 2 with you?
Also can you teach me to be that sneaky?? üòá
                Someone believed that the person I picked was the imposter. Everyone said if that person wasn't the imposter, they would pick him.

He didn't have a good time.
                I think he was playing 3 imps.
Tip:If u see some1 alone and ur the imp sabotuage lights so there is no chance someone sees u doing it.
If they didnt discover the body sabotuage the doors where the body is at if there is no door do electric again and u might get away with 2 kills :)))

Edit:Woah my best was 10 thx for 50 upvotes i though every people that knew the game well will do that so they wouldnt upvote it.
                    Nope. It was a 2 imposter game. It just the person I picked also happened to be another non-imposter's pick.
            There's nothing quite like the feeling of playing imposter and seeing one crewmember accuse another crewmember with the ol' "if it's not him vote me" and knocking out two birds with one stone.
Dude they won't even remember that for the last two meetings purple got 2 innocent crewmates kicked off for no reason.

"Hey anyone else think purple accuses incorrectly a lot?"

"Soo skip?"
    I experience this a lot on the other hand. I‚Äôll have concrete evidence against an impostor and vote them off first round, just for all the crewmates to forget and vote me for nonsensical reasons 2-3 rounds later. And it‚Äôs never an impostor trying to throw me under the bus, it‚Äôs always dumb crewmates
        Crew mates kill more crew mates than the imposters do.
        Ifkr
In public matches it's usually safe to assume they just aren't good at the game and are just randomly accusing
Just say you‚Äôre 30% sure every time you accuse someone and admit mistakes.
    No one does this. This dumbasses just type 100% and think they just deafeted somebody.
        everybody is so used to believing what people say in real life that they don't check evidence and easily believe "oh I saw cyan did it"
    Once I killed someone and someone else came in. I called the body and said "i saw purple over the body!!" and Purple was saying he saw me over the body, but since I called the report button, people were inclined to believe me. I even said "Well, no, I didn't see the body split in half in front of me, but he was standing over it, so I'm 90% sure it's them." It wasn't them! Oh no :( Someone I was in electrical with when my kill cooldown was counting vouched for me and went "i guess last round must have been a vent kill then."  
I won that game :)
One time I thought I was dead, opened chat, and saw who the imps were. When a body was reported, I didn‚Äôt say anything and refused to vote since I knew who the imps were and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin it for them
And then there's the people who call a meeting 5 seconds into the game and tell everyone who both the impostors are without them even having done anything
    Early meeting callers automatically get the boot vote.


And I like to pretend I'm at the airlock door smiling and waving goodbye.
he had us in the first half, not gonna lie
He‚Äôs a true imposter
Always. If u wanna hear the messed up thing I did with this the just ask
They obviously haven't played clue
What if trying to kill them, revealed them as an imposter instead
    What if being able to kill the other imp was a game mechanic
yup samme lol
I'd also be ok with a reputation system: the more you get vote-kicked from games, the more you end up playing with people who were themselves vote-kicked from games.
    Even better, people who abandon the game the instant they know they are not imp. I hate losing because we only have 2 crew suddenly after people leave.
    Or, you earn a reputation, similar to reddit, and game hosts can set a minimum reputation level to join.
yeah, i think they said that the content made for the sequel will just be reused for a big update on this game
