[[Green was just working out]]





these little space guys be thicc with their 36+ bmi
    yes impostors are literally obese lmao
        but very fit as the manage to run around and do all those task so quickly
            Like a sumo, powerful but fat.
                Lil 3 foot tall Shaqs
            Like [Munchlax](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/446.shtml), who canonically is two feet (0.6m) tall and weighs 232lb (105kg) yet can run around like a madman in the shows.
                that weight might be all muscle

                            munchlax videos are serious business man
                                Hell yeah they are

                Kind of concerning that they're also measuring in pounds, which accounts for gravity, and not grams, which doesn't. If they're 92 lbs in low gravity, I wonder what they'd be on Earth. Maybe they're all in space so they don't die by crushing themselves where there's more gravity?
                    yeah they should have given it in slugs obviously
                        Imagine innersloth put slugs in there omg
            That’s why player speed needs to be set on 0.5 to keep things realistic
        when you think about it, they should be, they fucking eat peoples heads all the time, i assume so anyway because their head just yeets out of existance

    To be fair, the crewmates could wearing spacesuits? In real life, spacesuits weigh somewhere around 150-250 lbs (50-80 kg) without the astronaut in them! It's like wearing another person. So maybe their actual weight is a little over half of 92 and the rest is their gear?

Unless those are just their bodies... I mean, they do wear clothing over top. Hard to say lol.
        Well there's no change in texture when they're bisected.

I saw some skeleton models, I don't know if any of them are canon tho :(
            the only canon skeleton model is ***B O N E***

hope that solves your problems :)
        I've always seen them as jetpack-wearing armless avatars. I cannot unsee it
        That means they weigh negative weight
        It is their bodies. I can prove it but if you're not interested I'm not gonna type it all out 😂 if you want the proof LMK
            Sure! I am curious if you don't mind.
The only explanation I have come to myself is that their innards matches the color that they are on the outside. Which makes me think that the color, and therefore the 'spacesuit', could actually just the way they look.
                So, that's part of it, and also this:

1. If they have a ship/airbase/planet that has some form of constant oxygen supply, as evidenced by O2 existing, then why are they wearing suits?

2. When their body falls over, we can tell that there is no layer between their outer "suit" and their innards that would be skin, so we can guess that the "suit" is their skin

3. If the suit had oxygen, then ejecting the wrong person would be inconsequential. They could just go back and get them from space. But since they die, we can tell that it's just their skin and not an O2 suit
    *I WAS IN THE POOL!*
    I suppose space gear adds a lot of weight
    Psh they are wearing suits
    r/theydidthemath
        nah you just use [this](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) or something.
Mind if I make a meme from this? I'll credit you.
    Sure! No problem :)
        green is a healthy Boi.
            Or at least attempting to become one.
                Well how heavy is the pack they have? Also they’re clearly not humans, so maybe that is a healthy weight.
                    I assume the pack is part of the 92 pounds, no?
                    I'm not hating but they are humans, probably from the future because they have mtn dew on mirahq and machinery made by samsung. They are clearly humans.
                        What’s Samsung? Do you mean Simsung
                            Samsung is a mobile company, same as apples.
                                ???
                                    Wdym "???" you asked what samsung was, I told you what it was.
                            Dude its samsung
                                No, its simsung on among us
                        But the ARMSSS, WHERE DID THEY GOOOO
                            They may just hold them by their sides till they gotta kill so it blends I to their suit
                        They're not humans, they just stole our stuff
                    That's part of their body....
            Actually, green has a BMI of 38, which is highly obese. According to the CDC their ideal weight is 46 to 62 pounds. Better get moving!

                Tbf they have some sort of pack on, which could be very heavy
                    No, that's part of their body
                        No, it IS their body.

It could be their suits. Most space suits for the average person come in at over 100 pounds, and considering their height it makes sense.

&#x200B;

I'm about to read too much into this so feel free to stop here, but they're still able to walk normally since we can hear their feet against the ground, and when the impostor jumps out of the vent he lands quickly so we can assume that gravity is present. If that were true then the suits would be far too heavy to even walk in. That or they have futuristic weightless suits and are just obese
    [deleted]
        I'm pretty sure Polus is just a planet they are currently researching and developing. Mira HQ is on their home planet and we can see it doesn't look like Polus. Now it's not confirmed Mira hq is an earth equivalent, so could still technically be a different gravity value.
            [deleted]
                Thing is, we don’t know how tall MIRA HQ is or which floor they fall from

                            unless they get pushed
                    But we do know how tall those little mini telletubbies are, so we can use those
        If they were on a planet with less gravity they would weigh less, surely?
            [deleted]
                Yeah a 90lb human would weigh 15 lbs on the moon. So if these aliens are on the moon and weigh 92 lbs that means they have the equivalent mass of a 550lb human 😵

                                [deleted]
                                    Idk my prof told me it’s pound force, but again if they have the same value it shouldn’t matter in civilian conversation unless we’re talking about a different gravity value?
                        No the us uses lb force. This person just obviously hasn’t taken a physics class before
                            Oh I see
        Low gravity would likely create tall and low density life forms as falling becomes less of a threat.

They are dense, small creatures with minimal limbs, this to me implies evolution in a high gravity environment.
            That makes more sense! Thanks!
    You got to remember, the imposters can't really be counted as the "space suits" they're "wearing" are just their bodies, as seen in the tongue kill. With this in mind, and since the crewmate walking speed doesn't seem to, at least canonically, change, the real way to tell their weights is by how fast they fall on MIRA's ejection screen and how fast the bodies fall over.
        NONE of them are wearing suits. That's their body
            Either that or the suits are really tight.
                They can't be suits, because if the impostor was ejected, it wouldn't do anything because they have oxygen and wouldn't die. Also, why would they wear suits on a ship with oxygen (proven by the O^2 sabotage)
                    1. I said the imposters "suits" are actually just the bodies.
2. I presume it's an oxygen reserve? The ISS has oxygen on it so the people on it aren't having to wear suits with limited oxygen supply, so I assume it works the same on the Skeld.
                        That was kinda my point
                            I mean, since there's a medical station and a cafeteria I assume there's an oxygen reserve so they can eat and have medical work done on them.
                                Yeah and they have a bathroom on Polus
    [removed]
        Their tanks would eventually run out and would have to be refilled. They also have to take their suits off to eat.
            Dosen’t an oxygen tank last more than 50 seconds
    If assume that the scales would take the excess suit weight into account given that all crewmates wear them.
    This would be true, if they were wearing suits....
damn i should be like green...

        Weight and mass are very different so the scan would probably find mass and apply the constant for gravitational acceleration in the among us universe to find weight in pounds
    No, they don't wear any suit or equipment

I live to play with such people
how he gonna fit through the vents if he is roughly a big pound of dough
"ya know he was just working out, I mean how would I feel if someone ran into the gym and bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill."
Imagine if the medbay scan was like that? Like you could go (if you had scan) and let’s say you don’t complete it, and you run around. Imagine if when you come back, you lose weight

Green deserves it.
Well he’s got a point,  if he wants to stay healthy.  Haha

Uh yeah that gives him a bmi of like 36 ish, that’s classified as obese
Maybe that’s why they’re so slow
okay i looked it up and apparently the crewmates are the height of a five year old, and also morbidly obese, weighing over DOUBLE what the recommended healthy weight for that height is
I lost her, 
I was in a lobby with a person named aphrodite, she wore a face mask and was white, we played in MIRA HQ, had the most fun time with her but then she got disconnected and then I didn’t feel like playing. There was one more person name “idiot I” wearing a witch hat and was purple she used to always hate us because we used to vote her out all the time, purple always died first in the game and we made fun of that. I hope I can find Aphrodite and idiot I

My name was “joking I” I wore horns and was black

I’m most impressed that he was able to type all that in sideways.
Well that certainly is a pretty sus bean. Pretty light bean as well, for a bean trying to lose weight...
Best answer ever 😂😂
Lmaoo
Best excuse I’ve ever seen.
How many football fields did he have to run to lose some weight?
Lmao
WOW LOL
Lol.
You’d think I’d weigh less scanning as a ghost, but alas...
You expect what kills you to be the Impostor, but no, it's just obesity-related heart failure.
helth
Made me laugh so harr
NUTRITION IS IMPORTANT KIDS!
Arent they wearing their suit when acanning tho? That has to be almost all of the weight
    No they aren't
Still better than like 90% of random pick-up groups.
None of this is true. I am not fit, strong, healthy, or 92lbs
green a brocoli, and a healthy boi
Ngl, when I see peeps running around, they become real sus, mad quick :/
This was pretty good:)
Now I'm gonna say that as well , when I have med scan
I would say lol to that if I was in that lobby
Lol
Just get a fit bit
LMAOOOOO
Dang BOI
Thats i fucking hilarious
Be more like green
Omg I was in this game lmao
Hahaha
Dude wtf

Green might be smarter than we think 😮
Do what you gotta do, I guess...
Same green same
Why are among us characters so short 'n fat????!!
Not funny
Dog
PFFFFFFT, why become skinny pleb when you can be muscular chad? >:3
among us community is so cringe haha
    Then why are you here
    Really is. I assume everyone here is 14. The whole "sus" phrase being parroted has ensured I never play the game.
        Then why are y'all in a server about the game
            Was on /r/all. Any post I've seen from this dump is " sus sus sus sus" over and over again.
                I suppose that's fair lol

People just hate on Green/lime.
Everyone knows that yellow is the real trouble maker.
Spin!
Now THAT'S a Killer Bean.
Wow! I'm gonna start using that!!😂
Lol
To everyone saying its probably their suits and packs-

While yes, that is a valid observation, I don't understand why they would use a scan and not a scale to find their weight and a measurement stick to find their height. But then again, they have really advanced technology and probably are way out of old school measurements leagues.
    They...aren't wearing suits lol
        ...Then...
What are they wearing?? Are they just colored beans??
            Yes
                Understandable, have a nice day

184lbs at 7’ is skinny tho
That is the best defense I have ever heard. lol

            Kind of concerning that they're also measuring in pounds, which accounts for gravity, and not grams, which doesn't. If they're 92 lbs in low gravity, I wonder what they'd be on Earth. Maybe they're all in space so they don't die by crushing themselves where there's more gravity?
                yeah they should have given it in slugs obviously
                    Imagine innersloth put slugs in there omg
        That’s why player speed needs to be set on 0.5 to keep things realistic
    when you think about it, they should be, they fucking eat peoples heads all the time, i assume so anyway because their head just yeets out of existance
    ‘Green got stuck in the vent’
        "Help me step-crewmate"
To be fair, the crewmates could wearing spacesuits? In real life, spacesuits weigh somewhere around 150-250 lbs (50-80 kg) without the astronaut in them! It's like wearing another person. So maybe their actual weight is a little over half of 92 and the rest is their gear?

Unless those are just their bodies... I mean, they do wear clothing over top. Hard to say lol.
    Well there's no change in texture when they're bisected.

I saw some skeleton models, I don't know if any of them are canon tho :(
        the only canon skeleton model is ***B O N E***

hope that solves your problems :)
    I've always seen them as jetpack-wearing armless avatars. I cannot unsee it
    That means they weigh negative weight
    It is their bodies. I can prove it but if you're not interested I'm not gonna type it all out 😂 if you want the proof LMK
        Sure! I am curious if you don't mind.
The only explanation I have come to myself is that their innards matches the color that they are on the outside. Which makes me think that the color, and therefore the 'spacesuit', could actually just the way they look.
            So, that's part of it, and also this:

1. If they have a ship/airbase/planet that has some form of constant oxygen supply, as evidenced by O2 existing, then why are they wearing suits?

2. When their body falls over, we can tell that there is no layer between their outer "suit" and their innards that would be skin, so we can guess that the "suit" is their skin

3. If the suit had oxygen, then ejecting the wrong person would be inconsequential. They could just go back and get them from space. But since they die, we can tell that it's just their skin and not an O2 suit
*I WAS IN THE POOL!*
I suppose space gear adds a lot of weight
Psh they are wearing suits
r/theydidthemath
    nah you just use [this](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) or something.
Sure! No problem :)
    green is a healthy Boi.
        Or at least attempting to become one.
            Well how heavy is the pack they have? Also they’re clearly not humans, so maybe that is a healthy weight.
                I assume the pack is part of the 92 pounds, no?
                I'm not hating but they are humans, probably from the future because they have mtn dew on mirahq and machinery made by samsung. They are clearly humans.
                    What’s Samsung? Do you mean Simsung
                        Samsung is a mobile company, same as apples.
                            ???
                                Wdym "???" you asked what samsung was, I told you what it was.
                        Dude its samsung
                            No, its simsung on among us
                    But the ARMSSS, WHERE DID THEY GOOOO
                        They may just hold them by their sides till they gotta kill so it blends I to their suit
                    They're not humans, they just stole our stuff
                That's part of their body....
        Actually, green has a BMI of 38, which is highly obese. According to the CDC their ideal weight is 46 to 62 pounds. Better get moving!

    I'm pretty sure Polus is just a planet they are currently researching and developing. Mira HQ is on their home planet and we can see it doesn't look like Polus. Now it's not confirmed Mira hq is an earth equivalent, so could still technically be a different gravity value.

            Thing is, we don’t know how tall MIRA HQ is or which floor they fall from

                        unless they get pushed
                But we do know how tall those little mini telletubbies are, so we can use those
    If they were on a planet with less gravity they would weigh less, surely?
        [deleted]
            Yeah a 90lb human would weigh 15 lbs on the moon. So if these aliens are on the moon and weigh 92 lbs that means they have the equivalent mass of a 550lb human 😵

                        lbf and lbm has the same value right?
                            [deleted]
                                Idk my prof told me it’s pound force, but again if they have the same value it shouldn’t matter in civilian conversation unless we’re talking about a different gravity value?
                    No the us uses lb force. This person just obviously hasn’t taken a physics class before
                        Oh I see
    Low gravity would likely create tall and low density life forms as falling becomes less of a threat.

They are dense, small creatures with minimal limbs, this to me implies evolution in a high gravity environment.
        That makes more sense! Thanks!
You got to remember, the imposters can't really be counted as the "space suits" they're "wearing" are just their bodies, as seen in the tongue kill. With this in mind, and since the crewmate walking speed doesn't seem to, at least canonically, change, the real way to tell their weights is by how fast they fall on MIRA's ejection screen and how fast the bodies fall over.
    NONE of them are wearing suits. That's their body
        Either that or the suits are really tight.
            They can't be suits, because if the impostor was ejected, it wouldn't do anything because they have oxygen and wouldn't die. Also, why would they wear suits on a ship with oxygen (proven by the O^2 sabotage)
                1. I said the imposters "suits" are actually just the bodies.
2. I presume it's an oxygen reserve? The ISS has oxygen on it so the people on it aren't having to wear suits with limited oxygen supply, so I assume it works the same on the Skeld.
                    That was kinda my point
                        I mean, since there's a medical station and a cafeteria I assume there's an oxygen reserve so they can eat and have medical work done on them.

    Their tanks would eventually run out and would have to be refilled. They also have to take their suits off to eat.
        Dosen’t an oxygen tank last more than 50 seconds
If assume that the scales would take the excess suit weight into account given that all crewmates wear them.
This would be true, if they were wearing suits....

    Weight and mass are very different so the scan would probably find mass and apply the constant for gravitational acceleration in the among us universe to find weight in pounds
No, they don't wear any suit or equipment

        Kind of concerning that they're also measuring in pounds, which accounts for gravity, and not grams, which doesn't. If they're 92 lbs in low gravity, I wonder what they'd be on Earth. Maybe they're all in space so they don't die by crushing themselves where there's more gravity?
            yeah they should have given it in slugs obviously
                Imagine innersloth put slugs in there omg
    That’s why player speed needs to be set on 0.5 to keep things realistic
when you think about it, they should be, they fucking eat peoples heads all the time, i assume so anyway because their head just yeets out of existance

Well there's no change in texture when they're bisected.

I saw some skeleton models, I don't know if any of them are canon tho :(
    the only canon skeleton model is ***B O N E***

hope that solves your problems :)
I've always seen them as jetpack-wearing armless avatars. I cannot unsee it
That means they weigh negative weight
It is their bodies. I can prove it but if you're not interested I'm not gonna type it all out 😂 if you want the proof LMK
    Sure! I am curious if you don't mind.
The only explanation I have come to myself is that their innards matches the color that they are on the outside. Which makes me think that the color, and therefore the 'spacesuit', could actually just the way they look.
        So, that's part of it, and also this:

1. If they have a ship/airbase/planet that has some form of constant oxygen supply, as evidenced by O2 existing, then why are they wearing suits?

2. When their body falls over, we can tell that there is no layer between their outer "suit" and their innards that would be skin, so we can guess that the "suit" is their skin

3. If the suit had oxygen, then ejecting the wrong person would be inconsequential. They could just go back and get them from space. But since they die, we can tell that it's just their skin and not an O2 suit
nah you just use [this](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) or something.
green is a healthy Boi.
    Or at least attempting to become one.
        Well how heavy is the pack they have? Also they’re clearly not humans, so maybe that is a healthy weight.
            I assume the pack is part of the 92 pounds, no?
            I'm not hating but they are humans, probably from the future because they have mtn dew on mirahq and machinery made by samsung. They are clearly humans.
                What’s Samsung? Do you mean Simsung
                    Samsung is a mobile company, same as apples.
                        ???
                            Wdym "???" you asked what samsung was, I told you what it was.
                    Dude its samsung
                        No, its simsung on among us
                But the ARMSSS, WHERE DID THEY GOOOO
                    They may just hold them by their sides till they gotta kill so it blends I to their suit
                They're not humans, they just stole our stuff
            That's part of their body....
    Actually, green has a BMI of 38, which is highly obese. According to the CDC their ideal weight is 46 to 62 pounds. Better get moving!

I'm pretty sure Polus is just a planet they are currently researching and developing. Mira HQ is on their home planet and we can see it doesn't look like Polus. Now it's not confirmed Mira hq is an earth equivalent, so could still technically be a different gravity value.

            But we do know how tall those little mini telletubbies are, so we can use those
If they were on a planet with less gravity they would weigh less, surely?

        Yeah a 90lb human would weigh 15 lbs on the moon. So if these aliens are on the moon and weigh 92 lbs that means they have the equivalent mass of a 550lb human 😵

                            Idk my prof told me it’s pound force, but again if they have the same value it shouldn’t matter in civilian conversation unless we’re talking about a different gravity value?
                No the us uses lb force. This person just obviously hasn’t taken a physics class before
                    Oh I see
Low gravity would likely create tall and low density life forms as falling becomes less of a threat.

They are dense, small creatures with minimal limbs, this to me implies evolution in a high gravity environment.
    That makes more sense! Thanks!
NONE of them are wearing suits. That's their body
    Either that or the suits are really tight.
        They can't be suits, because if the impostor was ejected, it wouldn't do anything because they have oxygen and wouldn't die. Also, why would they wear suits on a ship with oxygen (proven by the O^2 sabotage)
            1. I said the imposters "suits" are actually just the bodies.
2. I presume it's an oxygen reserve? The ISS has oxygen on it so the people on it aren't having to wear suits with limited oxygen supply, so I assume it works the same on the Skeld.
                That was kinda my point
                    I mean, since there's a medical station and a cafeteria I assume there's an oxygen reserve so they can eat and have medical work done on them.
                        Yeah and they have a bathroom on Polus
Their tanks would eventually run out and would have to be refilled. They also have to take their suits off to eat.

            No the us uses lb force. This person just obviously hasn’t taken a physics class before
                Oh I see
That makes more sense! Thanks!
Either that or the suits are really tight.
    They can't be suits, because if the impostor was ejected, it wouldn't do anything because they have oxygen and wouldn't die. Also, why would they wear suits on a ship with oxygen (proven by the O^2 sabotage)
        1. I said the imposters "suits" are actually just the bodies.
2. I presume it's an oxygen reserve? The ISS has oxygen on it so the people on it aren't having to wear suits with limited oxygen supply, so I assume it works the same on the Skeld.
            That was kinda my point
                I mean, since there's a medical station and a cafeteria I assume there's an oxygen reserve so they can eat and have medical work done on them.
                    Yeah and they have a bathroom on Polus
Dosen’t an oxygen tank last more than 50 seconds

Kind of concerning that they're also measuring in pounds, which accounts for gravity, and not grams, which doesn't. If they're 92 lbs in low gravity, I wonder what they'd be on Earth. Maybe they're all in space so they don't die by crushing themselves where there's more gravity?
    yeah they should have given it in slugs obviously
        Imagine innersloth put slugs in there omg
So, that's part of it, and also this:

1. If they have a ship/airbase/planet that has some form of constant oxygen supply, as evidenced by O2 existing, then why are they wearing suits?

2. When their body falls over, we can tell that there is no layer between their outer "suit" and their innards that would be skin, so we can guess that the "suit" is their skin

3. If the suit had oxygen, then ejecting the wrong person would be inconsequential. They could just go back and get them from space. But since they die, we can tell that it's just their skin and not an O2 suit
Well how heavy is the pack they have? Also they’re clearly not humans, so maybe that is a healthy weight.
    I assume the pack is part of the 92 pounds, no?

        lbf and lbm has the same value right?
            [deleted]
                Idk my prof told me it’s pound force, but again if they have the same value it shouldn’t matter in civilian conversation unless we’re talking about a different gravity value?
    No the us uses lb force. This person just obviously hasn’t taken a physics class before
        Oh I see
1. I said the imposters "suits" are actually just the bodies.
2. I presume it's an oxygen reserve? The ISS has oxygen on it so the people on it aren't having to wear suits with limited oxygen supply, so I assume it works the same on the Skeld.
    That was kinda my point
        I mean, since there's a medical station and a cafeteria I assume there's an oxygen reserve so they can eat and have medical work done on them.
            Yeah and they have a bathroom on Polus
I think you’re talking about r/beetlejuicing
