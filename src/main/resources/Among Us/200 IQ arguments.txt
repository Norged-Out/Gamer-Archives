            Pink the color or Pink the name?
                Why not both
                    Lol that’s funny because I just ended a match as an imposter.

I was Cyan, but my name was Red, and Red (the color) was the other imposter.
                        My name ingame is red and I am dark blue lol
Watched one win like this yesterday. All he would say is "I agree" when someone got blamed.
    I need to try that
        Just agree with everything

Black: “Who was at electrical when lights when down?”

You: “Agreed”
            reminds me of that one movie clip where the lawyer tells a guy to deny everything and he denies he was a witness or something
Wait guys he can't be an imposter I'm the imposter
    Wait no I am the imposter
How do you even mistakenly believe someone just vented? I'm a new player and I can generally tell the difference between venting and disappearing from the field of vision.
    This happens more often than I would like. I got blamed for venting (Crewmates) and kicked the first round by somebody that wasn’t even the imposter.

I think it’s cause of lag.
    You can see vents open even outside your fov
I only play games with 2 impostors
    Same
    Prefer not to do it alone because I panic inside
i killed somebody, walked right out the room into someone else n they reported then said the wrong color and everyone agreed. last vote before i won chat said “i trust u white <3”
funny thing is that this just happened to me some minutes ago.
I love winning games by not doing anything
"I cummed on the floor"

-cyan

"I'm the imposter"

-also cyan
One of my friends literally says "interesting" after every time she finds something that shows that they're imposter. I hear it every game
One time I was imposter with two crewmates left who were both blaming each other, trying to convince me to vote the other person (they both already voted).

I decided to fuck with the ghosts by making a show of being really conflicted about my vote.
Yeah, I don't know how they saw it so I'm just gonna ask who is actually the imposter like I don't know anything.
I got 4 guys to all basically spend the entire gaming blaming and kicking each other,I just skipped or played dumb and I won
U don't like the fact that I never be an imposter
I just finished a match where I only had to kill one person cause the second imposter killed two for me and white was going after me so hard he made himself look hella sus, then I didn’t kill anyone so it just turned into arguments with 0 evidence until there were 3 of us left 

Then I just sabotaged O2 and killed one of them while they were on their way
Just crack open a cold one and watch all unfold
I had no idea why they would say that lol
Yesterday, three people were left, one of them being me: the impostor. First poster suspected the third, I said "dunno. You sure?" and the other accused him of wanting to distract from himself. I could choose, with whom to side to win... That felt nice (was my first day playing)
Its funny when your the imposter and a crew mate accuse another crew mate of venting. They convince everyone to vote and if they are wrong to vote them next. Then next round you call emergency meeting to vote them off. Lol
purple sus
    Nah it pink
