[[There is 1 reposter among us...]]





Commenters, please don’t tag the user or threaten them in any way. Doing so will result in a temporary ban from this point forward.
Just make the background filled with watermarks
    Next time i will
        The ground is sucking me into watermarks
            It will all become u/Ghotohr
                The center cannot hold!
                    Such a great opening to a poem.

For those who haven’t read it, it’s The Second Coming by  W.B. Yeats:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
                        Thanks for that, a great piece
                Wait, it’s all u/Ghotohr
                    Always has been
                        🔫👨‍🔫👨‍ *BAM*
                            Sorry sir I was high
                Make all of the colours just u/Ghotor so it’s just loads of grey letters for the background

        Put some on the crewmate, too. Then people can’t edit out the watermark without editing out the most important part.
            Anyone with any skill can use a color picker to clear watermarks. But that requires effort and reposters don't want to put in effort.
                It took some effort to crop the watermark out of this one. The jackass who reposted it would likely do that to a post with the watermark on the crewmate
                    Actually if you look at it. All they did was crop out everything but the floor and the characters. The watermarks were only on the wall and the bottom corner of the photo. This was just a simple crop job that took no effort
                        Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate
                How about making the watermarks a rainbow color (i.e. using gradients) instead?
                    They would still use the color picker and brushes to remove watermarks. They use the color picker to grab the color around the watermark and paint over the wm to remove it.
                        Ouch.
                Cropping and repositioning each frame like that is ironically a huge amount more work than just selecting each watermark in photoship and selecting fill -> content aware.
            Pro tip in addition to that: Put your watermarks on "busy" parts of the picture - such as brown's outfit. This makes it much harder (i.e. more effort) to erase the watermark. If the reposter manages to get the watermark erased, that part will still look odd in comparison. 

Obviously Among Us isn't a fairly complex game in terms of erasing watermarks due to its art style but one can still try.
        Task: 5/6

Electrical: Find OP'S watermark to repost
            Nice. What's the likelihood that the reposter will notice that tasks?
        Did you know that since the maximum amount of karma you can get from a post is 5k this post earned you the same amount as his repost did him
            Whoa I actually didn’t know that! TIL. What about karma from comments? Is it the same?
                Each upvote gives less and less, so around 6k karma per post is the pretty much hard-cap. The reposter probably got like 5.8k, but by the end of this day you will probably have like 40k upvotes since it's been 3 hours and you already have 10k. By that time it should be pretty much the same.
                    it's been 3 hours since your reply and it's already past 41k
        Watermarks need to be in an area of the photo critical to the content. If you put them in unnecessary areas, people crop it out. By hiding it well, and somewhere vital, removing it becomes significantly more work. It sucks that watermarking has to be done sneakily, but the posts that get successfuly stolen the least have the most well-hidden watermarks in critical areas of the image

For example, putting it in the visor of the character, with it being only a slightly different color than their visor naturally is. Or in the pattern of the flooring between characters where they'd have to do multiple crops or shop a new spot of flooring over it to get rid of it.
            Finding creative ways to hide watermarks in images is always fun.
        try being creative and put the watermark, I dont know, on the crewmates or pets, or somewhere they won't notice.
        Next time make a better title too.
        Also make him go the other direction
        The reposter is a twat for stealing content, BUT I think it's worth noticing that the cropped version is actually more direct and quicker to process cognitively. That may have been at least part of the reason why the repost got more votes. Luck/timing is always a factor but its never the only factor!

Either way, you might want to try that style more in the future: There's at least partial evidence that the mob \_prefers\_ it, vote-wise, and it would also make it harder for a reposter to crop it any further :)
        I upvoted you here and [on the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j4daqh/mini_impostor_wants_to_do_like_daddy/) since you deserve it.

But man, your original title kinda sucks and Jess' was better. Also, Gaming is a MUCH bigger sub and probably easier to get traction on. Gotta learn to play the game.

        Hey, those are my watermarks that you posted on your picture!
        redditards will still repost it. mark my words.
        stop bitching no one cares its reddit points
        I like the one you made where the minis become friends!
        You have my respect 
The same thing happened with me a few days back. Not once but twice. This shit is unbelievable
        On the other hand the one without watermarks go way more upvotes, so if you care about karma trying posting without them
        Do u cry when someone steals ur worthless memes and karma?
        Don't go overboard with it unless you spend like hours on it or it will make you look arrogant I learn that the hard way

    Just make the meme out of watermarks
    This is why gaudy luxury products made by Louis Vuitton and such are covered with logos. It's generally impossible to copyright or trademark fashion designs, so the only thing to do is slather them with trademarks.
He also mirrored the image so repost bots can’t find it
    now that’s just scummy
    Weirdly the joke reads much better flipped.
        Ikr. Obviously he shouldn't have stolen it, but I actually found his version funnier. Makes sense it receive more upvotes
            I think it's because of how we normally read left to right, so it's much easier to stay fixated on the left. With the dead bodies on the right, you still check the left in case there's something there that you might miss. Also, it's much more compact, although the resolution is just terrible.

Of course, still a scummy thing to do.
            It also has a better title. But still scummy
            [deleted]
            Much better title
        Yup, his has a better angle, title, and its much better with the walls removed from second and third pic so you dont need to scroll down.
    Program the bots to look for inverted image?

I know nothing of computer robots so pay no attention
        No that's definitely possible I guess, one way would be to always run a scan on both the normal image and the inverted image and return results of both
    I don't think they would find it anyway due to it being cropped.
    Tbh looking at the original I prefer the mirrored version lmao

        Goooooood....
            The fucker probably made another account and is lurking in comments here.

 Think of the work he went to remove the marks.

Hey piece of shit next time you repost just keep the watermarks and give the OP credit.
                ya but now all of the karma, recognition and awards go to no one

and it took time out of their day to make a new one
                    Yeah, like cheaters evading bans
                He could be YOU, He could be ME, HE COULD EVEN BE *[fucking dies]*
                    Woah woah woah!
                        It was obvious! He was the reposter! See? His account will be deleted now... any minute now... see? Wait still there.
                            So, we still have problem?
                                Alright, who’s ready to go find this reposter?
                                    **Right behind you...**
                    r/unexpectedtf2
                    There is 1 reposter among us
                He just cropped the marks out for each image... still shitty obviously
                He could be you...
                    I mean... My account is a few years old but sure, I could be the guy
                        He could be me!
                            Nah you're way too cool
                                He could even be-
                                Damn thanks, you're very cool too
                its fucking reddit upvotes who gives a shit
                /u/barcaroli is sus, self report
                Seriously, I don’t care how old this person is. Stealing other people’s shit is fucked up.
                Boo-hoo he stole a bunch of internet points . Grow the fuck up
                So much hostility because he reposted a meme lol, ridiculous
            ...Anaking, good

Kill him, kill him now
                I’m so glad you know the exact type of “good” I’m trying to portray
        I hate when impostors leave the match when they’re caught.
            What if u/ghotohr and u/jess1743 are the same person and they just used two accounts to trick everyone into ejecting an obvious fake. Now we just ejected a psuedo-imposter, and u/ghotohr is the real reposter. I just want to remind everyone that this is reddit, confirm ejects is OFF!
                I’m voting for u/sqwaabird. Feels pretty sus ngl.

        Wow. What an embarrassment. 😂
    Good.
    Given the user name (western name followed by numbers) it was likely a farm account used for generating karma then selling to marketers, scammers, astroturfers, or whoever else needs an account with positive references.

Since /r/gaming is a cesspit of karma bots and geeks with no short term memory, it was posted there, shot up to the front page of the sub and reaped the benefits from those who never care about who originally posted the art.
    No witchhunts.
    I get you have good intentions but it'd be best to not link them considering Witch Hunts aren't exactly a good thing. No matter how disrespectful the individual is being through their actions.
        While typically I’d agree, there are a few reasons I believe that wouldn’t apply here.

1: if witch hunters want to find this person, they wouldn’t have to look at my comment to do it. They can simply look at the post. Now if the user was hidden and I went threw the effort into finding it than yes I would be going to far

2: the person we are tagging has deleted their account so this user no longer leads to anyone
            Very well
                Not trying to put you down or what you said, I’m just giving my opinion of it as well

Stay safe man!
                    Not bothered with you at all, rather annoyed with the people giving downvotes over my earlier comment about Witch Hunts
                        Ya I don’t understand it, your simply looking out for another person. Although they did something wrong you just looking out for others, and that’s super honorable
It seems to be gone now. They deleted it. What an asshole.
    Their account was deleted for anti trans
        r/gaming moment
            lmao
            yeah bro i make edgy jokes, *transphobia*

Edit: Above comment was something on the topic of the reporter needs to face justice, and he has been banned, thus this comment.

Edit 2: Above commenter probably got tempbanned from the sub according to the moderator pin. RIP.

            Ya he would have not been trolled if he would have taken permissions and given credit to the OP,sad

            Me after doing bull
Lol the fucker deleted his account and the post
    I believe it was also because they were saying some very anti trans things
    Because dumb fucking retards probably sent him death threats over a fucking meme
        Justice served?
    Just like in the simulations when the imposter is exposed
    His account was banned for being anti-trans.
Same thing happened to me. I got about 8k here and was like “yay I made a good meme”

Fast forward to the next day and I see someone else posted it in r/memes and got 55k upvotes
    Someone once repost my meme and got 50k upvotes on r/memes n when i reposted my post it got called a repost by idiots ))):::
    Wait until you see how much facebook pages profit off stolen youtube videos
    I actually saw that same meme on r/memes. I just learned the one on r/memes is a repost.

I have my free award. I know it’s not much, and doesn’t give you anything besides an award, but you can have it.
    So you're saying that 63k people liked your post? 

Reposts mean nothing, everything is reposted, rehashed and edited slightly to make a joke else where on other images. 

The only information you should care about is you gave some people some enjoyment for a moment. 

Stats on some random username on some bs website mean nothing. Think about it, how many sites, games and things were you involved with years ago that now no longer are around for cared about?

            So the op of this thread said others stole her nudes, making her a girl. Girls aren’t real.
                The real imposters
                    Kinda sus.
                        self report
                Guys can share nudes.

C'mon man it's 2020
                    My bad, sorry. Equality for all, no lives matter and so forth.


Amen
                        We can make a religion out of this.

                We are real! I promise! 😂
        Where
            Where
                Who?
    wait
    Something ain’t right here
        did you see her history she as bikini pictures so she would most likely have nudes
            That sounds like a slippery slope argument.
                Did you check their actual profile because they’re deadass just someone who sells nudes.
                    I was commenting on the argument, not the facts.
                It is a slippery slope. But I do post bikini pics (as do like 77% of women) and I do have nudes.
                    I doubt 77% of women post bikini pictures, even if we limit it to the USA. You're probably thinking of people in your peer group. There are many people not even on social media and others who are still too modest.
                That isn't a slippery slope
                    Did you see her history?

She wears t-shirts in pictures, so she would probably pose in shorts. 

If she posed in shorts, she would probably pose in a one piece swimsuit. 

If she posed in a one piece, she'd probably pose in a bikini. 

If she posed in a bikini, she'd probably pose for nudes.
    What a shitty and lame way to promote your nudes.
        In fairness it was sort of creative.
            That is creative lol
            In honesty it was not, esp since she doesn’t even have nudes in her profile
                modern prostitutes smh
                    I don’t think she’s a prostitute mate...
        Respect the hustle
        In a sub where probably a lot of young kids exist, only a shitty person would do such a thing.
            Because everyone knows kids don't find out about nude pictures on the Internet until their 18th birthday.
        Imagine if a guy did this, advertise his nudes on a subreddit filled with minors.

            You could've just said "posting my pictures" instead of "posting my nudes" but whatever

                    didn't think of it while you advertise on a popular post on a subreddit getting tons of traffic right now and with your line of work you know exactly what you're doing. just dont lie lmao.
                        I have literally gotten a total of 0 new orders since I commented that. Not even joking. Cuz no one looks at a comment like that and thinks “Hmm. Maybe I should buy her nudes cuz that’s obviously why she complained about having her nudes leaked.”

                    I think you're overestimating just how much I actually care about this particular issue
                        I mean, if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have commented in the first place. So I’m sure you care to some degree.
                            I initially cared because I read someone else say that you were a titty poster, but was disappointed to discover that you just post softcore/face cropped content which was around the time I stopped caring. Since we're being pedantic here 😂
                                Ah. I see. Well, given that you don’t care anymore, can I count on you to not reply to this thread anymore? Or...?
                                    Sure, consider this my last reply. As some friendly parting advice, if you don't want someone replying to you then don't keep probing them for responses.
    Wow that's crazy. I don't remember anyone asking though.
    \-. \_-.
    So have I!  And I'm not even a girl!
    Holy shit you weren't lying
    What!? That’s horrible! Where did they post these photos so I know to never go there!
    This is how attentionwhoring works, make something about you and mention your nudes.

Sadder is all the idiots giving you upvotes.

EDIT:  
Thank God your comment got removed, imagine finding that stuff in a forum about gaming like... woman who the fuck asked? it was textbook attention-whoring and advertising because you made it about yourself and implied your sex service selling in an environment that has absolutely nothing to do with you mentioning nudes.

Also this an "all ages" game, kids of both genders as young as maybe 12 tend to come here for advice and I highly doubt they need to see your comment about your nudes and your selling sexual services. Keep that shit to yourself next time.
        [deleted]
            It is attention whoring but Honestly I did get a few good long wanks to ur pictures tonight so there’s that
        This isn't attention whoring. Someone is entitled to their nudes. It's their body, they have a right to be pissed about asshats stealing the credit. This comment fits perfectly in this thread's discussion.
    Everybody, please downvote and report the comment I'm replying to for spam to help stop irrelevant promos and bots from infesting reddit! Thank you!

    You weren’t kidding huh
    What a shitty thing to do, advertising your nudes in a sub where probably a lot of young kids exist.

Downvotes? Really, imagine if a guy advertises his nudes on here, a place where it’s filled with minors, y’all upvoting her comment are pieces of shits.

            Right...
    this some clever marketing
        Not trying to market. Was just sharing that I hate when people steal your content. And that I’ve been a victim thrice now.
    ಠ_ಠ
    So are you 19 or 21?
        I’m 21!
            Why’d you lie about your age?
        He’s a 50 year old man posting images of young girls.
The thing is that r/gaming is way bigger than r/AmongUs, he’s a filthy reposter still but you could have posted it in gaming aswell and gotten the same upvotes
    Maybe they’d think he reposted it
        Anyone with a brain that checks the date of posting would quickly discover who the reposter is
            Not everyone is big brain especially on reddit where the average time spent on a post is 5 seconds
                That ain’t anything new round here either unfortunately
                    Sadly
        Rarely if anyone checks the usernames.
    plus he had a more eyecatching title
        plus he had better cropping (still uncool to not include watermark somewhere though ofc)
    as well*

It's not one word.

    aswell isn't a word in English

saw a pixel art repost on here that got popular and the original one or r/PixelArt acually got taken down by the mods
    Damn That Harsh
    Why do mods appear to have a bad reputation, are they emulating US cops?
r/karmacourt
I think they deleted it, I can’t find it on their profile
    They still have a profile?
Well they cropped out the watermark. I would place watermarks in places that no one can crop out without ruining the meme.
Sorry this happened man
I want to dv that reposter for you but ngl I don't like your title at all (it sounds so weird I would have ignored it too)
Titles are everything.
They deleted there account. JUSTICE S E R V E D
watermarking a meme

can someone link me to the repost so i can downdoot?
    i want to downdoot too
        I don’t wanna sound mean but witch hunting over a post is cringe as fuck
            Over fake internet points, too. I didn’t even look at the content. I just like to come in and see all the SJW trying to give some “credit.”  I almost get it when it’s an artist but a meme ? Settle down kids
                Did you have to make it political


Edit: wrong comment I replied to sorry and yeah I agree

i checked r/gaming and i cant find that post so maybe its removed now
The left account got deleted
That’s why ya gotta put watermarks in a spot where you can’t crop it out.
Bruh the audacity to crop out the watermark and earn karma from it, take my upvote and I am sorry for your loss
Great another fucking witch hunt. The last time this happens the guy got hundreds of messages telling him to kill himself for posting a meme. And now this Jess person deleted their account. Never change, Reddit.
    I hate these fucking posts "BlLeEh He StOlE mY kArMa It WaS mInE!1!1!" This just makes me want to downvote the original. Why do you even care about upvotes?
LMAO best part is, they deleted their account 👏
Why are you still in r/gaming is the real question
People keep reposting stuff that others spent an hour or two making a cute video or meme with just a screenshot they should not exist
you should post this in r/mildlyinfuriating
Oh my god, you were absolutely robbed
Jess deleted his account lmaooo
Hey sorry this happened. But just wanna provide some critiques on yours cause looking at both, I do prefer his edits more:

- he cut out the background and focused on the scene. Common in comics, you don’t typically see the same background again and again with each panel.

- this has the effect on focusing it on the scene itself, a case of less is more.

- watch out for use of text on the background. In your case, navigation. People end up focusing/reading text and ultimately is a distraction. Unless it’s a part of the scene, or adds to it, avoid them. Certain exceptions of course, like an “exit” sign. Navigation just happens to be a long and not regularly encountered word.

- the mirrored version lends better for left to right readers. The static/unmoving elements are on the left, and the characters moving appear to be moving off to the right. From a comic flow perspective, that’s better since people consume it left to right, top down.

- I’m not saying the reposter is a comic god but his end result, whether he was aware of it or not, yielded a more traditional comic setup which happens to be my preference too.
    Tbh whoever made the edit did an excellent job. I even think that something about the blurriness of it adds to the tone. Makes it feel like there is weight to it, instead of just panel snapshots.
Can't find post so good?
So that’s why I felt that I saw that post before.
Nice their account is gone
I’ve given up trying to post shit on this site.
Fucking reposters
Can someone explain to me why it matters? I feel like it’s not like art, where it’s commodified and lack of attribution would mean OP gets robbed of something with value - like it not being attributed to OP’s Reddit account means what? Reddit isn’t even a platform that people generally follow each other on... but honestly I feel like I’m missing something so if someone could enlighten me I would appreciate :-)
    Eh I don’t really get it much either. But like let’s say you worked on something it got let’s say 1k upvotes than someone reposts it and gets 50k upvotes. You would be feeling kinda sad too. It’s kinda like my work isn’t good but there’s is perfect. It’s like two students giving a teacher the same quiz with the same answers but one of them copies and they get 100 and you get a 70. That’s what I think anyway. I’ve had my work copied before and it just makes you think that there’s something wrong with you. Like we post the same thing and it was made by me but it’s worse than their’s. It just kinda stings.
        Oh ok I can see that. I feel bad that there’s a righteous mob over it though I can only imagine the shitty DM’s they got. Like it kinda sucks but I can’t say I feel ready to grab a pitchfork over it
            I once posted something i found on 9gag to reddit and it got to hot but then i started getting hateful DMs claiming i stole some one else's post. Feels bad, those DMs didn't even tell me whole post i stole they just kept insulting me in Dms and comments.

Judging by the mob in his post created no surprise the accused deleted the account.
     its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
Plot twist: You also stole the picture
    Stole the picture, went back in time, put a water mark on it, and post it, and then came back to the present and made this post. It's only been 10 minutes for OP.
[removed]
    The fact that people like you and others who harass him for stealing a FUCKING MEME BOGGLES ME ITS INTERNET POINTS YOU DELUSIONAL PIGS
        I've seen this argument a lot, it's never about the internet points, literally no one cares. It's about seeing your content get recognition and all the people like it and comment funny stuff. Stealing all that from someone and take credit is a pretty shitty thing to do. Like for real it's not a hard concept to understand
            This guy gets it.
            Im talking about the people who harras the person. ive seen death threats happen too a guy cuz he cropped out a watermark and placed it as its own. r/AmongUs is literrly the most cancerous subreddit ever sience it became popular.
                Then leave the subreddit. Easy as that.
                    you completely ignore the fact that people send death threats too that man
                        I do t send death threats, those people are idiots

    Stop harassing him, it’s internet points. Chill the fuck out.
        Fuck you loser.
            Who’s the loser? The people getting upset over internet points? Or the one telling them to chill it’s not a big deal?

It might feel bad when your oh so fuckin important reddit karma gets " Stolen ", But it doesn't compare with theft in any realm.
            For internet points. Harassing someone over internet points. Reddit moment.
                Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be. 
But no really imagine having YOUR content stolen, and posted elsewhere without giving any credit.
                    It’s the internet man chill out. The internet. Does it really matter? Fucking internet points. Think about it.



If someone used “your” idea irl (ideas are not intellectual property) would you go harass the person who did it?
                        Yes
                            You’re fucked up. Go get some mental help.
1 reposter? Half the people who post on this joke of a subreddit are reposters.
    Dude this isnt r/jacksepticeye tf you talking about
Probably because his caption was better.

Edit: It was also on a sub that has 28 million people as opposed to this one’s 678 thousand.
This post makes me want to vote the imposter up.
He nailed the tag line tho, yours is a bit sus
damn you convinced the crew to eject the Imposter  
gg all
Aww man, they snaked your fake internet points.
I hate when people pull shit like that. Like come on take the time and learn to create something entertaining
Make the water mark so big you can’t see the meme. Works, but you get less upvotes due to not being able to see the meme
r/fuckyoujess1743
    This sub does not exist and I will not be responsible for making it.
        Fucking chad
We got em, Jess is no more
Me, making a post and getting 20 upvotes. *watery eyed cat giving thumbs up*
Well, at least he deleted his account. Eff Jess1743
I hate the people who do this

Lazy and desperate for internet attention

This got 30k upvotes so one mod HAS to have seen this
Why do repost even get more awards and liked .-.
Remember to put your watermarks like in the middle area, or an important part
r/gaming is literally 99% reposts. its disgusting.
[removed]
Who the fuck cares.

It’s imaginary internet points.
I saw this one week ago on Pinterest. That's not your post though.
I am seeing so much reposts (Like from months ago being here)
I hate that some people do this. You can appreciate someone's edit/meme etc without removing a watermark. The person who did this wanted it to look like they did the edit because they have no imagination. 

I do a lot of photoshop edits and drawings and this is my biggest fear. I work hard on something and some little thief removes my water marks and gets credit for it just because they may have more followers than me. 

On a positive note, this was a really creative and clever way to incorporate the buddies of the crew so well done on creating it. And I'm sorry someone stole that from you
Someone did that to my post to- and put it on insta!! I should have put a big water mark on it.
Now you got more up votes man
Well got 75k so win win?
Not a witch hunt but the guy who reposted deleted his account
u/Jess1743
 u/jess1743 suck
u/jess1743
And now this have 80k Upvotes
No one cares
    I hope op feels better about his fake internet points
        its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
    No one cares about your comment about an among us meme being stolen on a sub about among us what no one actually cares about is people like you that say anything digital is useless and if it isnt real money its fucking nothing you antique gardening tool
        We demand to be taken seriously
            No one takes you seriously
                - guy who wrote a paragraph about how important reddit karma is
                    You can't even read properly you support stealing dumbass
                        Stealing reddit memes that took 10 minutes to make oh no
                            Yea that's the point there is no point in doing it they just want to watch the world burn that just makes them more hateble
                                How embarrassing
                                    You just dont get reddit
        But he didnt say "anything digital is useless". Why are you making stuff up to get a point across.... ooh wait.
            Someone is calling out a reposter and this guy is like it's just internet point dude it doesn't matter I think that point is clear
                You really do like to make stuff up dont ya
                    You really dont see it dont ya
                        You really dont see it. Reddit karma is useless, nobody cares. Have you ever heard somebody in real life being proud of his reddit karma? Its a useless metric. Especially with all the bot karma farming accounts being sold. You on the other hand are making up bullshit narratives to support your own fantasy. "Anything digital is useless"
"If it isnt real money its nothing"

Nobody said anything of that. 

You only made that up to drive your own point across, because without all the false bs, it falls flat on its nose
I mean you make memes for reddit. 

Why you need to watermark?

I say this as someone who's made [quite a bit of content](https://i.imgur.com/yQAmh42.gifv) for reddit, without watermarks, because I mean, whats the point? Am I trying to build a brand? Not really.

Make the watermark be, that your content is so unique, that its obviously you. Instead of stamping it twice.

Everything on reddit is a shitpost. Its throwaway content, stop trying to build a brand off shitposting.

If you want to try to build a brand as an artist. A simple frame with your name works great. See Sarah Anderson or Poorly Drawn Lines. But again, their work is _so unique_ that you know its them when you see it.

Maybe work on that instead of being salty about fake internet points.
    Honestly, I'm not sure what's worse: the guy who wasted time putting watermarks in this, or the guy who wasted time removing it.
    Same. I don't watermark aswell
That's why I slap a big-fat-juicy semi transparent water mark over my memes.
u/ghotohr didn’t this happen to u last month or something
I mean gotta admit the reposter had a much better title
Oh no the karma
    the problem is that, it's basically stealing somebodies work.

Welcome to the internet. Your fake points are still pointless. Log out
    is "your fake points are still pointless" supposed to be a pun?
    So why bother stealing your point doesnt make sence
        Your comments don’t make sense. Try speaking correctly first, then trolling after you can type a correct sentence.
            I'm saying that if stealing is meaningless why steal and why do you say that nothing matters if it isnt monetary gain
                Like I said, welcome to the internet. Good luck in your utopia where you think it doesn’t exist kid. You are in for a rude awakening soon
                    You didnt understand what I said
     its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
Oh crap I up voted that repost imma refind it so I can downvote it.
Time to get the pitchforks
    Reddit hivemind unite!!!
He even posted on another subreddit hoping you wouldn’t notice
    [deleted]
Also someone reposted this on r/blursedimages
his title was better
Why do people do things like this?  I can't even begin to understand it.  Is the allure of imaginary internet points that powerful?

Anyway, I'm glad you called them out!
Tbh I prefer the reposted one, its more compact, easier and quicker to get the picture.  


Not justifying stealing content. Just my opinion.
I upvoted the original and didn’t see the new one
*reposts this*
You're tattling about someone stealing your fake internet points. Jesus christ.
    And they stole someone's meme for fake internet points what's your point
[removed]
First world problems...?
What are you trying to accomplish with this post? I'm sure it could also be reposted and get karma. The entire point of reposting is for the people who didn't see it when it was new get a chance to be exposed to the content. Not everyone has 10 hours to dig through all of reddit until they get back to where they last left off.
    Oh yeah, because the reposter totally didn't go the extra mile to remove the watermarks and mirror the image so repost bots can't find it...
        Who really cares except you and the OP? They're fake internet points, the meme is using IP that isn't the OP's, there are about 100 more reasons why credit isn't necessary.
Honestly screw people who do this, this is just dirty.
Everybody in here is a re(im)poster
How are people changing their color next to their name?
There also transphobic
r/gaming is just repost city.
Justice.
Look at my profile. Accidentally reposted a repost
Good news, the person who stole it deleted your account
Oh no, what will you do without all of that karma OP?
damn, he took the title from my post too
I get the frustration of not being credited for your work but why do people get so butt hurt about karma? Can you cash it in or something
Who cares dude, do you want people to see the picture or are you making stuff for attention? The internet points yield you nothing IRL
Honestly who cares? It’s fake internet points.
U/jess1743 was banned by the removalbot from the entire site.
Don’t care
Clearly people didn’t like the watermark.
you must be a sad piece of shit of you really care about this
the impostor pic is much better in every way 

1. more concise in editing and framing
2. way better title
3. flipped reads better for western audiences that are used to red from left to right - this applies to pictures aswell

Should have credited the original though. But seriously, stop crying and learn to make memes better. Thats why they're "memes" after all.
Don’t you realise both pictures have differences?
If you watermark memes you deserve to have them stolen imo
That post sus
"professional" redditors are a joke. Removing water marks, mirroring images, and making it so repost bots can't find it. Sad lonely lives.
i really do not understsand why people on reddit care so fucking much about reposts. you made a meme and now it’s getting more attention so what
    Imagine you do a painting the best in the world and you show it to the world and before anyone can see it someone steals it and says he drew it and got praised while you sit their with nothing
        its just a meme bruh
        making an among us meme is not the mona lisa it’s really not that serious
            It's still stealing
I'm sorry but who actually cares.  Are you losing money off this?  It's fake internet points.  Who cares.
[deleted]
    You spent hours to do a quality, original post in order to contribute to the subreddit. But a scum thirsty for fake internet points cropped out your hard work in 5 mins, reposted it, and get more attention/recognition than you did. Is that fair? I don't think so.
Stop crying about it lol
how do u care this much
    Says the person who replied to the post lol
        I’d argue responding to a post is less effort than making one.
Somebody find the link to the imposter post and flood it with downvotes and op give link to your og post and we’ll upvote it

                Such a great opening to a poem.

For those who haven’t read it, it’s The Second Coming by  W.B. Yeats:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
                    Thanks for that, a great piece

    Put some on the crewmate, too. Then people can’t edit out the watermark without editing out the most important part.
        Anyone with any skill can use a color picker to clear watermarks. But that requires effort and reposters don't want to put in effort.
            It took some effort to crop the watermark out of this one. The jackass who reposted it would likely do that to a post with the watermark on the crewmate
                Actually if you look at it. All they did was crop out everything but the floor and the characters. The watermarks were only on the wall and the bottom corner of the photo. This was just a simple crop job that took no effort
                    Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate
            How about making the watermarks a rainbow color (i.e. using gradients) instead?
                They would still use the color picker and brushes to remove watermarks. They use the color picker to grab the color around the watermark and paint over the wm to remove it.
                    Ouch.
            Cropping and repositioning each frame like that is ironically a huge amount more work than just selecting each watermark in photoship and selecting fill -> content aware.
        Pro tip in addition to that: Put your watermarks on "busy" parts of the picture - such as brown's outfit. This makes it much harder (i.e. more effort) to erase the watermark. If the reposter manages to get the watermark erased, that part will still look odd in comparison. 

Obviously Among Us isn't a fairly complex game in terms of erasing watermarks due to its art style but one can still try.
    Task: 5/6

Electrical: Find OP'S watermark to repost
        Nice. What's the likelihood that the reposter will notice that tasks?
    Did you know that since the maximum amount of karma you can get from a post is 5k this post earned you the same amount as his repost did him
        Whoa I actually didn’t know that! TIL. What about karma from comments? Is it the same?
            Each upvote gives less and less, so around 6k karma per post is the pretty much hard-cap. The reposter probably got like 5.8k, but by the end of this day you will probably have like 40k upvotes since it's been 3 hours and you already have 10k. By that time it should be pretty much the same.
                it's been 3 hours since your reply and it's already past 41k
    Watermarks need to be in an area of the photo critical to the content. If you put them in unnecessary areas, people crop it out. By hiding it well, and somewhere vital, removing it becomes significantly more work. It sucks that watermarking has to be done sneakily, but the posts that get successfuly stolen the least have the most well-hidden watermarks in critical areas of the image

For example, putting it in the visor of the character, with it being only a slightly different color than their visor naturally is. Or in the pattern of the flooring between characters where they'd have to do multiple crops or shop a new spot of flooring over it to get rid of it.
        Finding creative ways to hide watermarks in images is always fun.
    try being creative and put the watermark, I dont know, on the crewmates or pets, or somewhere they won't notice.
    Next time make a better title too.
    Also make him go the other direction
    The reposter is a twat for stealing content, BUT I think it's worth noticing that the cropped version is actually more direct and quicker to process cognitively. That may have been at least part of the reason why the repost got more votes. Luck/timing is always a factor but its never the only factor!

Either way, you might want to try that style more in the future: There's at least partial evidence that the mob \_prefers\_ it, vote-wise, and it would also make it harder for a reposter to crop it any further :)
    I upvoted you here and [on the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j4daqh/mini_impostor_wants_to_do_like_daddy/) since you deserve it.

But man, your original title kinda sucks and Jess' was better. Also, Gaming is a MUCH bigger sub and probably easier to get traction on. Gotta learn to play the game.

    Hey, those are my watermarks that you posted on your picture!
    redditards will still repost it. mark my words.
    stop bitching no one cares its reddit points
    I like the one you made where the minis become friends!
    You have my respect 
The same thing happened with me a few days back. Not once but twice. This shit is unbelievable
    On the other hand the one without watermarks go way more upvotes, so if you care about karma trying posting without them

Just make the meme out of watermarks
This is why gaudy luxury products made by Louis Vuitton and such are covered with logos. It's generally impossible to copyright or trademark fashion designs, so the only thing to do is slather them with trademarks.
now that’s just scummy
Weirdly the joke reads much better flipped.
    Ikr. Obviously he shouldn't have stolen it, but I actually found his version funnier. Makes sense it receive more upvotes
        I think it's because of how we normally read left to right, so it's much easier to stay fixated on the left. With the dead bodies on the right, you still check the left in case there's something there that you might miss. Also, it's much more compact, although the resolution is just terrible.

Of course, still a scummy thing to do.
        It also has a better title. But still scummy
        [deleted]
        Much better title
    Yup, his has a better angle, title, and its much better with the walls removed from second and third pic so you dont need to scroll down.
Program the bots to look for inverted image?

I know nothing of computer robots so pay no attention
    No that's definitely possible I guess, one way would be to always run a scan on both the normal image and the inverted image and return results of both
I don't think they would find it anyway due to it being cropped.
Tbh looking at the original I prefer the mirrored version lmao
Account deleted
    Goooooood....
        The fucker probably made another account and is lurking in comments here.

 Think of the work he went to remove the marks.

Hey piece of shit next time you repost just keep the watermarks and give the OP credit.
            ya but now all of the karma, recognition and awards go to no one

and it took time out of their day to make a new one
                Yeah, like cheaters evading bans
            He could be YOU, He could be ME, HE COULD EVEN BE *[fucking dies]*
                Woah woah woah!
                    It was obvious! He was the reposter! See? His account will be deleted now... any minute now... see? Wait still there.
                        So, we still have problem?
                            Alright, who’s ready to go find this reposter?
                                **Right behind you...**
                r/unexpectedtf2
                There is 1 reposter among us
            He just cropped the marks out for each image... still shitty obviously
            He could be you...
                I mean... My account is a few years old but sure, I could be the guy
                    He could be me!
                        Nah you're way too cool
                            He could even be-
                            Damn thanks, you're very cool too
            its fucking reddit upvotes who gives a shit
            /u/barcaroli is sus, self report
            Seriously, I don’t care how old this person is. Stealing other people’s shit is fucked up.
            Boo-hoo he stole a bunch of internet points . Grow the fuck up
            So much hostility because he reposted a meme lol, ridiculous
        ...Anaking, good

Kill him, kill him now
            I’m so glad you know the exact type of “good” I’m trying to portray
    I hate when impostors leave the match when they’re caught.
        What if u/ghotohr and u/jess1743 are the same person and they just used two accounts to trick everyone into ejecting an obvious fake. Now we just ejected a psuedo-imposter, and u/ghotohr is the real reposter. I just want to remind everyone that this is reddit, confirm ejects is OFF!
            I’m voting for u/sqwaabird. Feels pretty sus ngl.

    u/jess1743 was the imposter.

    *Jess1743 was the Resposter*
    We won Mr. Stark!
    Wow. What an embarrassment. 😂
Good.
Given the user name (western name followed by numbers) it was likely a farm account used for generating karma then selling to marketers, scammers, astroturfers, or whoever else needs an account with positive references.

Since /r/gaming is a cesspit of karma bots and geeks with no short term memory, it was posted there, shot up to the front page of the sub and reaped the benefits from those who never care about who originally posted the art.
No witchhunts.
I get you have good intentions but it'd be best to not link them considering Witch Hunts aren't exactly a good thing. No matter how disrespectful the individual is being through their actions.
    While typically I’d agree, there are a few reasons I believe that wouldn’t apply here.

1: if witch hunters want to find this person, they wouldn’t have to look at my comment to do it. They can simply look at the post. Now if the user was hidden and I went threw the effort into finding it than yes I would be going to far

2: the person we are tagging has deleted their account so this user no longer leads to anyone
        Very well
            Not trying to put you down or what you said, I’m just giving my opinion of it as well

Stay safe man!
                Not bothered with you at all, rather annoyed with the people giving downvotes over my earlier comment about Witch Hunts
                    Ya I don’t understand it, your simply looking out for another person. Although they did something wrong you just looking out for others, and that’s super honorable
Their account was deleted for anti trans
    r/gaming moment
        lmao
        yeah bro i make edgy jokes, *transphobia*
THE BEAST HAS BEEN SLAIN!

Edit: Above comment was something on the topic of the reporter needs to face justice, and he has been banned, thus this comment.

Edit 2: Above commenter probably got tempbanned from the sub according to the moderator pin. RIP.
    Justice
        Ya he would have not been trolled if he would have taken permissions and given credit to the OP,sad
you are a good crewmate. you're safe.
    But you're an imposter, so are they safe?
        yes


i said so
Their account has been deleted. Justice has been served.
    We did it reddit😎
        Another kid bullied 😎👍
            Another art thief served justice
            Redditors after bullying someone to deleting his account because he reposted a meme he found funny and got fake internet points 😎🙏
                Also he got rewards that people paid money for
                    Why would someone pay for awards
                        To spite people like you. 

Enjoy the Gold.
                            You literally suck
                                The best revenge is doing something nice to someone who doesnt want it
                                Thank you! I spent the last of my coins on you ;)
                    (Likely) wrong. All those awards are in the free award pool (including Silver)
                He got bullied because he removed the watermarks
    Me after bullying



Bullying someone into leaving reddit😎😎😎😳😫😫😱😱
        u/emoji_interpreter
            Translation:

Me after bullying
Bullying someone into leaving reddit a badass a badass a badass a shame suddenly suddenly rushed out

I'm not a bot and you can call me if you want to translate emojis.
                Good notbot
                Good human
        Me after doing bull
I believe it was also because they were saying some very anti trans things
Because dumb fucking retards probably sent him death threats over a fucking meme
    Justice served?
Just like in the simulations when the imposter is exposed
His account was banned for being anti-trans.
Someone once repost my meme and got 50k upvotes on r/memes n when i reposted my post it got called a repost by idiots ))):::
Wait until you see how much facebook pages profit off stolen youtube videos
I actually saw that same meme on r/memes. I just learned the one on r/memes is a repost.

I have my free award. I know it’s not much, and doesn’t give you anything besides an award, but you can have it.
So you're saying that 63k people liked your post? 

Reposts mean nothing, everything is reposted, rehashed and edited slightly to make a joke else where on other images. 

The only information you should care about is you gave some people some enjoyment for a moment. 

Stats on some random username on some bs website mean nothing. Think about it, how many sites, games and things were you involved with years ago that now no longer are around for cared about?

    I don’t get the joke pls explain
        So the op of this thread said others stole her nudes, making her a girl. Girls aren’t real.
            The real imposters
                Kinda sus.
                    self report
            Guys can share nudes.

C'mon man it's 2020
                My bad, sorry. Equality for all, no lives matter and so forth.


Amen
                    We can make a religion out of this.
                        I can hear that dude's voice
                tinder has entered the chat
            Ah, this is why I always get killeded
            We are real! I promise! 😂
    Where
        Where
            Who?
wait
Something ain’t right here
    did you see her history she as bikini pictures so she would most likely have nudes
        That sounds like a slippery slope argument.
            Did you check their actual profile because they’re deadass just someone who sells nudes.
                I was commenting on the argument, not the facts.
            It is a slippery slope. But I do post bikini pics (as do like 77% of women) and I do have nudes.
                I doubt 77% of women post bikini pictures, even if we limit it to the USA. You're probably thinking of people in your peer group. There are many people not even on social media and others who are still too modest.
            That isn't a slippery slope
                Did you see her history?

She wears t-shirts in pictures, so she would probably pose in shorts. 

If she posed in shorts, she would probably pose in a one piece swimsuit. 

If she posed in a one piece, she'd probably pose in a bikini. 

If she posed in a bikini, she'd probably pose for nudes.
What a shitty and lame way to promote your nudes.
    In fairness it was sort of creative.
        That is creative lol
        In honesty it was not, esp since she doesn’t even have nudes in her profile
            modern prostitutes smh
                I don’t think she’s a prostitute mate...
    Respect the hustle
    In a sub where probably a lot of young kids exist, only a shitty person would do such a thing.
        Because everyone knows kids don't find out about nude pictures on the Internet until their 18th birthday.
    Imagine if a guy did this, advertise his nudes on a subreddit filled with minors.
    [deleted]
        You could've just said "posting my pictures" instead of "posting my nudes" but whatever
            [deleted]
                didn't think of it while you advertise on a popular post on a subreddit getting tons of traffic right now and with your line of work you know exactly what you're doing. just dont lie lmao.
                    I have literally gotten a total of 0 new orders since I commented that. Not even joking. Cuz no one looks at a comment like that and thinks “Hmm. Maybe I should buy her nudes cuz that’s obviously why she complained about having her nudes leaked.”
[deleted]
    About as subtle as a brick to the face.
Wait
Funny how you apparently aged 2 years over the span of 8 days.
    Yeah in one she’s 21 in another 19, in one a huge chest in another flat.

        Just go away already
        Lol if you say so
            [deleted]
                I think you're overestimating just how much I actually care about this particular issue
                    I mean, if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have commented in the first place. So I’m sure you care to some degree.
                        I initially cared because I read someone else say that you were a titty poster, but was disappointed to discover that you just post softcore/face cropped content which was around the time I stopped caring. Since we're being pedantic here 😂
                            Ah. I see. Well, given that you don’t care anymore, can I count on you to not reply to this thread anymore? Or...?
                                Sure, consider this my last reply. As some friendly parting advice, if you don't want someone replying to you then don't keep probing them for responses.
Wow that's crazy. I don't remember anyone asking though.
\-. \_-.
So have I!  And I'm not even a girl!
Holy shit you weren't lying
What!? That’s horrible! Where did they post these photos so I know to never go there!
This is how attentionwhoring works, make something about you and mention your nudes.

Sadder is all the idiots giving you upvotes.

EDIT:  
Thank God your comment got removed, imagine finding that stuff in a forum about gaming like... woman who the fuck asked? it was textbook attention-whoring and advertising because you made it about yourself and implied your sex service selling in an environment that has absolutely nothing to do with you mentioning nudes.

Also this an "all ages" game, kids of both genders as young as maybe 12 tend to come here for advice and I highly doubt they need to see your comment about your nudes and your selling sexual services. Keep that shit to yourself next time.
    [deleted]
        It is attention whoring but Honestly I did get a few good long wanks to ur pictures tonight so there’s that
    This isn't attention whoring. Someone is entitled to their nudes. It's their body, they have a right to be pissed about asshats stealing the credit. This comment fits perfectly in this thread's discussion.
Everybody, please downvote and report the comment I'm replying to for spam to help stop irrelevant promos and bots from infesting reddit! Thank you!
    [deleted]
    [deleted]
You weren’t kidding huh
What a shitty thing to do, advertising your nudes in a sub where probably a lot of young kids exist.

Downvotes? Really, imagine if a guy advertises his nudes on here, a place where it’s filled with minors, y’all upvoting her comment are pieces of shits.
    [deleted]
        Right...
this some clever marketing
    Not trying to market. Was just sharing that I hate when people steal your content. And that I’ve been a victim thrice now.
ಠ_ಠ
So are you 19 or 21?
    I’m 21!
        Why’d you lie about your age?
    He’s a 50 year old man posting images of young girls.
Maybe they’d think he reposted it
    Anyone with a brain that checks the date of posting would quickly discover who the reposter is
        Not everyone is big brain especially on reddit where the average time spent on a post is 5 seconds
            That ain’t anything new round here either unfortunately
                Sadly
    Rarely if anyone checks the usernames.
plus he had a more eyecatching title
    plus he had better cropping (still uncool to not include watermark somewhere though ofc)
as well*

It's not one word.

    aswell isn't a word in English

Damn That Harsh
Why do mods appear to have a bad reputation, are they emulating US cops?
They still have a profile?
i want to downdoot too
    I don’t wanna sound mean but witch hunting over a post is cringe as fuck
        Over fake internet points, too. I didn’t even look at the content. I just like to come in and see all the SJW trying to give some “credit.”  I almost get it when it’s an artist but a meme ? Settle down kids
            Did you have to make it political


Edit: wrong comment I replied to sorry and yeah I agree

        {Deleted}
I hate these fucking posts "BlLeEh He StOlE mY kArMa It WaS mInE!1!1!" This just makes me want to downvote the original. Why do you even care about upvotes?
Tbh whoever made the edit did an excellent job. I even think that something about the blurriness of it adds to the tone. Makes it feel like there is weight to it, instead of just panel snapshots.
Eh I don’t really get it much either. But like let’s say you worked on something it got let’s say 1k upvotes than someone reposts it and gets 50k upvotes. You would be feeling kinda sad too. It’s kinda like my work isn’t good but there’s is perfect. It’s like two students giving a teacher the same quiz with the same answers but one of them copies and they get 100 and you get a 70. That’s what I think anyway. I’ve had my work copied before and it just makes you think that there’s something wrong with you. Like we post the same thing and it was made by me but it’s worse than their’s. It just kinda stings.
    Oh ok I can see that. I feel bad that there’s a righteous mob over it though I can only imagine the shitty DM’s they got. Like it kinda sucks but I can’t say I feel ready to grab a pitchfork over it
        I once posted something i found on 9gag to reddit and it got to hot but then i started getting hateful DMs claiming i stole some one else's post. Feels bad, those DMs didn't even tell me whole post i stole they just kept insulting me in Dms and comments.

Judging by the mob in his post created no surprise the accused deleted the account.
 its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
Stole the picture, went back in time, put a water mark on it, and post it, and then came back to the present and made this post. It's only been 10 minutes for OP.
The fact that people like you and others who harass him for stealing a FUCKING MEME BOGGLES ME ITS INTERNET POINTS YOU DELUSIONAL PIGS
    I've seen this argument a lot, it's never about the internet points, literally no one cares. It's about seeing your content get recognition and all the people like it and comment funny stuff. Stealing all that from someone and take credit is a pretty shitty thing to do. Like for real it's not a hard concept to understand
        This guy gets it.
        Im talking about the people who harras the person. ive seen death threats happen too a guy cuz he cropped out a watermark and placed it as its own. r/AmongUs is literrly the most cancerous subreddit ever sience it became popular.
            Then leave the subreddit. Easy as that.
                you completely ignore the fact that people send death threats too that man
                    I do t send death threats, those people are idiots

Stop harassing him, it’s internet points. Chill the fuck out.
    Fuck you loser.
        Who’s the loser? The people getting upset over internet points? Or the one telling them to chill it’s not a big deal?
            Both are, you are included for not seeing it too
            Oh, I see you approve of plagiarism. Loser.
                No I don’t, in a professional manner, but this is the internet and a gaming subreddit where this stuff happens all the time, so why lose your tempers over it? Jesus...
                    god i don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. this is all immature as hell
                        im not sure if i wanna be on this site anymore after going through this comment section

                                Dont compare a photo that took 20 minutes *max* to create with theft.

It might feel bad when your oh so fuckin important reddit karma gets " Stolen ", But it doesn't compare with theft in any realm.
        For internet points. Harassing someone over internet points. Reddit moment.
            Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be. 
But no really imagine having YOUR content stolen, and posted elsewhere without giving any credit.
                It’s the internet man chill out. The internet. Does it really matter? Fucking internet points. Think about it.



If someone used “your” idea irl (ideas are not intellectual property) would you go harass the person who did it?
                    Yes
                        You’re fucked up. Go get some mental help.
Dude this isnt r/jacksepticeye tf you talking about
This sub does not exist and I will not be responsible for making it.
    Fucking chad
I hope op feels better about his fake internet points
    its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
No one cares about your comment about an among us meme being stolen on a sub about among us what no one actually cares about is people like you that say anything digital is useless and if it isnt real money its fucking nothing you antique gardening tool
    We demand to be taken seriously
        No one takes you seriously
            - guy who wrote a paragraph about how important reddit karma is
                You can't even read properly you support stealing dumbass
                    Stealing reddit memes that took 10 minutes to make oh no
                        Yea that's the point there is no point in doing it they just want to watch the world burn that just makes them more hateble
                            How embarrassing
                                You just dont get reddit
    But he didnt say "anything digital is useless". Why are you making stuff up to get a point across.... ooh wait.
        Someone is calling out a reposter and this guy is like it's just internet point dude it doesn't matter I think that point is clear
            You really do like to make stuff up dont ya
                You really dont see it dont ya
                    You really dont see it. Reddit karma is useless, nobody cares. Have you ever heard somebody in real life being proud of his reddit karma? Its a useless metric. Especially with all the bot karma farming accounts being sold. You on the other hand are making up bullshit narratives to support your own fantasy. "Anything digital is useless"
"If it isnt real money its nothing"

Nobody said anything of that. 

You only made that up to drive your own point across, because without all the false bs, it falls flat on its nose
Honestly, I'm not sure what's worse: the guy who wasted time putting watermarks in this, or the guy who wasted time removing it.
Same. I don't watermark aswell
the problem is that, it's basically stealing somebodies work.

is "your fake points are still pointless" supposed to be a pun?
So why bother stealing your point doesnt make sence
    Your comments don’t make sense. Try speaking correctly first, then trolling after you can type a correct sentence.
        I'm saying that if stealing is meaningless why steal and why do you say that nothing matters if it isnt monetary gain
            Like I said, welcome to the internet. Good luck in your utopia where you think it doesn’t exist kid. You are in for a rude awakening soon
                You didnt understand what I said
 its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen

And they stole someone's meme for fake internet points what's your point
Oh yeah, because the reposter totally didn't go the extra mile to remove the watermarks and mirror the image so repost bots can't find it...
    Who really cares except you and the OP? They're fake internet points, the meme is using IP that isn't the OP's, there are about 100 more reasons why credit isn't necessary.
Imagine you do a painting the best in the world and you show it to the world and before anyone can see it someone steals it and says he drew it and got praised while you sit their with nothing
    its just a meme bruh
    making an among us meme is not the mona lisa it’s really not that serious
        It's still stealing
You spent hours to do a quality, original post in order to contribute to the subreddit. But a scum thirsty for fake internet points cropped out your hard work in 5 mins, reposted it, and get more attention/recognition than you did. Is that fair? I don't think so.
Says the person who replied to the post lol
    I’d argue responding to a post is less effort than making one.
The ground is sucking me into watermarks
    It will all become u/Ghotohr
        The center cannot hold!
            Such a great opening to a poem.

For those who haven’t read it, it’s The Second Coming by  W.B. Yeats:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
                Thanks for that, a great piece
        Wait, it’s all u/Ghotohr
            Always has been
                🔫👨‍🔫👨‍ *BAM*
                    Sorry sir I was high
        Make all of the colours just u/Ghotor so it’s just loads of grey letters for the background

Put some on the crewmate, too. Then people can’t edit out the watermark without editing out the most important part.
    Anyone with any skill can use a color picker to clear watermarks. But that requires effort and reposters don't want to put in effort.
        It took some effort to crop the watermark out of this one. The jackass who reposted it would likely do that to a post with the watermark on the crewmate
            Actually if you look at it. All they did was crop out everything but the floor and the characters. The watermarks were only on the wall and the bottom corner of the photo. This was just a simple crop job that took no effort
                Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate
        How about making the watermarks a rainbow color (i.e. using gradients) instead?
            They would still use the color picker and brushes to remove watermarks. They use the color picker to grab the color around the watermark and paint over the wm to remove it.
                Ouch.
        Cropping and repositioning each frame like that is ironically a huge amount more work than just selecting each watermark in photoship and selecting fill -> content aware.
    Pro tip in addition to that: Put your watermarks on "busy" parts of the picture - such as brown's outfit. This makes it much harder (i.e. more effort) to erase the watermark. If the reposter manages to get the watermark erased, that part will still look odd in comparison. 

Obviously Among Us isn't a fairly complex game in terms of erasing watermarks due to its art style but one can still try.
Task: 5/6

Electrical: Find OP'S watermark to repost
    Nice. What's the likelihood that the reposter will notice that tasks?
Did you know that since the maximum amount of karma you can get from a post is 5k this post earned you the same amount as his repost did him
    Whoa I actually didn’t know that! TIL. What about karma from comments? Is it the same?
        Each upvote gives less and less, so around 6k karma per post is the pretty much hard-cap. The reposter probably got like 5.8k, but by the end of this day you will probably have like 40k upvotes since it's been 3 hours and you already have 10k. By that time it should be pretty much the same.
            it's been 3 hours since your reply and it's already past 41k
Watermarks need to be in an area of the photo critical to the content. If you put them in unnecessary areas, people crop it out. By hiding it well, and somewhere vital, removing it becomes significantly more work. It sucks that watermarking has to be done sneakily, but the posts that get successfuly stolen the least have the most well-hidden watermarks in critical areas of the image

For example, putting it in the visor of the character, with it being only a slightly different color than their visor naturally is. Or in the pattern of the flooring between characters where they'd have to do multiple crops or shop a new spot of flooring over it to get rid of it.
    Finding creative ways to hide watermarks in images is always fun.
try being creative and put the watermark, I dont know, on the crewmates or pets, or somewhere they won't notice.
Next time make a better title too.
Also make him go the other direction
The reposter is a twat for stealing content, BUT I think it's worth noticing that the cropped version is actually more direct and quicker to process cognitively. That may have been at least part of the reason why the repost got more votes. Luck/timing is always a factor but its never the only factor!

Either way, you might want to try that style more in the future: There's at least partial evidence that the mob \_prefers\_ it, vote-wise, and it would also make it harder for a reposter to crop it any further :)
I upvoted you here and [on the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/j4daqh/mini_impostor_wants_to_do_like_daddy/) since you deserve it.

But man, your original title kinda sucks and Jess' was better. Also, Gaming is a MUCH bigger sub and probably easier to get traction on. Gotta learn to play the game.
S T O C K P H O T O
Hey, those are my watermarks that you posted on your picture!
redditards will still repost it. mark my words.
stop bitching no one cares its reddit points
I like the one you made where the minis become friends!
You have my respect 
The same thing happened with me a few days back. Not once but twice. This shit is unbelievable
On the other hand the one without watermarks go way more upvotes, so if you care about karma trying posting without them
Do u cry when someone steals ur worthless memes and karma?
Don't go overboard with it unless you spend like hours on it or it will make you look arrogant I learn that the hard way
Ikr. Obviously he shouldn't have stolen it, but I actually found his version funnier. Makes sense it receive more upvotes
    I think it's because of how we normally read left to right, so it's much easier to stay fixated on the left. With the dead bodies on the right, you still check the left in case there's something there that you might miss. Also, it's much more compact, although the resolution is just terrible.

Of course, still a scummy thing to do.
    It also has a better title. But still scummy
    [deleted]
    Much better title
Yup, his has a better angle, title, and its much better with the walls removed from second and third pic so you dont need to scroll down.
No that's definitely possible I guess, one way would be to always run a scan on both the normal image and the inverted image and return results of both
Goooooood....
    The fucker probably made another account and is lurking in comments here.

 Think of the work he went to remove the marks.

Hey piece of shit next time you repost just keep the watermarks and give the OP credit.
        ya but now all of the karma, recognition and awards go to no one

and it took time out of their day to make a new one
            Yeah, like cheaters evading bans
        He could be YOU, He could be ME, HE COULD EVEN BE *[fucking dies]*
            Woah woah woah!
                It was obvious! He was the reposter! See? His account will be deleted now... any minute now... see? Wait still there.
                    So, we still have problem?
                        Alright, who’s ready to go find this reposter?
                            **Right behind you...**
            r/unexpectedtf2
            There is 1 reposter among us
        He just cropped the marks out for each image... still shitty obviously
        He could be you...
            I mean... My account is a few years old but sure, I could be the guy
                He could be me!
                    Nah you're way too cool
                        He could even be-
                        Damn thanks, you're very cool too
        its fucking reddit upvotes who gives a shit
        /u/barcaroli is sus, self report
        Seriously, I don’t care how old this person is. Stealing other people’s shit is fucked up.
        Boo-hoo he stole a bunch of internet points . Grow the fuck up
        So much hostility because he reposted a meme lol, ridiculous
    ...Anaking, good

Kill him, kill him now
        I’m so glad you know the exact type of “good” I’m trying to portray
I hate when impostors leave the match when they’re caught.
    What if u/ghotohr and u/jess1743 are the same person and they just used two accounts to trick everyone into ejecting an obvious fake. Now we just ejected a psuedo-imposter, and u/ghotohr is the real reposter. I just want to remind everyone that this is reddit, confirm ejects is OFF!

We won Mr. Stark!
Wow. What an embarrassment. 😂
While typically I’d agree, there are a few reasons I believe that wouldn’t apply here.

1: if witch hunters want to find this person, they wouldn’t have to look at my comment to do it. They can simply look at the post. Now if the user was hidden and I went threw the effort into finding it than yes I would be going to far

2: the person we are tagging has deleted their account so this user no longer leads to anyone
    Very well
        Not trying to put you down or what you said, I’m just giving my opinion of it as well

Stay safe man!
            Not bothered with you at all, rather annoyed with the people giving downvotes over my earlier comment about Witch Hunts
                Ya I don’t understand it, your simply looking out for another person. Although they did something wrong you just looking out for others, and that’s super honorable

            Also he got rewards that people paid money for
                Why would someone pay for awards
                    To spite people like you. 

Enjoy the Gold.

                (Likely) wrong. All those awards are in the free award pool (including Silver)
            He got bullied because he removed the watermarks

    So the op of this thread said others stole her nudes, making her a girl. Girls aren’t real.
        The real imposters
            Kinda sus.
                self report
        Guys can share nudes.

C'mon man it's 2020
            My bad, sorry. Equality for all, no lives matter and so forth.


Amen
                We can make a religion out of this.
                    I can hear that dude's voice
            tinder has entered the chat
        Ah, this is why I always get killeded
        We are real! I promise! 😂
Where
    Where
        Who?
did you see her history she as bikini pictures so she would most likely have nudes
    That sounds like a slippery slope argument.
        Did you check their actual profile because they’re deadass just someone who sells nudes.
            I was commenting on the argument, not the facts.
        It is a slippery slope. But I do post bikini pics (as do like 77% of women) and I do have nudes.
            I doubt 77% of women post bikini pictures, even if we limit it to the USA. You're probably thinking of people in your peer group. There are many people not even on social media and others who are still too modest.
        That isn't a slippery slope
            Did you see her history?

She wears t-shirts in pictures, so she would probably pose in shorts. 

If she posed in shorts, she would probably pose in a one piece swimsuit. 

If she posed in a one piece, she'd probably pose in a bikini. 

If she posed in a bikini, she'd probably pose for nudes.
In fairness it was sort of creative.
    That is creative lol
    In honesty it was not, esp since she doesn’t even have nudes in her profile
        modern prostitutes smh
            I don’t think she’s a prostitute mate...
Respect the hustle
In a sub where probably a lot of young kids exist, only a shitty person would do such a thing.
    Because everyone knows kids don't find out about nude pictures on the Internet until their 18th birthday.
Imagine if a guy did this, advertise his nudes on a subreddit filled with minors.
[deleted]
    You could've just said "posting my pictures" instead of "posting my nudes" but whatever

            didn't think of it while you advertise on a popular post on a subreddit getting tons of traffic right now and with your line of work you know exactly what you're doing. just dont lie lmao.
                I have literally gotten a total of 0 new orders since I commented that. Not even joking. Cuz no one looks at a comment like that and thinks “Hmm. Maybe I should buy her nudes cuz that’s obviously why she complained about having her nudes leaked.”
About as subtle as a brick to the face.
Yeah in one she’s 21 in another 19, in one a huge chest in another flat.

            I think you're overestimating just how much I actually care about this particular issue
                I mean, if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have commented in the first place. So I’m sure you care to some degree.
                    I initially cared because I read someone else say that you were a titty poster, but was disappointed to discover that you just post softcore/face cropped content which was around the time I stopped caring. Since we're being pedantic here 😂
                        Ah. I see. Well, given that you don’t care anymore, can I count on you to not reply to this thread anymore? Or...?
                            Sure, consider this my last reply. As some friendly parting advice, if you don't want someone replying to you then don't keep probing them for responses.
[deleted]
    It is attention whoring but Honestly I did get a few good long wanks to ur pictures tonight so there’s that
This isn't attention whoring. Someone is entitled to their nudes. It's their body, they have a right to be pissed about asshats stealing the credit. This comment fits perfectly in this thread's discussion.

    Right...
Not trying to market. Was just sharing that I hate when people steal your content. And that I’ve been a victim thrice now.
I’m 21!
    Why’d you lie about your age?
He’s a 50 year old man posting images of young girls.
Anyone with a brain that checks the date of posting would quickly discover who the reposter is
    Not everyone is big brain especially on reddit where the average time spent on a post is 5 seconds
        That ain’t anything new round here either unfortunately
            Sadly
Rarely if anyone checks the usernames.
plus he had better cropping (still uncool to not include watermark somewhere though ofc)
I don’t wanna sound mean but witch hunting over a post is cringe as fuck
    Over fake internet points, too. I didn’t even look at the content. I just like to come in and see all the SJW trying to give some “credit.”  I almost get it when it’s an artist but a meme ? Settle down kids
        Did you have to make it political


Edit: wrong comment I replied to sorry and yeah I agree

Oh ok I can see that. I feel bad that there’s a righteous mob over it though I can only imagine the shitty DM’s they got. Like it kinda sucks but I can’t say I feel ready to grab a pitchfork over it
    I once posted something i found on 9gag to reddit and it got to hot but then i started getting hateful DMs claiming i stole some one else's post. Feels bad, those DMs didn't even tell me whole post i stole they just kept insulting me in Dms and comments.

Judging by the mob in his post created no surprise the accused deleted the account.
I've seen this argument a lot, it's never about the internet points, literally no one cares. It's about seeing your content get recognition and all the people like it and comment funny stuff. Stealing all that from someone and take credit is a pretty shitty thing to do. Like for real it's not a hard concept to understand
    This guy gets it.
    Im talking about the people who harras the person. ive seen death threats happen too a guy cuz he cropped out a watermark and placed it as its own. r/AmongUs is literrly the most cancerous subreddit ever sience it became popular.
        Then leave the subreddit. Easy as that.
            you completely ignore the fact that people send death threats too that man
                I do t send death threats, those people are idiots

                            Dont compare a photo that took 20 minutes *max* to create with theft.

It might feel bad when your oh so fuckin important reddit karma gets " Stolen ", But it doesn't compare with theft in any realm.
    For internet points. Harassing someone over internet points. Reddit moment.
        Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be. 
But no really imagine having YOUR content stolen, and posted elsewhere without giving any credit.
            It’s the internet man chill out. The internet. Does it really matter? Fucking internet points. Think about it.



If someone used “your” idea irl (ideas are not intellectual property) would you go harass the person who did it?
                Yes
                    You’re fucked up. Go get some mental help.
Fucking chad
its not about the karma, its about the content that has been stolen. it doesnt matter if it took 10 minutes or 3 hours to make, its still someones content that got stolen and the reposter got credit and awards and upvotes and all that shit over it. nobody gives a shit about the karma, its just the content that got stolen
We demand to be taken seriously
    No one takes you seriously
        - guy who wrote a paragraph about how important reddit karma is
            You can't even read properly you support stealing dumbass
                Stealing reddit memes that took 10 minutes to make oh no
                    Yea that's the point there is no point in doing it they just want to watch the world burn that just makes them more hateble
                        How embarrassing
                            You just dont get reddit
But he didnt say "anything digital is useless". Why are you making stuff up to get a point across.... ooh wait.
    Someone is calling out a reposter and this guy is like it's just internet point dude it doesn't matter I think that point is clear
        You really do like to make stuff up dont ya
            You really dont see it dont ya
                You really dont see it. Reddit karma is useless, nobody cares. Have you ever heard somebody in real life being proud of his reddit karma? Its a useless metric. Especially with all the bot karma farming accounts being sold. You on the other hand are making up bullshit narratives to support your own fantasy. "Anything digital is useless"
"If it isnt real money its nothing"

Nobody said anything of that. 

You only made that up to drive your own point across, because without all the false bs, it falls flat on its nose
Your comments don’t make sense. Try speaking correctly first, then trolling after you can type a correct sentence.
    I'm saying that if stealing is meaningless why steal and why do you say that nothing matters if it isnt monetary gain
        Like I said, welcome to the internet. Good luck in your utopia where you think it doesn’t exist kid. You are in for a rude awakening soon
            You didnt understand what I said
Who really cares except you and the OP? They're fake internet points, the meme is using IP that isn't the OP's, there are about 100 more reasons why credit isn't necessary.
its just a meme bruh
making an among us meme is not the mona lisa it’s really not that serious
    It's still stealing
I’d argue responding to a post is less effort than making one.
It will all become u/Ghotohr

Anyone with any skill can use a color picker to clear watermarks. But that requires effort and reposters don't want to put in effort.
    It took some effort to crop the watermark out of this one. The jackass who reposted it would likely do that to a post with the watermark on the crewmate
        Actually if you look at it. All they did was crop out everything but the floor and the characters. The watermarks were only on the wall and the bottom corner of the photo. This was just a simple crop job that took no effort
            Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate
    How about making the watermarks a rainbow color (i.e. using gradients) instead?
        They would still use the color picker and brushes to remove watermarks. They use the color picker to grab the color around the watermark and paint over the wm to remove it.
            Ouch.
    Cropping and repositioning each frame like that is ironically a huge amount more work than just selecting each watermark in photoship and selecting fill -> content aware.
Pro tip in addition to that: Put your watermarks on "busy" parts of the picture - such as brown's outfit. This makes it much harder (i.e. more effort) to erase the watermark. If the reposter manages to get the watermark erased, that part will still look odd in comparison. 

Obviously Among Us isn't a fairly complex game in terms of erasing watermarks due to its art style but one can still try.
Nice. What's the likelihood that the reposter will notice that tasks?
Whoa I actually didn’t know that! TIL. What about karma from comments? Is it the same?
    Each upvote gives less and less, so around 6k karma per post is the pretty much hard-cap. The reposter probably got like 5.8k, but by the end of this day you will probably have like 40k upvotes since it's been 3 hours and you already have 10k. By that time it should be pretty much the same.
        it's been 3 hours since your reply and it's already past 41k
Finding creative ways to hide watermarks in images is always fun.
I think it's because of how we normally read left to right, so it's much easier to stay fixated on the left. With the dead bodies on the right, you still check the left in case there's something there that you might miss. Also, it's much more compact, although the resolution is just terrible.

Of course, still a scummy thing to do.
It also has a better title. But still scummy
[deleted]
Much better title
The fucker probably made another account and is lurking in comments here.

 Think of the work he went to remove the marks.

Hey piece of shit next time you repost just keep the watermarks and give the OP credit.
    ya but now all of the karma, recognition and awards go to no one

and it took time out of their day to make a new one
        Yeah, like cheaters evading bans
    He could be YOU, He could be ME, HE COULD EVEN BE *[fucking dies]*
        Woah woah woah!
            It was obvious! He was the reposter! See? His account will be deleted now... any minute now... see? Wait still there.
                So, we still have problem?
                    Alright, who’s ready to go find this reposter?
                        **Right behind you...**
        r/unexpectedtf2
        There is 1 reposter among us
    He just cropped the marks out for each image... still shitty obviously
    He could be you...
        I mean... My account is a few years old but sure, I could be the guy
            He could be me!
                Nah you're way too cool
                    He could even be-
                    Damn thanks, you're very cool too
    its fucking reddit upvotes who gives a shit
    /u/barcaroli is sus, self report
    Seriously, I don’t care how old this person is. Stealing other people’s shit is fucked up.
    Boo-hoo he stole a bunch of internet points . Grow the fuck up
    So much hostility because he reposted a meme lol, ridiculous
...Anaking, good

Kill him, kill him now
    I’m so glad you know the exact type of “good” I’m trying to portray
What if u/ghotohr and u/jess1743 are the same person and they just used two accounts to trick everyone into ejecting an obvious fake. Now we just ejected a psuedo-imposter, and u/ghotohr is the real reposter. I just want to remind everyone that this is reddit, confirm ejects is OFF!

Stay safe man!
        Not bothered with you at all, rather annoyed with the people giving downvotes over my earlier comment about Witch Hunts
            Ya I don’t understand it, your simply looking out for another person. Although they did something wrong you just looking out for others, and that’s super honorable
lmao
yeah bro i make edgy jokes, *transphobia*
Ya he would have not been trolled if he would have taken permissions and given credit to the OP,sad
yes


i said so
Another kid bullied 😎👍
    Another art thief served justice
    Redditors after bullying someone to deleting his account because he reposted a meme he found funny and got fake internet points 😎🙏
        Also he got rewards that people paid money for
            Why would someone pay for awards
                To spite people like you. 

Enjoy the Gold.
                    You literally suck
                        The best revenge is doing something nice to someone who doesnt want it
                        Thank you! I spent the last of my coins on you ;)
            (Likely) wrong. All those awards are in the free award pool (including Silver)
        He got bullied because he removed the watermarks

So the op of this thread said others stole her nudes, making her a girl. Girls aren’t real.
    The real imposters
        Kinda sus.
            self report
    Guys can share nudes.

C'mon man it's 2020
        My bad, sorry. Equality for all, no lives matter and so forth.


Amen
            We can make a religion out of this.
                I can hear that dude's voice
        tinder has entered the chat
    Ah, this is why I always get killeded
    We are real! I promise! 😂
Where
    Who?
That sounds like a slippery slope argument.
    Did you check their actual profile because they’re deadass just someone who sells nudes.
        I was commenting on the argument, not the facts.
    It is a slippery slope. But I do post bikini pics (as do like 77% of women) and I do have nudes.
        I doubt 77% of women post bikini pictures, even if we limit it to the USA. You're probably thinking of people in your peer group. There are many people not even on social media and others who are still too modest.
    That isn't a slippery slope
        Did you see her history?

She wears t-shirts in pictures, so she would probably pose in shorts. 

If she posed in shorts, she would probably pose in a one piece swimsuit. 

If she posed in a one piece, she'd probably pose in a bikini. 

If she posed in a bikini, she'd probably pose for nudes.
That is creative lol
In honesty it was not, esp since she doesn’t even have nudes in her profile
    modern prostitutes smh
        I don’t think she’s a prostitute mate...
Because everyone knows kids don't find out about nude pictures on the Internet until their 18th birthday.
You could've just said "posting my pictures" instead of "posting my nudes" but whatever
    [deleted]
        didn't think of it while you advertise on a popular post on a subreddit getting tons of traffic right now and with your line of work you know exactly what you're doing. just dont lie lmao.
            I have literally gotten a total of 0 new orders since I commented that. Not even joking. Cuz no one looks at a comment like that and thinks “Hmm. Maybe I should buy her nudes cuz that’s obviously why she complained about having her nudes leaked.”
Just go away already
Lol if you say so
    [deleted]
        I think you're overestimating just how much I actually care about this particular issue
            I mean, if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have commented in the first place. So I’m sure you care to some degree.
                I initially cared because I read someone else say that you were a titty poster, but was disappointed to discover that you just post softcore/face cropped content which was around the time I stopped caring. Since we're being pedantic here 😂
                    Ah. I see. Well, given that you don’t care anymore, can I count on you to not reply to this thread anymore? Or...?
                        Sure, consider this my last reply. As some friendly parting advice, if you don't want someone replying to you then don't keep probing them for responses.
It is attention whoring but Honestly I did get a few good long wanks to ur pictures tonight so there’s that
Right...
Why’d you lie about your age?
Not everyone is big brain especially on reddit where the average time spent on a post is 5 seconds
    That ain’t anything new round here either unfortunately
        Sadly
Over fake internet points, too. I didn’t even look at the content. I just like to come in and see all the SJW trying to give some “credit.”  I almost get it when it’s an artist but a meme ? Settle down kids
    Did you have to make it political


Edit: wrong comment I replied to sorry and yeah I agree
{Deleted}
I once posted something i found on 9gag to reddit and it got to hot but then i started getting hateful DMs claiming i stole some one else's post. Feels bad, those DMs didn't even tell me whole post i stole they just kept insulting me in Dms and comments.

Judging by the mob in his post created no surprise the accused deleted the account.
This guy gets it.
Im talking about the people who harras the person. ive seen death threats happen too a guy cuz he cropped out a watermark and placed it as its own. r/AmongUs is literrly the most cancerous subreddit ever sience it became popular.
    Then leave the subreddit. Easy as that.
        you completely ignore the fact that people send death threats too that man
            I do t send death threats, those people are idiots
[deleted]
    Just reported your bitchass. Hope you get banned. Do you not hear yourself? Are you that pathetic and sad you would tell someone to kill themself over a fucking meme?? Get over it kid lol. What a dumbass.
        Reported you for abusing report button. Didn't even know that was a thing lmao
            HE JUST TOLD THE DUDE TO GO FUCKING HARASS ME WTF HOW IS THAT ABUSE OF THE RPEORT BUTTON?
        [deleted]
            YOU JUST TOLD HIM TOO "FEEL FREE TO HARASS HIM" WTF HOW IS THAT NOT HARASSING YOU DUMB BITCH
See this is what i mean. Ok u/furrypopcornporn
Who’s the loser? The people getting upset over internet points? Or the one telling them to chill it’s not a big deal?
    Both are, you are included for not seeing it too
    Oh, I see you approve of plagiarism. Loser.
        No I don’t, in a professional manner, but this is the internet and a gaming subreddit where this stuff happens all the time, so why lose your tempers over it? Jesus...
            god i don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. this is all immature as hell
                im not sure if i wanna be on this site anymore after going through this comment section
                    [deleted]
                        Dont compare a photo that took 20 minutes *max* to create with theft.

It might feel bad when your oh so fuckin important reddit karma gets " Stolen ", But it doesn't compare with theft in any realm.
For internet points. Harassing someone over internet points. Reddit moment.
    Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be. 
But no really imagine having YOUR content stolen, and posted elsewhere without giving any credit.
        It’s the internet man chill out. The internet. Does it really matter? Fucking internet points. Think about it.



If someone used “your” idea irl (ideas are not intellectual property) would you go harass the person who did it?
            Yes
                You’re fucked up. Go get some mental help.
No one takes you seriously
    - guy who wrote a paragraph about how important reddit karma is
        You can't even read properly you support stealing dumbass
            Stealing reddit memes that took 10 minutes to make oh no
                Yea that's the point there is no point in doing it they just want to watch the world burn that just makes them more hateble
                    How embarrassing
                        You just dont get reddit
Someone is calling out a reposter and this guy is like it's just internet point dude it doesn't matter I think that point is clear
    You really do like to make stuff up dont ya
        You really dont see it dont ya
            You really dont see it. Reddit karma is useless, nobody cares. Have you ever heard somebody in real life being proud of his reddit karma? Its a useless metric. Especially with all the bot karma farming accounts being sold. You on the other hand are making up bullshit narratives to support your own fantasy. "Anything digital is useless"
"If it isnt real money its nothing"

Nobody said anything of that. 

You only made that up to drive your own point across, because without all the false bs, it falls flat on its nose
I'm saying that if stealing is meaningless why steal and why do you say that nothing matters if it isnt monetary gain
    Like I said, welcome to the internet. Good luck in your utopia where you think it doesn’t exist kid. You are in for a rude awakening soon
        You didnt understand what I said
It's still stealing
The center cannot hold!
    Such a great opening to a poem.

For those who haven’t read it, it’s The Second Coming by  W.B. Yeats:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
        Thanks for that, a great piece
Wait, it’s all u/Ghotohr

            Sorry sir I was high
Make all of the colours just u/Ghotor so it’s just loads of grey letters for the background
It took some effort to crop the watermark out of this one. The jackass who reposted it would likely do that to a post with the watermark on the crewmate
    Actually if you look at it. All they did was crop out everything but the floor and the characters. The watermarks were only on the wall and the bottom corner of the photo. This was just a simple crop job that took no effort
        Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate

Not bothered with you at all, rather annoyed with the people giving downvotes over my earlier comment about Witch Hunts
    Ya I don’t understand it, your simply looking out for another person. Although they did something wrong you just looking out for others, and that’s super honorable
Also he got rewards that people paid money for
    Why would someone pay for awards
        To spite people like you. 

Enjoy the Gold.
            You literally suck
                The best revenge is doing something nice to someone who doesnt want it
                Thank you! I spent the last of my coins on you ;)
    (Likely) wrong. All those awards are in the free award pool (including Silver)
He got bullied because he removed the watermarks
Good notbot
Good human
Kinda sus.
    self report
My bad, sorry. Equality for all, no lives matter and so forth.


Amen
    We can make a religion out of this.
        I can hear that dude's voice
tinder has entered the chat
I was commenting on the argument, not the facts.
I doubt 77% of women post bikini pictures, even if we limit it to the USA. You're probably thinking of people in your peer group. There are many people not even on social media and others who are still too modest.
Did you see her history?

She wears t-shirts in pictures, so she would probably pose in shorts. 

If she posed in shorts, she would probably pose in a one piece swimsuit. 

If she posed in a one piece, she'd probably pose in a bikini. 

If she posed in a bikini, she'd probably pose for nudes.
I don’t think she’s a prostitute mate...
didn't think of it while you advertise on a popular post on a subreddit getting tons of traffic right now and with your line of work you know exactly what you're doing. just dont lie lmao.
    I have literally gotten a total of 0 new orders since I commented that. Not even joking. Cuz no one looks at a comment like that and thinks “Hmm. Maybe I should buy her nudes cuz that’s obviously why she complained about having her nudes leaked.”
I think you're overestimating just how much I actually care about this particular issue
    I mean, if you didn’t care, you wouldn’t have commented in the first place. So I’m sure you care to some degree.
        I initially cared because I read someone else say that you were a titty poster, but was disappointed to discover that you just post softcore/face cropped content which was around the time I stopped caring. Since we're being pedantic here 😂
            Ah. I see. Well, given that you don’t care anymore, can I count on you to not reply to this thread anymore? Or...?
                Sure, consider this my last reply. As some friendly parting advice, if you don't want someone replying to you then don't keep probing them for responses.
Sadly
you completely ignore the fact that people send death threats too that man
    I do t send death threats, those people are idiots
Reported you for abusing report button. Didn't even know that was a thing lmao
    HE JUST TOLD THE DUDE TO GO FUCKING HARASS ME WTF HOW IS THAT ABUSE OF THE RPEORT BUTTON?
[deleted]
    YOU JUST TOLD HIM TOO "FEEL FREE TO HARASS HIM" WTF HOW IS THAT NOT HARASSING YOU DUMB BITCH
No I don’t, in a professional manner, but this is the internet and a gaming subreddit where this stuff happens all the time, so why lose your tempers over it? Jesus...
    god i don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. this is all immature as hell
        im not sure if i wanna be on this site anymore after going through this comment section
            [deleted]
                Dont compare a photo that took 20 minutes *max* to create with theft.

It might feel bad when your oh so fuckin important reddit karma gets " Stolen ", But it doesn't compare with theft in any realm.
It’s the internet man chill out. The internet. Does it really matter? Fucking internet points. Think about it.



If someone used “your” idea irl (ideas are not intellectual property) would you go harass the person who did it?
    Yes
        You’re fucked up. Go get some mental help.
You can't even read properly you support stealing dumbass
    Stealing reddit memes that took 10 minutes to make oh no
        Yea that's the point there is no point in doing it they just want to watch the world burn that just makes them more hateble
            How embarrassing
                You just dont get reddit
You really dont see it dont ya
    You really dont see it. Reddit karma is useless, nobody cares. Have you ever heard somebody in real life being proud of his reddit karma? Its a useless metric. Especially with all the bot karma farming accounts being sold. You on the other hand are making up bullshit narratives to support your own fantasy. "Anything digital is useless"
"If it isnt real money its nothing"

Nobody said anything of that. 

You only made that up to drive your own point across, because without all the false bs, it falls flat on its nose
You didnt understand what I said
Thanks for that, a great piece
🔫👨‍🔫👨‍ *BAM*
    Sorry sir I was high
Sort of, but it’s more than just cutting off the top and bottom bits, he had to at least open up MSPaint or something to remove the watermark, which is how much effort it would take to remove one directly on the crewmate
Ouch.
It was obvious! He was the reposter! See? His account will be deleted now... any minute now... see? Wait still there.
    So, we still have problem?
        Alright, who’s ready to go find this reposter?
            **Right behind you...**
He could be me!
    Nah you're way too cool
        He could even be-
        Damn thanks, you're very cool too
