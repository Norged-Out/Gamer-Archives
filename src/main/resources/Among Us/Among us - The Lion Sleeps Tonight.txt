[[Among us - The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]





It was the WOAOAOA's that got me
    Same lmfao

Edit: oh fuck first comment with 1k
        Specially when they start running circles around the main lyrics
            Incredible job
                I need more from this group.
                    make this a band, and i will pay my soul to watch this
            The attention to detail is what makes this gold
            Yeah that's the point
                He knows that's the point, he's just saying that part is especially funny.
                    Yeah I just realised. I'm an idiot
            That's literally all they're doing? What do you mean by especially? They didn't do anything else lmao
                If you watch again, it isn't, they start solo. At one point they show up around the main lyrics
                    I've tried so hard to see this and I cannot ahaha
                    [deleted]
                        My Lord you are actually right. How did I get confused on that? Lol
        Same lmfao
            Same lmfao
    Purple venting in the beginning is my fav...after I watched it a few times

    Especially the awimaweh tornado
Beautiful. and that actually made me smile, but purple looks sus.
    What do you mean I was just cleaning the vents, it’s one of my tasks I sweeeaaar
        yeah dw guys I saw purple clean em
            They should make that one of the tasks so one crew per game can use the vents. It would create such chaos! 😂

        No Patrick, Fall Guys is not an instrument either.
            Fun fact: 

For the longest time I actually thought Among Us and Fall Guys were supposed to be the same thing.

Why do I feel like I just witnessed a miracle?
    Because you did
        YEssssss
    I just witnessed every game I've joined where I have no clue what's going on, but clearly it wasn't supposed to be public.
        "What... is happening here."

"You have been banned"
    This was a pure work of art
It’s the orbiting WOAOAOAOA’s for me
    Haha yes, they were ingenious

This is so fucking cute
It's a black swan of Among us
    A flock of crows is called a murder.
How fitting
        Crows are not swans
            A flock of swans is called a whiteness.
                White sus
I'm loving all these music videos
    There's more??
        u/pospol made [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/comments/jdjt7v/me_and_my_friend_did_this_hope_you_like_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the other day!
            Honestly the All Star vid didn’t make me laugh quite as much, more going on in this one.
                Yea, that's just 3 minutes of someone going out of a vent.

&#x200B;

Like, I get that it takes time to make, but it isn't worth 40k upvotes imo
        Go to shushibae on tiktok! Show a bunch if vids like this
            Thx, I will check him out.
    I need more
        Samee!! My ForYou page/Recommended are full of them!!
At 27 seconds the song says "In the jungle the QUIET jungle" but light green is called mighty, light green is sus.
    I hope someone got fired for that blunder
        You mean ejected?
    It’s quiet? I already thought it was mighty. TIL.
        It's mighty then quiet the next line
    It doesn't even say mighty. It says might lol
What can i say except lmfao
I like the dropship orgy
    [deleted]
        No
Imagine not saving this post
    Exactly
    Well I don't know what the song is so it doesn't mean much to me. It's cool, but I'd save the post if I knew the song.
        what!? go watch Lion King today
            Ah, that's where it's from. Makes sense then, I really don't like Disney movies, so I've never watched many at all.
What is that lava scene?
    It's part of Polus' map, if that's what you're asking.
        Ohh
    I never played it, so I thought the whole thing was on a space station. That's cool.
        you’re thinking of the default map, there are three maps; space station (skeld), in the sky (mira HQ), and a planet (polas). i think there’s a story connecting them, i just can’t remember it. sorry that got preachy, i just....really like among us.
            I don't blame you. It looks like a fun game. Thanks for explaining.
When your friends are crazy like you😂.
Bless the one who made this. They really put in some effort to create this and made alot of people smile :)
    It's from the instagram account @/hiriririririri! They really worked a lot for this it's definitely so cool!

OMG🤣🤣, they look like they are worshiping them

Sometimes very rarely there are good things from tiktok
    r/redditmoment
    Oh yes
I see you spent alot of time making this, you should be proud.
    Yeah he opened tiktok and stole a video from it, really alot of time!!
I wonder how historians will explain this in 500 years.
THE DEDICATION.

I... just... can't.

I saved it to give my free award when I earn it
I didn’t think I’d love something so much
I smiled so much

This was actually really wholesome tbh XD.

The best thing I've seen on Reddit in a long time.
This is the greatest thing on the Internet rn. Needed this.
you passed the vibe check
I literally died laughing when umum boway hoped out of a vent, this is fucking hilarious
This song is constantly on the tip of my tongue. Breaking out into singing it is always just a whim away.  

A whim away.  A whim away.
The song+crewmates : The lion sleep toniiiight

Me out loud : MEDBAAAAAY
Who would have thought that free name changes would create hilarious content such as this, with the potential to make more than name changes from the marketing it gives you. STOP CHARGING US TO CHANGE OUR GOTDAMN NAMES.
Me: [Notices it's from Tiktok]
Also Me: It is Acceptable.
Don't you all love when people unite for a common purpose like this video? 'Cause I do
How much coordination did this take?
It's beautiful. I've been watching this for 5 hours.
    Nice
I collected my free reward to try and award this but my page just refreshed and I cant give it :(
Among us was a mistake and a masterpiece at the same time.

They have in the mighty jungle but its supposed be in the quiet jungle

Can't wait for this to be re-posted for the next 10 years, just in much shittier quality and without sound - but at least you'll still be able to hear it.
This is funniest thing I’ve seen in weeks

Damn this is really high effort. Wish I still had my award I would've given it to you.
    Bruh some tiktokker made it and he just stole it
    “High effort”

Lmao dude it’s a bunch of people who took 5 seconds to rename there characters and walk in circles. If it’s that easy to impress you that’s pretty bad.
        then try to make something similiar with a different music.
            I'm sure he doesn't have enough friends to do even the very first part
            Lmao sure thing kid. I don’t have anything to prove
“In the jungle, the *quiet* jungle” @ 0:27.  Mighty sus.
I wish I can award u something for the effort
    Bruh some tiktokker made it and he just stole it
        Well a least he didn't crop it and not give credit, plus it may have been his own toktok. You never know
            Ye but it seems like nobody knows its not his, and i dont think its his tiktok
    Why did this guy get downvoted?
        Some salt in the chat lol
Very nice! Big pp!
Did you make this video or found it of tiktok. Nothing against it just wondering

How wonderfully cringe worthy

    Why is this getting downvotes , lol
https://discord.gg/JqnzA3 Join this discord, it is a public among us server me and my friend made
It's great but I'm pretty sure Jay Siegel wasn't going Hiriririri it was more of a HeeeEeeeeEeeee. You also missed the quiet jungle bit and instead put mighty. Good effort though.
    Then you do it and make it better. I'm sure you can!
        I cannot, I don't know much about editing videos and I don't have enough friends who would do this. I didn't say it was bad, in fact I said it was great. I was just pointing out some inaccuracies.
            >Good effort though.

Dude, that's what people say when they don't want to outright say the work was bad. Praise the effort but not the work.

You had much more criticism than "praise" (if you can even call it that".
                I don't know what else to say. It's not that big a deal. Funny thing is it's not the OP that can't take the criticism it's other people can't take the criticism for them lmao.
        In their defense they never said they could do better, they said some of the lyrics were off, which is true.
This is a tictok lol, downvote
    r/redditmoment
WHY IS THIS TIKTOK? WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE TIKTOK! EVERYONE WHICH IS SEEING THIS ARE SATANISTS AND NEO NAZIS! THEY AREN'T TRUE REDDITORS! THERE IS STILL HOPE! DELETE THE VIDEO AND WATCH TIKTOK BAD REDDIT GOOD MEMES! AND PLEASE REMOVE THE AWARDS!
    Tell me this is satire
        I think it is but that doesn't make the comment less shit
    i really really REALLY hope this is satire
    Why hate videos because tik Tom? Personally I don’t like tik tok but I don’t hate a funny video just because of where it came from
        Well , imagine this , imagine you are an jew in ww2 and you have a mail ,its an well designed furniture , toys and etc , but who sended it was an Nazi. So what would you do? A : Burn the box or B : Like it so much that every jew likes it?
            Alright:

Unless you have been put in a concentration camp and starved almost to death by tik tok, using ww2 is too extreme. Unless tik tok has killed your family and everyone you love, using ww2 is too extreme. Here’s a more accurate scenario:

You are a Jew, and you receive a present from someone from a French man. Do you then hate him because he’s in a country that is occupied by the nazis?
                Well Tiktok killed an girl in Texas because there was a challenge named the Bernadryl challenge , this challenge was to drink so much bernadryl as you can. Not to mention an challenge named the baby throw challenge where there is a mother dancing and at one point of the music , the mother throws her baby anywhere in the house.
                Shut up
    I can't believe people thought you were serious lmao

    ?
You know i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

Tik Tok
    That's a stupid reason to stop liking something.
        Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it
            >Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You said that you were liking it until you saw the tik tok logo. So yes you did say you stopped liking it and you did say you were liking it.
                No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it
                    >No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it

But you wrote:

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You WERE liking it, you wrote "THEN I looked bottom left." This implies you stopped liking it. If I said "I was enjoying my dinner then I found a bug in it" that would imply I was enjoying my dinner, then after I found the bug I was not enjoying my dinner.
                        Idc about you and your dinner the then was a transition of what i was focused on I don’t know what you thought I implied but i never said I don’t like video anymore I didn’t say then i saw tik tok and stopped liking the video i just said then i saw tik tok thats like saying i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this
                            I was enjoying my time on reddit then I looked at your comment
                                What a vague reply
                            >i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds

This is exactly it yes, this implies you were enjoying your burger, then you saw it was from McDonalds and stopped enjoying it. The way you phrase it implies you stopped enjoying it once you saw it was from McDonalds. 

If I say "I was running, then I got tired" this implies I stopped running right? I don't know if English is your first language but using "then" in your sentence implies the situation has changed, especially because you wrote "I WAS enjoying it" "was" is past tense. So instead of saying "I was enjoying it" you'd say "I enjoyed this video, I also saw it was from Tik Tok.
                                Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote
And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you
                                    >Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote.

I have no idea what quote you're talking about. Is it this? "i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this"

>And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired

But it does, we can use different words to imply different things. Again, "was" is past tense. "I was doing X, then I noticed Y." This is how you would write that you stopped doing X after you noticed Y. You need to phrase it differently if you want it to say something else. 

I have literally no idea what else your initial comment could mean. You phrased it to imply you stopped enjoying it, you should have phrased it differently if you didn't want to imply that.

>im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you

I didn't assume anything, you implied it, I'm going off of what you implied. Words really do mean stuff!
    I’m not that big of a fan of Tik Tok myself, but it’s not a reason to stop enjoying something, so it’s kinda stupid that you said that
        Never said i stopped enjoying it

        Ah, that's where it's from. Makes sense then, I really don't like Disney movies, so I've never watched many at all.
It's part of Polus' map, if that's what you're asking.
    Ohh
I never played it, so I thought the whole thing was on a space station. That's cool.
    you’re thinking of the default map, there are three maps; space station (skeld), in the sky (mira HQ), and a planet (polas). i think there’s a story connecting them, i just can’t remember it. sorry that got preachy, i just....really like among us.
        I don't blame you. It looks like a fun game. Thanks for explaining.
It's from the instagram account @/hiriririririri! They really worked a lot for this it's definitely so cool!

    Well a least he didn't crop it and not give credit, plus it may have been his own toktok. You never know

Why did this guy get downvoted?
    Some salt in the chat lol
Found it, it was new, you can see the Creator at the bottom right
Why is this getting downvotes , lol
Then you do it and make it better. I'm sure you can!
    I cannot, I don't know much about editing videos and I don't have enough friends who would do this. I didn't say it was bad, in fact I said it was great. I was just pointing out some inaccuracies.
        >Good effort though.

Dude, that's what people say when they don't want to outright say the work was bad. Praise the effort but not the work.

You had much more criticism than "praise" (if you can even call it that".
            I don't know what else to say. It's not that big a deal. Funny thing is it's not the OP that can't take the criticism it's other people can't take the criticism for them lmao.
    In their defense they never said they could do better, they said some of the lyrics were off, which is true.
r/redditmoment
Tell me this is satire
    I think it is but that doesn't make the comment less shit
i really really REALLY hope this is satire
Why hate videos because tik Tom? Personally I don’t like tik tok but I don’t hate a funny video just because of where it came from
    Well , imagine this , imagine you are an jew in ww2 and you have a mail ,its an well designed furniture , toys and etc , but who sended it was an Nazi. So what would you do? A : Burn the box or B : Like it so much that every jew likes it?
        Alright:

Unless you have been put in a concentration camp and starved almost to death by tik tok, using ww2 is too extreme. Unless tik tok has killed your family and everyone you love, using ww2 is too extreme. Here’s a more accurate scenario:

You are a Jew, and you receive a present from someone from a French man. Do you then hate him because he’s in a country that is occupied by the nazis?
            Well Tiktok killed an girl in Texas because there was a challenge named the Bernadryl challenge , this challenge was to drink so much bernadryl as you can. Not to mention an challenge named the baby throw challenge where there is a mother dancing and at one point of the music , the mother throws her baby anywhere in the house.
            Shut up
I can't believe people thought you were serious lmao
?
That's a stupid reason to stop liking something.
    Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it
        >Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You said that you were liking it until you saw the tik tok logo. So yes you did say you stopped liking it and you did say you were liking it.
            No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it
                >No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it

But you wrote:

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You WERE liking it, you wrote "THEN I looked bottom left." This implies you stopped liking it. If I said "I was enjoying my dinner then I found a bug in it" that would imply I was enjoying my dinner, then after I found the bug I was not enjoying my dinner.
                    Idc about you and your dinner the then was a transition of what i was focused on I don’t know what you thought I implied but i never said I don’t like video anymore I didn’t say then i saw tik tok and stopped liking the video i just said then i saw tik tok thats like saying i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this
                        I was enjoying my time on reddit then I looked at your comment
                            What a vague reply
                        >i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds

This is exactly it yes, this implies you were enjoying your burger, then you saw it was from McDonalds and stopped enjoying it. The way you phrase it implies you stopped enjoying it once you saw it was from McDonalds. 

If I say "I was running, then I got tired" this implies I stopped running right? I don't know if English is your first language but using "then" in your sentence implies the situation has changed, especially because you wrote "I WAS enjoying it" "was" is past tense. So instead of saying "I was enjoying it" you'd say "I enjoyed this video, I also saw it was from Tik Tok.
                            Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote
And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you
                                >Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote.

I have no idea what quote you're talking about. Is it this? "i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this"

>And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired

But it does, we can use different words to imply different things. Again, "was" is past tense. "I was doing X, then I noticed Y." This is how you would write that you stopped doing X after you noticed Y. You need to phrase it differently if you want it to say something else. 

I have literally no idea what else your initial comment could mean. You phrased it to imply you stopped enjoying it, you should have phrased it differently if you didn't want to imply that.

>im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you

I didn't assume anything, you implied it, I'm going off of what you implied. Words really do mean stuff!
I’m not that big of a fan of Tik Tok myself, but it’s not a reason to stop enjoying something, so it’s kinda stupid that you said that
    Never said i stopped enjoying it
        I was enjoying the video then I looked in the bottom left.

Not everything needs to spelled out. You can allude that you stopped enjoying the video. We're not idiots here.
            I think you are judging by what your typing
        Oh ok

No Patrick, Fall Guys is not an instrument either.

For the longest time I actually thought Among Us and Fall Guys were supposed to be the same thing.

    Honestly the All Star vid didn’t make me laugh quite as much, more going on in this one.
        Yea, that's just 3 minutes of someone going out of a vent.

Like, I get that it takes time to make, but it isn't worth 40k upvotes imo
Go to shushibae on tiktok! Show a bunch if vids like this
    Thx, I will check him out.
Samee!! My ForYou page/Recommended are full of them!!
You mean ejected?
It's mighty then quiet the next line
No
what!? go watch Lion King today
    Ah, that's where it's from. Makes sense then, I really don't like Disney movies, so I've never watched many at all.
Ohh
you’re thinking of the default map, there are three maps; space station (skeld), in the sky (mira HQ), and a planet (polas). i think there’s a story connecting them, i just can’t remember it. sorry that got preachy, i just....really like among us.
    I don't blame you. It looks like a fun game. Thanks for explaining.
then try to make something similiar with a different music.
    I'm sure he doesn't have enough friends to do even the very first part
    Lmao sure thing kid. I don’t have anything to prove
Well a least he didn't crop it and not give credit, plus it may have been his own toktok. You never know
    Ye but it seems like nobody knows its not his, and i dont think its his tiktok
Some salt in the chat lol
I cannot, I don't know much about editing videos and I don't have enough friends who would do this. I didn't say it was bad, in fact I said it was great. I was just pointing out some inaccuracies.
    >Good effort though.

Dude, that's what people say when they don't want to outright say the work was bad. Praise the effort but not the work.

You had much more criticism than "praise" (if you can even call it that".
        I don't know what else to say. It's not that big a deal. Funny thing is it's not the OP that can't take the criticism it's other people can't take the criticism for them lmao.
In their defense they never said they could do better, they said some of the lyrics were off, which is true.
I think it is but that doesn't make the comment less shit
Well , imagine this , imagine you are an jew in ww2 and you have a mail ,its an well designed furniture , toys and etc , but who sended it was an Nazi. So what would you do? A : Burn the box or B : Like it so much that every jew likes it?
    Alright:

Unless you have been put in a concentration camp and starved almost to death by tik tok, using ww2 is too extreme. Unless tik tok has killed your family and everyone you love, using ww2 is too extreme. Here’s a more accurate scenario:

You are a Jew, and you receive a present from someone from a French man. Do you then hate him because he’s in a country that is occupied by the nazis?
        Well Tiktok killed an girl in Texas because there was a challenge named the Bernadryl challenge , this challenge was to drink so much bernadryl as you can. Not to mention an challenge named the baby throw challenge where there is a mother dancing and at one point of the music , the mother throws her baby anywhere in the house.
        Shut up
Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it
    >Never said I didn’t stop liking it didn’t say i was liking it

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You said that you were liking it until you saw the tik tok logo. So yes you did say you stopped liking it and you did say you were liking it.
        No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it
            >No all I said was i look and saw the tik tok sign NEVER said anything about not liking it

But you wrote:

>i was enjoying the video then i looked in the bottom left

You WERE liking it, you wrote "THEN I looked bottom left." This implies you stopped liking it. If I said "I was enjoying my dinner then I found a bug in it" that would imply I was enjoying my dinner, then after I found the bug I was not enjoying my dinner.
                Idc about you and your dinner the then was a transition of what i was focused on I don’t know what you thought I implied but i never said I don’t like video anymore I didn’t say then i saw tik tok and stopped liking the video i just said then i saw tik tok thats like saying i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this
                    I was enjoying my time on reddit then I looked at your comment
                        What a vague reply
                    >i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds

This is exactly it yes, this implies you were enjoying your burger, then you saw it was from McDonalds and stopped enjoying it. The way you phrase it implies you stopped enjoying it once you saw it was from McDonalds. 

If I say "I was running, then I got tired" this implies I stopped running right? I don't know if English is your first language but using "then" in your sentence implies the situation has changed, especially because you wrote "I WAS enjoying it" "was" is past tense. So instead of saying "I was enjoying it" you'd say "I enjoyed this video, I also saw it was from Tik Tok.
                        Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote
And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you
                            >Did you even read what i said and you didn’t finish the quote.

I have no idea what quote you're talking about. Is it this? "i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this"

>And it doesn’t imply you stopped you could still keep running even if your tired

But it does, we can use different words to imply different things. Again, "was" is past tense. "I was doing X, then I noticed Y." This is how you would write that you stopped doing X after you noticed Y. You need to phrase it differently if you want it to say something else. 

I have literally no idea what else your initial comment could mean. You phrased it to imply you stopped enjoying it, you should have phrased it differently if you didn't want to imply that.

>im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you

I didn't assume anything, you implied it, I'm going off of what you implied. Words really do mean stuff!
Never said i stopped enjoying it
    I was enjoying the video then I looked in the bottom left.

Not everything needs to spelled out. You can allude that you stopped enjoying the video. We're not idiots here.
        I think you are judging by what your typing
    Oh ok
Incredible job
    I need more from this group.
        make this a band, and i will pay my soul to watch this
The attention to detail is what makes this gold
Yeah that's the point
    He knows that's the point, he's just saying that part is especially funny.
        Yeah I just realised. I'm an idiot
That's literally all they're doing? What do you mean by especially? They didn't do anything else lmao
    If you watch again, it isn't, they start solo. At one point they show up around the main lyrics
        I've tried so hard to see this and I cannot ahaha

I have literally no idea what else your initial comment could mean. You phrased it to imply you stopped enjoying it, you should have phrased it differently if you didn't want to imply that.

>im not the type of person to assume something without all the information unlike you

I didn't assume anything, you implied it, I'm going off of what you implied. Words really do mean stuff!

I was enjoying my time on reddit then I looked at your comment
    What a vague reply
>i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds

This is exactly it yes, this implies you were enjoying your burger, then you saw it was from McDonalds and stopped enjoying it. The way you phrase it implies you stopped enjoying it once you saw it was from McDonalds. 

If I say "I was running, then I got tired" this implies I stopped running right? I don't know if English is your first language but using "then" in your sentence implies the situation has changed, especially because you wrote "I WAS enjoying it" "was" is past tense. So instead of saying "I was enjoying it" you'd say "I enjoyed this video, I also saw it was from Tik Tok.

I have no idea what quote you're talking about. Is it this? "i was enjoying a burger then i saw it was from McDonalds for all you know i could be implying that I would use Tik Tok since it had good creations like this"
