[[So is it actually possible for blood to be used as fuel]]





The glucose present in the blood? Yes.

The blood cells? Hmm. Tough question.

Haemoglobin is a protein, and proteins can be burnt to produce energy, same goes for other proteins including those in the RBC, WBC and platelets (all contains proteins)
Enzymes are also proteins and can be burnt

Electrolytes in the blood could be used to carry electricity or electrons used for galvanic electrolysis, but it is unlikely

You could use the oxygen in the blood to fuel combustion processes, and the carbonic acid might be used to fuel a battery

Antibodies may be used for its amino acid contents, either to be combusted or battery usage

So yes you could fuel using blood, but good luck getting everything where it needs to be

Recommended: Use adipose tissue instead as a meat based source they are full of fats which can be combusted

            I think so
            Yeah
    So what youâ€™re telling me is that itâ€™s possible to make a fully functioning v2
        There is no reason V2 has to run on blood; just substitute it for some other power source

Also, in the body, blood is not fuel. Blood is merely meant to carry fuel to the cells. Your blood takes the fuel from your intestine and puts it into your cells
            Well, if you also using the blood extracting the iron in the hemoglobin, you would still need to replace the blood, so yes, maybe

Are you trying to make us go extinct??
Probably yeah but it's not the most efficient way of fueling something

are you v1 or v2 in disguise
were fueled by blood
    we're fuelled by carbohydrates that is delivered by blood
        and it becomes blood and we run on it
    speak for yourself
Yeah it is I do it all the time
I think [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fuel-cell-generates-power-from-human-blood](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/fuel-cell-generates-power-from-human-blood)
listen i know you guys want to sex V1 but i just don't feel like making a machine that relies on killing beings and possibly sentient is a good idea. Might be wrong tho..
my headcanon for the machines is that they have an artificial circulatory system maybe with a pump in the center kind of like a heart. don't ask me how my theory works i'm not smart enough for that

and since the blood cells die eventually they need to refuel using fresh blood since they can't make their own. which explains why they're in the predicament they're in. this would also explain why fresh blood is necessary to fuel them.
