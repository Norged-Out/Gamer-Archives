[[Thoughts How gay and librl was your ultrakill experience 🤔🤔🤔]]





maybe? the 3 hour CGI sex scene between V1 and V2 has me leaning towards it being gay but im not sure
    I think you found the alternate ending.
        Wait, alternate ending?
            The main ending is a 3 hour CGI sex scene with Gabriel
                Clearly you haven’t found the 5-hour sex scene with Minos Prime and quick-time events
                    "Prepare thyself!"

\~Minos Prime
    Act 2: Heresy’s secret mission.
        coming spring 2023
    "all copies of ultrakill are custom"
    Both haven't expressed a preferred gender so it's fair to assume they both are agender, if neither have a gender can it still be gay?
        I think the community thinks of v1 and v2 as guys more or less
            Really? I've seen lots of people consider V1 a girl.
                I think it's more down to aesthetics for most people. Very blocky and hard designs like V1/V2 tend to be seen as more masculine whereas flowing and curvy designs are more feminine. However I prefer to see both V1/V2 as agender - they're robots.
                    THEY HAVE NO DICK \*vine boom*

NO BALLS \*vine boom*

AND PROBABLY NO BUTTHOLE BECAUSE THIS GUY FEEDS ON BLOOD \*vine boom*
                        hey i get that reference!
                that's probably because of Mirage from the secret level having her design based on v1. iirc officially v1 hasn't been gendered but one could take Mirage as a sign that V1 leans towards a female gendering if they wanted to.
                they are robots
                Me
        yeah that's pretty gay in my book.
        gender doesn't matter it's still gay as fuck
        If they're both agender then it's clearly *homo*sexual.
    V2 didn't get away this time
    Please tell me how to see this scene i need the information for

Purposes
    Gabriel tho 🥵
    This is real, I was the cameraman.
    Thats not gay they are non bi---- wait no that is gay
You can recolor your guns,  
so you can make demons actually taste rainbow
    Wait you can recolor the guns??
        costs 1 million P per gun but yes
            How to get
                go to guns, click customize, click custom, buy
                Buy the gay dlc
                    Literally lgbtq+
    Happy cake day
        Thanks :3
Calling it now, 9-2 boss is just sex with gabriel
    Mankind is dead
Cum is fuel
Gabe is full
        BLOOD IS FUEL

FOR MY COCK
            Swordsmachine is a Civvie11 fan confirmed
    Gabriel wouldn't be a good partner he is still in his closeted phase where he gets ashamed of himself/you after any gay stuff happens. But then again I've yet to even touch act 2 so perhaps I'm missing something huge.
        Finish act two because yes totally,  he finally confesses to v1 and they get married and adopt Maurice
        play act 2 now go kick gabe's ass
        It's so good, also pick up the book on 5-2, pretty good read
I've always found the community around boomer shooters to be very tolerant
    Half the community of any given boomer shooter community are queer autists that are currently hyperfixating on said boomer shooter

            Adding myself to the thread of queer autists that play ULTRAKILL

    from what i’ve seen, most boomer shooter communities are very tolerant, except doom fans (though it could be a vocal minority situation)
        [deleted]
            The amount of times that glory kill montages with the caption “me at the furry convention/pride parade” has been posted to the doom subreddit is at least in the double digits now. It’s joking about committing terroristic acts, and sure, it’s a joke, but it isn’t funny considering how people often do go to pride parades and LGBT spaces with the intent of killing and maiming people.
                Tbf that joke does sound funny to me
                    tell that to the victims who died in the pulse nightclub shooting
                        You cant make jokes out of horrible events anymore?
            I knew about Brutal Doom's creator, but what did the Blade of Agony guys do?
Woke ULTRAKILL be like:

GAYbriel

BI-1 

Minos PRONOUN

TRANSmachine

Hideous PLUS SIZE

Hakita

GENDERflayer
    GENDERflayer is the strongest enemy in the gaym.
        after the whiplash nerf shes kinda hard

other enemies i can weave, dodge, dash and jump but genderflayer? cant do that on her cuz she’s constantly teleporting and floating in the air while her projectiles hit harder than my dads belt, and i cant whiplash her or i get hard damaged
            Unironically feel like im suddenly doing better against the mindflayers. Like they feel like their time to kill has just suddenly gone down which hurts my brain. Guess im just comboing them will and i dont even shotgun swap or try to be all pro ultrakill gamer.
                Same, and I fight them basically exactly the same as I used to. Was there a phantom mindflayer change or something? Or am I just getting good?
            Use the sex rocket (drill)
            skrewdriver
    Hakita
    All mind flayers are trans
    you joke but mindflayers are canonically transfem, they put in EFFORT to make that body and they're damn proud of it

very, that goddamn robot made me Ultragay
    Explain
        simple, the robot is hot

just like men


and women



and everyone else in the world
            Good argument ☕
            well i mean he sure is going to overheat after doing whats going on in the game
idk man that one part where v1 and gabriel french kiss at the end of act 2 kinda got to me
    Yeah pretty wholesome moment ngl. But kinda fruity 🤨🤔😳.
        true...
    I don't even think either of them have mouths, but love finds a way

I'm just imagining them bonking their heads together
        they're like cats they do the "please love me" bonk
        They align the circles in there heads
        They do that spark thing like in WALL-E
Ultra kill has an oddly horny player base for how non-horny the game is.
    Idk man, have you SEEN Hank? 🥴
    Sayin this while gabe exists smh
        Gianni could make fart noises with his mouth and I'd still be simping for him fr fr.
    have you seen the twitter account of francis?
    Idk man, the mindflayer looking kinda hot
    2-S
    body pillow merch and the romance secret disagree with you
I was queer prior, however introduced a friend to it and he is like the gayest dude I know now.
Gabriel got me acting up at the end of act 2
    I've yet to play act 2 and based off other comments I believe I am missing something here.
        All I'm gonna say is Gianni delivered when he was recording his voice lines for Gabriel. The monologue he says when you fight him the second time is absolutely great.
            >!"HAHAhahahahaHAHAHAHAHA-"!<

>!"COME ON, MACHINE! FIGHT ME LIKE AN ANIMAL!"!<

>!His insane laughter is great asdgjksd!<
    so no head?
if i remember correctly hakita is bi also the ocean of dudes is very gay
But how librual if has GOD and ANGLES 🤣🤣
    Latest update literally had the line "God is dead" in it.

So decently liberal.
        There’s still angels
            Not for long, gabe [SPOILER TO ACT 2. DO NOT READ IF NOT PREPARED]  gonna die in a few hours, and he is one of strongest angels out there. So machines gonna disintegrate all angels for blood, and after there is no blood they gonna shut down forever.
Before playing through the update i was straight, now i'm bi, so yeah playing ultrakill turned me into a libtard
    TIME TO ROLL THE DICE
        That gabrielussy had me 😳
Based Brisket pfp
    why are there so many guilty gear enjoyers in the ultrakill community
        I guess they both have frantic action and reward technical skill? Makes sense there’d be some overlap
        Because they’re both high-energy, unique, expressive and gay
    Duality of- how the fuck do I put photos in comments?
    who is she? i know shes from guilty gears, but whats guilty gears? 

the only fighter game i’ve known and played is skullgirls so im not very knowledgeable
        That's a very tough question to answer, she's a Male-to-female bounty Hunter in that was a from a village that hated same sex twins, so she was forced to dress as a girl when she was still thinking of herself as a boy, and she went to do her bounty Hunter shit, then she shows up in this game and comes to terms with her gender
        to oversimplify, its an anime fighter where magic is a science and the characters are really over-the-top rock and metal song references with magic powers

Bridget is a trans girl from guilty gear
        Basically a bounty hunter girl that hits people with yo yo and a teddy bear
            A *possessed* teddy bear. A possessed *robot* teddy bear. I love GG ajsdg
        Guilty gear is an anime fighting game franchise themed around heavy metal, known for its visibly over the top story and characters. Bridget, in the older games, was essentially a joke character, with her being shown as a weak, crossdressing guy and weirdly sexualised. She’s come back as a trans girl in the newest game (it does kind of conflict with her old lore, but the old lore was a poorly written justification for a trap character) and she’s a great instance of good representation being explicitly trans in her arcade story, theme song, and design. She’s really cool.
Surprised nobody here bought up the rough gay sex scene with Gabriel and Minos.
How many V1s does it take to choose a gender!?!?,?!?!.!? None!!!,!!,! There too bussy!!!!,!!,! There blood!!,!!!!!,!,!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
im *pretty* sure there isn't a single cishet person in the dev team so yeah pretty accurate
    You love to see it
    That's how you know you've got that quality autism in the mix
    Technically, Stephen whyte isn’t, but the sheer homosexual energy coming from Minos makes him gay.
ULTRAKILL isn't on caps opinion discarded
    that's the joke, you dont put emphasis on the one that already fits the criteria
        No, the joke is that the others are spelled incorrectly but ultrakill is. Not capping it is just an all-around error.
            i don't think you really understand the format that well : you're meant to put the obvious one in lowercase anyway
                They're saying ULTRAKILL's title is officially capitalized. Thus, writing it in lowercase is incorrect.
                    yeah but also who gives a shit + that's how the format works
    Also anime pfp opinion doesn't matter
        You idiot. It’s a fighting game character
            I'm sorry
                Character development
        You play a game created by a guy that made his bandcamp a Gurren Lagann reference
Grew boobs 10/10
    Most informative ultrakill review thank you. 💅
I still have absolutely no idea why the ultrakill fanbase is so queer but I’m definitely not complaining
    My dude. An ultrakill dev (or was it artist? Idk) made fucking gay porn of Gabriel (pretty good too!). And there are literally official body pillows being sold on the site of the game.

The devs are so gay they affect the community.

Also Mirage exists.
        Okay but like it’s the internet of course there’s gonna be porn it the characters
            Yeah but it being made by an artist and shared so publicly on the web by said artist? That's not so common I have to say.
        francis counts as a concept artist i believe? he has the dev role on the ukds too
        where can i find said gay porn of gabriel?
            Francis Xie on rule 34. Just look for Gabriel, and you'll get it.
    We are all collectively down bad for Gabriel.
I feel like all of the robots in ultrakill are raging homosexuals, idk they just give off that kind of aura
    https://twitter.com/daveoshry/status/1277456089622081536
Yeah it's liberal. Liberal amounts of blood.
P-2 boss is just Bridget at full screen
    Bridget's strike-throw-high-low mixing bowl kicks my ass ngl

~~At least she's not as disjointed as Axl or god help you Happy Chaos~~
imean Swordsmachine is so obviously queer coded
    Swords are gay af
Well to be fair i wasn't a girl before starting ultrakill
This comment section is godly
    I'm pretty happy that everyone is being chill about it either by taking the piss or discussing creators. So many other subreddits I interact with have been acting obnoxious lately.
        Its called trolling, probably

At this point the decisions of a community, no matter where, they depend on two things:

The idea of people

And god help me, but, the pornography around it
My shotgun has trans colours. Thats how.
    wft_is_happening1 be like "Go woke go broke" (they are woke and will now broke you with 12 gauge rounds).
        I have 14 million points left my man i am not broke lmfao
            Gotta stay on the cyber grind frfr
Well i mean i discovered francis through ultrakill and you now how he's doing rn
    You mean as in boogie2988???
        nah the artist for some of ULTRAKILL's stuff (the act 2 announcement shot with gabe and minos on the beach, the paintings of minos and sisyphus, possibly including the body pillows but i'm not sure)
            Not the V1 pillow, but the Gabe pillow was literally the thing that got him hired.
                Based king
i wanna fuck the robot
    Everyone talks about fucking the robot, bit what about the big burly stone men?
        nah i want tha Vussy
I mean revolutionary Gabriel giving the power to the people of heaven was pretty damn far left
V1 in a sexually frustrated rage (due to lack of similar bots) slaughters her way through hell to get drunk as fuck on blood only to discover that a v2 exist. As he makes a dashing entrance she falls for him but they fight anyways. 

V2 is dumber then rocks but also confident as fuck so he doesn't realize just how fucking much v1 wants him. So basically the rest of the game is v1 chasing v2 to fuck his Brains out but she's horrible at socializing and ends up fighting and scaring him away. The rest of the game is just her chasing her alcoholic blood addiction and kinda just eliminating competition as she tries to seduce v2 who just spends most of the time coming up with even crazier entrances and watching blood dry.
    best game description
"Joe many mahcines does it take to change a log by bolb???

None! Their to busy ?!?!?? Their blood 😂" 

A statement so woke hakita fucking died
Gabriel came into the real world and called me the f slur. then he told me to kill myself
the fact that they have the Brisket pfp makes this all the more funny
I kinda liked how daddy Minos dominated me with his imposing musculature 🥴🥴
I mean I'm running the bi-piercer and transhotgun so I probably fall under this category.
I want to play QUEER Duke Nukem
Lesbian Dusk is something I need in my life
    What do you think lesbian dusk would entail? 🤔
        Idk I would just very much like a female voice mod
i am ambiguously homosexual towards gabriel
The game actually has barely anything to do with that, its just everything surrounding it (for some reason, maybe because the official bodypillows) either way cool game
    Exactly, the game itself does not have anything to do with the community, its just the ideas of what everyone believe and think of. 

Yes, even the cursed cringe pornography stuff
The 40 min long vn where you have a very detailed description of gabriel doing v1.
Chad ultrakill
I don't get this post, is it supposed to make me dumber or is it mocking something?
    Idk I was just curious about what makes ULTRAKILL ULTRAGAY.
        If you want an actual answer I assume it's something to the tune of:

- The prevalence of LGBT creators in the community, some of which Hakita and New Blood have worked with 

- Horny Gabriel fans 

- New Blood's aiding and abetting of horny Gabriel fans 

- Gianni's outspoken political views

- The fact that Hakita's Twitter banner has been a collage of femboy artwork of himself for a good while now
            > The prevalence of LGBT creators in the community, some of which Hakita and New Blood have worked with 

I mean, Hakita himself is bi, and several of the artists working on the game are trans. It's not just the fans, lol.
                Yeah but sometimes the creation doesn't have to be the same as the creator, if you know what I mean, no offense
                    Did I ask
            The additional joke in the post is that there's all these altered names for everything else, but Ultrakill is still just Ultrakill
IM HERE TO LICK ASS AND CHEW BUBBLEGUM...AND IM ALL OUT OF ASS

SHAKE IT BUDDY

WANNA TRANCE?
"A puddle of blood" is a gender-neutral pronoun, isn't it?
    Yes we love inclusion 💅💅🦾🦾🎣🎣🩸🩸
I dont think any what the game developers sexuality preference do anything with the game

I like to imagine that all of the levels are played in, well, hell and somewhere between earth and that every enemy is either somehow a representative of the 7 deadly sins and Gabriel even been an angel of "heaven or paradise" is trying to fight back against the enemies of god (because right hand of the father).

So, what im trying to say here is that it doesn't matter how the game developers model the enemies and lore with real religion. In the end its what you believe of and how you see it.



(Except the rule34 and cringe love shit, fuck that)
    ALSO i forgot to mention that probably Gabriel is the only one without any sexual preference since probably is god and only god and (SPOLIERS OF ACT II) after been defeated by the machine and relying on the true that god may be death, his only thoughts left are hatred and hollowness
a lot
Why everything need to be centered around sexuality now ? Who care what you fuck
    cause 2022? 

Look im confused as you are but at this point you cannot change this cause this entirety of community is gay, literally.

The only options left now are just the sweet relief of death or a event so dramatic and shocking that will change the point of view of people
When i play ultrakill i dont think about any of that i just think “There are enemies and i dont want to see them” so politics dont come up and i prefer to keep it that way.
    joke
    How is being queer political?
        Sorry i saw liberal and i forgot that this was about gender debate either way if its any controversial topic i dont want it in a game even if i support it. I just want the game to be fun no need for real world meaning just a fun experience for the players
            well i think that games can be fun even with real life meanings to them, bioshock or fallout for example
                Now that i think about i shouldn’t be talking i mean i’ve played all the way through postal 2 and laughed my ass off
                    postal 2 is a masterpiece, one of the best games ever made, thanks for reminding me of it again so i can beat it again for like the 727483th time
                        Yeah haha can say i’ve played it that much but i know the game. Rick hunter is the best postal dude
                tho im mostly a gameplay kinda guy so
    Yeah I'm kinda bullshiting when I say liberal but people do associate the game community to LGBTQ sometimes and I assume it's because of the promiscuous art of Gabriel and King Minos.
        Understandable and also i wasn’t making it a political statement i was just explaining my though process when i play through the game and come across an enemy encounter.
Edit: I never seen that art and i dont think i want to.
Average twitter user + go touch grass
    why touch grass when i can touch my partner
        I want a partner made of grass
        Holy shit the comeback is unreal very epic

too much gay seck
WTF
Remember when Hakita agreed with a twitter user that all Ultrakill players are neko femboys?
Everyone saying v1 a guy when there’s the whole secret cutscene of v1 wit tiddies in girl school uniform
The first fight between V1 and V2 was extremely gay. I mean this in the most positive way possible.
i turned my shotgun into the ace flag, so very gay

I mean... have you seen Gabriel and king Minos.

    Wait, alternate ending?

        Really? I've seen lots of people consider V1 a girl.
            I think it's more down to aesthetics for most people. Very blocky and hard designs like V1/V2 tend to be seen as more masculine whereas flowing and curvy designs are more feminine. However I prefer to see both V1/V2 as agender - they're robots.

                    hey i get that reference!
            that's probably because of Mirage from the secret level having her design based on v1. iirc officially v1 hasn't been gendered but one could take Mirage as a sign that V1 leans towards a female gendering if they wanted to.

    yeah that's pretty gay in my book.
    gender doesn't matter it's still gay as fuck
    If they're both agender then it's clearly *homo*sexual.
V2 didn't get away this time
Please tell me how to see this scene i need the information for

Thats not gay they are non bi---- wait no that is gay

        The amount of times that glory kill montages with the caption “me at the furry convention/pride parade” has been posted to the doom subreddit is at least in the double digits now. It’s joking about committing terroristic acts, and sure, it’s a joke, but it isn’t funny considering how people often do go to pride parades and LGBT spaces with the intent of killing and maiming people.
            Tbf that joke does sound funny to me
                tell that to the victims who died in the pulse nightclub shooting
                    You cant make jokes out of horrible events anymore?
        I knew about Brutal Doom's creator, but what did the Blade of Agony guys do?
GENDERflayer is the strongest enemy in the gaym.
    after the whiplash nerf shes kinda hard

other enemies i can weave, dodge, dash and jump but genderflayer? cant do that on her cuz she’s constantly teleporting and floating in the air while her projectiles hit harder than my dads belt, and i cant whiplash her or i get hard damaged
        Unironically feel like im suddenly doing better against the mindflayers. Like they feel like their time to kill has just suddenly gone down which hurts my brain. Guess im just comboing them will and i dont even shotgun swap or try to be all pro ultrakill gamer.
            Same, and I fight them basically exactly the same as I used to. Was there a phantom mindflayer change or something? Or am I just getting good?
        Use the sex rocket (drill)

All mind flayers are trans
you joke but mindflayers are canonically transfem, they put in EFFORT to make that body and they're damn proud of it

Explain
    simple, the robot is hot

just like men


and women



and everyone else in the world
        Good argument ☕
        well i mean he sure is going to overheat after doing whats going on in the game
Yeah pretty wholesome moment ngl. But kinda fruity 🤨🤔😳.
    true...
I don't even think either of them have mouths, but love finds a way

I'm just imagining them bonking their heads together
    they're like cats they do the "please love me" bonk
    They align the circles in there heads
    They do that spark thing like in WALL-E
Idk man, have you SEEN Hank? 🥴
Sayin this while gabe exists smh
    Gianni could make fart noises with his mouth and I'd still be simping for him fr fr.
have you seen the twitter account of francis?
Idk man, the mindflayer looking kinda hot
2-S
body pillow merch and the romance secret disagree with you
I've yet to play act 2 and based off other comments I believe I am missing something here.
    All I'm gonna say is Gianni delivered when he was recording his voice lines for Gabriel. The monologue he says when you fight him the second time is absolutely great.
        >!"HAHAhahahahaHAHAHAHAHA-"!<

>!"COME ON, MACHINE! FIGHT ME LIKE AN ANIMAL!"!<

>!His insane laughter is great asdgjksd!<
so no head?
Latest update literally had the line "God is dead" in it.

So decently liberal.
    There’s still angels
        Not for long, gabe [SPOILER TO ACT 2. DO NOT READ IF NOT PREPARED]  gonna die in a few hours, and he is one of strongest angels out there. So machines gonna disintegrate all angels for blood, and after there is no blood they gonna shut down forever.
TIME TO ROLL THE DICE
    That gabrielussy had me 😳
why are there so many guilty gear enjoyers in the ultrakill community
    I guess they both have frantic action and reward technical skill? Makes sense there’d be some overlap
    Because they’re both high-energy, unique, expressive and gay
Duality of- how the fuck do I put photos in comments?
who is she? i know shes from guilty gears, but whats guilty gears? 

the only fighter game i’ve known and played is skullgirls so im not very knowledgeable
    That's a very tough question to answer, she's a Male-to-female bounty Hunter in that was a from a village that hated same sex twins, so she was forced to dress as a girl when she was still thinking of herself as a boy, and she went to do her bounty Hunter shit, then she shows up in this game and comes to terms with her gender
    to oversimplify, its an anime fighter where magic is a science and the characters are really over-the-top rock and metal song references with magic powers

Bridget is a trans girl from guilty gear
    Basically a bounty hunter girl that hits people with yo yo and a teddy bear
        A *possessed* teddy bear. A possessed *robot* teddy bear. I love GG ajsdg
    Guilty gear is an anime fighting game franchise themed around heavy metal, known for its visibly over the top story and characters. Bridget, in the older games, was essentially a joke character, with her being shown as a weak, crossdressing guy and weirdly sexualised. She’s come back as a trans girl in the newest game (it does kind of conflict with her old lore, but the old lore was a poorly written justification for a trap character) and she’s a great instance of good representation being explicitly trans in her arcade story, theme song, and design. She’s really cool.
You love to see it
That's how you know you've got that quality autism in the mix
Technically, Stephen whyte isn’t, but the sheer homosexual energy coming from Minos makes him gay.
that's the joke, you dont put emphasis on the one that already fits the criteria
    No, the joke is that the others are spelled incorrectly but ultrakill is. Not capping it is just an all-around error.
        i don't think you really understand the format that well : you're meant to put the obvious one in lowercase anyway
            They're saying ULTRAKILL's title is officially capitalized. Thus, writing it in lowercase is incorrect.
                yeah but also who gives a shit + that's how the format works
Also anime pfp opinion doesn't matter
    You idiot. It’s a fighting game character
        I'm sorry
            Character development
    You play a game created by a guy that made his bandcamp a Gurren Lagann reference
Most informative ultrakill review thank you. 💅
My dude. An ultrakill dev (or was it artist? Idk) made fucking gay porn of Gabriel (pretty good too!). And there are literally official body pillows being sold on the site of the game.

The devs are so gay they affect the community.

Also Mirage exists.
    Okay but like it’s the internet of course there’s gonna be porn it the characters
        Yeah but it being made by an artist and shared so publicly on the web by said artist? That's not so common I have to say.
    francis counts as a concept artist i believe? he has the dev role on the ukds too
    where can i find said gay porn of gabriel?
        Francis Xie on rule 34. Just look for Gabriel, and you'll get it.
We are all collectively down bad for Gabriel.

Bridget's strike-throw-high-low mixing bowl kicks my ass ngl

~~At least she's not as disjointed as Axl or god help you Happy Chaos~~
Swords are gay af
I'm pretty happy that everyone is being chill about it either by taking the piss or discussing creators. So many other subreddits I interact with have been acting obnoxious lately.
    Its called trolling, probably

At this point the decisions of a community, no matter where, they depend on two things:

The idea of people

And god help me, but, the pornography around it
wft_is_happening1 be like "Go woke go broke" (they are woke and will now broke you with 12 gauge rounds).
    I have 14 million points left my man i am not broke lmfao
        Gotta stay on the cyber grind frfr
You mean as in boogie2988???
    nah the artist for some of ULTRAKILL's stuff (the act 2 announcement shot with gabe and minos on the beach, the paintings of minos and sisyphus, possibly including the body pillows but i'm not sure)
        Not the V1 pillow, but the Gabe pillow was literally the thing that got him hired.
            Based king
Everyone talks about fucking the robot, bit what about the big burly stone men?
    nah i want tha Vussy
best game description
What do you think lesbian dusk would entail? 🤔
    Idk I would just very much like a female voice mod
Exactly, the game itself does not have anything to do with the community, its just the ideas of what everyone believe and think of. 

Yes, even the cursed cringe pornography stuff
Idk I was just curious about what makes ULTRAKILL ULTRAGAY.
    If you want an actual answer I assume it's something to the tune of:

- The prevalence of LGBT creators in the community, some of which Hakita and New Blood have worked with 

- Horny Gabriel fans 

- New Blood's aiding and abetting of horny Gabriel fans 

- Gianni's outspoken political views

- The fact that Hakita's Twitter banner has been a collage of femboy artwork of himself for a good while now
        > The prevalence of LGBT creators in the community, some of which Hakita and New Blood have worked with 

I mean, Hakita himself is bi, and several of the artists working on the game are trans. It's not just the fans, lol.
            Yeah but sometimes the creation doesn't have to be the same as the creator, if you know what I mean, no offense
                Did I ask
        The additional joke in the post is that there's all these altered names for everything else, but Ultrakill is still just Ultrakill
Yes we love inclusion 💅💅🦾🦾🎣🎣🩸🩸
ALSO i forgot to mention that probably Gabriel is the only one without any sexual preference since probably is god and only god and (SPOLIERS OF ACT II) after been defeated by the machine and relying on the true that god may be death, his only thoughts left are hatred and hollowness
cause 2022? 

Look im confused as you are but at this point you cannot change this cause this entirety of community is gay, literally.

The only options left now are just the sweet relief of death or a event so dramatic and shocking that will change the point of view of people
joke
How is being queer political?
    Sorry i saw liberal and i forgot that this was about gender debate either way if its any controversial topic i dont want it in a game even if i support it. I just want the game to be fun no need for real world meaning just a fun experience for the players
        well i think that games can be fun even with real life meanings to them, bioshock or fallout for example
            Now that i think about i shouldn’t be talking i mean i’ve played all the way through postal 2 and laughed my ass off
                postal 2 is a masterpiece, one of the best games ever made, thanks for reminding me of it again so i can beat it again for like the 727483th time
                    Yeah haha can say i’ve played it that much but i know the game. Rick hunter is the best postal dude
            tho im mostly a gameplay kinda guy so
Yeah I'm kinda bullshiting when I say liberal but people do associate the game community to LGBTQ sometimes and I assume it's because of the promiscuous art of Gabriel and King Minos.
    Understandable and also i wasn’t making it a political statement i was just explaining my though process when i play through the game and come across an enemy encounter.
Edit: I never seen that art and i dont think i want to.
why touch grass when i can touch my partner
    I want a partner made of grass
    Holy shit the comeback is unreal very epic
    Holy shit the comeback is unreal very epic
average redditor
Your name is literally super hot artiorias. I don't think I believe you
Damn that's crazy 🤯🤯🤯
Wait, alternate ending?
    The main ending is a 3 hour CGI sex scene with Gabriel
        Clearly you haven’t found the 5-hour sex scene with Minos Prime and quick-time events
            "Prepare thyself!"

\~Minos Prime
coming spring 2023
I think the community thinks of v1 and v2 as guys more or less
    Really? I've seen lots of people consider V1 a girl.
        I think it's more down to aesthetics for most people. Very blocky and hard designs like V1/V2 tend to be seen as more masculine whereas flowing and curvy designs are more feminine. However I prefer to see both V1/V2 as agender - they're robots.
            THEY HAVE NO DICK \*vine boom*

NO BALLS \*vine boom*

AND PROBABLY NO BUTTHOLE BECAUSE THIS GUY FEEDS ON BLOOD \*vine boom*
                hey i get that reference!
        that's probably because of Mirage from the secret level having her design based on v1. iirc officially v1 hasn't been gendered but one could take Mirage as a sign that V1 leans towards a female gendering if they wanted to.
        they are robots
        Me
yeah that's pretty gay in my book.
gender doesn't matter it's still gay as fuck
If they're both agender then it's clearly *homo*sexual.
costs 1 million P per gun but yes
    How to get
        go to guns, click customize, click custom, buy
        Buy the gay dlc
            Literally lgbtq+
Thanks :3
BLOOD IS FUEL

FOR MY COCK
    Swordsmachine is a Civvie11 fan confirmed
Finish act two because yes totally,  he finally confesses to v1 and they get married and adopt Maurice
play act 2 now go kick gabe's ass
It's so good, also pick up the book on 5-2, pretty good read
As a fellow queer autist I can confirm
    Adding myself to the thread of queer autists that play ULTRAKILL
        How many autistic queers are in here 😭 why are there so many of us
            Lol I'm here too
                so am i
                    oh hey guys you here too?
                        *-Jumps into pile-* Wassap?
                            am i late to the queer artists who play ultrakill party?  


edit: ah. autist. still applies probably
        same here!
    What tipe of car is a queer? I'm an autist but i never heard about that car before
Not queer, am autist, can confirm
    Same. Not queer but autist here.

idk if im actually autistic but im queer af and can confirm this statement as true, this mfer had a half life phase for a month straight at least
We have been found out
