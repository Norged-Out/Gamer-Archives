[[The feeling when your sleeping bag is gone]]





What enchances the feeling is when you spend an hour before bed reinforcing your base thinking it wont get raided.
    I'm stressing man dont remind me
    My small group of friends once spent days farming and stealing a huge amount of mats and gunpowder and then logged off with it all in a flimsy 2x2 that only had a single door without even an airlock (our last base the other side of the map was raided and we had to evac it). I'm talking like 40k sulfur or something stupid and tons of guns they got from Rig. *Behind ONE DOOR.*

So I spent 3 hours before bed building a THICCC fortress on the far cliff of a remote hidden island, deep in the frozen wastes and almost perfectly camouflaged. *Two* hidden separate stability bunkers and all these armoured storage rooms.

Woke up next morning and someone had just blown through something like 7 armoured walls and all the doors to get at the stuff, and it was all gone. The 2x2 was unraided. LOL.
        that is my i keep my bases as small as possible, and only use metal\\armor on the inner layers that are not visible from outside. I'm solo though, dont need much space.
        Someone saw you building it, guaranteed. That's an easy raid when something like that pops up fast
            Lol my duo and I have a cave base this wipe and it’s worked greatly so far no one has messed with us. We have armored honey comb at the main entrance and a turret behind the honey comb with an l.r. We literally can’t access it it’s just waiting for someone to blow through the first wall. We have a turret facing the bucket as well in case anyone drops down. It’s about as safe as you can get. But anyways we’ve been farming down there and have waaaay more metal frags and stone than we need. Keep the sulfur of course. But we’ve been building huge compounds outside the cave and put no loot in it. 2 have been raided and I really wish I could see the look on these zergs faces when they waste rockets and c4 on nothing haha. I have bounties on my head by like 4 different clans now and my duo and I came up with a hilarious idea I’m gonna try to make a video if it works. Everyone thinks I’m a solo so he’s been calling me a bitch in the global chat saying I insided his base. And now he’s trying to sell my base location to a clan for 1000 scrap. And he’s going to lead them to one of our empty compounds. It will be so funny if we can pull it off
            That's why my rule is usually "Put all the materials into the walls."
                Mine is always, evenly honeycomb the roof and the walls of the floors with loot. No point wallhoneycombing the roof honeycomb or the way up to the shooting floor, cuz on my base its on the third floor above the front door, which is an awkward spot to ladder up to anyway.
                yup, I try to leave 2 days on upkeep. I want most of the TC to go down into upkeep. Also, I despawn all my charcoal when it's not needed. Gotta make em work for it.
                    It would pain me to despawn charcoal, especially on vanilla
                        Bruh it’s a pain to despawn on a 2x, fast smelting makes charcoal impossible but on vanilla if you’re just smelling a bit of metal along with the sulf and use a mixing table you’re always gonna have excess
        My best wipe was when we lived out of a bunch of 2x1s scattered along a hillside. We had a main base up top which got raided multiple times. Our five 2x1s were never touched tho! I felt kinda bad for the raiders cayse they blew through a few walls and endless garage doors for some revs. If theyd have hit any of our 2x1s theyd have been showered in mats and guns after 2 doors lol
            I once built a 3x2 + airlock. 2 doors, 4 garage doors, all metal walls. They blew through it and in side they found a TC with enough metal for 48 hours, a bag, and a locked box.

In the box a simple note "Gone fishin'"
        I've learned there's actually some benefits towards building a base that makes it look like you don't know what you're doing/used all your mats. 

Fortresses get raided while shitty noob shacks get passed up because usually there's nothing in them.
            >I've learned there's actually some benefits towards building a base that makes it look like you don't know what you're doing/used all your mats.

Good thing I *actually* don't know what I'm doing! I'm safe!
            Deff need the odd wood pieces up top. Backward doors. Maybe even a ladder to make it look like you already were scouted/raided
                If you have a jackhammer with enoguh repairs to remove a stone wall block off your front door like raiders greifed it, with some ladders up to the roof you look 200% raided
                    I usually add unfinished honeycombing, an oil refinery with 73 charcoal and a damaged wooden door at the front. I just place one inside, shoot it with DB to like 90, then pick it up and put it at the front. Then I block it off with wooden walls with softside outside and one wall missing to look like it was picked, I also do 1 compete layer of honeycomb before the unfinished, and the finished honeycomb will have like 4 softside walls, never been raised.
                        Fam I think I just found your base yesterday LMAO
                            probably
        the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm
        Gp in externals
            Dangerous tho if you run into toxic players who jus wanna grief you😭 then they only hitting those externals
        I like to make a 2x2 with an airlock. First door wood, second door, sheet metal and then garage doors throughout. They never get raided and if they do they ok only make it to the garage door.
        Fact bro. you built a target. the 2x2 looks like any other 2x2 some solo coulda slapped together, blends in.
        Sounds like hax. Crazy
        This is an epic tale that really speaks to the truth at the heart of Rust
    And then the guy next to you with a twig 2x2 is untouched
        Twig 2x2 😂
        😂
    I've gone entire wipes living out of 2 to 6, 2x1s, I can count the amount of times I was raided unprovoked on one hand. Now ask me how many of my actual bases have been raided. ALL OF THEM
    then some 20 man clan rock up with 20 rockets
    More like 3 hours past bedtime
        Indeed
That's pretty accurate.

    half the time my base is entirely decayed by the time i get on
    Or when you respawn in your old base and take your base back after being onlined by an ESP hacker. Then your neighbours pin him into your first floor and a flurry of F1's go in and ESP hacker dies.
"Aww hell yeah I cannot wait to try out this new design I thought up that uses the new autoturrets as a decoy for the shotgun traps to make for the perfect trap base!"

Every time you get 2 scrap you get shot by a group of Semi/SMG users on horseback who utilize the new circle road to have an endless stream of fun, and then by the crossbow kids who come out of the woodwork after the group of bandits passes.
Me: "Im gunna make an insane crossbow play and destroy an ak kid"

Me when actually playing: "OMFG SOME STUPID ROCK KID JUST KILLED ME WITH THE 7K STONE"
    7k stone?
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna play for 2 hours and i'll have the whole base up and running"

9/10 times this does not happen people
Come on man the day just started here I have to get through work still and would rather not be panicking
    Same.  I built a GNARLY and THICC boi base last might.  8 garage doors, 9 sheet metal doors, all in a maze of dead ends and shotgun/flame thrower traps last night.  Literally takes ~40 satchels to get to loot room if you manage to snake your way through exactly.  That said, here I am with 5 hours left before I can find out some MLG offlined me.  :(
        This new group I was playing with are trash.  They spent the wipe farming mats when we had no BPs expecting me to carry them solo on Rustafied Med II.  They eould not even run monuments.  I finally manage to get a few basic BPs and build the base over 12 hours staying up all night, and it gets offlined 30 minutes after I logged out.  I quit that Discord.
            Geez.  I’m pretty new to Rust, 58 hours only.  I haven’t quite figured out the best way to go about getting BP’s and how to run wipe day properly.  I usually just run monuments when I get a rad suit and/or buy BP’s from bandit/outpost after some scrap runs.  Any recommendations? 

That said, I HATE when people won’t contribute to the team.  I’ll kick them before I keep playing with bottom feeders or those who want to be carried.  I’m working my ass off to learn the game to not be one of those people.
                BP wipe is about getting BPs.  These guys were playing: they were just farm Bots. I mean there were 3 boxes full of metal frags, box of sulfur.  All of this and the only gun we had was a Rev.  You need to get keycards, run monument puzzles, do oil rig, fly a heli to Dome or train yard, kill guys & make plays, trade, buy items: pretty much everything.  Just farming will not get you ahead in Rust.
                    Sometimes, RNG just doesn't agree at all with the methods. My trio just went Thursday to tonight, constantly running monument puzzles and getting the occasional airdrop, and had only rev/DB. Tier one guns. Just tonight, I was finally able to find a SAR at a monument and an SMG out of an airdrop.
                    Update;

My base did not get raided and is even THICCer.  Will take some serious dedication to raid at this point.  But the spoils will be great if they get in.  T2 and T3 loot all day long.  Approx 30,000 metal frag
                    Thanks for the advice.  It’s BP’s I always struggle with.  This is my best wipe thus far- got bp’s for SAR, double barrel, syringe, satchel, beancan and shotgun traps (plus some more) within 12 hours.  Still not great tho
                        If you get a medical kit (the green box), you can always recycle it for a syringe to BP.  Same if say you find two satchels and still need bean can.  If you are going to experiment on a Tier 1, research the cheap 20 scrap BPs so you have less chance of a dud item.  Researching is still a solid strat for level 1 items.
that pretty much sums it up, nowadays i get more joy watching streamers\\youtubers playing it that myself.
That is horrible.  The only thing that I can think of being worse is waking up locked in your own base with no way to get out.  I did that to a few people yesterday.  Technically I locked them in a room to starve to death.  All they can do is kill themselves lol.
    I managed to lock someone in their own base while they were building it. 

PSA: Lock your TC
        I wonder if they heard the door and lock go down lol.
    My group once killed one of two guys in a base, walled in the other with a sign supposedly from the guy we killed saying he betrayed him and stole all his stuff.  Next day they weren't on one another's friends list.

Rust attracts good people.
        How would you know that they weren't on each other's friends list?
            We investigated for our amusement.  You can see friends on people's Steam profile page if they're not set to private.
                I wonder if they figured out they got played.  Either way you're pretty evil.  lol
    Someone stole my base, but forgot to clear the tc so I just griefed the entrance.
Same for Tarkov
    Is there also a base system in tarkov or how does it work?
        you have a hideout at the end of each raid
            [deleted]
                Wait people can raid you and take your stuff in tarkov?
                    [deleted]
                        Ohhh haha I see.
                            Unless you get insurance claims, where there is a chance if the item hasn’t been looted you get it back in insurance if you insured it.
                                I just bought the game tonight and I’m not sure if I’ve made a mistake or not. It’s incredibly hard, I just hope I have the patience to learn. I guess rust felt that way once upon a time.
                                    Oh it's real hard at first. Best thing to do is to learn a map in offline mode. Interchange is a great first map since you only need to learn two exits. 

Also being new you might want to build up some loot and money. Unfortunately, you can't access the flea market (auction house) until you're level 5. Looting, examining items, and escaping alive will help you a lot. 

Lastly, learn how to be a rat (community term for those who hide around the maps) if you find it hard. Stay quiet and only engage if you need to. It's okay to run. Loot everything you can and get out.
                                    Yes it is very very hard. I would reccomend looking up a loot guide on customs and using loot goblin to see how much things are worth as you loot. This game is unforgiving as fuck. There are times you'll get on and get so fucked over by one raid you just open a different game. But that realllllly good raid every once in a while is what keeps you going. It's like crack
                                    I've had it for a week first 3 days I hated it cursed the Russian Devs than wouldn't refund it and now I love the game exact same happened with rust back in 2016 and now I have 4k hours or something just stick with it ;)
                                    Why is everyone playing this dodgy Russian game?
                                    Honestly take all I said with a grain of salt, I’m saying this from all the videos I’ve watched I haven’t played the game yet
                                    If you need some people to play with and you’re not toxic then pm me, I’ve been playing tarkov since .10 and could help out a bit
                > It’s better

Tarkov is leagues better than rust and Tarkov is kinda ass right now.
                    Even Welyn is playing tarkov lmao
    Lmao yea. I literally went from playing rust to Tarkov, and it has been the most fun and at the same time most frustrating experience I have had in a long damn time
        So true, I am so excited of playing tarkov this weekend but I know I gonna get destroyed, WHY AM I FELLING THIS WAY
            WHY DO WE GAIN SELF CONFIDENCE ONLY TO HAVE IT RIPPED AWAY
    I actually quit playing rust out of me being too paranoid. it would literally haunt my day till I got home. too much stress. not fun anymore. then my friend mentioned tarkov. I love it. I can be way more casual about it. losing your shit still sucks but now I won't get offlined
I find myself watching rust on YouTube and then whenever I die I’m like fuck this shitty game

    Bruh windows 10 demo is literally free
Watching youtubers play vs me :
    Most of them cheat. Plays are staged; raids are fake; they use scripts.  It's widespread.
        I wouldn't say ''most of them''. Some for sure yeah.
Have a silver this is 100% relatable
No, both but the right pic.
This speaks to my soal
    New Minecraft nether update:
Soal sand
I have a very good time imagining how much fun I'll have next wipe. but I'm not playing till it's out on ps4
Damn that's so true
That is so fuckin true
It’s become a chore at this point
Pretty much sums it up
I have never been so offended by something that I 100% agree with.
EST and mordhau bois if you need a break try one of these
Now the best part is snowballing with a rock to a crossy to a custom to an MP5, to LR L96 :)
I’m solo all the time anyone wanna play I have 500+ hrs Dom me on ig bfdmemez
Just watch youtubers play it, it’s so much more satisfying
Lmao me everyday at school waiting to get home😂😂💀
Literally me after a week of not playing then me after I get 1 ak pvp fight and have to stress about being raided cause I actually have gear that I care about then
I relate to this
Reality is often disappointing. But with this **cheating program** reality can be whatever I want
Spending all that time grinding then getting raided
Today was a good day 6h straight,alot of deaths, losing lr, finding sar on a sleeping person and 3 grenade launchers, eco raided a base with a big fault.
I have been playing rust for 2 weeks, every time I have built a base it was rated the next day when I came back, probably 7 or 8 times now,  today I logged in and my base was not rated for the 1st time, what of feeling.
Rust: Extreme Capitalism Simulator
I make wood doors always in front so people think its a noob / taken over base
I mean, just dont sleep and you dont get raided :)
So simple... and so agonisingly true.
You really need to prepare mentally to play a game like rust.
bro this is such an enlighting mood, Im gonna play rust soon, just take my time!

reality:

Alive For 31.6 Minutes

You were killed by asain zurg Using entity.Assault-Rifle
i'm in this picture and i don't like it
Me preparing for the roam vs me after losing my kit
It’s the same feeling with Escape from Tarkov, I watch shroud play it and think “wow I bet I could do that” and then get headshot from literally nowhere
Play escape from tarkov
\*im in this picture and i dont like it\*
Can’t relate
Now that autoturrets cost a fortune... 😭
I'm stressing man dont remind me

                        Unless you get insurance claims, where there is a chance if the item hasn’t been looted you get it back in insurance if you insured it.
                            I just bought the game tonight and I’m not sure if I’ve made a mistake or not. It’s incredibly hard, I just hope I have the patience to learn. I guess rust felt that way once upon a time.
                                Oh it's real hard at first. Best thing to do is to learn a map in offline mode. Interchange is a great first map since you only need to learn two exits. 

Also being new you might want to build up some loot and money. Unfortunately, you can't access the flea market (auction house) until you're level 5. Looting, examining items, and escaping alive will help you a lot. 

Lastly, learn how to be a rat (community term for those who hide around the maps) if you find it hard. Stay quiet and only engage if you need to. It's okay to run. Loot everything you can and get out.
                                Yes it is very very hard. I would reccomend looking up a loot guide on customs and using loot goblin to see how much things are worth as you loot. This game is unforgiving as fuck. There are times you'll get on and get so fucked over by one raid you just open a different game. But that realllllly good raid every once in a while is what keeps you going. It's like crack
                                I've had it for a week first 3 days I hated it cursed the Russian Devs than wouldn't refund it and now I love the game exact same happened with rust back in 2016 and now I have 4k hours or something just stick with it ;)
                                Why is everyone playing this dodgy Russian game?
                                Honestly take all I said with a grain of salt, I’m saying this from all the videos I’ve watched I haven’t played the game yet
                                If you need some people to play with and you’re not toxic then pm me, I’ve been playing tarkov since .10 and could help out a bit
            > It’s better

Tarkov is leagues better than rust and Tarkov is kinda ass right now.
                Even Welyn is playing tarkov lmao
Lmao yea. I literally went from playing rust to Tarkov, and it has been the most fun and at the same time most frustrating experience I have had in a long damn time
    So true, I am so excited of playing tarkov this weekend but I know I gonna get destroyed, WHY AM I FELLING THIS WAY
        WHY DO WE GAIN SELF CONFIDENCE ONLY TO HAVE IT RIPPED AWAY
I actually quit playing rust out of me being too paranoid. it would literally haunt my day till I got home. too much stress. not fun anymore. then my friend mentioned tarkov. I love it. I can be way more casual about it. losing your shit still sucks but now I won't get offlined
Bruh windows 10 demo is literally free
Most of them cheat. Plays are staged; raids are fake; they use scripts.  It's widespread.
    I wouldn't say ''most of them''. Some for sure yeah.
New Minecraft nether update:
Soal sand
that is my i keep my bases as small as possible, and only use metal\\armor on the inner layers that are not visible from outside. I'm solo though, dont need much space.
Someone saw you building it, guaranteed. That's an easy raid when something like that pops up fast
    Lol my duo and I have a cave base this wipe and it’s worked greatly so far no one has messed with us. We have armored honey comb at the main entrance and a turret behind the honey comb with an l.r. We literally can’t access it it’s just waiting for someone to blow through the first wall. We have a turret facing the bucket as well in case anyone drops down. It’s about as safe as you can get. But anyways we’ve been farming down there and have waaaay more metal frags and stone than we need. Keep the sulfur of course. But we’ve been building huge compounds outside the cave and put no loot in it. 2 have been raided and I really wish I could see the look on these zergs faces when they waste rockets and c4 on nothing haha. I have bounties on my head by like 4 different clans now and my duo and I came up with a hilarious idea I’m gonna try to make a video if it works. Everyone thinks I’m a solo so he’s been calling me a bitch in the global chat saying I insided his base. And now he’s trying to sell my base location to a clan for 1000 scrap. And he’s going to lead them to one of our empty compounds. It will be so funny if we can pull it off
    That's why my rule is usually "Put all the materials into the walls."
        Mine is always, evenly honeycomb the roof and the walls of the floors with loot. No point wallhoneycombing the roof honeycomb or the way up to the shooting floor, cuz on my base its on the third floor above the front door, which is an awkward spot to ladder up to anyway.
        yup, I try to leave 2 days on upkeep. I want most of the TC to go down into upkeep. Also, I despawn all my charcoal when it's not needed. Gotta make em work for it.
            It would pain me to despawn charcoal, especially on vanilla
                Bruh it’s a pain to despawn on a 2x, fast smelting makes charcoal impossible but on vanilla if you’re just smelling a bit of metal along with the sulf and use a mixing table you’re always gonna have excess
My best wipe was when we lived out of a bunch of 2x1s scattered along a hillside. We had a main base up top which got raided multiple times. Our five 2x1s were never touched tho! I felt kinda bad for the raiders cayse they blew through a few walls and endless garage doors for some revs. If theyd have hit any of our 2x1s theyd have been showered in mats and guns after 2 doors lol
    I once built a 3x2 + airlock. 2 doors, 4 garage doors, all metal walls. They blew through it and in side they found a TC with enough metal for 48 hours, a bag, and a locked box.

In the box a simple note "Gone fishin'"
I've learned there's actually some benefits towards building a base that makes it look like you don't know what you're doing/used all your mats. 

Fortresses get raided while shitty noob shacks get passed up because usually there's nothing in them.
    >I've learned there's actually some benefits towards building a base that makes it look like you don't know what you're doing/used all your mats.

Good thing I *actually* don't know what I'm doing! I'm safe!
    Deff need the odd wood pieces up top. Backward doors. Maybe even a ladder to make it look like you already were scouted/raided
        If you have a jackhammer with enoguh repairs to remove a stone wall block off your front door like raiders greifed it, with some ladders up to the roof you look 200% raided
            I usually add unfinished honeycombing, an oil refinery with 73 charcoal and a damaged wooden door at the front. I just place one inside, shoot it with DB to like 90, then pick it up and put it at the front. Then I block it off with wooden walls with softside outside and one wall missing to look like it was picked, I also do 1 compete layer of honeycomb before the unfinished, and the finished honeycomb will have like 4 softside walls, never been raised.
                Fam I think I just found your base yesterday LMAO
                    probably
the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm
Gp in externals
    Dangerous tho if you run into toxic players who jus wanna grief you😭 then they only hitting those externals
I like to make a 2x2 with an airlock. First door wood, second door, sheet metal and then garage doors throughout. They never get raided and if they do they ok only make it to the garage door.
Fact bro. you built a target. the 2x2 looks like any other 2x2 some solo coulda slapped together, blends in.
Sounds like hax. Crazy
This is an epic tale that really speaks to the truth at the heart of Rust
Twig 2x2 😂
😂
Indeed
This new group I was playing with are trash.  They spent the wipe farming mats when we had no BPs expecting me to carry them solo on Rustafied Med II.  They eould not even run monuments.  I finally manage to get a few basic BPs and build the base over 12 hours staying up all night, and it gets offlined 30 minutes after I logged out.  I quit that Discord.
    Geez.  I’m pretty new to Rust, 58 hours only.  I haven’t quite figured out the best way to go about getting BP’s and how to run wipe day properly.  I usually just run monuments when I get a rad suit and/or buy BP’s from bandit/outpost after some scrap runs.  Any recommendations? 

That said, I HATE when people won’t contribute to the team.  I’ll kick them before I keep playing with bottom feeders or those who want to be carried.  I’m working my ass off to learn the game to not be one of those people.
        BP wipe is about getting BPs.  These guys were playing: they were just farm Bots. I mean there were 3 boxes full of metal frags, box of sulfur.  All of this and the only gun we had was a Rev.  You need to get keycards, run monument puzzles, do oil rig, fly a heli to Dome or train yard, kill guys & make plays, trade, buy items: pretty much everything.  Just farming will not get you ahead in Rust.
            Sometimes, RNG just doesn't agree at all with the methods. My trio just went Thursday to tonight, constantly running monument puzzles and getting the occasional airdrop, and had only rev/DB. Tier one guns. Just tonight, I was finally able to find a SAR at a monument and an SMG out of an airdrop.
            Update;

My base did not get raided and is even THICCer.  Will take some serious dedication to raid at this point.  But the spoils will be great if they get in.  T2 and T3 loot all day long.  Approx 30,000 metal frag
            Thanks for the advice.  It’s BP’s I always struggle with.  This is my best wipe thus far- got bp’s for SAR, double barrel, syringe, satchel, beancan and shotgun traps (plus some more) within 12 hours.  Still not great tho
                If you get a medical kit (the green box), you can always recycle it for a syringe to BP.  Same if say you find two satchels and still need bean can.  If you are going to experiment on a Tier 1, research the cheap 20 scrap BPs so you have less chance of a dud item.  Researching is still a solid strat for level 1 items.
I wonder if they heard the door and lock go down lol.
How would you know that they weren't on each other's friends list?
    We investigated for our amusement.  You can see friends on people's Steam profile page if they're not set to private.
        I wonder if they figured out they got played.  Either way you're pretty evil.  lol
you have a hideout at the end of each raid
    [deleted]
        Wait people can raid you and take your stuff in tarkov?
            [deleted]
                Ohhh haha I see.
                    Unless you get insurance claims, where there is a chance if the item hasn’t been looted you get it back in insurance if you insured it.
                        I just bought the game tonight and I’m not sure if I’ve made a mistake or not. It’s incredibly hard, I just hope I have the patience to learn. I guess rust felt that way once upon a time.
                            Oh it's real hard at first. Best thing to do is to learn a map in offline mode. Interchange is a great first map since you only need to learn two exits. 

Also being new you might want to build up some loot and money. Unfortunately, you can't access the flea market (auction house) until you're level 5. Looting, examining items, and escaping alive will help you a lot. 

Lastly, learn how to be a rat (community term for those who hide around the maps) if you find it hard. Stay quiet and only engage if you need to. It's okay to run. Loot everything you can and get out.
                            Yes it is very very hard. I would reccomend looking up a loot guide on customs and using loot goblin to see how much things are worth as you loot. This game is unforgiving as fuck. There are times you'll get on and get so fucked over by one raid you just open a different game. But that realllllly good raid every once in a while is what keeps you going. It's like crack
                            I've had it for a week first 3 days I hated it cursed the Russian Devs than wouldn't refund it and now I love the game exact same happened with rust back in 2016 and now I have 4k hours or something just stick with it ;)

Thanks for the advice.  It’s BP’s I always struggle with.  This is my best wipe thus far- got bp’s for SAR, double barrel, syringe, satchel, beancan and shotgun traps (plus some more) within 12 hours.  Still not great tho
    If you get a medical kit (the green box), you can always recycle it for a syringe to BP.  Same if say you find two satchels and still need bean can.  If you are going to experiment on a Tier 1, research the cheap 20 scrap BPs so you have less chance of a dud item.  Researching is still a solid strat for level 1 items.

    Ohhh haha I see.
        Unless you get insurance claims, where there is a chance if the item hasn’t been looted you get it back in insurance if you insured it.
            I just bought the game tonight and I’m not sure if I’ve made a mistake or not. It’s incredibly hard, I just hope I have the patience to learn. I guess rust felt that way once upon a time.
                Oh it's real hard at first. Best thing to do is to learn a map in offline mode. Interchange is a great first map since you only need to learn two exits. 

Also being new you might want to build up some loot and money. Unfortunately, you can't access the flea market (auction house) until you're level 5. Looting, examining items, and escaping alive will help you a lot. 

Lastly, learn how to be a rat (community term for those who hide around the maps) if you find it hard. Stay quiet and only engage if you need to. It's okay to run. Loot everything you can and get out.
                Yes it is very very hard. I would reccomend looking up a loot guide on customs and using loot goblin to see how much things are worth as you loot. This game is unforgiving as fuck. There are times you'll get on and get so fucked over by one raid you just open a different game. But that realllllly good raid every once in a while is what keeps you going. It's like crack
                I've had it for a week first 3 days I hated it cursed the Russian Devs than wouldn't refund it and now I love the game exact same happened with rust back in 2016 and now I have 4k hours or something just stick with it ;)
                Why is everyone playing this dodgy Russian game?
                Honestly take all I said with a grain of salt, I’m saying this from all the videos I’ve watched I haven’t played the game yet
                If you need some people to play with and you’re not toxic then pm me, I’ve been playing tarkov since .10 and could help out a bit
Even Welyn is playing tarkov lmao
Bruh it’s a pain to despawn on a 2x, fast smelting makes charcoal impossible but on vanilla if you’re just smelling a bit of metal along with the sulf and use a mixing table you’re always gonna have excess
Fam I think I just found your base yesterday LMAO
    probably
