    yup, those windows give perfect access to soft side pick the walls. xD
        I was gonna be snarky and and say why would you bust into this but if i was naked and saw this id be gettin me a fuckton of spearss
            [deleted]
                These are the bases you hit on Day 2 of the wipe as you a prepping to compound your own base. Role players always horde mats.

If you see a metal door then then you know there is sulfur and HQM in the TC too. xD
Is this a nod to the post by that guy talking about his friendly encounters on his rust porch?
    He had a stone porch
    hahahahaha it has to be
     No, but that sounds interesting. Can you shoot me the video link?

            Aw. Thatâ€™s sweet.
I feel something that I havenâ€™t felt in years
If I remember correctly,
Itâ€™s called...

            That post is as fake as your mother's love for you.
I hate building meta bases. They're so ugly and annoying.

Make fun of me all you want but I enjoy making a base that I could live in IRL.

I wouldn't say I'm a role player but I do enjoy making a fine house/mansion/bunker/etc.
    Just play a game to enjoy a game, you donâ€™t have to be in competition with anyone else. Have fun.
        Yeh but if you make a good looking base you get raided instantly which isn't fun after the 2-3 time it happens. I wish there was a way to make nice bases viable.
            Check my reply above. A Fritzl base is the solution! Nice roleplay house at top with a bunker underneath!
            Just play on one of the servers that encourage this, the pve servers.
                Nah because I like pvp, pve gets really boring really quick because there is no challenge to it.
                    Pvp isnâ€™t a challenge as much as itâ€™s a chore.  Itâ€™s really not that hard to pvp in rust if you have numbers too.
                    I play on low pop so sometimes it is just PvE but I enjoy clearing the monuments as efficiently as possible. Perhaps an option too?
    roleplayer bases are underrated. its all about the mind games.
    That makes you a roleplayer my friend
        Not really. I don't make small communities of life like houses with other people.
            Definition of a roleplayer. Making houses youd live in irl
                hes not a real player dude.
    Wood mansion w/100 ROCKET HQ TRI STACK BUNKER YOU WONT BELIEVE THIS
    Yeah, I build bases that are organized and easy to navigate, visually appealing, and also annoying to siege.
    You can make a meta base without it being ugly
    Just build a smaller meta base and surround it with an rp cabin exterior
    You're a Fritzl, a nice house on top and a decorated bunker underneath!
    Me too! Fresh wipe I will be in a stone 1x2x1. Later in the wipe Iâ€™ll have a few wood 1x2s (depends, sometimes stone) they hardly get messed with depending on location. 

THEN, Iâ€™ll build a big ass roomy base, and live there the rest of the wipe. Traps, dead ends, etc. itâ€™s def fun until someone pulls out the rockets.
Millennial here, this is me on wipe day because it's the only way I'll ever own a home.
    Yeah welcome to capitalism
        Capitalism allowed me to buy a house.  If I can do it, I would imagine you probably can too.
            Probly not. Canâ€™t really afford a house when they work at Starbucks lmao.

                        Same. No 3 cars but Iâ€™ve got a truck and a few motorcycles and a boat ðŸ˜‚
                            Sounds like my dad. The more dangerous jobs tend to be the higher paying ones. Would that have something to do with your situation?
                                Naa man, I got in the door tearing down aircraft engines and cleaning the parts. Iâ€™m now inspecting those said parts lol.
                                    Didn't think you could get into that kind of thing without a degree.
                            I just got a diesel to pull my boat I don't have yet. XD
                            What you doing right now?

                            Yeah I was an asshole there sorry
                Oh, I should have mentioned you would need a REAL job.
                    Damn those fake jobs. I hate how fake they are and not real.
                        A job that pays just above minimum wage isn't meant to be a career.  People that say "I can't buy a house because I'm a millenial because (insert bull shit)" are the ones working those jobs.
                    [deleted]
                        If no one "forgot" that part no one would be doing most of the jobs. But fuck those guys, right? They deserve to suffer.
                            [deleted]
                                Never meant to be a permanent job according to whom? Not FDR, who started this whole 'minimum wage' thing in the first place:

"In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By "business" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living."

        Because of globalization...
    Awwww.... one day your mummy and daddy will be dead and you might be lucky and they left you something.
only authing on a base like this should grant you roleplayer passives/bonus stats

examples: increased mic volume to yell across map, spawn with XL wood sign in hotbar, seeds planted have 4 percent chance to grow into giant magical bean stock touching the sky.
    Scream from your RP stalk, yoohoo!!!! as you rain arrows from upon high your bean camp.
looks real cosy, but not grandpa safe yet, he would just trip on the stairs everytime man.
    That's a feature, not a bug. Grandpa's got you in the will.
It's ironic. Half the people you kids call boomers are gen-x'ers or xennials. And almost everyone that the boomers call millennials are gen-z or younger.
    Ok boomer
        I know you are but what am I.
    Which I think only adds to the meme. At this point though boomer isn't even a generation but a mindset. There are young 'boomers'.
        Yeah, no.
            Okay Boomer
    I think you are wrong. Millennials call alot of Gen Z conservatives boomers. The internet thinks im a boomer if I say that people are responsible ot take care themselves and should pick a career that is able to support themselves.
I wish more people still built cool RP bases like this instead of the tacticool 2x2 bunkers that seem to be all anyone makes anymore
    Just gotta find one of the many RP villages.
        [deleted]
            That is fine no one should be storing good stuff in their RP bases anyway. Plus thats on them if they want to raid a 20 man village full of roof camper bases.
    Having a bunker is the best way to keep your stuff safe.
how do you get the triangle walls
    Just build roof next to normal wall.
        ok thanks
No, but that sounds interesting.
Can you shoot me the video link?

        boomers amirite... smh
    [Here you go sir](https://youtu.be/FveF-we6lcE) you didnâ€™t say which video you wanted so I had to guess
My summer house
I wish building bases like this was viable but people are buttplugs...
hopefully the devs add rocking chair and monster ultra zero energy drink DLC
I'd actually like it if cool looking based were viable. I hate all the honey combing bullshit it looks so ugly especially since the building in the game seems like it was created with cooler looking bases in mind. 

Idk I just hate seeing giant rectangle#4 or 3 story octagon#16 on every server.
I'm going to put one of these near my compound on the solo server I'm on next time I play.  Whoever touches it will be my "foundation raid this fucker" target.

As a millennial and a proud roleplayer, I'd like to say: 

I feel called out
I'd call myself a roleplayer for sure but it's fun dude what can I say
I wish there was a server where I could do this stuff and not get wrecked
I have 1k upvotes.
Time to get the incin rockets boys
Me literally every day lol. Rust architecture isnâ€™t dead yet folks
Unraidable
Role play yo
Ok, this is actually funny
SO I should start a server for boomers?
    Lmao Iâ€™d love to see that.
        BoxR Gaming - look it up... we're all old farts here.
I got on a server yesterday and someone asked if theres anyway to save loot through a wipe cause he lost a box of sulfer and when people told him no he started raging. Some guy in chat just said "Ok boomer"
I don't understand the boomer meme. Maybe I am getting old... I'm not even 30 yet but now there are kids turning 18 that never even saw the 90's. You all missed out on some cool shit.
    Me neither.
They're also dumping Gen-X into "boomers". 
I'm in my 40s. I'm Gen-X, and a late Gen-X at that.  
The "boomers" were my parent's generation.
        My Dad is a boomer in his late 60s now. Im deffinetly a millenial. So this meme kinda bothers the shit out of me.
I built this when i first saw the pic on rust wiki just by looking at the pic, pretty easy.
Boomer from left 4 dead 2 ?
All these people saying "fat loot" and "going deep," I just wanna grill for petes sake!
This gave me a thought; boomers are like the players who started early in the wipe and they already had all the blueprints, and millenials are players who joined late, have no blueprints, and just keep getting roof-camped by the boomers so they can't start. Then the boomers complain about the state of the server.
Get off my lawn!
Thanks for the attention you've given this shitpost, people.

If i get 1k karma i will use incin rockets on 200 nakeds and record it.
Lol op calling people boomers but he doesnâ€™t know how to use reply button on Reddit
    someoneâ€™s knowledge of Reddit has literally nothing to do with their age. Please go be negative somewhere else.
        And someoneâ€™s building abilities on Rust have nothing to do with their age either so you could say the same thing about OP
            OP posted this as a meme, thatâ€™s the entire point. It doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s young or old, thereâ€™s no way to find out if he is. You are just making retarded points that are completely invalid to the subject matter.
                Ok boomer
                    Yes, that makes sense! Lets reply with a meme because I simply can't think of a reasonable reply because hes' right.
                        Ok boomer
                            remoob ko
I love the "ok boomer" meme.


Except for the time I got ok boomered by the entire server after saying I was 27.

        OP posted this as a meme, thatâ€™s the entire point. It doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s young or old, thereâ€™s no way to find out if he is. You are just making retarded points that are completely invalid to the subject matter.

                Yes, that makes sense! Lets reply with a meme because I simply can't think of a reasonable reply because hes' right.

        These are the bases you hit on Day 2 of the wipe as you a prepping to compound your own base. Role players always horde mats.

If you see a metal door then then you know there is sulfur and HQM in the TC too. xD

    That post is as fake as your mother's love for you.
Yeh but if you make a good looking base you get raided instantly which isn't fun after the 2-3 time it happens. I wish there was a way to make nice bases viable.
    Check my reply above. A Fritzl base is the solution! Nice roleplay house at top with a bunker underneath!
    Just play on one of the servers that encourage this, the pve servers.
        Nah because I like pvp, pve gets really boring really quick because there is no challenge to it.
            Pvp isnâ€™t a challenge as much as itâ€™s a chore.  Itâ€™s really not that hard to pvp in rust if you have numbers too.
            I play on low pop so sometimes it is just PvE but I enjoy clearing the monuments as efficiently as possible. Perhaps an option too?
Not really. I don't make small communities of life like houses with other people.
    Definition of a roleplayer. Making houses youd live in irl
        hes not a real player dude.
Capitalism allowed me to buy a house.  If I can do it, I would imagine you probably can too.
    Probly not. Canâ€™t really afford a house when they work at Starbucks lmao.
