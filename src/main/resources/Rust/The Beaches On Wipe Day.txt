[[The Beaches On Wipe Day]]





Free animal fat and bones? Nice!
    Don’t forget that yummy yummy human meat Mmmmmm
        Perfect for use to catch fish too
            Ok it’s been a while since I’ve been able to play rust. There’s fish now?!
                "Survival Fish Trap". I fill them with cooked human meat in order to attract trout and minnows. Not sure if you can use raw or not but I can say for sure that cooked does work. It's something to keep from wasting anything in those early days. If I starve once or twice and guy myself for bones, day, and meat, I can use a fish trap to actually fix my food situation. Problem is that anybody can open them so they aren't exactly safe from theft.
                    I’ve been using it raw and it works
                        For both trout and minnows?
                            Yes
                                Ok then. Save me a bit on wood then
                It's been around since the XP system.
                Been in the game for years
                It's been in the game for like 3~+ years but no one ever builds it or uses it ever. I would seriously bet 1% of servers have a survival fish trap even built.
        Whenever I live near a beach or something I always kill the people who eat the other people no cannibalism on my nice beach
        So salty
    Arent they technically free anyway?
    Improvise, adapt, overcome!
    You’re about to become a statistic if you farm that
never seen one so dramatic, did facepunch release a t-rex in game or what!
    When servers make “custom” spawns.
    Could be the savas server.
        yeah thats right next to the mineshaft in savas. prime camping spot

*on D day
Good one, but this is one of the nude beaches in south California.
gonna tell my kids this was D day
This looks like rustified savas.

For those of you who don't know, rustified savas is a king of the hill server. You can only build on the hill, so the hill kills all the nakeds on the beaches. It is the most toxic server I've ever played.
    This sounds awful... ima jump on it in a bit
        Is olacattack your steam name? I feel like I've played with you before.

Btw I love the savas game mode.
            Yes
                Were you in the comfort crowd?
                    Yes I was
                        I had to check that discord. My in-game and discord is Ecstasy. I used to go by revolutionist or illenium in game.

                            Dont remember ya, sorry. This server tho... wew its bonkers
    time to go rally the troops, the new zerg army is coming
    The beach camping hill owners arnt what makes savas toxic.

The toxicity comes from it attracting every racist edgelord tween and their extended family.

Id like to thank savas for being rusts daycare
    It’s so fun but so bad

        It looks like savas because of the bodies. Doesn't mean that it is savas.

Edit: so much hate, I reworded it. Y'all happy now?

                I didn't say it was. I just said it looked like it.
                    “It is savas”
                        I meant the type of game mode. People get confused. I just said it looked like savas because all the dead nakeds.

                                No im not saying that. I'm just saying by the body count it looks like it. Play savas one time and you'll see what I mean. Bodies litter the beach like that on savas, that doesn't mean it's the savas game mode.

Looking like an [episode of Westworld.](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_955,w_1702/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2FWW-hosts-floating-in-water.jpg)
Think of all the cloth you could harvest from all that underwear.
Pretty sure that's just a quiet Savas mourning
why did you just post a picture of Bondi Beach?
Savas circa 2019

You appear on the beach rifle fire cracking around you, you rush forward only to be dropped by a roof camping BASTARD
Recreating the Zanzibar Massacre in Rust
Not social distancing. They all died of a virus from the other island. Now you understand why the scientists don't let you get close.
I have the feeling that someone could make a painting out of this and get a shit ton of money
Rust main is like this right now, except the beachhead is literally a giant cock a balls.
Awesome screenshot, added blood: [https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/g9clru/the\_beaches\_w\_blood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/g9clru/the_beaches_w_blood/)
It’s d day all over again
coincidentally this was right below a pic of a beach covered in trash, I could hardly tell the difference.
