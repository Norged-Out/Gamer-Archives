[[Is rust dull if a wipe isnâ€™t a BP wipe]]


Probably just me, but I just had a crew goes nuts on the BP wipe. No tech tree, etc. found all our high tier items on oil rigs, high monuments. Good wipe cycle.

Now it wipes, and you keep all your blueprints. You hear gunshots within the first 10 minutes, probably get raided first night. Just not a fan of hearing gunshots within 10minâ€¦. Everyone running around with their best loot almost immediately. If itâ€™s not a BP wipe itâ€™s almost pointless to wipe itâ€™s just like relocating your base.


The server I play gets wiped daily for me, because every time I log in, all I have left is the blueprints.
    Sorry Iâ€™m retarded, are you saying you get offlined every day?
        That's what I got out of it ðŸ¤£
            It's okay, I'm retarded as well and yes that's exactly what I meant.
    Rust really makes you value education
The grind is a fun one (for the most part) but as a solo with a job, wife and kid â€¦ the wipes I donâ€™t have to endlessly farm scrap are far more relaxing. 

If I was in high school or college again? Absolutely. If I was in a group to help? Absolutely. Just unfortunately not in those positions at this point.
    This is definitely true I used to play duo with a guy who was at this point in life as well and it definitely made for quicker progression and fun. We also both are not very sweaty players we die with loot who cares we will just farm more lol
        I was raising a neighbor base and ran home to make some more satchels. 

I heard 2 people talking. Dropped my raiding kit. Grabbed bone kit and dB and 4 shells. Walked outside and can hear it. I found as house like not far from mine. They were having normal people conversation like where they work and stuff. 

They're like 30s. I was just like oh hi guys what's up. I was gonna kill you. I'm burning down this guy's base rn. 

Added him on discord. He's pretty cool. 

I warned him tho his base would get eco raided if he went offline. Hecki was burning one down when I found him. But he said he had to go so I made him a new base made of stone with metal doors.
    I cannot agree any more with this.
BP wipes are the best. There's nothing like getting into a mosh pit of nakeds beating eachother senseless with rocks just to get their hands on that corpse's half broken crossbow.

On the other hand, I'm usually pretty busy so that scrap grind makes things a little slower as a solo
yeah, full wipes are much better


normal wipes are dead in 2-3 days

but the bigger issue is the games progression atm, its all fucked and needs reworking


its been said 10000 times but being able to be in the 'endgame' in 2 hours is fucked up
    Yep, rush AK-->kill server, then get offlined 4am is the same every wipe.

No point rebuilding cause your gona get offlined and now since its not wipeday anymore you wont find people off their roofs, and the degen 0skill roofcampers got guns and the pvp is 0 skill and heavily roofcamp advantage (0 ttk) so goodluck have fun post wipeday.
        With everything I've heard about the AK for the past few days, I sort of want to see an experiment where the AK is removed for a wipe on a server and see which other guns rise to the top. I guess the LR would be attempted as a replacement but I'm sure things would be mixed up overall to some extent or another.
            There would be no difference people would roam Tomys and roofcamp with bolts/l96s/m249s.

Instead of nerfing the only usefull gun, you buff the useless guns.

People make AKS as its one of the few guns that actually shoots where you aim close/med range, its still a gamble gun long range, ak vs ak snow/desert/excavator/openfield fights are still 100% coinflip.
            Sar and lr for sure. They're very strong despite the ak
    I think the ocean based monuments are a problem/too op. if you get on oil rig it is so hard for people to counter compared to land based monuments and the loot is crazy. Anything that gives crazy loot/ multiple guns in one run should be easy to counter. Like I remember back in the day (Maybe a bit of this is nostalgia) but when heli got taken everyone was running to it, nowadays its a bit like yeah what ever because there are so many other things to do as well. And then Things like cargo/oil rig if you're first on it's pretty easy to hold you hear them coming you know where they are coming from. counters have to buy boats/mini.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to fully fix the issue but in my mind ocean monuments  need to be nerfed and there probaly need to be fewer monuments per map.
        They should just honestly remove safezones/re add recyclers to oil (it helps solos/small groups more then anyone) and make minicopters spawn on roads like they used to so people can counter cargo/oil not caring about the minicopter (750 scrap).
            Yeah I think they should get rid of safezones, maybe not all of them but they probably shouldn't have recyclers there, the least they can do is make the safe zone  recyclers  worse than the ones where you actually have to risk your loot to use. Also I'm not too sure about the mini's I'm not even really too sure I like them in the game, I think it makes a bit too easy to transfer loot avoid fights and everything
                Yeap, imo they re-release the hardcore game mode with no map(or must explore it to draw it on your map), no heli/cars/horse/balloon, no water monuments, no safe zone, no tech tree, no quarries, no team ui. And maybe with old recoil. All of these in some way promote more boots on ground which is what made the game so fun all those years ago.
                    I actually don't think horses are bad personally but yeah alot of those changes would be good, I remember back in the day I used to just look at dome and then find out where I was based on that
        Or buff smaller monuments. The loot at water treatment is underwhelming for a blue card. Like 2 military crates with electrical garbage. The monument looks so fun for pvp with its many up and down structures and tunnels. Ain't nobody there. You go to dome? Ain't nobody there most the time.
            Probably a bit of both tbh, but I think monuments that are in the middle of nowhere and harder to counter (oil rig) should give less loot than land based monuments that are easy to counter
                Higher risk and reward, I hear.
    ridiculous to imply itâ€™s not partially the games fault, but honestly the playerbase optimizing everything to perfection is mostly to blame. Fortnite used to actually be fun when nobody knew how to build, but now it sucks and is purely uncompelling build spam build fights.
    What about making finding items at rad towns more random, rather than the same loot spawn points each time? Make it harder to find boxes, but also make blueprints a physical item you must keep stored inside your workbenches in order to craft the item. This would make it so people can raid you for your progression on top of your loot. Some raiders would probably leave behind some BPs they wouldn't need, and so new players to the server could have more chances to scavenge BPs. BPs would also be more prevalent in player shops. This also means your teammates can all share BPs.

The only way this would be possible would be in a completely perpetual game, no wipes. However, that would likely ruin map generation, although I'm not sure their plan yet for the server nexus thing but that could help keep maps fresh.

A wipeless game would make communities more common, as villages would only have to be raided to go away. And if you are concerned about losing your progression, simply hide your good BPs elsewhere in your base, or another base or stash until you need it again to craft.
    nah, I play on a monthly with no bp wipes and im currently in a que. just take more care picking your server
        Okay, and as a new player you'd for sure be able to make a start and go to monuments, right?
            I guess that's the sort of thing a new player might do.

Not very time efficient though. If your trying to get guns and stuff I'd just farm crude and hqm on the sea then drone it to bandit. from there you can exchange them for guns or fertilizer or whatever you need. Then you can exchange the fertilizer for scrap. buy smoke grenades and recycle them. Now you have lots of gunpowder, metal and guns. 

Go have fun, maybe go to monuments or whatever
                > Go have fun, maybe go to monuments or whatever

Literally joined a monthly wipe, like you said, and this is impossible?


Lighthouse is covered in turrets


Mining outposts/supermarkets are all dominated by roof campers


Quarries walled off


Other monuments are entirely walled off, like, 20 grids of a wall (because this is fun & fair, right)


Roads are turreted with silenced bolties in bushes



the game just becomes so unfun so quickly, wipe day really is just uncontested
                    That's fair man, sounds like monthly servers with no bp wipes aren't for you. 

I'm a solo with a full time job. I find monuments boring. I also like messing around with traps and electrics and junk so they work for me
    Idea: Cost of progression changes based on the nunber of players on your TC ðŸ¤”
Yeah no I'm a fan of full wiping bps and all
Even tho rust is in a shit state, i always try to play force as its the only part of the game where prim pvp exists, if its not a bp wipe people roam guns 20m in, shit gets stale fast.

On monthly servers guns go for 50-100 sulfur its just sad and people still roofcamp with gear fear.
The grind makes people roam a lot more. I enjoy it
I used to be much more excited for Bp wipes. But as time went on, I started caring about them less, and they became more of an inconvenience.
I'm in the same boat. For me, rust's soul is progression. You start on the beach and slowly climb the food chain. Starting with BPs is antithetical to that, it's like if you started a game of LoL with half your levels already. I don't understand getting BPs on the last day of wipe in order to have them all at the start of the next one. 

Also, tech tree is another big enemy of interesting progression. No more having to look for items in crates and trading, just camp underwater labs, recycle, and you're endgame.
It depends on how you play. No lifers will have all the BP's within a day or 2. A small clan on all day will unlock everything quickly and get bored quickly. 

Solo's who have things like a job or family can only spend a few hours here and there. It takes a week or 2 to unlock key items. They spend the later half of the month enjoying those items. If the BP's wiped every week, they wouldn't play.
BP wipes: the biggest, smelliest zergs have guns and you have a grind

No BP wipes: the biggest, smelliest zergs have guns and you don't have to do boring shit to get basic stuff like pistol ammo or weapon flashlight

thanks but i like spending my game time doing literally anything but slapping trees to feed small furnaces
    Amen. Nothing will keep those who can put in 8 hours a day from being fully kitted in 3 days, BP wipe or no. I can hardly get in 8 hours a week, so no BP wipes work well for me.
No BP Wipe > BP Wipe. 

Full wipes are a predictable race for BPs. If you are coordinated and get ahead you can still be raiding within 3-6 hours even as a small group starting from scratch.

The game is designed for monthly wipes where you can join 1 week in and still have fun, not a race on wipe day to get BPs before your enemies.
    I believe you guys think this game is designed for month wipes but its not worked out like that in reality. Just look at how frequent your community servers wipe, most people don't play full month wipes because progression is broken.

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
    Just curious: has the topic of server-based progression ever been brought up to throttle the BP race and time-gate phases? 

IE: instead of *just* individual progress unlocking BPs, the *server* instead helps 'research teams' at select monuments progress towards a community goal to develop prototypes. Meanwhile, the individual unlock mechanics remain the same. Once prototypes are discovered, players can 'copy' them at a monument to paper, bring those schematics back to base, and then 'learn them' by crafting them the normal way. 

That way you can time-gate several real-time days of primitive behind things like electric furnaces, solar panels, windmill, rockets etc., Plus those could serve as a resource sink. 

(So basically: server-wide benchmark of 10k 'research progress' is met, prototype schematics drop to Arctic Research Base at 18:00 real-world time, player visits arctic research with paper, copies from one of four locations/computers, deposits that into their workbench, and then can use scrap to learn the BP). 

To prevent severe hoarding of resources and force 'server contribution,' which was a major issue during the XP system, lore wise something like 'acid raid' could force farm & components to 'decay' so teams can only hoard for a small time window of time during the primitive stages. Late stage research could eventually *completely remove this mechanic.* This would prevent teams from having 3-days of farm saved up before something like SARs drop. So basically, early wipe is 'use it or lose it, or donate it.'  

Donations could be incentivized with certain thresholds. Perhaps give certain blueprints that data-mining discovers are not typically used by small teams. Perhaps reward a crate which has powerful items determined by 'current server research'. Perhaps a chance at a 'black cards' which is either only usable late wipe or *perhaps for some kind of long-term currency for some unique unlockable untradeable cosmetics, like the scientist hazmat skin or missed Twitch rewards.* 

If a server goal is met, you could even determine the real-time hour that said prototypes permanently 'drop' to monuments once unlocked. Naturally, some 'prototype drops' could result in some pretty amazing threshold events (like the drop of satchels, SARs, AKs, etc.,) and probably should be recognized (IE every 24th cargo ship delivers any P3-T3 unlocked prototype.) Less important ones could just drop as progress is made. This way peak server hours could create an equal playing field when things like SARs hit in a rat-race & monumental control meta.
    This could at very least slow down each tier a bit: https://rust.nolt.io/33990
    so why are you not correcting progression to be a monthly progression instead of 3 hours?  why does FP endorse 'official' servers with everything modifiedWhen is the next PTW dlc?    


Why not just make the game where you log in with an AK.. like csgo.. seems popular and sells a lot of skins.
This is a big reason that the 'remove tech tree' argument falls flat with me.

Lots of the most popular servers don't wipe bp's at all, even on forced wipe.  And the ones that do, like the one you played on, it only impacts the first wipe cycle of the month.  On weekly/biweekly wipes people can get on towards the end of wipe and farm bp's pretty easily, even without tech tree.

But I digress..  Yeah that 2nd week doesn't quite pack the punch that force wipe does.  Lots of teams will have bp's and rush guns immediately and lots of other groups/solos have no bp's and stay permanently behind.  It tends to make everyone rich/poor with nothing inbetween.

Sounds counterintuitive but vanilla's where bp's don't ever wipe can be super fun.  Monthly servers like moose, topia large, reddit, etc. never wipe bp's and sooo many people have bp's on there.  It almost plays like a 2x because people only need scrap for workbenches.  The rest people buy frags, cloth, turrets, horses, heli's, etc.  Shit can get really hectic which is cool.  Also if you want to farm some scrap it tends to be pretty easy because everyone isn't trying to do the same thing. It opens up a lot of different play styles.  There's some biweekly's that don't wipe as well.  Moose biweekly leaps to mind.  I love that server 2 weeks after forced wipe.  Weekly Monday's that don't wipe bp's are fun as hell too.  Everyone has bp's but it's cool.. they only stay busy for 2 days until Thursday anyway and it's just kind of a shitshow that entire time.
People dont have Tommies/AK's 10 minutes into the wipe because they crafted them. They looted them from mil crates or did milked them from oil rig. High End monument loot is busted if you have a clan to milk them with bows.

Servers die because of offline raiding and the first weekend after the wipe is where the tryhards and sweats get their dopamine. If a server survives the first weekend and its cheaters, its gucci for the month.
Thank god they donâ€™t wipe BP every wipe, people have lives outside of this game
No. Why should Blueprints wipe at all? There are certain things that require a lot of effort that stay with your character even if you get killed. So just look at Blueprints as character stats (Health, Stamina, Strength, Agility, etc...) in other video games. They are vital part of your character that it doesn't make sense for them to reset.  This would only hurt solo players more big groups are gonna get weapons faster than anyone else regardless.
    Ofc the larger groups will grind scrap faster, but having everyone lose their BPs helps to level the playing field, even if it's only a little.

Instead of needing 550 scrap to craft a tommy (just enough for t1 and t2), they'll need much more because they'll have to research down, so you won't ne getting gunned down while you're still in a 2x1 starter.
        They should even make it harder to progress, 2023 rust its easier to progress on a vanilla server then it was to progress on a 3x server in 2020 rust.
I used to love playing servers with bp wipes for the progress, but lots of servers no longer have bp wipes anymore. 

With the NO BP wipe stuff, we always have thousands of scrap in the base just from recycling, and we really only use it to buy SAM sites and turrets.

IDK maybe T3 stuff should always wipe or something, or boom, guns idk.
I play solo on a server that doesn't wipe BPs now, so  IMO no but everyone has different things they like. Some get bored when they have loot and want to start over, others want to go roam and pvp till they get raided or do a ton of raids.
Yes.

It's okay for short wipes, IMO, 3-5 days or so.
BPs are part of what little there is left of Rustâ€™s progression. Itâ€™s not a great progression system and is broken because in any event even with BPs wiping, big clans can get AKs and T3 wipes within a couple of hours of a wipe. 

But on a non-BP wipe server - you stand no chance at wipe unless you have BPs already. Progression is completely broken. The only way no BP wipes are fun is when youâ€™re on a big team and you just want to quickly build a base and war against other big teams who also have BPs. Wipes in those games are really only fun for a few days.
The only people that are against BP wipes struggle to get a T3 bench. I maybe play this game 2-3 days a week on average and have zero issues. It's all about tempering your expectations and learning to live off the T2 bench if things don't go your way. Don't overbuild or get overly invested with time/energy each wipe.
It depends how you play. You play for the rush of loot, I play for the control of the map. Git gud kiddo
Different strokes for different folks. I canâ€™t dedicate a huge amount of time playing this game so BP wipes are not fun for me.
Sorry Iâ€™m retarded, are you saying you get offlined every day?
    That's what I got out of it ðŸ¤£
        It's okay, I'm retarded as well and yes that's exactly what I meant.

Added him on discord. He's pretty cool. 

I warned him tho his base would get eco raided if he went offline. Hecki was burning one down when I found him. But he said he had to go so I made him a new base made of stone with metal doors.
With everything I've heard about the AK for the past few days, I sort of want to see an experiment where the AK is removed for a wipe on a server and see which other guns rise to the top. I guess the LR would be attempted as a replacement but I'm sure things would be mixed up overall to some extent or another.
    There would be no difference people would roam Tomys and roofcamp with bolts/l96s/m249s.

Instead of nerfing the only usefull gun, you buff the useless guns.

People make AKS as its one of the few guns that actually shoots where you aim close/med range, its still a gamble gun long range, ak vs ak snow/desert/excavator/openfield fights are still 100% coinflip.
    Sar and lr for sure. They're very strong despite the ak
They should just honestly remove safezones/re add recyclers to oil (it helps solos/small groups more then anyone) and make minicopters spawn on roads like they used to so people can counter cargo/oil not caring about the minicopter (750 scrap).
    Yeah I think they should get rid of safezones, maybe not all of them but they probably shouldn't have recyclers there, the least they can do is make the safe zone  recyclers  worse than the ones where you actually have to risk your loot to use. Also I'm not too sure about the mini's I'm not even really too sure I like them in the game, I think it makes a bit too easy to transfer loot avoid fights and everything
        Yeap, imo they re-release the hardcore game mode with no map(or must explore it to draw it on your map), no heli/cars/horse/balloon, no water monuments, no safe zone, no tech tree, no quarries, no team ui. And maybe with old recoil. All of these in some way promote more boots on ground which is what made the game so fun all those years ago.
            I actually don't think horses are bad personally but yeah alot of those changes would be good, I remember back in the day I used to just look at dome and then find out where I was based on that
Or buff smaller monuments. The loot at water treatment is underwhelming for a blue card. Like 2 military crates with electrical garbage. The monument looks so fun for pvp with its many up and down structures and tunnels. Ain't nobody there. You go to dome? Ain't nobody there most the time.
    Probably a bit of both tbh, but I think monuments that are in the middle of nowhere and harder to counter (oil rig) should give less loot than land based monuments that are easy to counter
        Higher risk and reward, I hear.
Okay, and as a new player you'd for sure be able to make a start and go to monuments, right?
    I guess that's the sort of thing a new player might do.

Not very time efficient though. If your trying to get guns and stuff I'd just farm crude and hqm on the sea then drone it to bandit. from there you can exchange them for guns or fertilizer or whatever you need. Then you can exchange the fertilizer for scrap. buy smoke grenades and recycle them. Now you have lots of gunpowder, metal and guns. 

Go have fun, maybe go to monuments or whatever
        > Go have fun, maybe go to monuments or whatever

Literally joined a monthly wipe, like you said, and this is impossible?


Lighthouse is covered in turrets


Mining outposts/supermarkets are all dominated by roof campers


Quarries walled off


Other monuments are entirely walled off, like, 20 grids of a wall (because this is fun & fair, right)


Roads are turreted with silenced bolties in bushes



the game just becomes so unfun so quickly, wipe day really is just uncontested
            That's fair man, sounds like monthly servers with no bp wipes aren't for you. 

I'm a solo with a full time job. I find monuments boring. I also like messing around with traps and electrics and junk so they work for me
They should even make it harder to progress, 2023 rust its easier to progress on a vanilla server then it was to progress on a 3x server in 2020 rust.
It's okay, I'm retarded as well and yes that's exactly what I meant.
