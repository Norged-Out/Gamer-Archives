[[I made a quick reference chart for all monster elementailment weaknesses and weak parts. Enjoy!]]





Small error on great jagras:
Should be weak point: great jagras
    Lol, you right, you right
    Weak point: button mashing
        Button mashing is its elemental weakness, not its weak point
Updated version: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
    This is amazing thanks so much.  Imo ultimate version would have their icons for multi Monster investigates when people don't know them all like me.  And a note on some to right, like xev can't be ridden or odagaron gem carve only etc.

Wouldn't expect u to go through all that lol just what I thought of.  Will be printing this at work tomorrow! Heh
    PM the Mods and tell them to put this in the sidebar! Thanks again for the taking the time!!!
    so the "x" in a monsters weakness chart that indicates to which element/ailment the monster is immune automatically means thats also the type of damage the monster is doing?
Barroth mud/no-mud needs to be swapped.
    You are correct! I will make the changes. Thank you!
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
    Also i would count head weak for blunt weapon users
Hammerbros everwhere - SMASH HEAD!
    Side question: what's the community-preferred nomenclature for ladies with hammers? If it's still "hammerbro", I'm okay with that, just wondering :)
        Hammerbroads
            Most underrated comment of the year
        Hammerbro is just a term like Mankind. 
            Groovy, thank you :)
        Mallet maid.
            Take your upvote 😂 I set my guild card title as "Bride of Hammer".
    Me strong me break parts!
    I started on the Horn, and still love it,  but soloing took FOREVER. Switched to a Hammer Bro. No doots, but twice the head smashing. Keep your combos. Me smash. 
        I want to try out the horn out. So you find that when soloing stuff, it is not exactly great?
            It just takes longer. Don’t expect to solo those 20 min investigations. Other than that, it’s a blast. Using earplugs and that walloping something as it roars is a great feeling. When I used healing horns I never used potions, so that was pretty cool too
                Nice! I have zero clue how the damn thing works, but I'm sure a little time in the training area will fix that.
                    Definitely. It’s pretty simple. Swing to build up songs, and then play them. Don’t think there are only three ways to hit something, however. You have hits with movement, aerial, mounting, and , of course, the actual playing of songs. Lots of dodging, and you’ll probably want your palico running defense. I love the flash fly cage, but the shield thing is very helpful. 
    Are the Horn players like a second cousin to hammer bros?

As a horn player I hate Barroths rocky head. But at least he's easy
        Your attacks don't go through with the second-tier Self Improvement song?
            Honestly I havent fought barroth in a while, I was pretty new to the horn. But yeah that makes sense
        This is how I picture everyone's favourite [Dootsters.](https://youtu.be/RYOOa087YZE?t=55s)

        This chart makes it seem like nothing is immune/strong vs Poison except for Zorah Magdaros.

Is that true?  I just made a Poison Charge Blade that I am enjoying.
            Pukei Pukei is strong against it since it is his element!
I will be updating the chart with what element they use soon, which is basically what they are strong/immune to as well.
            0 is immune, 1 is strong against. 
            Nice, I may try that (though if I recall, I need a ton of Rathalos shit for it)! I'm a CB user too, been rocking the water one (Leaf?) since I'm just at Coral and lots of monsters (Barroth, Anjanath, Jury) seem to be weak to water.

I have a poison bow I use, but so far it feels underwhelming. Probably b/c one can only carry 20 coatings in the pouch at a time. Do you find the poison increases the speed at which you kill stuff?
                I never use the coatings (because I don't understand them, honestly) but just having poison on the weapon's stats seems to help quite a bit.  You'll get a few hits in on some enemies and then you'll see 8-10 health tick off of them for a while as they run around poisoned. It doesn't always happen and I don't quite understand the pattern or logic but it is often enough to be a nice bonus.

That's always nice when it happens.  I do just as much damage with my heavy hits as my old 700+ damage hammer even though the actual damage is listed as far less on the charge blade.

90% of my swings are in the two-handed axe mode, though.
            That CB lasted me quite a while.  It's quite nice.
        I just realized this one is missing Lavasloth.
    Just printed out this one. This will come in handy. Thanks for looking out friend!
    Ooh, it is pretty! I would probably get distracted by all the colors though, lol
    This one is missing Lavisoth. Otherwise, I do like the visual layout better. 
        Lavasloth* 
            Lavasioth*
        Also kushala daora
    so you should not use 1* elements for a monster?

is 2* = no bonus, no penalty?
Thanks for this! Minor spelling mistake in Diablos though. (Diabolos means the pellets for pellet guns in spanish)

Could you add to it the best armor type vs each monster? I never know that one
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
        Was looking everywhere for this. The book in the game does a pretty good job of showing monster weaknesses but doesn't say anything about what element it uses against you. Thanks a bunch this is great!
            Sure thing dude! Glad it can be of use
    Good idea! I can put what element they use on the updated version.
        Thank god! Bless you for this

Hello everyone! Here is an updated version of the chart that includes the attack element that a monster uses, as well as their resistances. Hope this helps! https://imgur.com/a/ngtmr

Error on the barroth mud is weak to water and no mud is fire* you had it backwards bro
    My bad duderino! Someone else pointed it out too. Will be fixed ASAP.
        Not a problem bro! Im happy to help if i can!

Now I know why I like killing Tobi Kodachi so much to upgrade my bows. All dem thunder weaks!

    Yeah, Kirin is a butt :( So fast!!

    To have the optimal setup for the fight, yes. To be able to kill the monster, no.
        [deleted]
            Best in slot is going to depend on your play style and weapon. Gear with speed sharpening may be best in slot for an IG but worthless to an LB. so best in slot is hard to peg down.

Also if a monsters set bonus can outweigh the benefits of running individual pieces that can factor in too.

I mean this is my first MH so I’m still new myself, but the game has a very fluid feel to armor, sometimes one setup will feel OP other times you’ll want other gear.
            By end game you should aim to have one weapon for each element and mainly swap that. Changing your armor for a fight is only REALLY needed if your armor has a significant elemental weakness
    You don't *need* one, but if you're struggling to complete a hunt, exploiting weaknesses might help.
    Yessirree! Certain monsters are stronger or weaker to certain elements or status effects. I will be adding the strengths in the next update, which I am making now.
For example, Anjanath uses fire so he is strong against fire. He is weak to water, then thunder and ice secondly, so you would use a water weapon against him if possible. There are multiple weapons in the game that you can make that have different elements and status effects, as well as different armor that is strong against certain elements and weak to others.
Hope that helps!
Soooo hit em in the face. Got it
    Haha yeah, it is a common weak spot!
I feel like Xeno had two elements that he was weaker against than the others. But the information from the research guy said all equal 2 star. But if you look at the armor you craft from him I believe it revealed fire/dragon being stronger than the others. For every other monster the armor you make from it matches the weaknesses you see from the researchers (as far as I can remember) but for Xeno it did not match. So maybe some research is needed on this.

edit: thank you for going through the trouble to make this
    Yeah, Xeno is a little fuzzy because not many people have fought him. I made this based off of the monsters's in-game info, so his was a little vague.
Thank you for the info! Hope you enjoy the chart!
        Yup tyvm and your totally right. We just need more info of the armor matches the descriptions or not. 
Do the raths count for pink and blue as well?
    Oops! Small adjustment- the azure secondary is ice, not thunder. Pink is the same. My apologies!
        Thanks I've been working on blue the last few days just can't drop him quick enough.
            Aw man, keep at it! It's worth it
                [Got him](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/XDsRc7y) and a plate to boot.
                    ୧༼ ヘ ᗜ ヘ ༽୨ Woot wooooot! Congrats, dude!!
                        Thanks just when you think you can't love the game anymore.
                I'll have him soon.
            Ensure you have flash bombs and combinations, he's a pain in the skies. 

Also ancient potion, max potion, armorskin and demondrug if you feel you need the extra attack.

Having good armor really helps, I used todachi as it had an evade extender skill which was great for evading.

Happy hunting!
                I just need to main line demondrug I can get near death but I run out of time because of interference.

                        I've cut and carved his tail so many times that when I finally killed him I had everything I needed for his weapon.

thanks!  For your next version would you mind sorting column A from A to Z for quick reference?
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png

This has to be the most readable monster guide yet. 
Not to take away from OPs hard work, but there is something like this in the Google play store. Every game made, someone thankfully makes a quick reference like this. I just typed in "Monster Hunter World guide" and it's the 1st one in list. Unsure if there is one for iPhone users, probably. 
    Huh, I just found it. That's pretty cool!
        Still yet, thank you for doing this! I always find myself running to the workshop to check on monster weaknesses...and that's if I have any parts from that monster. That or constantly googling haha. Nice to have a quick reference on your phone. 
            Sure thing! Yeah, I found myself constantly looking up weaknesses and I just got really tired of it.
            Also no need to run all the way there, your Hunter's Notes from the Start menu contains all the monster info you've collected!
As somebody who only watches out for weaknesses and elements when I try to solo the last monster ever since PS2, i say nice work but i doubt i'll be using it XD.

Don't have -20 ice resistance against Legiana is not funny XD.
Funny thing is I have yet to die once.
    Nice xDDDD me haven't died yet too since not dying and fainting have fun xDDDDD I play on -100 all resist and LMAO not even be hit!!! xDDD
I have something similar myself. Not weak parts though. Shortened some stuff like Thunder to Thund. No mud = /nm etc to make it print well in landscape mode.
https://i.imgur.com/4lyIi5R.png
You da real MVP. *claps hands*
This is great! Perfect for someone like me who looks up info constantly on the phone while dashing to the chest
    I'm glad you like it! I was doing the same thing, so I figured I'd go ahead and make it simpler for everyone.
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Thank you, kind sir.
    Sure thing! :)
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
        So, kind sir. Am I allowed to create a more readfriendly version of this sheet? I don't want to be credited. It will be the same sheet but with visually improvements if you don't mind.
            Sure, go for it. I can give you a link to the Google doc if you like. I just tried to keep it simple and easy to read. :)
                Short question: On Bazel's Weakparts you wrote "Head, Tail, Wings" ... 3 categories? It happens like 2 or 3 times in your sheet.

Do you seperate them into Primary, Secondary etc? Or is it all just Primary? 

Anajanth f.e. you Wrote "Head/Nose, Tail".

I need this information just for better understanding and re-creating this sheet.
                    Happens for Bazel and Zorah
                    I also have small problems in unterstanding the "Attack Elements/Resitances" section. Could you explain? 

Is the first one the element the monster attacks with and the second word his resistance? Or how is that build up?
                        some doesn't have slashes in that section, does that mean they dont have any resistances?
                    I put it in the key at the top of the page, but a lot of people missed it.
The weakness of parts is rated 0-3 stars in the game. Slashes (i.e. fire/water) indicates both parts were rated with 3 stars. Comma separates primary from secondary, secondary being the second one.
Hope that helps!
                        thing is: sometimes you write double commas. seperating primary to secondary and then to some third criteria.
                            Ah, I see what you mean! I mainly did that to list all weak parts, even if they were not as highly rated. I could see how that could be confusing, my bad.
                                okay. you know what? You inspire me to do something big. I will release it here and credit you for that. But it will take some time. It'll be great.
                                    Go for it dude! It takes time but it's worth it :)
Thank you!

    (ಥ﹏ಥ) thank you, that means a lot!!
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
As a new hunter can anyone save me a google and explain the difference between ailment and regular weakness?
    Elements add extra damage to hits. Ailments cause status effects to monsters (i.e. enough hits with stun ailment will stun the monster for a couple of seconds)
    Elemental weakness: what element they are weak to. Fire, water, etc. There are different elemental weapons that are better against different monsters.
Ailments: think of it like status effects. Some monsters are more resistant to certain status effects but weaker to others, like Pukei-Pukei is a poison monster so he doesn't get poisoned easily, but he is easier to make go to sleep or paralyze.
Hope that helps!
        Very helpful. Thank you. Also is one more viable than the other. For instance i have a thunder CB and a poison CB. whats the better choice for say a Legiana hunt? 
            Typically elemental is pretty useful to have from what I know. Status effects are helpful but elemental is more flat damage I think.
Honestly you ideally want both, for example if you are playing with friends one person use each type of weapon, or use armor that gives you extra weakness damage (for example, Legiana you could use a Thunder weapon, then use armor that gives extra poison attack).
I hope that makes sense! All the information is very important for a fight, so keep in mind elemental and ailment weakness, not just one or the other.
                Alrighty. Thanks again for the help. Happy hunting.
                    Same to you! C:
        Five years late here. But holy shit thank you so much for this. Been trying to find the difference for half an hour and all I’ve been getting is some crazy stuff I don’t understand lol

Whats the "*" mean next to the name? I see kirin on it but havent fought the others...
    The asterisk indicates that it is an elder dragon! :)
        Ok gotcha
How do you find out what a monsters elemental weaknesses are if you weren't going to Google it or look at a chart? That's always confused me.
    There are available in the game via research. You can find it under Info>Hunter's Notes>Monster Field Guide. :)
        Thank you!
            Sure thing! Happy hunting!
                You as well:)
So how does elemental damage on the weapons work? Is it stacked with the physical damage?
    Element adds on top.

Monsters tend to have high physical resistance (which is why your 500 attack weapon does 20 damage). Using a weapon wth the correct element will add proportionally more damage.

You can also choose to run elementless weapons with skills for bonus elementless damage as a general option for multi-monster hunts.

You can also run a status weapon rather than an element (poison, blast, etc.)

Ultimately just don’t choose a weapon they’re strong against and you’ll be fine.
        awesome! thanks so much man 
    I believe so! I'm not exactly sure, I just know it makes the monster die faster. 乁༼☯‿☯✿༽ㄏ
        so a weapon with 100 physical damage and 100 elemental damage would be better than a weapon with 185 physical damage? I tried looking o line but can't find any answers 😭
            I'll be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure. This is my first MH game so I'm still learning.
Any other hunters care to chime in? o:
                we're some noobs in need

    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Would monster element be helpful too? Like, which resists I would need against the monster? I try to use armor that is resistant against the element a monster uses. Or, should I even care about this and go mostly for defense?

IE: For fighting Kirin, I have armor with the most thunder resistance. 
    Absolutely! Obviously regular defense is super important too, but element resistance is veeeery important.
In the update I'm currently working on, I'll list those as well. :)
    Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
        Awesome thanks! Great job.
Nice chart, any chance we can see the reverse? Be it what elements/ailments each monster can deal to a hunter and the best armor sets to use against.
    You got it! I am in the process of updating this chart with just that. Thanks for the suggestion!

Excellent reference sheet for those who don’t know how to use the Monster Field Guide.

Probably a rookie question here but:
Can I add a [Insert Ailment Damage here] decoration to a [Insert Elemental Damage here] weapon to create hybrid affliction weapons?
Such as adding a Poison Attack decoration to a Water weapon or vice versa, a Water Attack decoration to a Poison weapon?
    I believe it has to be the same element to make any difference, though I'm only about 90% sure.
        That’s exactly how I’m thinking!
I’m hoping for that 10% chance where you can make an awesome hybrid.
I’m at work right now but I’m hoping to test it out in about... ugh, 7 hours.
            Good luck! Just think of all the hunting you can do after you get off of work, that always helped me waste time. :P
    I believe you can add coatings to bows with decorations but I'm not sure of other weapons yet
    you can't add effects to weapons, only enhance the ones it currently has
So what do you think element wise would cover the most if you only had two or three elements. I’m currently using a dragon one and wondering what I should farm for next
    Thunder and water are pretty widely useable tbh. Fire is good too however
do the weakness differ between pink rathian, Azure rathalos, black Diabolos and the regular versions?
    There are two differences:
-azure rathian is weak to ice (as listed on chart)
-black Diablos is immune to fire/dragon, and weak to ice (not listed). Thank you for asking, I will update with black Diablos included next
        thank you!
Now post the motion value and part modifier.
    I'm dedicated, but not THAT dedicated. xD
Tank you, was thinking of making on, but never Come to do it. 
    Sure thing! Glad I could save you the trouble. :)
Cheater
You ain't a real hunter if you use these cheats. 
    ? They are listed in the game in the same way, just a little less organized. I don't see this as cheating? Sorry you think so, though.
        I'm just poking fun.  This is cool BUT,  it downplays an important system created by Capcom to use the Monster Guide as a reference. Instead of whipping out the pseudo book,  looking up the Monster,  slowly memorizing each monsters weakens. This quick check guide is a lot less engaging and in turn will make it less likely people will memorize the weakness's etc. 
            Ahh, I gotcha. That does make sense for the hardcore and immersion factor of the game.
Thanks for the input! Happy hunting :)
                Of course,  thanks again for taking the time to make the guide.  We appreciate it.  Happy hunting 
So basically make sure to have a good Thunder weapon and then an Ice weapon!!
    For real!! Poison is helpful too
        Exactly! For people who can’t make everything, the best combination to have is Thunder, Ice, Poison, and finally Dragon with elderseal to cover all your bases and farming needs.
Saving this shit right now! Thanks!
    Sure thing! In case you didn't see it, here is the updated version with attack elements too: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Now can someone please make one of these for the other way around? As in, what damage they deal to you?
    Done! The updated version has it here: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
I would post it again but I don't think it's allowed.
        So what you're telling me, is that not a single monster in the game uses blast damage.
            I mostly included blast with fire to keep it simple. If that does not make sense I can change it in a later update.
What does secondary mean?
as seen in xeno jiiva
    So in the game, in the Monster Guide, the elemental weaknesses and ailment weaknesses are rated by 0-3 stars. Primary means it is rated with 3 stars, and secondary means it is rated 2 stars.
Hope this helps!
        Meaning he does not have a real weakness (3*) but have elements that are better then average(2*) against him? 

Yup, thanks!
            Correct! I figured having 2 star weakness was better than none. Happy hunting!
Grear chart, but could you add the one thing that the in game one doesn't give me either? What the monster attacks with lol. I need this info.
    Yep, done in the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
        Nice, thanks a bunch 
            Sure thing! Happy hunting!
I actually set this as my wallpaper so I can quick glance on my lock screen instead of going into my hunter notes. Thanks OP
    Sure thing dood. Be sure to use the updated version: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Good looking out!!
    Glad you like it!
You're a bro. 
    Aw yeah B)
Should add a "Tail Severable? Y/N" column at the end. 


Wait, are there monsters whose tails can't be severed??
    Ooh, that is a very good idea! Will keep in mind for next update. Thank you!
    A common alternative to "severed" is "broken". You can break certain tails (and get the "part broken" popup) but they will never come flying off for an extra carve.
        No I totally get that you can "break" all of their tails, but in the way that you can "sever" the tails so that it drops a lootable tail and reduces range on their tail attacks... is that every monster?
            Some, like Legiana and Paolumu (just off the top of my head), can only have their tails "broken". They won't fall off. In the Hunter's Notes it will let you know whether the tail is severable.
This is now my Lock Screen. Thanks!
    Sure thing! Be sure to use the updated version here: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
You my friend are my new favorite person!!! 
Cheers!
    Glad you like it!! :)
U da real mvp
    B) thanks duderino
I'm new to the series and I'm just wondering when would it ever be better to use a weapon with a status ailment over a weapon with elemental damage?  To me it seems less useful
    Honestly, both are very important. I usually prioritise element over status because you don't want to use something that the monster is strong against, but again, both are pretty vital to a fight.
I've been using this one: https://www.docdroid.net/1B6t7wQ/mhwchart.pdf for the past week or so. If anyone knows the author, please let me know! I love it. Would like to know if he updated it. Also, in the original post he had a link to helpful tips for most of the bosses but I can't find that link anymore :/
    Aw man, is that supposed to be opened in a specific app? I opened it via reddit and it was a hot mess. :( kudos to the creator though!
        It's a PDF so it should work just fine.  I open it up in firefox and it works great.
Awesome, thank you
Nice and if capcom decide to buff the elemental damage, then I can play some of the cool CB, but for now it seems raw is king.
    It depends on the weapon type you're using. Raw is generally better on slower hitting weapons, while elemental is generally better on faster hitting ones that do less damage per strike normally. That being said, there's always variances, particularly when you start taking into account things like sharpness and affinity, as well as what skills you have equipped on your armor.....
Thank you!
Thank you for a great job. Much appreciated!
dont know if it's been said before but I'm pretty sure dodogama's bulky stomach is a weak point aswell :p
Where were you a day ago when I did all this by hand lol 
What’s secondary mean under ailment?
    Weakness is rated 0-3 stars in the game. Secondary means it only has 2 stars since some monsters had no 3 star ailment weaknesses. :)
Sorry for the dumb question, but what does Ailment mean? Primary?
    Ailment is status effects i.e. poison, stun, paralysis, etc. They are rated 0-3 stars, primary means 3 stars, secondary means 2 stars.
Hope that helps!
I think if people aren't looking at the monster guide the game has provided then people deserved to get smashed but I thought about it again and its really annoying to go and look at it for each and every monster you face so good job man! 
🙏🏽
You're the real MVP. Thanks!!
Awesome! 
Negrigante - Tail is a weak point isn't it?
    According to the hunters info monster guide, it is severable, but not a weak point technically. His front legs and his  head are the main weak points. :)
Hope that helps!
Thank you for this!
Can we have hd pls as the zoom distorts it ....
I love u for making this
noob question but what's ailment?
    Status effect, such as poison, stun, paralysis, etc :)
Possibly a much larger undertaking than I make it sound in asking, but any chance you could make a guide for the insect glaive users that tells where to hit for each type of nectar? I'm sure it would make life easier for folks
    Actually, yes! I have not posted it cause a lot of the greens are unknown. I can send you a copy when I get to my computer, though! (On mobile atm)
        The community waits with held breath Fiver. Just as we'd expect of our Sapphire Star XD. Thank you on behalf of the community once you track it all down. XD
    Just posted it to this subreddit! :)
DO you happen to have a text version of this (i images are easier to host)
    Umm I have the Google doc, would that work for you?
        yes! :)
            Ok! Give me just a second and I will PM you the link.
                Could I please have the link as well?

Great work, this has all the info I need at a quick glance.
                    PM'ing you now!
Thanks for this!
Lol, you right, you right
Weak point: button mashing
    Button mashing is its elemental weakness, not its weak point
This is amazing thanks so much.  Imo ultimate version would have their icons for multi Monster investigates when people don't know them all like me.  And a note on some to right, like xev can't be ridden or odagaron gem carve only etc.

Wouldn't expect u to go through all that lol just what I thought of.  Will be printing this at work tomorrow! Heh
PM the Mods and tell them to put this in the sidebar! Thanks again for the taking the time!!!
so the "x" in a monsters weakness chart that indicates to which element/ailment the monster is immune automatically means thats also the type of damage the monster is doing?
You are correct! I will make the changes. Thank you!
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Also i would count head weak for blunt weapon users
Side question: what's the community-preferred nomenclature for ladies with hammers? If it's still "hammerbro", I'm okay with that, just wondering :)
    Hammerbroads
        Most underrated comment of the year
    Hammerbro is just a term like Mankind. 
        Groovy, thank you :)
    Mallet maid.
        Take your upvote 😂 I set my guild card title as "Bride of Hammer".
Me strong me break parts!
I started on the Horn, and still love it,  but soloing took FOREVER. Switched to a Hammer Bro. No doots, but twice the head smashing. Keep your combos. Me smash. 
    I want to try out the horn out. So you find that when soloing stuff, it is not exactly great?
        It just takes longer. Don’t expect to solo those 20 min investigations. Other than that, it’s a blast. Using earplugs and that walloping something as it roars is a great feeling. When I used healing horns I never used potions, so that was pretty cool too
            Nice! I have zero clue how the damn thing works, but I'm sure a little time in the training area will fix that.
                Definitely. It’s pretty simple. Swing to build up songs, and then play them. Don’t think there are only three ways to hit something, however. You have hits with movement, aerial, mounting, and , of course, the actual playing of songs. Lots of dodging, and you’ll probably want your palico running defense. I love the flash fly cage, but the shield thing is very helpful. 
Are the Horn players like a second cousin to hammer bros?

As a horn player I hate Barroths rocky head. But at least he's easy
    Your attacks don't go through with the second-tier Self Improvement song?
        Honestly I havent fought barroth in a while, I was pretty new to the horn. But yeah that makes sense

    This chart makes it seem like nothing is immune/strong vs Poison except for Zorah Magdaros.

Is that true?  I just made a Poison Charge Blade that I am enjoying.
        Pukei Pukei is strong against it since it is his element!
I will be updating the chart with what element they use soon, which is basically what they are strong/immune to as well.
        0 is immune, 1 is strong against. 
        Nice, I may try that (though if I recall, I need a ton of Rathalos shit for it)! I'm a CB user too, been rocking the water one (Leaf?) since I'm just at Coral and lots of monsters (Barroth, Anjanath, Jury) seem to be weak to water.

I have a poison bow I use, but so far it feels underwhelming. Probably b/c one can only carry 20 coatings in the pouch at a time. Do you find the poison increases the speed at which you kill stuff?
            I never use the coatings (because I don't understand them, honestly) but just having poison on the weapon's stats seems to help quite a bit.  You'll get a few hits in on some enemies and then you'll see 8-10 health tick off of them for a while as they run around poisoned. It doesn't always happen and I don't quite understand the pattern or logic but it is often enough to be a nice bonus.

That's always nice when it happens.  I do just as much damage with my heavy hits as my old 700+ damage hammer even though the actual damage is listed as far less on the charge blade.

90% of my swings are in the two-handed axe mode, though.
        That CB lasted me quite a while.  It's quite nice.
    I just realized this one is missing Lavasloth.
Just printed out this one. This will come in handy. Thanks for looking out friend!
Ooh, it is pretty! I would probably get distracted by all the colors though, lol
This one is missing Lavisoth. Otherwise, I do like the visual layout better. 
    Lavasloth* 
        Lavasioth*
    Also kushala daora
so you should not use 1* elements for a monster?

is 2* = no bonus, no penalty?

        Thank you very much!!
Gah! I always mess that up. Thank you!
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
    Was looking everywhere for this. The book in the game does a pretty good job of showing monster weaknesses but doesn't say anything about what element it uses against you. Thanks a bunch this is great!
        Sure thing dude! Glad it can be of use
Good idea! I can put what element they use on the updated version.
    Thank god! Bless you for this

    Not a problem bro! Im happy to help if i can! 
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Yeah, Kirin is a butt :( So fast!!
To have the optimal setup for the fight, yes. To be able to kill the monster, no.
    [deleted]
        Best in slot is going to depend on your play style and weapon. Gear with speed sharpening may be best in slot for an IG but worthless to an LB. so best in slot is hard to peg down.

Also if a monsters set bonus can outweigh the benefits of running individual pieces that can factor in too.

I mean this is my first MH so I’m still new myself, but the game has a very fluid feel to armor, sometimes one setup will feel OP other times you’ll want other gear.
        By end game you should aim to have one weapon for each element and mainly swap that. Changing your armor for a fight is only REALLY needed if your armor has a significant elemental weakness
You don't *need* one, but if you're struggling to complete a hunt, exploiting weaknesses might help.
Yessirree! Certain monsters are stronger or weaker to certain elements or status effects. I will be adding the strengths in the next update, which I am making now.
For example, Anjanath uses fire so he is strong against fire. He is weak to water, then thunder and ice secondly, so you would use a water weapon against him if possible. There are multiple weapons in the game that you can make that have different elements and status effects, as well as different armor that is strong against certain elements and weak to others.
Hope that helps!
Haha yeah, it is a common weak spot!
Yeah, Xeno is a little fuzzy because not many people have fought him. I made this based off of the monsters's in-game info, so his was a little vague.
Thank you for the info! Hope you enjoy the chart!
    Yup tyvm and your totally right. We just need more info of the armor matches the descriptions or not. 
Oops! Small adjustment- the azure secondary is ice, not thunder. Pink is the same. My apologies!
    Thanks I've been working on blue the last few days just can't drop him quick enough.
        Aw man, keep at it! It's worth it
            [Got him](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/XDsRc7y) and a plate to boot.

                    Thanks just when you think you can't love the game anymore.
            I'll have him soon.
        Ensure you have flash bombs and combinations, he's a pain in the skies. 

Also ancient potion, max potion, armorskin and demondrug if you feel you need the extra attack.

Having good armor really helps, I used todachi as it had an evade extender skill which was great for evading.

Happy hunting!
            I just need to main line demondrug I can get near death but I run out of time because of interference.

Huh, I just found it. That's pretty cool!
    Still yet, thank you for doing this! I always find myself running to the workshop to check on monster weaknesses...and that's if I have any parts from that monster. That or constantly googling haha. Nice to have a quick reference on your phone. 
        Sure thing! Yeah, I found myself constantly looking up weaknesses and I just got really tired of it.
        Also no need to run all the way there, your Hunter's Notes from the Start menu contains all the monster info you've collected!
Nice xDDDD me haven't died yet too since not dying and fainting have fun xDDDDD I play on -100 all resist and LMAO not even be hit!!! xDDD
I'm glad you like it! I was doing the same thing, so I figured I'd go ahead and make it simpler for everyone.
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Sure thing! :)
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
    So, kind sir. Am I allowed to create a more readfriendly version of this sheet? I don't want to be credited. It will be the same sheet but with visually improvements if you don't mind.
        Sure, go for it. I can give you a link to the Google doc if you like. I just tried to keep it simple and easy to read. :)
            Short question: On Bazel's Weakparts you wrote "Head, Tail, Wings" ... 3 categories? It happens like 2 or 3 times in your sheet.

Do you seperate them into Primary, Secondary etc? Or is it all just Primary? 

Anajanth f.e. you Wrote "Head/Nose, Tail".

I need this information just for better understanding and re-creating this sheet.
                Happens for Bazel and Zorah
                I also have small problems in unterstanding the "Attack Elements/Resitances" section. Could you explain? 

Is the first one the element the monster attacks with and the second word his resistance? Or how is that build up?
                    some doesn't have slashes in that section, does that mean they dont have any resistances?
                I put it in the key at the top of the page, but a lot of people missed it.
The weakness of parts is rated 0-3 stars in the game. Slashes (i.e. fire/water) indicates both parts were rated with 3 stars. Comma separates primary from secondary, secondary being the second one.
Hope that helps!
                    thing is: sometimes you write double commas. seperating primary to secondary and then to some third criteria.
                        Ah, I see what you mean! I mainly did that to list all weak parts, even if they were not as highly rated. I could see how that could be confusing, my bad.
                            okay. you know what? You inspire me to do something big. I will release it here and credit you for that. But it will take some time. It'll be great.
                                Go for it dude! It takes time but it's worth it :)
No problemo!

Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
(ಥ﹏ಥ) thank you, that means a lot!!
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Elements add extra damage to hits. Ailments cause status effects to monsters (i.e. enough hits with stun ailment will stun the monster for a couple of seconds)
Elemental weakness: what element they are weak to. Fire, water, etc. There are different elemental weapons that are better against different monsters.
Ailments: think of it like status effects. Some monsters are more resistant to certain status effects but weaker to others, like Pukei-Pukei is a poison monster so he doesn't get poisoned easily, but he is easier to make go to sleep or paralyze.
Hope that helps!
    Very helpful. Thank you. Also is one more viable than the other. For instance i have a thunder CB and a poison CB. whats the better choice for say a Legiana hunt? 
        Typically elemental is pretty useful to have from what I know. Status effects are helpful but elemental is more flat damage I think.
Honestly you ideally want both, for example if you are playing with friends one person use each type of weapon, or use armor that gives you extra weakness damage (for example, Legiana you could use a Thunder weapon, then use armor that gives extra poison attack).
I hope that makes sense! All the information is very important for a fight, so keep in mind elemental and ailment weakness, not just one or the other.
            Alrighty. Thanks again for the help. Happy hunting.
                Same to you! C:
    Five years late here. But holy shit thank you so much for this. Been trying to find the difference for half an hour and all I’ve been getting is some crazy stuff I don’t understand lol

    Ok gotcha
There are available in the game via research. You can find it under Info>Hunter's Notes>Monster Field Guide. :)
    Thank you!
        Sure thing! Happy hunting!
            You as well:)
Element adds on top.

Monsters tend to have high physical resistance (which is why your 500 attack weapon does 20 damage). Using a weapon wth the correct element will add proportionally more damage.

You can also choose to run elementless weapons with skills for bonus elementless damage as a general option for multi-monster hunts.

You can also run a status weapon rather than an element (poison, blast, etc.)

Ultimately just don’t choose a weapon they’re strong against and you’ll be fine.
    awesome! thanks so much man 
I believe so! I'm not exactly sure, I just know it makes the monster die faster. 乁༼☯‿☯✿༽ㄏ
    so a weapon with 100 physical damage and 100 elemental damage would be better than a weapon with 185 physical damage? I tried looking o line but can't find any answers 😭
        I'll be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure. This is my first MH game so I'm still learning.
Any other hunters care to chime in? o:
            we're some noobs in need

╰(˵ヘωヘ✿)╯ Glad you like it! Be sure to save the update once I post it, too!
Here is the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
I believe it has to be the same element to make any difference, though I'm only about 90% sure.
    That’s exactly how I’m thinking!
I’m hoping for that 10% chance where you can make an awesome hybrid.
I’m at work right now but I’m hoping to test it out in about... ugh, 7 hours.
        Good luck! Just think of all the hunting you can do after you get off of work, that always helped me waste time. :P
I believe you can add coatings to bows with decorations but I'm not sure of other weapons yet
you can't add effects to weapons, only enhance the ones it currently has
Thunder and water are pretty widely useable tbh. Fire is good too however
There are two differences:
-azure rathian is weak to ice (as listed on chart)
-black Diablos is immune to fire/dragon, and weak to ice (not listed). Thank you for asking, I will update with black Diablos included next
    thank you!
I'm dedicated, but not THAT dedicated. xD
Sure thing! Glad I could save you the trouble. :)
? They are listed in the game in the same way, just a little less organized. I don't see this as cheating? Sorry you think so, though.
    I'm just poking fun.  This is cool BUT,  it downplays an important system created by Capcom to use the Monster Guide as a reference. Instead of whipping out the pseudo book,  looking up the Monster,  slowly memorizing each monsters weakens. This quick check guide is a lot less engaging and in turn will make it less likely people will memorize the weakness's etc. 
        Ahh, I gotcha. That does make sense for the hardcore and immersion factor of the game.
Thanks for the input! Happy hunting :)
            Of course,  thanks again for taking the time to make the guide.  We appreciate it.  Happy hunting 
For real!! Poison is helpful too
    Exactly! For people who can’t make everything, the best combination to have is Thunder, Ice, Poison, and finally Dragon with elderseal to cover all your bases and farming needs.
Sure thing! In case you didn't see it, here is the updated version with attack elements too: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Done! The updated version has it here: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
I would post it again but I don't think it's allowed.
    So what you're telling me, is that not a single monster in the game uses blast damage.
        I mostly included blast with fire to keep it simple. If that does not make sense I can change it in a later update.
So in the game, in the Monster Guide, the elemental weaknesses and ailment weaknesses are rated by 0-3 stars. Primary means it is rated with 3 stars, and secondary means it is rated 2 stars.
Hope this helps!
    Meaning he does not have a real weakness (3*) but have elements that are better then average(2*) against him? 

Yup, thanks!
        Correct! I figured having 2 star weakness was better than none. Happy hunting!
Yep, done in the update! https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
    Nice, thanks a bunch 
        Sure thing! Happy hunting!
Sure thing dood. Be sure to use the updated version: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Glad you like it!
Aw yeah B)
Ooh, that is a very good idea! Will keep in mind for next update. Thank you!
A common alternative to "severed" is "broken". You can break certain tails (and get the "part broken" popup) but they will never come flying off for an extra carve.
    No I totally get that you can "break" all of their tails, but in the way that you can "sever" the tails so that it drops a lootable tail and reduces range on their tail attacks... is that every monster?
        Some, like Legiana and Paolumu (just off the top of my head), can only have their tails "broken". They won't fall off. In the Hunter's Notes it will let you know whether the tail is severable.
Sure thing! Be sure to use the updated version here: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Glad you like it!! :)
B) thanks duderino
Honestly, both are very important. I usually prioritise element over status because you don't want to use something that the monster is strong against, but again, both are pretty vital to a fight.
Aw man, is that supposed to be opened in a specific app? I opened it via reddit and it was a hot mess. :( kudos to the creator though!
    It's a PDF so it should work just fine.  I open it up in firefox and it works great.
It depends on the weapon type you're using. Raw is generally better on slower hitting weapons, while elemental is generally better on faster hitting ones that do less damage per strike normally. That being said, there's always variances, particularly when you start taking into account things like sharpness and affinity, as well as what skills you have equipped on your armor.....
Weakness is rated 0-3 stars in the game. Secondary means it only has 2 stars since some monsters had no 3 star ailment weaknesses. :)
Ailment is status effects i.e. poison, stun, paralysis, etc. They are rated 0-3 stars, primary means 3 stars, secondary means 2 stars.
Hope that helps!
According to the hunters info monster guide, it is severable, but not a weak point technically. His front legs and his  head are the main weak points. :)
Hope that helps!
Status effect, such as poison, stun, paralysis, etc :)
Actually, yes! I have not posted it cause a lot of the greens are unknown. I can send you a copy when I get to my computer, though! (On mobile atm)
    The community waits with held breath Fiver. Just as we'd expect of our Sapphire Star XD. Thank you on behalf of the community once you track it all down. XD
Just posted it to this subreddit! :)
Umm I have the Google doc, would that work for you?
    yes! :)
        Ok! Give me just a second and I will PM you the link.
            Could I please have the link as well?

Great work, this has all the info I need at a quick glance.
                PM'ing you now!
Button mashing is its elemental weakness, not its weak point
Hammerbroads
    Most underrated comment of the year
Hammerbro is just a term like Mankind. 
    Groovy, thank you :)
Mallet maid.
    Take your upvote 😂 I set my guild card title as "Bride of Hammer".
I want to try out the horn out. So you find that when soloing stuff, it is not exactly great?
    It just takes longer. Don’t expect to solo those 20 min investigations. Other than that, it’s a blast. Using earplugs and that walloping something as it roars is a great feeling. When I used healing horns I never used potions, so that was pretty cool too
        Nice! I have zero clue how the damn thing works, but I'm sure a little time in the training area will fix that.
            Definitely. It’s pretty simple. Swing to build up songs, and then play them. Don’t think there are only three ways to hit something, however. You have hits with movement, aerial, mounting, and , of course, the actual playing of songs. Lots of dodging, and you’ll probably want your palico running defense. I love the flash fly cage, but the shield thing is very helpful. 
Your attacks don't go through with the second-tier Self Improvement song?
    Honestly I havent fought barroth in a while, I was pretty new to the horn. But yeah that makes sense
This is how I picture everyone's favourite [Dootsters.](https://youtu.be/RYOOa087YZE?t=55s)
This chart makes it seem like nothing is immune/strong vs Poison except for Zorah Magdaros.

Is that true?  I just made a Poison Charge Blade that I am enjoying.
    Pukei Pukei is strong against it since it is his element!
I will be updating the chart with what element they use soon, which is basically what they are strong/immune to as well.
    0 is immune, 1 is strong against. 
    Nice, I may try that (though if I recall, I need a ton of Rathalos shit for it)! I'm a CB user too, been rocking the water one (Leaf?) since I'm just at Coral and lots of monsters (Barroth, Anjanath, Jury) seem to be weak to water.

I have a poison bow I use, but so far it feels underwhelming. Probably b/c one can only carry 20 coatings in the pouch at a time. Do you find the poison increases the speed at which you kill stuff?
        I never use the coatings (because I don't understand them, honestly) but just having poison on the weapon's stats seems to help quite a bit.  You'll get a few hits in on some enemies and then you'll see 8-10 health tick off of them for a while as they run around poisoned. It doesn't always happen and I don't quite understand the pattern or logic but it is often enough to be a nice bonus.

That's always nice when it happens.  I do just as much damage with my heavy hits as my old 700+ damage hammer even though the actual damage is listed as far less on the charge blade.

90% of my swings are in the two-handed axe mode, though.
    That CB lasted me quite a while.  It's quite nice.
I just realized this one is missing Lavasloth.
Lavasloth* 
    Lavasioth*
Also kushala daora
Hava updoot
    Thank you very much!!
Was looking everywhere for this. The book in the game does a pretty good job of showing monster weaknesses but doesn't say anything about what element it uses against you. Thanks a bunch this is great!
    Sure thing dude! Glad it can be of use
Thank god! Bless you for this
    ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶ Glad you like it!!
Glad you like it! :) If there are any other helpful charts you can think of, let me know!
Not a problem bro! Im happy to help if i can! 
[deleted]
    Best in slot is going to depend on your play style and weapon. Gear with speed sharpening may be best in slot for an IG but worthless to an LB. so best in slot is hard to peg down.

Also if a monsters set bonus can outweigh the benefits of running individual pieces that can factor in too.

I mean this is my first MH so I’m still new myself, but the game has a very fluid feel to armor, sometimes one setup will feel OP other times you’ll want other gear.
    By end game you should aim to have one weapon for each element and mainly swap that. Changing your armor for a fight is only REALLY needed if your armor has a significant elemental weakness
Yup tyvm and your totally right. We just need more info of the armor matches the descriptions or not. 
Thanks I've been working on blue the last few days just can't drop him quick enough.
    Aw man, keep at it! It's worth it
        [Got him](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/XDsRc7y) and a plate to boot.
            ୧༼ ヘ ᗜ ヘ ༽୨ Woot wooooot! Congrats, dude!!
                Thanks just when you think you can't love the game anymore.
        I'll have him soon.
    Ensure you have flash bombs and combinations, he's a pain in the skies. 

Also ancient potion, max potion, armorskin and demondrug if you feel you need the extra attack.

Having good armor really helps, I used todachi as it had an evade extender skill which was great for evading.

Happy hunting!
        I just need to main line demondrug I can get near death but I run out of time because of interference.
        [Got the bastard.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/XDsRc7y)
            Gratz! First time is always the hardest ;)
                I've cut and carved his tail so many times that when I finally killed him I had everything I needed for his weapon.
Thanks again.
Awesome thank you!
Thank you!
    Sure thing! Hope it comes in handy!
Still yet, thank you for doing this! I always find myself running to the workshop to check on monster weaknesses...and that's if I have any parts from that monster. That or constantly googling haha. Nice to have a quick reference on your phone. 
    Sure thing! Yeah, I found myself constantly looking up weaknesses and I just got really tired of it.
    Also no need to run all the way there, your Hunter's Notes from the Start menu contains all the monster info you've collected!
So, kind sir. Am I allowed to create a more readfriendly version of this sheet? I don't want to be credited. It will be the same sheet but with visually improvements if you don't mind.
    Sure, go for it. I can give you a link to the Google doc if you like. I just tried to keep it simple and easy to read. :)
        Short question: On Bazel's Weakparts you wrote "Head, Tail, Wings" ... 3 categories? It happens like 2 or 3 times in your sheet.

Do you seperate them into Primary, Secondary etc? Or is it all just Primary? 

Anajanth f.e. you Wrote "Head/Nose, Tail".

I need this information just for better understanding and re-creating this sheet.
            Happens for Bazel and Zorah
            I also have small problems in unterstanding the "Attack Elements/Resitances" section. Could you explain? 

Is the first one the element the monster attacks with and the second word his resistance? Or how is that build up?
                some doesn't have slashes in that section, does that mean they dont have any resistances?
            I put it in the key at the top of the page, but a lot of people missed it.
The weakness of parts is rated 0-3 stars in the game. Slashes (i.e. fire/water) indicates both parts were rated with 3 stars. Comma separates primary from secondary, secondary being the second one.
Hope that helps!
                thing is: sometimes you write double commas. seperating primary to secondary and then to some third criteria.
                    Ah, I see what you mean! I mainly did that to list all weak parts, even if they were not as highly rated. I could see how that could be confusing, my bad.
                        okay. you know what? You inspire me to do something big. I will release it here and credit you for that. But it will take some time. It'll be great.
                            Go for it dude! It takes time but it's worth it :)
Very helpful. Thank you. Also is one more viable than the other. For instance i have a thunder CB and a poison CB. whats the better choice for say a Legiana hunt? 
    Typically elemental is pretty useful to have from what I know. Status effects are helpful but elemental is more flat damage I think.
Honestly you ideally want both, for example if you are playing with friends one person use each type of weapon, or use armor that gives you extra weakness damage (for example, Legiana you could use a Thunder weapon, then use armor that gives extra poison attack).
I hope that makes sense! All the information is very important for a fight, so keep in mind elemental and ailment weakness, not just one or the other.
        Alrighty. Thanks again for the help. Happy hunting.
            Same to you! C:
Five years late here. But holy shit thank you so much for this. Been trying to find the difference for half an hour and all I’ve been getting is some crazy stuff I don’t understand lol
Perfect timing. Just about to hop on :D 
    Here is the updated guide as well in case you didn't catch it: https://i.imgur.com/XN5xEEM.png
Happy hunting!!

    Augh, I know! I have a hard time getting red on certain monsters but I always seem to get orange too lol.
This is awesome man. I’m going to grind some hunts tonight with this
    Good luck and happy hunting! :)
Ok gotcha
Thank you!
    Sure thing! Happy hunting!
        You as well:)
awesome! thanks so much man 
so a weapon with 100 physical damage and 100 elemental damage would be better than a weapon with 185 physical damage? I tried looking o line but can't find any answers 😭
    I'll be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure. This is my first MH game so I'm still learning.
Any other hunters care to chime in? o:
        we're some noobs in need
You are the man
    ༼⌐■ل͜■༽ thanks my dude!
Sweet, thanks again! Lol
Awesome thanks! Great job.
Awesome work!
    Thanks, glad you like it!!
That’s exactly how I’m thinking!
I’m hoping for that 10% chance where you can make an awesome hybrid.
I’m at work right now but I’m hoping to test it out in about... ugh, 7 hours.
    Good luck! Just think of all the hunting you can do after you get off of work, that always helped me waste time. :P
thank you!
I'm just poking fun.  This is cool BUT,  it downplays an important system created by Capcom to use the Monster Guide as a reference. Instead of whipping out the pseudo book,  looking up the Monster,  slowly memorizing each monsters weakens. This quick check guide is a lot less engaging and in turn will make it less likely people will memorize the weakness's etc. 
    Ahh, I gotcha. That does make sense for the hardcore and immersion factor of the game.
Thanks for the input! Happy hunting :)
        Of course,  thanks again for taking the time to make the guide.  We appreciate it.  Happy hunting 
Exactly! For people who can’t make everything, the best combination to have is Thunder, Ice, Poison, and finally Dragon with elderseal to cover all your bases and farming needs.
So what you're telling me, is that not a single monster in the game uses blast damage.
    I mostly included blast with fire to keep it simple. If that does not make sense I can change it in a later update.
Meaning he does not have a real weakness (3*) but have elements that are better then average(2*) against him? 

Yup, thanks!
    Correct! I figured having 2 star weakness was better than none. Happy hunting!
Nice, thanks a bunch 
    Sure thing! Happy hunting!
