[[I finally beat Alatreon today]]





You can't always go in raw my friend.
    I got advice in the MHW discord that you can still go raw tho. Just gonna have to take the escaton cart since the ele check is only for keeping the escaton damage low but the raw damage will still kill him. Bonus if you jack in a Fortitude jewel. This is all assuming solo gameplay. If full team goes raw then might as well abandon.
        There's a few different ways you can do it raw. Solo you can tank Escaton, with a squad you can kill him before the first Escaton.



If I remember correctly, Alatreons hitzones are actually weaker to raw damage. Kinda funny
            I don't know how people tank a full damage Nova. 1100 defense, health boost 3, divine blessing 5, mantles, a health booster and jerky and still die before I can heal more than a couple times. I managed to beat it with a dragon build but it's still just insane to me
                I think he meant tank as in just eating it and using a cart.

Ala takes substantially more raw damage so if you‚Äôre proficient enough it‚Äôs still considerably faster to eat a judgement and run raw.
                You can't tank a full damage nova by yourself. It just isn't possible. It MIGHT be possible with a very well coordinated squad.

When the guy said "tank" it, he means just cart to the nova and come back.
                    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4) your right
        Yes, my first kill was solo raw hammer, with fortitude and I also ate to get another cart.


It was very intense and exhilarating to win despite but using the intended way!
        Not true with the solo. A group of friends and I beat Alatreon with Heavy Bow guns. You can tank the Judgement with a bonus cart or by killing him quick enough.
    "*Whoa whoa whoa!* You want me to craft new gear to hunt that monster? That's not what this game is about!"
        Damn, its almost like raw weapons arent the only gear available
            We should make a physics prop bowgun that shoots explosive barrels
                Gravity Bowgun
                    I want to pick up a jagras and fling it at 60 mph into an Anjanath's face
                        Me too, my friend. Me too
                        Deviljho time.
                            Great idea! I just need a deviljho's head on a big stick!
                Tape a stick to explosive barrel and it's a hammer
                    I wanna chuck the thing like a football
            I feel offended reading this as a Greatsword main.
                Ok greatswords and maybe hammers are excused, but the rest arent.
        elementless Gang
    This sound extremely weird without context
        Cut off "my friend" and Michael scott would Burst* through the wall with "that's what she said"
    If you *ice* it properly first you certainly can
    Sound advice for Monster Hunter AND other things.
    You actually can.
        I mean, sure and you can also shower with ostrich eggs every morning.
            That's true as well.
            Waste of eggs and money at that point.
    Then why aren't any hammers and greatswords good with elemental damage? If I have to craft new gear than fine whatever but to have to switch to using a weapon I never use and a set to go with that weapon seems a bit disloyal to the spirit of the game.
        Did you ever try using ele GS on alatreon? They gave typically raw weapons a boost in the fight specifically to address that point
            I tried awhile back and couldn't ever get the check but maybe ill try it again later. I've also heard that it's still more difficult for hammer and greatsword than other weapons even with the boost.
                Its more difficult with GS for sure than DB for example. But it is very doable. I say this as someone who's solo'ed him with both.
                    Good to know. Really dislike how im getting downvote bombed though. Then again ive found I dislike most of the Monster Hunter community since the vets hate new players.
        While that's usually true, Alatreon has different elemental multipliers for each weapon type to balance them all out. There was never a need to switch weapon type against it, just don't use raw.
    I like the fact that more than half of the replies only got half of that advice.
    We're still talking about monster hunter right?
    There are over 250 loadout slots for a reason, fellow hunter
    2 more likes, just 2 more my dude and Satan will be proud.
Just make an elemental weapon set beotodus weapons or frostfang barrioth weapons for ice are good enough. For fire try glavenus or rathalos weapons. You actually do not need Kjarr or safi to beat him.
    True, but kjarr does make it a cakewalk
        some people hated it when they have to get kjarr just to kill alatreon. So my argument was for those kind of people who felt that kjarr is just too hard to get. You don;t need it actually so there's no reason on hating alatreon just because you are forced to use elemental weapons
            You can use two piece velkhana to get crit element, which I actually recommend over true crit element because silverlos/azure age armor has pretty mediocre slots. Silver rath/ and frostfang weapons can get the job done.
        *cries in having killed him first time with silver ratholos cause safi out of rotation and terrible luck*
    And honestly, dual blades are super easy to learn the basics of. Beyblade that mf up
        Heck, even Glavenus or Rathalos GS works against ICE starting alatreon. I dont get the hate. To me alatreon is if not 1st then 2nd best fight in the game.
        Ion like the beyblade

I wanna keep my lunch man it was super good
    I clearly feel this since I had to use these exact monster weapons to beat Alatreon since I can‚Äôt go online lol.
    Speartuna critdraw GS got me my first solo elemental dps check ( before swapping to easy mode elemental savage axe)
    You don‚Äôt technically need Kjarr, but man Kjarr weapons are so good and opens up your options because they have built in crit element. Kjarr sword fire is a phenomenal weapon, 60% crit anywhere. But frostfang is good too. I had to grind for 30 hours to get the Kjarr weapons I wanted though.. So that‚Äôs a bit of a downside
What I think I like the most is if you‚Äôre really confident you can hit him consistently, you could just use a weapon with high dragon element and say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the horn break
    or just go in raw and tank the escatons, stack fortify and it‚Äôs a free 10-15 minute kill
Allthough he's far from perfect, atleast his hitboxes are clean and fair.
7/10 fight, maybe 8/10 on good days
    I‚Äôm not a fan of the elemental limitations, but you are right about those clean hit boxes. I would enjoy it much more if I wasn‚Äôt constantly worried about the elemental threshold.
        It kinda takes away from the flow, they could have lowered it just a bit imo
            Go in with full confidence and ala won‚Äôt dictate the flow
        On the flip side I loved it because I never ever really take the time to make elemental sets as I always felt it was a pain to make one for each element. This time not only had I a strong incentive to fully build one, I only needed to build one for a single element. The ice set is still my only elemental set to this day, but it was nice to build something different than raw on a raw centric weapon.
            Same here. I normally just ran poison or blast damage. Alatreon made me make an elemental build. After I beat him. I spent a couple months building new Safi elemental Charge Blades. Now I have a tab of Alatreon armor sets paired with various elemental CB‚Äôs and decorations that I‚Äôll swap between accordingly.
            As a bow player at the time, I just swapped to my ice/fire sets but fuck it was still a lame fight. Better than Safi, but most of World/Iceborne‚Äôs big monsters let me down. 

I really liked KT, Behemoth, and Fatty tho
        You can kill him with raw, especially solo. You just have to be really good. Alatreon is a fair fight, he just poked holes people's playstyle.
            you do NOT have to be that good to kill him raw solo

eat for fortify, he escatons every ~6 minutes, giving you ~24 minutes to kill him

very easily doable especially when stacking fortify
    I have heard of people getting his entire set before getting a single kill.
        You can do that for pretty much every monster if you're patient enough with the plunderblade
            The point is that it's unintentional lol
                The whole point of the plunder blade is to let you cat get materials. Being able to get equipment from a monster you haven't killed is just part of how it works. Potentially an oversight, but one they haven't changed. It could very well be intentional.

If they didn't want that to be possible all they would have to do make it so the parts gathered by your palico was only given to you if you completed the hunt. Yet they didn't.
                    No.


The *point* is that you want to kill the monster. As this game is called monster *hunter* and the people who can craft the full armor set before killing him are literally not accomplishing their own objective üòÇ
                        Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
                            Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.


Are you really going to act like the point of monster hunter isn't killing monsters? Are you really going to sit here and downvote me and argue that a notable amount of MHW buyers paid $60 USD so they can run around with  a plunderblade?


Ffs are you hearing yourself? Are you just a contrarian or a legit troll? This is so childish good lord.



#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
                                >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
                    The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
                        Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
        Many such cases.
            And the worst part is the fact that everyone defending this fight is a carbon copy, they always have the exact same argument.
                Even I git his weapon before a kill. It was pain, but atleast it's not the worst fight (looking at you Jay Leno)
                    Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
                        Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
                            Good god, that chin is impressive.
                                I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
                What do people say to defend the fight? I‚Äôm not on mhw Reddit so I didn‚Äôt even know people hated this fight. I personally think this is in my top 3 fights of all time
                    The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
                        But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
                            Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
                    "Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
                        The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
                            Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
                        probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
                            So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
                                When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                                    Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
                            Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
                                Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                                    My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
        That was me with Fatalis.
    It really depends. I think he is in best when he is on the ground. Especially the flying Ice version is sooo annoying, because it is really hard to deal significant damage that way. If he does this I either flashcancel his flight or use the clutchclaw to slam him to the ground
    His hitboxes are great, but his hunt. Not so much.
    An 8/10 fight brought down to a 1/10 because of a braindead awful mechanic
Never had an issuen with having to make new sets for dealing with a certain monster.

But an Elemental damage Check? As A Gunlance main? 

&#x200B;

Weird way for capcom to tell me to go screw myself tbh.
You can 100% beat Ala with any weapon and it's definitely not a deciding factor. Me and a friend did it with Greatswords, he was running raw too. Still hit the element check.
Best fight in the game. There are modifiers that make every weapon viable, the hitzones are very tight and forgiving, and you have to actually make a build for it instead of just using the same raw set you use for the entire game.

With a frostfang weapon (easy to get) and some ice attack jewels you can very easily get the check once you learn the fight even a little and once you do, you may end up loving it like I do üëç.
    if you run charge blade, you don‚Äôt even need frostfang. You can one combo his dps check with Beotodus CB lmao
        Funny story, I was helping someone get ala yesterday who said "ala is an amazing fight but since I use CB it was impossible to get the elemental check as it's not a good elemental weapon". Couldn't believe my ears, was an MR250ish as well.
            "My brother in Christ, don't you realize that Impact phials aren't the only option?"

"Huh?!"
            my god, lmao

Safi armour + ele CB is a lot of fun and most of the time my preferred way to play CB (i just love safi set in general but it makes savage axe really nice)
            Wtf, the element check is so essy with the ice kjarr cb
                Im not very good at CB at all, but with a kjarr strongarm ice(and ice attack 6), I can get 2 elemental checks being the only one using an elemental build in a 4p hunt. CB savage axe is definitely the easiest way to suppress alatreons judgement, as for whatever reason they didn't put a modifier on it.
            To add onto the quote, elemental CB is absolutely brutal and most of the time will outmatch impact. For CBers out there, Charged Sword will give extra elemental damage if using elements power phials. If using Savage Axe, always make sure Power Axe Mode is active.
    Alatreon was absolutely an amazing teacher for me and is also my favorite fight in the game by far. Prior to the fight releasing, I was probably okay at best. Just casually hitting monsters without a care in the world, getting hit and probably carting a lot or getting carried by SOS players I‚Äôd assume.

Alatreon‚Äôs release is what forced me to actually try really hard. Behemoth did too but it was a bit different. Randoms weren‚Äôt reliable at all those first few weeks so I had to actually play/learn solo. Alatreon was a 2 week grind for me. Went hard learning the movement, my weapon, making builds instead of using a raw build I found online for everything, etc. and finally beating them was incredible. Just because of how personal that fight felt, it‚Äôs my favorite in the game.

I‚Äôve gotten so far now thanks to that fight that I can casually do the fight with no issue, as well as next to every monster in the game. Also made me enjoy playing so much more (999-800 currently.) The fight forcing me to learn was the best thing to happen for me in the game and it‚Äôs now become one of my favorite games of all time because of how much fun I had after playing better. Alatreon will always be my go to fight now if I see it under an SOS. Love helping other players with it.
        It was absolutely a turning point for me as well. I was around mr200 when I solod my first ala as I spent a lot of time doing event quests, guiding lands and helping others. Since "mastering" ala and fatalis ive helped so many hunters with them and reached mr999 quite quickly as ive now seen almost 500 alas slayed and around 200 fatalis'.
        I was in the same boat, and I absolutely miss it. I felt like a badass when I killed it. My wife even got into it because she kept watching me lose to this guy over and over. 

 For some reason, Rise just isn‚Äôt as fun for me as World was.
    >instead of just using the same raw set you use for the entire game.

*laughs in raw glaive and elemental bug*
    I can't quite get the check with my Frostfsng Gunlance... yet. Debating if I want to keep working on my pokes or switch to something else for this fight. In MH3U I ended up having to switch to my Kibamaru set from my gunlance to beat him. And I originally made that sword/set for Brachydios because much like Alatreon I couldn't quite deal enough damage in the normally very generous time frame.

I was just a bit too sluggish with the gunlance. Wondering if I should adopt a similar strategy in World for Alatreon as well.
        Yeah, I'd guess that regular lance would be better. Not sure how different it is from gun though.
            Regular frostfang Lance with 4-6 ice attack gems is *very comfy*. You start to run into an issue of low Raw, if anything.
                Yeah I remember seeing an alatreon lance speedrun and was so impressed, just endlessly poking away with heroics and alatreon couldn't touch em.
    Agreed; among the endgame fights, it's probably my favorite.
    You've never tried to hunt him with a Gunlance, have you?
        Just one example, not a speedrun or anything like that, they're getting hit a lot.

https://youtu.be/4fSp3zxduOQ
            I'm not asking for proof, I did hunt him with a Gunlance it's not impossible. I'm asking if you've personally hunted him with a Gunlance.
                I have hunted him with every single weapon, and?
                    Your original comment sound like you don't.
                        I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
                            It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
    Elemental IG, Elemental Kinsect. Wake up, choose violence, beat the shit out of a dragon.

This fight is not that hard, but people fuss because you can't turtle the whole time and have to build for it. Sometimes you have to change your playstyle to beat something in a game.The horror.
    Very fun fight tbh, even with Hammer.
    i just wish, that they had released frost frang before alatreon. I still remember farming the ice weapon for alatreon only to realize that a week later the strongest ice weapons where about to drop.
Bit of a missed opportunity in my book.
    I call BS. There is no way gunlance is a viable weapon against Alatreon. Unless I'm missing something?
        It's completely doable, but requires a proper build and relies on slaps and pokes rather than any shelling. Or you can brute force.
            Gunlance Alatreon really needs u to make a set to pump out any element u can and its a 100% slaplance playstyle at least to get the topple first
                I know most people bash you if you're not using ice or fire. But like... GL kinda struggles to keep up with Alatreons mobility some what, even with EE3 imo. And even with White Knight fully kitted and a proper elemental Safi build I couldn't do it. Whne you can keep up with him, the damage you can do just isn't really there and basic pokes don't add up to fuck all. Meeting the check is... rough.

So I farmed my ass off against Kulve until I got the Kjarr Water Buster for that fat free crit ele, augmented the shit out of it with regen 1 + element 2 (plus every custom element upgrade), made my best fuck Alatreon Safi set, and went to work.

Turns out water being meh doesn't matter a whole lot when you're rocking 1100+ element, and smacking the poor thing for 500-800~ using your full burst slap-lance combo, and poking for 200-300, it's disgusting.

It's absolutely doable, and I've since done it solo/multi-player with different weapons (easier with kjarrs by far, and the Alatreon GL, with drag. Atk6, imo) but man does it not feel good to fight with that weapon at all.
                    Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
                        I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
            Once u get the topple then u can go back to mixing it up with shells again
            Doable, but no way in hell viable.
        All weapons are viable and the elemental check is actually very easy to achieve the hard part is breaking the horns so he doesn't swap elements
            But not all play styles are viable. If you use primarily shelling with gunlance, you will do only a tiny amount of elemental damage excluding the 3 fire damage from each blast.
                Even with an only shelling run you could easily get sub 10 you just have to take a cart at 6 mins
                That goes for a ton of monsters too though. Crit Draw GS works very well on kirin due to it's shitzones everywhere but the head, constant movement and AOEs, but is absolutely unnecessary on dodogama who practically explodes taking a TCS off its massive gullet
        just kill him in under 3 carts
        well hunters can mash the heavy swings instead of artillery tho,.  howevery yeah im curious if the elemental on gunlances is enough for alatreon's element dps check?
            I can with a fully element focused augmented water kjarr, or alatreons gunlance. 1100+ water element if built properly. Alatreon's GL I feel just nets more trips in general. But the damage is solid since dragon is okay in general. Unless you play it perfect and Alatreon hardly moves from like 2 spots, you're probably not dishing enough damage before a phase shift, if you're using fire or ice. 

The only real damage GL deals to Alatreon is in the full burst combo, without shellings, they're not worth it mostly, and it moves A LOT. So you're not gonna get that off unless it's basically down or does 1-2 specific moves.
                Why choose water over the elements he's weakest to?
                    Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
                        I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
                            I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
    Love the fight but Fatty is my #1 fight still.
People really went from saying "World is too easy" to "WTF THIS IS BROKENLY HARD" the very instant they couldn't beat a monster first yry.
    So I've gotta ask, did alot of people think World was too easy back in the day? Cause I see that all the time now, the "Rise is easy compared to World" statement.

I should've known people we're saying the same thing here too lol.
        I think it was probably an experience thing for me. World was the first MH I ever played. Even using defender gear in low rank, I got beat up. 

I had to make legiana armor and an ice bow to beat high rank Diablos. It took me a long time to get it figured out. Black Diablos would still beat me down in my HR gear. 

In Rise, I'm not sure I ever failed a hunt. I'd maybe cart once or twice, but that's about it. 

I think part of it is that 1shot damage is toned down, and you are so much more mobile you can just avoid things.
            tbh I'm perfectly fine with 1shot damage being lowered, there's hardly a point in time where that *isn't* frustrating
                I think I'd rather be 1 shot than just stunlocked or something, though.
    Well to be fair the last couple of monsters were much harder then the rest. But I like it, it really feels like end game and a real challenge to beat.
        That's what i'm wishing for in Sunbreak the most right now: Monsters that truly feel imposing and are a goal to work towards to.  
Sure, there are high level investigations, but it's not the same.
            I have felt it was pretty easy overall but finally started working through the HR event quests grinding to 100 and there have been a few apex fights that were surprisingly tough. I am enjoying having to be somewhat careful in my build and playstyle. The beginning was all just the same weapon for everyone but I'm getting some challenge now. I havent gotten to sunbreak yet but I hope there are some of the Alatreon Behemoth Fatalis level fights thrown in.
    Very true, but id also say it‚Äôs pretty damn jarring that the entire game is on one side of the difficulty scale, then extreme behemoth, this and fatalis are on the other side. Capcom didn‚Äôt do a great job bridging the difficulty at all
    You do realize there's such a thing as bad difficulty, right? World is easy, but some of its end game monsters are designed with artificial difficulty in mind. Most people who die to Ala die from his EJ attack.

You're fighting a DPS check, not a monster.
        If you‚Äôre good at the fight and using a suitable weapon, the dps check won‚Äôt be a problem. People spend half the fight running away and healing, then wonder why they died to EJ.
        nah, it wasn't "bad difficulty". it was just a monster with a different challenge to it.

all monsters are designed with "artificial difficulty" lol

just get out of your comfort zone and use an elemental weapon

>Most people who die to Ala die from his EJ attack.

yeah no shit lol

OP image is silly too, yeah you *are* bad at monster hunting if you get so comfortable with one weapon that you can't even change up your tactics for one of the hardest mons in the game
        Literally every monster is a DPS check. You just actually have to be good to beat this one.
            Technically yes, but also technically inaccurate. The DPS checks are only last resorts for other monsters. The main method of failure for every other monster fight is carting 3 times by any of the monster's moves.

If you're only failing Alatreon's quest from the EJ, that means the main monster you're fighting isn't Alatreon, but his artificial DPS check.
                Same with Alatreon. Even if you cart to just the EJ you have enough time to kill him with raw weapons. 

No, it means you've failed to either build a proper set, and or play well enough.
        Can we even consider it a dps check given how easy it is? Can take any weapon in the game, find its best craftable fire/ice weapon on the tree, throw in fire/ice attack and no other skills and still get the topple. All while doing pitiful dmg, but high elemental. Or you could just kill him with raw. If people are really only dying to EJ, that gives them 3 EJ's, a whole 15-18 min, to kill him in whatever way they want. 4 EJ's and 20+ min if insurance.
    Having a boss a hundred or two hours in randomly say "lol no" because your build isnt on the approved checklist is a bit different than "why did I faint once bad game"
    Alatreon is a pain because at the time of its release doing it solo was difficult. And doing it with other people was even more difficult. Depending on weapon typing a solo attempt could be cancer trying to hit the horn enough 

In co-op nobody would even try to use elemental weapons, nobody would focus the horn, they died by stepping on a bug, I saw two people playing blackjack in the back corner once‚Ä¶
My issue with Alatreon is in the Blazing Black Twilight quest you're just dumped in front of him, can't buff or farcast out. Whereas the other two quests you get to start at camp.
alatreon is an amazing fight, id rather fight him in iceborne than in mh3 anyday
I laughed when he dropped. I always preferred making elemental builds.
Time pressure trying to hit a monster that spends 50% of the time flying in the air wasn't fun for me

The cheese build i made to beat it was just an elemental kinsect that i just shot at its head until it broke
    Smokebomb or two, (and a point or three in stealth if you can afford it) and hell come right down super quick.
    Air problems with Insect Glaive? What?
        More that i couldn't fight it with SnS or dual blades
            Throw a smoke bomb during an attack, he will look around and land.
                Fuck that's genius.

I haven't done the fight. Didn't even realize we had smoke bombs.

But that's genius.
                    Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
                    Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
You could beat him with pure raw solo. Just eat safeguard and get Fortify.  
If you go all in on raw and still can't kill him in time before fainting 4 times, then it's on you.  
I still see the frustration with his binary gimmick that means certain death though.  
I think Fatalis was done much better, where not breaking his horn in time makes the fight much harder but still gives you a chance to turn it around.
You can use any weapon type for World-Alatreon, the required threshold for elemental damage changes based on your weapon type. I've done plenty of successful Gunlance runs despite half the weapons damage coming from shells. While it's possible to go through almost the entire game using non-specialized builds, it's something people have been doing for decades in these games to deal with the threats certain monsters bring.
About the "can't use my fav weapon type" - you can.   
Alatreon has different elemental thresholds based on the weapon type you use.

And technically if you go solo you can go raw and take the cart to EJ. It's not making things easier but it's not impossible. 

And as far as elemental sets are concerned: You need just one elemental set (either fire or ice) if you break the horns in dragon phase to prevent the swap.   
Ice is very easy since some of the Beotodus weapons are very powerful and rarity 10, the best choice for many weapon types is Frostfang which is rarity 11. So they're easy to augment.   
And you could use a raw set and slot in some ele attack, although I think Safi armor is kind of made for Alatreon with all of the skills being very useful although it depends a little on your playstyle. If you sheath often the set bonus is kind of an issue.
What‚Äôs annoying about his update was the fact that Master‚Äôs Touch Lightbreak weapons just became the meta right BEFORE his update. So everyone who uses raw based weapons had to scrap it and create elemental sets to hunt him the way Capcom intended
    The Raging Brachy update was four months before Alatreon though, and Alatreon didn't even drop anything good for raw weapons. It wasn't some huge shakeup
        I‚Äôm not saying that the arrival of Alatreon‚Äôs weapons shook up the meta. 

What I said was the fact that for 4 months, Raging brachy weapons were meta for raw heavy weapons. 

Then the arrival of Alatreon made those weapons unusable against it due to the escaton judgement. 

So unless you‚Äôre one of the few who went in bulldozes Alatreon with fortify, you have to put aside your raging brachy set with agitator 7 and master‚Äôs touch and go back and use/create a fire and ice set again specifically for this new additional monster
World Alatreon is tough for me because I mained hammer. But isn‚Äôt so bad with a bow.
Honestly, it hits home. 

Night after night solo, it was a tragedy

Then my cousin joined. Another trsgedy

But one fated night another hunter joined. Someone named "ZELDA". They basically solo'ed it while we were watching in awe and trying to be as helpful as possible

Then they joined again. And again. It was a happy night

Now, several months after that, on a new console, we bought it again together, aiming for the hunt
all in all, alatreon is a good teacher. his natural mechanics requires hunters to ditch their 'meta dps blast build' and focus more on elemental exploits. unlike most monsters, alatreon can change elements during fights, which makes it a situational gameplay of whether you can stop him from changing elements by breaking his horns - or just be stubborn and focus on dps onto the body without thinking about his elemental check
    Shame they don't at least let you farcaster and switch sets if you don't meet the check...wastes both time and damage attacking fire into fire so you just cart yourself to go switch...or lose inevitably.
        true true. also i hated that theres no good wall placement for us to wallbang alatreon. its really hard to angle ourselves when alatreon is just mad flailing around, so we're mostlikely miss wallbang
            Only replying to mention a couple of caveats. Firstly, there's setups to wallbang him at the very start of the fight, reliably, on that tiny wall behind him which i find amusing. Secondly, if he's un-enraged, and starts flying, those are free downs, get up there and blow your slinger in his face :)
                wait what you can actually wallbang him during the start of the hunt??
                    Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
                        yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
                    There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
                    I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
To me the fight itself, might be the best one in all of World/Iceborne. The hit boxes are percise, fair, and he has enough openings that he can be punished, but you have to be quick. However, Escaton Judgement is still an annoying mechanic that limits playstyles. It's fine to make certain playstyles harder for different encounters, but saying "take element, even if it's bad for your weapon or die" is bad design.
classic mad cause bad. World Alatreon is such a good fight, some would say even more fun than fatty
I had way too much fun researching and building a set specifically for this fight. It‚Äôs as if we are hunters and have to adapt to the challenges in front of us.
I had alot of fun with the fight even if it was rly hard. Never played any MH before world but I figured the ability was cool af despite it being annoying to deal with.
Come on, I loved the fight with Alatreon
Good to see I‚Äôm not the only guy who likes this fight. Alatreon is one of my favorites because it forced me to think outside the box. It‚Äôs possible to beat him with some raw weps, but I like the experimentation of elemental builds that were otherwise ignorable for most of the game‚Äôs life cycle aside from doing super optimized runs. I‚Äôm used to playing mmo‚Äôs, so wipe mechanics are things I‚Äôm used to and it serves as a stress test for my builds. I remember trying it for the first time and getting smoked repeatedly. All that did was inspire me to try new stuff like sacrificing attack for elemental resist skills into my builds. Maybe I‚Äôm just a sucker for punishment. Plus I‚Äôm a CB player mostly and they nerfed SAED on Alatreon, so I had to get more comfortable using savage axe. Soloing with Gunlance was even harder but I made it work. Oh yeah Alatreon‚Äôs new moves and general attack patterns are cool as hell too. The sound, the AoE, all 5 elements, it‚Äôs beautiful

Only thing I wish was different was the way its armor skills worked. Not as good as Safi on its own despite all the hard work to get it
I've been stuck on this fucking dragon for about 5 months now, I think I'm just ass but I won't give up üí™
    What platform are you on? Maybe I can help you out
        On xbox, thanks for the offer but I really wanna solo this dragon since that's what I've done for the whole game. I just gotta get better so I'm gonna start practicing more üëç
Yeah, that seems about right
The only negative about world Alatreon is the elemental check, outside of that the rest of his moveset is very fair and far more creative than his 3rd Gen counterpart.
I‚Äôve never really enjoyed Alatreon. I don‚Äôt think he sucks but he‚Äôs not for me. I‚Äôm not a huge fan on his design, I‚Äôm not all in favour for Escatons judgement but not completely against it. It‚Äôs one of those fights for me where I did it, I killed it and probably won‚Äôt do again. Now that I‚Äôve expressed my opinion, I will accept my downvotes
I used to hate this fight using safi armor just for the true dragon awakening (elemental attack boost) when alatreon was first introduced to Iceborne you‚Äôre like never safe playing while your health keep ticking down. Once fatalis armor was available, oh man I had so much fun killing alat with an elemental weapon + so much room for offensive decos with fatty armor üíØ love the fight now
I love Alatreon in MHW, it was one of the most intense and challenging Solo fights I ever had in that game.
It‚Äôs honestly not that hard, I don‚Äôt know why people are still complaining about it so many years later. I mained hammer and it took me like an hour to put together a build that could kill Alatreon. The damage check was annoying but it was a way for Capcom to encourage build variety. Same reason why they made so many buffs to elemental damage after Drachen came out: it was literally too good and people complained about the lack of options.

Edit: Apparently it isn‚Äôt clear, despite the fact that OP‚Äôs meme is very specifically *only* about the elemental damage check supernova and I‚Äôm commenting on it, that I‚Äôm *also* specifically talking about the elemental damage check being not hard. The rest of the fight is tough, I‚Äôm not denying that nor have I ever. You can scrub thru my other replies on this thread, tho I know no one will otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have to make this edit. No where do I ever say that I think it‚Äôs an easy fight. I will stand by my opinion: the elemental damage check isn‚Äôt a bad mechanic. If you can‚Äôt reach it, redo your build. I was on this sub when Alatreon came out and I‚Äôve been on it up until now: the ONLY problem people have ever had with Alatreon is that they can‚Äôt just steamroll him with the same build they‚Äôve used for the rest of the game. You can look thru old posts and YouTube videos on this topic yourself. People have always, only, had an issue with Capcom ‚Äúforcing them to play a certain way‚Äù. No one has a problem with it being a tough fight and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs easy. I‚Äôm turning off replies for this comment because I can‚Äôt deal with the amount of people who can‚Äôt read
    Eh, we're all different. I've got so many hours in monster hunter world but I just hit a plateau. I just couldn't do alatreon fast enough with a hammer, so I opted for some other weapon.
    "Not that hard" If I had a penny for every time I heard someone say this about the same monster who literally split the community in half then I would have enough money to buy the entire state of Wisconsin.
         The reason it split the community in half is because half of it couldn‚Äôt put down their Raw builds. That‚Äôs not a hard fight, just a different one. It‚Äôs literally never been about how tough Alatreon is, people just don‚Äôt like that they can‚Äôt use the same build they steamrolled the rest of the game with. 

 We‚Äôre having this discussion in the comment thread of a meme *literally* only about Alatreon‚Äôs damage check. There‚Äôs even a bit of text in the meme that says ‚Äúonly get killed by the nova‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have good elemental sets‚Äù so even OP knows it‚Äôs just about the damage check
            That is a straight up lie. Tons of people find it hard despite using elemental builds.
                Exactly, the biggest problem that I have is the fact that I'm spending half the fight chasing him around the arena because he refuses to stay still.
                Exactly. I tried making an ice elemental set and still got wiped everytime. Even playing with randoms we just got owned. 

I got -11 downvotes in my other comment just for saying his need to make a "meta" set made me quit the game. 

Sorry but I don't want to grind 10+ hours or more just so I can make a set AND THEN actually starting to fight ans learn the monster...
            REALLY? I can't even count how many times I've used the exact builds from people who have beaten him and still not hitting the check. I've teamed up with people who actually do use element builds and we still got our asses handed to us. I've actually sat down and watched people beat his ass with a raw build so raw builds being unviable clearly isn't accurate. Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it.
                \>i've teamed up with people  


honestly that was a bit of a mistake. i found soloing him way more enjoyable and easier because you can triple topple him easier. Then again i may just be a scrub ls/cb/bow main so oh well :\^)
                > Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it. 

 So, in the same sentence, you‚Äôve stated that I‚Äôm not allowed to assume things and then you immediately make an assumption about me? The mental gymnastics on display, holy crap 

 Look, I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess? I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you‚Äôve watched people beat Alatreon with a Raw damage build but you can‚Äôt do it the intended way, with builds other people have beaten him with, then maybe you are just bad at the game. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, this game‚Äôs old af and people have been arguing over what makes Alatreon tough since it came out

 My flair is literally hammer. You can *see* that I main hammer. And you‚Äôre really going to talk to me about how difficult Alatreon was.
                    You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
                        I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
                            But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
                                Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                                    Thanks for the advice.
                        I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
                            Nice, good job.
                        I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
                I‚Äôm guessing the team you played with probably got dragonblighted a bunch and didnt check to nullberry it.

If you use alatreon‚Äôs lbg, the fight will become extremely easy. As long as you remember his movesets and to just keep walking left or right away from the walls. Then just keep shooting his front feet.

You won‚Äôt get any horn breaks but it‚Äôll be a piece of cake. Bring iceammo and fireammo crafts and you‚Äôre good to go.

Raw builds are possible but usually only recommended for solo to prevent wipe on first nova unless everyone in the team knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

But if you‚Äôre really struggling with alatreon, I recommend ala lbg. It does enough elem check even if you‚Äôre the only elem in a 4 man team.
            yeah, keep being a condescending prick. Not all people have sharp skill like you, thus the complaining
    I love Alatreon, it's my favorite fight in the game. But taking a hard fight that is supposed and intended to be hard and is good partially BECAUSE it's hard and saying "no it's not hard" is the worst possible defense I can imagine.
        I‚Äôm not talking about the fight. I‚Äôm specifically talking about the Nova, which OP is also doing in their meme.
            Ah alright
    It's honestly not that hard, I don't know why people are still assuming everyone has their skill level so many years later.
        ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playing since MH2. Alatreon in MH3 was way better‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a bad player. They, like many, just don‚Äôt like that they have to change how they play for one single monster in the entire game. Not even Fatalis asks you to change your build or playstyle. It‚Äôs one monster that you don‚Äôt even need to kill if you really don‚Äôt want to use an elemental build because Alatreon‚Äôs armour and weapons are all elemental damage focused anyway, and if you‚Äôre so in love with Raw damage then it‚Äôs all useless to you
        [deleted]
            I think you missed my point, I used comment OP's text to spin their assumptions on them. I'm on your side of this debate.
                Ah, Sorry. I just got sick of people assuming that everyone who complains about him must suck. I legit had someone tell me on YouTube that Team Darkside beat him so it must be easy.
                    Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.
                        The sad thing is that Alatreon was partially the reason I stopped playing World. I came back for Fatalis but I could never get to phase 3 but I liked him better because I could at the very least see what I did wrong and I wasn't having to rush to avoid a single move. Team Darkside themselves even proved that you could get through all of base game without taking damage, even now you still can but Alatreon is the only exception.
Alatreon in Tri and 3U went crazy. I had so much fun mastering that fight with the hammer. The ol‚Äô turn-a-pound.
How did you beat him? I'm probably at around 200 fails and I'm at the point of looking for advice
    Go get the frost fang weapons for whatever weapon type you run. It doesn't matter what type because he has different scaling for different weapon types.

Once you're actually in the fight you just want to stay aggressive. As many have said his hotboxes are incredibly clean, so you can dodge through them very reliably. The only attack you should really worry about is the body slam. If you dont have a crystal burst to stagger him out of the follow up l, it's basically a guarantee cart. Target the front legs until you get the first topple then switch to the head. The elemental check isn't really a big issue as long as you know how to stay aggressive on the front legs. The much bigger issue is usually doing enough damage to actually kill ala in under 4 escatons. At least for most first clears it is. That's why you want to target the head after you have weekend escatons once. Just make sure you survive the nova and then target the head for one of the best hitzones in the game. Above all else you want to stay close to ala and get hits in whenever you can. The fight is much more about having good damage uptime then it is about getting elemental topples. Also if you already have gotten a topple and ala starts flying, just let them. It's usually not worth fighting into it's flying attacks.
    Alright first up how the hell did you go in 200 times without realising you need to change what you're doing ? 

Now to answer your question: the absolute most sure-fire way of making alatreon piss easy is using the lunastra light bowgun as it has both fire and ice bullets + the safijiva armor. Afterwards get alatreon's light bowgun and farm even easier. Everyone, EVERYONE did this when he launched. You can also get any of the other alatreon weapons since he's always weak to dragon, but the first time beating him is made 1000 times easier using luna lbg
        I'm bad with any weapon besides the long sword and a lot of the fails were either I had a really bad run or other people never healed themselves(health dust supply depleted very fast),

I've had many almost wins(past 2 novas but had 2 downs) but always ended up failing because me or someone messed up and died
            Nah bruh you got this i believe in you. My buddy touched the lbg first time during alatreon and he was fine , and he's not even that crazy with his main weapon , and i was more of a HBG guy in terms of bow guns. I believe in you , just move and shoot üëç. 

I think we used this : https://youtu.be/gYO8z8pXa_g

Use the first build
                Actually made a post yesterday about how I finally beat Alatreon and showcasing the 3 legends that helped me, 

I will definitely look at the build and try it for doing the second Alatreon special assignment
    Big note he has dragon Blight which shafts elemental damage. If you slot for Blight resistance to the max it's no longer an issue.
I'm just sad I can not eb defensive and methodic like I'm with every single monster in game. 

I had a run where he killd me 3 times with the nova, and for 5 min he didn't even hit me
You can technically just punch Alatreon to death with raw dmg, just swap in Fortify and eat escaton judgement
Anyone who unironically agrees with this never fought Ala in MH3, because that fight was ass compared to Iceborne‚Äôs.
Farmed it with raw GS with 0 issues, just eat for the extra cart to be sure and boop m on the snoot.
He is a bastard , fr
"Whaaaaat?! I can't use the same blast or raw weapon the entire game?!?!" looking mfers.
    I think that attitude was worsened on Alatreons release because raging brachy had just come out, and EVERYONE was using his weapons at the time, it was a trap that people didn't want to climb out of
        Still do use his weapons, only ever change off them when doing alatreon and Safi, (use either a fire LS or ice Hammer for alatreon, and sticky demonbuster for Safi while I'm still making a aquashot)
    I got a big shield, and little legs, so I just want him to not jump around every 5 seconds. My elemental deeps are there... I just don't want to play extreme tag with him for 30 minutes.
When ala came out for MHW: "This sucks! This dps check is totally unfun and unbalanced" 

After ala has been out for 2+ years for MHW: "this sucks! This dps check is totally unfun and unbalanced" 

Glad to see nothing has changed. Being honest, the dps check is manageable even solo. However, there's no doubt it's overly tedious and the nova itself is a very unfun concept. Save or sucks are rough, and I'll never understand why they turned the entire ala fight into one.
    I think alot of players don't hate the nova itself but rather the fact that it's just wasting their time when they failed to proc the elemental topple and are just waiting for EJ to hit. When they missed the elemtal dps check he still has to transition to the other element and then EJ, they know the cart is coming and they can't do anything about it anymore.
This seems like a major skill issue and ‚Äúsoy wojac is my enemy‚Äù
I admire the effort that went into the meme, but I wholly disagree with the message. It's one of, if not THE best fight in the game. You can take whichever weapon you want, just make sure it has ice or fire element on it and you will succeed. 

If you played the game until now, you can xefeat this one too.
> Am I just a terrible hunter?

Yes
I think everyone thinks I hated fighting him I didn't this was just a meme that I wanted to put up üòÖ If I did complain about one thing I didn't like about the fight would be it sometimes felt like the fire attacks didn't hit me lol
3U Alatreon was a huge fucking wall for me. For the games and it's mechanics, it was a real tough hunt and at the time I mained the switch Axe. 

World/Iceborne Alatreon wasn't that challenging. Literally the only tough part about it was the nova and accidentally locking him in an element because of the stupid horn break mechanic. I get it, you had to be more strategic about fighting him in the new gen but like. Fuck man.
    The only thing 3U Alatreon has going for it in terms of difficulty is a bloated heath pool. Iceborne Ala has a far better moveset, hits harder and doesn't stall you by flying around.
I hate Alatreon‚Äôs fight so much. He‚Äôs literally why I haven‚Äôt fought Fatalis yet. Not that I couldn‚Äôt beat him, but seeing as his fight is a prerequisite to fighting Fatalis in World, it drained all my joy to even try. I‚Äôd literally do anything else than just get over my hatred of him to get through to that fight.
    Sounds like a madcuzbad situation. If its any consolation, the pre fatalis alatreon quest is like a half hp much easier alatreon. If you were anywhere remotely close to beating normal alatreon, or if you did already, then that pre fatalis quest should not be an issue for you. You may end up liking the Fatalis fight so I'd say its worth it.
        Cut him a break will you? Alatreons elemental check is nothing short of annoying and anytime anyone talks bad about it they basically get crucified. I get the idea, but why not make so that if you played by alatreons rules you get significantly more damage on him instead of not being able to fight him if you cant.
            Everything but the first sentence was meant to be cutting him a break already. But anyways, not sure what you mean by not being able to fight him if you dont play by alatreons rules. Even if you wanna ungabunga raw dmg dps him down, you've got a whole 15-18ish minutes to do it on 3 faints, add another cycle to the clock if you've got insurance. Or in the case of some weapons, do so much dmg that you kill him before he can even EJ. You dont have to play by Alatreon's rules at all. But, that is an interesting idea, getting extra dmg on him from ele, and I'd like to point out that we kind of have that? In the form of how much time he spends flopping on the ground during ele topples, which are dmg windows raw weapons cant get. And its possible to get 3 or so topples per EJ cycle. 

Caveat: i will come out and say that i dont like the concept of how his EJ works, but am indifferent to it in application, because its downsides (no ele topple full dmg EJ) never happen to me.
                I moreso meant having to deal with elemental bullshit at all. I ignored elemntal damage throught all the game so it was kidna annoying having to learn about it for 1 fight. My weapon class had bad elemntal damage so getting the check was harder. I had no idea which attacks did more ele damage, if any. The most infuriating part of this fight is other weapon classes either saying get gud cause they had to work half as hard for a mechanic I hated , and when I asked for help no came but when I healed through escaton instead everyone came by to tell at me.

I think my problem is that I love this community until this 1 dogshit fight that only exist just to piss me off.

Tdlr I dont like this guys fight so my advice was to switch up ur strat so u didnt have to deal with his mechanic at all
        I love how I complain and immediately there‚Äôs an assumption of ‚Äúmadcuzbad‚Äù. Actually getting really sick of the community‚Äôs go to answer for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this fight‚Äù is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash then‚Äù. I‚Äôve fashion hunted the entire game. I was a MH newbie and had no idea what I was even doing. It wasn‚Äôt until near Behemoth‚Äôs release that I learned traps were a thing and I was super confused on what capturing meant on investigations. I was by no means the smartest player. But with all the disadvantages I gave myself, willingly and unwittingly, I never thought the game was as hard as people said it was. Challenging, sure. But always fun.

And already I can see people saying, ‚ÄúOh well that‚Äôs the problem: you can‚Äôt fashion hunt Alatreon.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs literally the only one I figured I‚Äôd respect enough not to because everyone was putting mad hype on him because ‚ÄúBlack Dragon‚Äù. I actually went in there with a plan. And in my own friend group I had the least amount of carts against him.

And with all that. Even with me having defeated Alatreon multiple times now. I don‚Äôt like his fight.  It‚Äôs a garbage fight. Quite frankly it‚Äôs a disappointment in almost every regard. HELL, I like Behemoth‚Äôs fight more, and I‚Äôve carted more to him, than Alatreon! I didn‚Äôt beat him until like a quarter way through Iceborne, AND IVE BEEN WITH THIS GAME LAUNCH. (Note: I did beat him using an old armor set because professionals have standards) If I was to complain about any fight, it should be that one. But I like that fight!

And I know pre-res Alatreon‚Äôs health is half. I. Do not. Care. When I said I‚Äôd rather do anything else other than fight him again, I meant it. I‚Äôd rather go into a private server to see how long it would take to farm Safi‚Äôs weapons by myself. And I can‚Äôt even tell you how much time I wasted doing that the first time. And even that was a more enjoyable experience.
            With a rant that long id say madcuzbad was a safe assumption üòÇ for real tho bro at least have someone power u thru that fatty prereq quest if u dont wanna do it yourself, cause u may like fatty, he doesnt have alatreon's "bs". Super hard but no exact EJ type mechanic, nostalgic to many, good finale for mhw, godtier armor/weaps.
    Yeah alatreons mechanic is a real piece of work, my personal recommendation that everyone shits on is just try to outlast him. Get really good at his normal shit, take the loss at eschaton judgement (his nova) and come back harder. Should be enough to beat the  one needed to unlock fatalis.
The more posts I see on this  sub, the more I feel like I should not bother fghting this boss.
    You should. It's arguably one of the best fights in the game.
    If you want to miss out on the second best fight in the game because of some whiny redditors, that‚Äôs your choice.
    People are just bad, and refuse to adapt to a frankly simple mechanic, then complain when they die despite the game very clearly telling them they have to use elements.
    this is making me excited to get to him lmao what are you talking about
    As much as I hate this monster he's still got charm to him, I suggest just doing it.

I have my own reason why I'd rather get decked by three fatalis before I seriously fight him again but don't let that discourage you.
Btw if people think I'm complaining about the fight I'm  not I love the fight but man that fight was exhausting. I had to take a 20 minute break after killing him ü§£
At LeAsT iT iSnT a FiRe MoNsTeR!!!!!!

This community honestly smh my head

Maaaan killed it in one hit the game is too easy.
*tries to make the game hard*
WTF!? THE GAME IS TOO HARD ITS FORCING ME TO ENGAGE WITH MECHANICS I HAPPENED TO IGNORE UP UNTIL THIS POINT WTF REEEE!!!!
Folk are still complaining about World Alatreon?
    Because it's that annoying of a mechanic. This fight singlehandedly managed to make the community as annoying as DS1 community when it came out. Because the only thing that comes out of people's mouth is "git gud"
        Look man, I really think the complaints are over-exaggerated. 

He‚Äôs extremely fun. One of the best monsters in the game. 

Escathon really isn‚Äôt a big deal. I‚Äôve beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably.
            YOU'VE beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably and consider the fight as good. That doesn't mean that everyone else share the same sentiment as you have. I've beaten him enough times to get consistent procs to not die from EJ and still my opinion on it is that it's mid at best and just a frustrating snooze fest because of EJ. 

They're not exaggerating when alot of players consider that mechanic to be tedious than fun. Sure the outliers that does not learn are a part of the crowd but most often than not the ones criticising that mechanic are experienced players that can solo him.

Yes his hitboxes are good, if not the best in Iceborne. And yes his presentation is absolutely S tier that feels like he's an actual threat despite the progress we've made as a hunter at that point. And yes his moves are pretty predictable and easy to learn. But EJ completely up turns all that and changes a fight that was supposed to be exciting into a fight that can ultimately boils down to either adapt and have a chance to beat him or continuously slam your head against a wall until he dies or you relents and adapts.

Everyone eventually will learn how to beat him, that's not a debate. But the problem is is the time and effort required to do so even worth it. And for alot of players that up to this point in the game wasn't as invested to a mechanic that isn't even that good, it's not.
Monster Hunter players when the game about studying monsters and equipping themselves appropriately for the monsters their hunting makes them use something else to appropriately equip themselves.
Well, if you can't adapt to a monster by just changing your weapons, then maybe you're a bad hunter, 

Or a gunlancer. My honest condolence.
    We've been violated ever since GL came out. But alatreon is whole another level of disrespect.
        Hmm. You mean the guiding land? I don't know if gunlancers had been specifically suffered there. Can you elaborate?

Honestly, I like Alatreon. But it doesn't take a saint to feel sympathy with gunlancers.
            I meant since FU when Gunlance was introduced.
The doges are the wrong way around but otherwise pretty accurate
Alatreon is not only my favourite iceborne fight and monster, he is also my second favourite behind lagi. He is the proof that people did not experiment with setbuilding at all and that they were not ready because they did not grind the monsters that previously released. He was supposed to be an endgame challenge that you had to grind for. You had all the tools necessary to defeat him and chose not to use them, so stop whining after 2 years
I killed the alatreon solo with raw damage GS
The hunter should be the tiny little baby crying in the mhw one
I love Alatreon because it forces you to play aggressively and create an elemental set. No other monster requires you to make a set specifically for that fight. Some people hate the mechanics but I think it‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs a test of skill and demands you learn the mechanics which is why I like it. He destroyed me at first and it felt impossible but eventually I got better and put the blazing black dragon to rest. 

The only thing that kinda bothers me is after the first few phases he starts to freely switch elements, so if you can‚Äôt kill him in 15 mins or so then good luck. You can‚Äôt switch weapons unless you cart, no farcaster, so you better hope that you can meet the elemental check in one of those phases before he switches elements otherwise you have no other choice but to cart. In the later phases you only get half the time to meet the dps check than in the first two phases provided you broke the horn.
Unpopular opinion: not every fight needs to be the same ‚Äúsmack it until it dies with anything‚Äù battle.
It sucked at first but forcing you to play a different way (even if it was just using mainly elemental) was fine.
    Also unpopular opinion, EJ is completely unnecessary as a mechanic and resulted in a potentially great fight into a mid at best one.
Splish splash your opinion is trash
I don't think playing since MH2 would necessarily make you not bad at the game.
**You have alerted the horad**

hooard 

fuck it you have alerted the horse
    I think people think I hated the fight by posting this but it's the opposite üòÖ  I just wanted to post this I loved the fight although some of the fire attacks passed me off lol
As someone who loves his elementless builds, Alatreon brakes my heart to this day üò≠
World failed hard with alatreon,
Yeah completely breaks the flow of the game my friends and I usually don't run the highest dps weapons but this fight went too far with the have to use a specific element to one. The threshold was too high and still is its not a fun fight. It's so artificial in design compared to other bosses.
If someone's complaining they can't use their fave weapon type, they just suck with it, didn't bother to properly learn their openings. I know because I've been there and I got gud. And now Alatreon is the one that trembles when I enter the arena
"Wait a minute game, so you're telling me that I need to build a set in order to hunt this monster on a game designed around that??? THIS GAME IS TRASH!!!"
I will never understand all the whining about the elemental damage threshold. It's extremely easy to reach. Would love to see a hunt from the people failing it to understand exactly what's going on.
    They usually play too passive. They try to play really safe and end up missing way too many openings.
Alatreon sucks, Fatalis is much more fun.
    All these comments saying how perfect and fair alatreon was... meanwhile if you used the wrong weapon type/element you just....lose. Not to mention he spends as much time in the air as Kushala so that damage check timer is a reeeeeaaaal bitch if your weapon can't reach, on top of the element issue. 

I'll never understand how people could love alatreon but hate kushala, as annoying as the windshield/flying is, you don't instantly fail for being methodical/patient...just takes forever.

Fatalis is perfect and it's literally calculated to be finished in the last minute/second perfectly. The only issue is being stuck on him when he goes to drop on the floor. Even if you don't break the horns, there's no instant bullshit loss. You can still win....if you're good enough to not get hit.
I haaaaated alatreon. It was such a wall for me, the only good DB I had were lightning/dragon 

I figured DB have good elemental damage and being able to do consistent damage would be good. 

But no, it is literally a game changer to use fire/ice, if you don't you'll have SUCH a hard time meeting the check and surviving the nova, especially with the bastard in the air and out of reach so much. But that was such a bummer since there simply were no good fire DBs, they all have awful sharpness/affinity so when he switched it was pretty much automatic game over from there.
People coming in and explaining how u can still beat it are sort of just proving what makes alatreon so bad for so many people, yes u can beat it if u play raw, yes u can beat it with frostfang, bla bla bla. 

The point that seems to go right over your heads is that to some of us it just seems extremely tedious to complete what sounds like a goddamn grocery list to fight this monster, first, his mechanics require you to look shit up, which is already not great game design, second, every single phase of the fight carries some ticking time objective you must accomplish that you can't ignore:

\-Hit elemental threshold

\-Break horns

\-Prepare to tank Escaton

\-Repeat.

Any one of these steps that you did not accomplish you will fall out of wack and trip all over this hunt, THAT is the stressful part, yes it's possible, yes it's doable, but some of us don't want to follow a list of actions. And every person I've seen kill alatreon seems to do the SAME hunt every single time, it's a snooze fest at this point, that's not good.
This had me so weak üíÄ literally the only monster you can‚Äôt get away with running pure raw
Fuck Al and fat-talis mcfuckface

Timer is a terrible idea for ‚ÄúTHE FINAL BATTLE TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE WORLD!‚Äù but you only get a set time because gameplay
Having to completely make an optimal set for this is why I dropped the game and haven't done high endgame content

Edit: damn what was wrong with what I said lol
I feel they should have been more clear about the elemental cap i spend like 3 days getting steam rolled cause i couldnt figure that part out but once i did it was alot of fun i literally had to build a custom ice gs build with whatever shit i had at mr 60 and then the battle was a super satisfying one that i barely managed to beat
Yeah monster hunter has always been about doing 1 raw set and shit on all the game
Oozing of small dick energy.

MHW Alatreon: wow you garbage hunter, you didn't even manage to reach the lowest damage threshold that can easily be reached within 2 mins. Now I'm gonna wipe you out. Git gud you little bitch.
Seein all the bilds and what people bring......makes me incredibly upset at myself for deleting every  single Kulve Weapon when Iceborne started.

Wtf past me.

Oh well at least I could make a Safi build since I hat the mats,but it still sucks to miss out on Critical Element.
It's so hard to craft frostfang weapon...
Idiot can get toppled by a fucking insect
In solo mode, you can easily tank some deaths and fo  for a raw build ...
Jokes on you, I did cart 2 times tanking the novas but I also managed to beat him while only using a raw SnS.
ah yes, the my friend's favourite monster from when he played mhp3rd but grew to hate in iceborne so much so he quit the game, and what I (a complete newbie) consider one of the best fights in the game.   


dumb dragon took me 3 days to beat but it was so worth it. love you black dragon
gonna be real dude they specifically made frostfang barioth to give you a good weapon for alatreon
Is‚Ä¶ Is paralysis an element? Or am I gonna get ass wiped?
Gun him the fuck down with lunastra's light bowgun. It's what everyone else did . I vividly remember before alatreon released the game was normal monster hunter , afterwards it became call of duty with 4 people all using guns. Its like we were all collectively using melee weapons as a gesture of honor and sportsmanship, when steel wasn't working we made do with lead. Get his own light bowgun and he becomes as easy as every other monster. I got so used to his moveset i did it once with switchaxe too for the sake of completion
How is MHW Alatreon a cheems? lmao
I will admit I never liked fighting Alatreon, I beat it for the armor and then never fought it again after.
I had poured hundreds of hours into Gs and finally caved and made elemental dual blades, leaned his to play dual blades, and beat him that way
You can beat alatreon with GS.
I mean this whole game is supposed to be about bringing the right gear to every fight
My mhw game ended at alatreon. Unfun wall
They don't think the fight be like it is, but it do.
I remember making the coral pukei SA just to have decent elemental damage.

It didn't work.
Even though I died to these endgame fights lots of times and has these controversial mechanics, I like the fact that they *really* feel like a monster that can end the world. After all, MHW went for realism.
When gunlance mains can't use their gun  because ewememtal damig cheq.
Based Alatreon not giving a shit about your raw set and how much you love it
Honestly I need to fight that monster I need to get back into if anyone wants me on their team
    What platform are you on?
        Ps4 what about yourself
            Oh nice I'm on ps5
                Is it compatible for online
                    Yeah
                    Grinding to get gear for fatalis now after I beat altreon
Hot take: i liked world alatreon more.

I love being challenged by specific mechanics that force me to adapt.
Really is it compatible for online
You totally can go in raw it‚Äôs very easy just only die to the nova and nothing else then spam greatsword away, don‚Äôt let anyone here tell you you can‚Äôt do it cause I did
I main nearly all weapons but i like sns and dual blades and gsand the hammer the most 

My freind uses the longsword mainly and sometimes dual blades 

So we tried alatreon a lot of times until we were at the point were we just wanted to kill him no matter how so we used both ice dual blades and killed him so fast that we didnt even knew if he did his nova or his death animation 

so yeah guys use ice dual blades.
Come on man. I'm a scrub and I solo'd Alatreon with two different weapons and beat him with a team of bow guns. You've got this!
Ice greatsword go boom I don't have fire greatsword need to make one but alatreon one is good when he is in dragon mode
I beat Alatreon with charged long shelling only on gunlance. 

Did I suffer, yes. But that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an idiot that only knows how to shell.

And, lmao, why wouldn‚Äôt you jump at the opportunity to use a slightly different build vs the same raw Greatsword build you used for 99% of the game? You can still win, but must play perfectly.
Meanwhile fatalis got the opposite treatment
Yes. Because Capcom.
So because I think the elemental check is easy to achieve, you believe that shows "I don't know how Alatreon operates"? Oh boy.... I can be the only person running ice in a 4 person squad and get the elemynal check EASILY.

You have yourself a great day my friend, I don't have time for this shit.
Same bro. I finall after many many attempts did it solo. I reaƒ∫ly had to play this shit carefully. I had the frostfang barioth hammer with 930 Ice Element and I barely beat him around 26 minutes. He unloaded his escaton 3 times where oke time I had to die. I tried beating him since he came out, so this is a real dopamine shot here.
Alatreon in MHW is more stable, so it's ambiguous between being stronger or weaker
I got advice in the MHW discord that you can still go raw tho. Just gonna have to take the escaton cart since the ele check is only for keeping the escaton damage low but the raw damage will still kill him. Bonus if you jack in a Fortitude jewel. This is all assuming solo gameplay. If full team goes raw then might as well abandon.
    There's a few different ways you can do it raw. Solo you can tank Escaton, with a squad you can kill him before the first Escaton.



If I remember correctly, Alatreons hitzones are actually weaker to raw damage. Kinda funny
        I don't know how people tank a full damage Nova. 1100 defense, health boost 3, divine blessing 5, mantles, a health booster and jerky and still die before I can heal more than a couple times. I managed to beat it with a dragon build but it's still just insane to me
            I think he meant tank as in just eating it and using a cart.

Ala takes substantially more raw damage so if you‚Äôre proficient enough it‚Äôs still considerably faster to eat a judgement and run raw.
            You can't tank a full damage nova by yourself. It just isn't possible. It MIGHT be possible with a very well coordinated squad.

When the guy said "tank" it, he means just cart to the nova and come back.
                [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4) your right
    Yes, my first kill was solo raw hammer, with fortitude and I also ate to get another cart.


It was very intense and exhilarating to win despite but using the intended way!
    Not true with the solo. A group of friends and I beat Alatreon with Heavy Bow guns. You can tank the Judgement with a bonus cart or by killing him quick enough.
"*Whoa whoa whoa!* You want me to craft new gear to hunt that monster? That's not what this game is about!"
    Damn, its almost like raw weapons arent the only gear available
        We should make a physics prop bowgun that shoots explosive barrels
            Gravity Bowgun
                I want to pick up a jagras and fling it at 60 mph into an Anjanath's face
                    Me too, my friend. Me too
                    Deviljho time.
                        Great idea! I just need a deviljho's head on a big stick!
            Tape a stick to explosive barrel and it's a hammer
                I wanna chuck the thing like a football
        I feel offended reading this as a Greatsword main.
            Ok greatswords and maybe hammers are excused, but the rest arent.
    elementless Gang
This sound extremely weird without context
    Cut off "my friend" and Michael scott would Burst* through the wall with "that's what she said"
If you *ice* it properly first you certainly can
Sound advice for Monster Hunter AND other things.
You actually can.
    I mean, sure and you can also shower with ostrich eggs every morning.
        That's true as well.
        Waste of eggs and money at that point.
Then why aren't any hammers and greatswords good with elemental damage? If I have to craft new gear than fine whatever but to have to switch to using a weapon I never use and a set to go with that weapon seems a bit disloyal to the spirit of the game.
    Did you ever try using ele GS on alatreon? They gave typically raw weapons a boost in the fight specifically to address that point
        I tried awhile back and couldn't ever get the check but maybe ill try it again later. I've also heard that it's still more difficult for hammer and greatsword than other weapons even with the boost.
            Its more difficult with GS for sure than DB for example. But it is very doable. I say this as someone who's solo'ed him with both.
                Good to know. Really dislike how im getting downvote bombed though. Then again ive found I dislike most of the Monster Hunter community since the vets hate new players.
    While that's usually true, Alatreon has different elemental multipliers for each weapon type to balance them all out. There was never a need to switch weapon type against it, just don't use raw.
I like the fact that more than half of the replies only got half of that advice.
We're still talking about monster hunter right?
There are over 250 loadout slots for a reason, fellow hunter
2 more likes, just 2 more my dude and Satan will be proud.
True, but kjarr does make it a cakewalk
    some people hated it when they have to get kjarr just to kill alatreon. So my argument was for those kind of people who felt that kjarr is just too hard to get. You don;t need it actually so there's no reason on hating alatreon just because you are forced to use elemental weapons
        You can use two piece velkhana to get crit element, which I actually recommend over true crit element because silverlos/azure age armor has pretty mediocre slots. Silver rath/ and frostfang weapons can get the job done.
    *cries in having killed him first time with silver ratholos cause safi out of rotation and terrible luck*
And honestly, dual blades are super easy to learn the basics of. Beyblade that mf up
    Heck, even Glavenus or Rathalos GS works against ICE starting alatreon. I dont get the hate. To me alatreon is if not 1st then 2nd best fight in the game.
    Ion like the beyblade

I wanna keep my lunch man it was super good
I clearly feel this since I had to use these exact monster weapons to beat Alatreon since I can‚Äôt go online lol.
Speartuna critdraw GS got me my first solo elemental dps check ( before swapping to easy mode elemental savage axe)
You don‚Äôt technically need Kjarr, but man Kjarr weapons are so good and opens up your options because they have built in crit element. Kjarr sword fire is a phenomenal weapon, 60% crit anywhere. But frostfang is good too. I had to grind for 30 hours to get the Kjarr weapons I wanted though.. So that‚Äôs a bit of a downside
or just go in raw and tank the escatons, stack fortify and it‚Äôs a free 10-15 minute kill
I‚Äôm not a fan of the elemental limitations, but you are right about those clean hit boxes. I would enjoy it much more if I wasn‚Äôt constantly worried about the elemental threshold.
    It kinda takes away from the flow, they could have lowered it just a bit imo
        Go in with full confidence and ala won‚Äôt dictate the flow
    On the flip side I loved it because I never ever really take the time to make elemental sets as I always felt it was a pain to make one for each element. This time not only had I a strong incentive to fully build one, I only needed to build one for a single element. The ice set is still my only elemental set to this day, but it was nice to build something different than raw on a raw centric weapon.
        Same here. I normally just ran poison or blast damage. Alatreon made me make an elemental build. After I beat him. I spent a couple months building new Safi elemental Charge Blades. Now I have a tab of Alatreon armor sets paired with various elemental CB‚Äôs and decorations that I‚Äôll swap between accordingly.
        As a bow player at the time, I just swapped to my ice/fire sets but fuck it was still a lame fight. Better than Safi, but most of World/Iceborne‚Äôs big monsters let me down. 

I really liked KT, Behemoth, and Fatty tho
    You can kill him with raw, especially solo. You just have to be really good. Alatreon is a fair fight, he just poked holes people's playstyle.
        you do NOT have to be that good to kill him raw solo

eat for fortify, he escatons every ~6 minutes, giving you ~24 minutes to kill him

very easily doable especially when stacking fortify
I have heard of people getting his entire set before getting a single kill.
    You can do that for pretty much every monster if you're patient enough with the plunderblade
        The point is that it's unintentional lol
            The whole point of the plunder blade is to let you cat get materials. Being able to get equipment from a monster you haven't killed is just part of how it works. Potentially an oversight, but one they haven't changed. It could very well be intentional.

If they didn't want that to be possible all they would have to do make it so the parts gathered by your palico was only given to you if you completed the hunt. Yet they didn't.
                No.


The *point* is that you want to kill the monster. As this game is called monster *hunter* and the people who can craft the full armor set before killing him are literally not accomplishing their own objective üòÇ
                    Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
                        Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.


Are you really going to act like the point of monster hunter isn't killing monsters? Are you really going to sit here and downvote me and argue that a notable amount of MHW buyers paid $60 USD so they can run around with  a plunderblade?


Ffs are you hearing yourself? Are you just a contrarian or a legit troll? This is so childish good lord.



#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
                            >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
                The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
                    Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
    Many such cases.
        And the worst part is the fact that everyone defending this fight is a carbon copy, they always have the exact same argument.
            Even I git his weapon before a kill. It was pain, but atleast it's not the worst fight (looking at you Jay Leno)
                Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
                    Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
                        Good god, that chin is impressive.
                            I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
            What do people say to defend the fight? I‚Äôm not on mhw Reddit so I didn‚Äôt even know people hated this fight. I personally think this is in my top 3 fights of all time
                The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
                    But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
                        Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
                "Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
                    The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
                        Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
                    probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
                        So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
                            When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                                Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
                        Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
                            Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                                My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
    That was me with Fatalis.
It really depends. I think he is in best when he is on the ground. Especially the flying Ice version is sooo annoying, because it is really hard to deal significant damage that way. If he does this I either flashcancel his flight or use the clutchclaw to slam him to the ground
His hitboxes are great, but his hunt. Not so much.
An 8/10 fight brought down to a 1/10 because of a braindead awful mechanic
if you run charge blade, you don‚Äôt even need frostfang. You can one combo his dps check with Beotodus CB lmao
    Funny story, I was helping someone get ala yesterday who said "ala is an amazing fight but since I use CB it was impossible to get the elemental check as it's not a good elemental weapon". Couldn't believe my ears, was an MR250ish as well.
        "My brother in Christ, don't you realize that Impact phials aren't the only option?"

"Huh?!"
        my god, lmao

Safi armour + ele CB is a lot of fun and most of the time my preferred way to play CB (i just love safi set in general but it makes savage axe really nice)
        Wtf, the element check is so essy with the ice kjarr cb
            Im not very good at CB at all, but with a kjarr strongarm ice(and ice attack 6), I can get 2 elemental checks being the only one using an elemental build in a 4p hunt. CB savage axe is definitely the easiest way to suppress alatreons judgement, as for whatever reason they didn't put a modifier on it.
        To add onto the quote, elemental CB is absolutely brutal and most of the time will outmatch impact. For CBers out there, Charged Sword will give extra elemental damage if using elements power phials. If using Savage Axe, always make sure Power Axe Mode is active.
Alatreon was absolutely an amazing teacher for me and is also my favorite fight in the game by far. Prior to the fight releasing, I was probably okay at best. Just casually hitting monsters without a care in the world, getting hit and probably carting a lot or getting carried by SOS players I‚Äôd assume.

Alatreon‚Äôs release is what forced me to actually try really hard. Behemoth did too but it was a bit different. Randoms weren‚Äôt reliable at all those first few weeks so I had to actually play/learn solo. Alatreon was a 2 week grind for me. Went hard learning the movement, my weapon, making builds instead of using a raw build I found online for everything, etc. and finally beating them was incredible. Just because of how personal that fight felt, it‚Äôs my favorite in the game.

I‚Äôve gotten so far now thanks to that fight that I can casually do the fight with no issue, as well as next to every monster in the game. Also made me enjoy playing so much more (999-800 currently.) The fight forcing me to learn was the best thing to happen for me in the game and it‚Äôs now become one of my favorite games of all time because of how much fun I had after playing better. Alatreon will always be my go to fight now if I see it under an SOS. Love helping other players with it.
    It was absolutely a turning point for me as well. I was around mr200 when I solod my first ala as I spent a lot of time doing event quests, guiding lands and helping others. Since "mastering" ala and fatalis ive helped so many hunters with them and reached mr999 quite quickly as ive now seen almost 500 alas slayed and around 200 fatalis'.
    I was in the same boat, and I absolutely miss it. I felt like a badass when I killed it. My wife even got into it because she kept watching me lose to this guy over and over. 

 For some reason, Rise just isn‚Äôt as fun for me as World was.
>instead of just using the same raw set you use for the entire game.

*laughs in raw glaive and elemental bug*
I can't quite get the check with my Frostfsng Gunlance... yet. Debating if I want to keep working on my pokes or switch to something else for this fight. In MH3U I ended up having to switch to my Kibamaru set from my gunlance to beat him. And I originally made that sword/set for Brachydios because much like Alatreon I couldn't quite deal enough damage in the normally very generous time frame.

I was just a bit too sluggish with the gunlance. Wondering if I should adopt a similar strategy in World for Alatreon as well.
    Yeah, I'd guess that regular lance would be better. Not sure how different it is from gun though.
        Regular frostfang Lance with 4-6 ice attack gems is *very comfy*. You start to run into an issue of low Raw, if anything.
            Yeah I remember seeing an alatreon lance speedrun and was so impressed, just endlessly poking away with heroics and alatreon couldn't touch em.
Agreed; among the endgame fights, it's probably my favorite.
You've never tried to hunt him with a Gunlance, have you?
    Just one example, not a speedrun or anything like that, they're getting hit a lot.

https://youtu.be/4fSp3zxduOQ
        I'm not asking for proof, I did hunt him with a Gunlance it's not impossible. I'm asking if you've personally hunted him with a Gunlance.
            I have hunted him with every single weapon, and?
                Your original comment sound like you don't.
                    I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
                        It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
Elemental IG, Elemental Kinsect. Wake up, choose violence, beat the shit out of a dragon.

This fight is not that hard, but people fuss because you can't turtle the whole time and have to build for it. Sometimes you have to change your playstyle to beat something in a game.The horror.
Very fun fight tbh, even with Hammer.
i just wish, that they had released frost frang before alatreon. I still remember farming the ice weapon for alatreon only to realize that a week later the strongest ice weapons where about to drop.
Bit of a missed opportunity in my book.
I call BS. There is no way gunlance is a viable weapon against Alatreon. Unless I'm missing something?
    It's completely doable, but requires a proper build and relies on slaps and pokes rather than any shelling. Or you can brute force.
        Gunlance Alatreon really needs u to make a set to pump out any element u can and its a 100% slaplance playstyle at least to get the topple first
            I know most people bash you if you're not using ice or fire. But like... GL kinda struggles to keep up with Alatreons mobility some what, even with EE3 imo. And even with White Knight fully kitted and a proper elemental Safi build I couldn't do it. Whne you can keep up with him, the damage you can do just isn't really there and basic pokes don't add up to fuck all. Meeting the check is... rough.

So I farmed my ass off against Kulve until I got the Kjarr Water Buster for that fat free crit ele, augmented the shit out of it with regen 1 + element 2 (plus every custom element upgrade), made my best fuck Alatreon Safi set, and went to work.

Turns out water being meh doesn't matter a whole lot when you're rocking 1100+ element, and smacking the poor thing for 500-800~ using your full burst slap-lance combo, and poking for 200-300, it's disgusting.

It's absolutely doable, and I've since done it solo/multi-player with different weapons (easier with kjarrs by far, and the Alatreon GL, with drag. Atk6, imo) but man does it not feel good to fight with that weapon at all.
                Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
                    I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
        Once u get the topple then u can go back to mixing it up with shells again
        Doable, but no way in hell viable.
    All weapons are viable and the elemental check is actually very easy to achieve the hard part is breaking the horns so he doesn't swap elements
        But not all play styles are viable. If you use primarily shelling with gunlance, you will do only a tiny amount of elemental damage excluding the 3 fire damage from each blast.
            Even with an only shelling run you could easily get sub 10 you just have to take a cart at 6 mins
            That goes for a ton of monsters too though. Crit Draw GS works very well on kirin due to it's shitzones everywhere but the head, constant movement and AOEs, but is absolutely unnecessary on dodogama who practically explodes taking a TCS off its massive gullet
    just kill him in under 3 carts
    well hunters can mash the heavy swings instead of artillery tho,.  howevery yeah im curious if the elemental on gunlances is enough for alatreon's element dps check?
        I can with a fully element focused augmented water kjarr, or alatreons gunlance. 1100+ water element if built properly. Alatreon's GL I feel just nets more trips in general. But the damage is solid since dragon is okay in general. Unless you play it perfect and Alatreon hardly moves from like 2 spots, you're probably not dishing enough damage before a phase shift, if you're using fire or ice. 

The only real damage GL deals to Alatreon is in the full burst combo, without shellings, they're not worth it mostly, and it moves A LOT. So you're not gonna get that off unless it's basically down or does 1-2 specific moves.
            Why choose water over the elements he's weakest to?
                Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
                    I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
                        I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
Love the fight but Fatty is my #1 fight still.
So I've gotta ask, did alot of people think World was too easy back in the day? Cause I see that all the time now, the "Rise is easy compared to World" statement.

I should've known people we're saying the same thing here too lol.
    I think it was probably an experience thing for me. World was the first MH I ever played. Even using defender gear in low rank, I got beat up. 

I had to make legiana armor and an ice bow to beat high rank Diablos. It took me a long time to get it figured out. Black Diablos would still beat me down in my HR gear. 

In Rise, I'm not sure I ever failed a hunt. I'd maybe cart once or twice, but that's about it. 

I think part of it is that 1shot damage is toned down, and you are so much more mobile you can just avoid things.
        tbh I'm perfectly fine with 1shot damage being lowered, there's hardly a point in time where that *isn't* frustrating
            I think I'd rather be 1 shot than just stunlocked or something, though.
Well to be fair the last couple of monsters were much harder then the rest. But I like it, it really feels like end game and a real challenge to beat.
    That's what i'm wishing for in Sunbreak the most right now: Monsters that truly feel imposing and are a goal to work towards to.  
Sure, there are high level investigations, but it's not the same.
        I have felt it was pretty easy overall but finally started working through the HR event quests grinding to 100 and there have been a few apex fights that were surprisingly tough. I am enjoying having to be somewhat careful in my build and playstyle. The beginning was all just the same weapon for everyone but I'm getting some challenge now. I havent gotten to sunbreak yet but I hope there are some of the Alatreon Behemoth Fatalis level fights thrown in.
Very true, but id also say it‚Äôs pretty damn jarring that the entire game is on one side of the difficulty scale, then extreme behemoth, this and fatalis are on the other side. Capcom didn‚Äôt do a great job bridging the difficulty at all
You do realize there's such a thing as bad difficulty, right? World is easy, but some of its end game monsters are designed with artificial difficulty in mind. Most people who die to Ala die from his EJ attack.

You're fighting a DPS check, not a monster.
    If you‚Äôre good at the fight and using a suitable weapon, the dps check won‚Äôt be a problem. People spend half the fight running away and healing, then wonder why they died to EJ.
    nah, it wasn't "bad difficulty". it was just a monster with a different challenge to it.

all monsters are designed with "artificial difficulty" lol

just get out of your comfort zone and use an elemental weapon

>Most people who die to Ala die from his EJ attack.

yeah no shit lol

OP image is silly too, yeah you *are* bad at monster hunting if you get so comfortable with one weapon that you can't even change up your tactics for one of the hardest mons in the game
    Literally every monster is a DPS check. You just actually have to be good to beat this one.
        Technically yes, but also technically inaccurate. The DPS checks are only last resorts for other monsters. The main method of failure for every other monster fight is carting 3 times by any of the monster's moves.

If you're only failing Alatreon's quest from the EJ, that means the main monster you're fighting isn't Alatreon, but his artificial DPS check.
            Same with Alatreon. Even if you cart to just the EJ you have enough time to kill him with raw weapons. 

No, it means you've failed to either build a proper set, and or play well enough.
    Can we even consider it a dps check given how easy it is? Can take any weapon in the game, find its best craftable fire/ice weapon on the tree, throw in fire/ice attack and no other skills and still get the topple. All while doing pitiful dmg, but high elemental. Or you could just kill him with raw. If people are really only dying to EJ, that gives them 3 EJ's, a whole 15-18 min, to kill him in whatever way they want. 4 EJ's and 20+ min if insurance.
Having a boss a hundred or two hours in randomly say "lol no" because your build isnt on the approved checklist is a bit different than "why did I faint once bad game"
Alatreon is a pain because at the time of its release doing it solo was difficult. And doing it with other people was even more difficult. Depending on weapon typing a solo attempt could be cancer trying to hit the horn enough 

In co-op nobody would even try to use elemental weapons, nobody would focus the horn, they died by stepping on a bug, I saw two people playing blackjack in the back corner once‚Ä¶
Smokebomb or two, (and a point or three in stealth if you can afford it) and hell come right down super quick.
Air problems with Insect Glaive? What?
    More that i couldn't fight it with SnS or dual blades
        Throw a smoke bomb during an attack, he will look around and land.
            Fuck that's genius.

I haven't done the fight. Didn't even realize we had smoke bombs.

But that's genius.
                Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
                Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
The Raging Brachy update was four months before Alatreon though, and Alatreon didn't even drop anything good for raw weapons. It wasn't some huge shakeup
    I‚Äôm not saying that the arrival of Alatreon‚Äôs weapons shook up the meta. 

What I said was the fact that for 4 months, Raging brachy weapons were meta for raw heavy weapons. 

Then the arrival of Alatreon made those weapons unusable against it due to the escaton judgement. 

So unless you‚Äôre one of the few who went in bulldozes Alatreon with fortify, you have to put aside your raging brachy set with agitator 7 and master‚Äôs touch and go back and use/create a fire and ice set again specifically for this new additional monster
Shame they don't at least let you farcaster and switch sets if you don't meet the check...wastes both time and damage attacking fire into fire so you just cart yourself to go switch...or lose inevitably.
    true true. also i hated that theres no good wall placement for us to wallbang alatreon. its really hard to angle ourselves when alatreon is just mad flailing around, so we're mostlikely miss wallbang
        Only replying to mention a couple of caveats. Firstly, there's setups to wallbang him at the very start of the fight, reliably, on that tiny wall behind him which i find amusing. Secondly, if he's un-enraged, and starts flying, those are free downs, get up there and blow your slinger in his face :)
            wait what you can actually wallbang him during the start of the hunt??
                Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
                    yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
                There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
                I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
What platform are you on? Maybe I can help you out
    On xbox, thanks for the offer but I really wanna solo this dragon since that's what I've done for the whole game. I just gotta get better so I'm gonna start practicing more üëç
Eh, we're all different. I've got so many hours in monster hunter world but I just hit a plateau. I just couldn't do alatreon fast enough with a hammer, so I opted for some other weapon.
"Not that hard" If I had a penny for every time I heard someone say this about the same monster who literally split the community in half then I would have enough money to buy the entire state of Wisconsin.
     The reason it split the community in half is because half of it couldn‚Äôt put down their Raw builds. That‚Äôs not a hard fight, just a different one. It‚Äôs literally never been about how tough Alatreon is, people just don‚Äôt like that they can‚Äôt use the same build they steamrolled the rest of the game with. 

 We‚Äôre having this discussion in the comment thread of a meme *literally* only about Alatreon‚Äôs damage check. There‚Äôs even a bit of text in the meme that says ‚Äúonly get killed by the nova‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have good elemental sets‚Äù so even OP knows it‚Äôs just about the damage check
        That is a straight up lie. Tons of people find it hard despite using elemental builds.
            Exactly, the biggest problem that I have is the fact that I'm spending half the fight chasing him around the arena because he refuses to stay still.
            Exactly. I tried making an ice elemental set and still got wiped everytime. Even playing with randoms we just got owned. 

I got -11 downvotes in my other comment just for saying his need to make a "meta" set made me quit the game. 

Sorry but I don't want to grind 10+ hours or more just so I can make a set AND THEN actually starting to fight ans learn the monster...
        REALLY? I can't even count how many times I've used the exact builds from people who have beaten him and still not hitting the check. I've teamed up with people who actually do use element builds and we still got our asses handed to us. I've actually sat down and watched people beat his ass with a raw build so raw builds being unviable clearly isn't accurate. Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it.
            \>i've teamed up with people  


honestly that was a bit of a mistake. i found soloing him way more enjoyable and easier because you can triple topple him easier. Then again i may just be a scrub ls/cb/bow main so oh well :\^)
            > Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it. 

 So, in the same sentence, you‚Äôve stated that I‚Äôm not allowed to assume things and then you immediately make an assumption about me? The mental gymnastics on display, holy crap 

 Look, I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess? I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you‚Äôve watched people beat Alatreon with a Raw damage build but you can‚Äôt do it the intended way, with builds other people have beaten him with, then maybe you are just bad at the game. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, this game‚Äôs old af and people have been arguing over what makes Alatreon tough since it came out

 My flair is literally hammer. You can *see* that I main hammer. And you‚Äôre really going to talk to me about how difficult Alatreon was.
                You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
                    I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
                        But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
                            Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                                Thanks for the advice.
                    I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
                        Nice, good job.
                    I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
            I‚Äôm guessing the team you played with probably got dragonblighted a bunch and didnt check to nullberry it.

If you use alatreon‚Äôs lbg, the fight will become extremely easy. As long as you remember his movesets and to just keep walking left or right away from the walls. Then just keep shooting his front feet.

You won‚Äôt get any horn breaks but it‚Äôll be a piece of cake. Bring iceammo and fireammo crafts and you‚Äôre good to go.

Raw builds are possible but usually only recommended for solo to prevent wipe on first nova unless everyone in the team knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

But if you‚Äôre really struggling with alatreon, I recommend ala lbg. It does enough elem check even if you‚Äôre the only elem in a 4 man team.
        yeah, keep being a condescending prick. Not all people have sharp skill like you, thus the complaining
I love Alatreon, it's my favorite fight in the game. But taking a hard fight that is supposed and intended to be hard and is good partially BECAUSE it's hard and saying "no it's not hard" is the worst possible defense I can imagine.
    I‚Äôm not talking about the fight. I‚Äôm specifically talking about the Nova, which OP is also doing in their meme.
        Ah alright
It's honestly not that hard, I don't know why people are still assuming everyone has their skill level so many years later.
    ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playing since MH2. Alatreon in MH3 was way better‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a bad player. They, like many, just don‚Äôt like that they have to change how they play for one single monster in the entire game. Not even Fatalis asks you to change your build or playstyle. It‚Äôs one monster that you don‚Äôt even need to kill if you really don‚Äôt want to use an elemental build because Alatreon‚Äôs armour and weapons are all elemental damage focused anyway, and if you‚Äôre so in love with Raw damage then it‚Äôs all useless to you
    [deleted]
        I think you missed my point, I used comment OP's text to spin their assumptions on them. I'm on your side of this debate.
            Ah, Sorry. I just got sick of people assuming that everyone who complains about him must suck. I legit had someone tell me on YouTube that Team Darkside beat him so it must be easy.
                Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.
                    The sad thing is that Alatreon was partially the reason I stopped playing World. I came back for Fatalis but I could never get to phase 3 but I liked him better because I could at the very least see what I did wrong and I wasn't having to rush to avoid a single move. Team Darkside themselves even proved that you could get through all of base game without taking damage, even now you still can but Alatreon is the only exception.
Go get the frost fang weapons for whatever weapon type you run. It doesn't matter what type because he has different scaling for different weapon types.

Once you're actually in the fight you just want to stay aggressive. As many have said his hotboxes are incredibly clean, so you can dodge through them very reliably. The only attack you should really worry about is the body slam. If you dont have a crystal burst to stagger him out of the follow up l, it's basically a guarantee cart. Target the front legs until you get the first topple then switch to the head. The elemental check isn't really a big issue as long as you know how to stay aggressive on the front legs. The much bigger issue is usually doing enough damage to actually kill ala in under 4 escatons. At least for most first clears it is. That's why you want to target the head after you have weekend escatons once. Just make sure you survive the nova and then target the head for one of the best hitzones in the game. Above all else you want to stay close to ala and get hits in whenever you can. The fight is much more about having good damage uptime then it is about getting elemental topples. Also if you already have gotten a topple and ala starts flying, just let them. It's usually not worth fighting into it's flying attacks.
Alright first up how the hell did you go in 200 times without realising you need to change what you're doing ? 

Now to answer your question: the absolute most sure-fire way of making alatreon piss easy is using the lunastra light bowgun as it has both fire and ice bullets + the safijiva armor. Afterwards get alatreon's light bowgun and farm even easier. Everyone, EVERYONE did this when he launched. You can also get any of the other alatreon weapons since he's always weak to dragon, but the first time beating him is made 1000 times easier using luna lbg
    I'm bad with any weapon besides the long sword and a lot of the fails were either I had a really bad run or other people never healed themselves(health dust supply depleted very fast),

I've had many almost wins(past 2 novas but had 2 downs) but always ended up failing because me or someone messed up and died
        Nah bruh you got this i believe in you. My buddy touched the lbg first time during alatreon and he was fine , and he's not even that crazy with his main weapon , and i was more of a HBG guy in terms of bow guns. I believe in you , just move and shoot üëç. 

I think we used this : https://youtu.be/gYO8z8pXa_g

Use the first build
            Actually made a post yesterday about how I finally beat Alatreon and showcasing the 3 legends that helped me, 

I will definitely look at the build and try it for doing the second Alatreon special assignment
Big note he has dragon Blight which shafts elemental damage. If you slot for Blight resistance to the max it's no longer an issue.
I think that attitude was worsened on Alatreons release because raging brachy had just come out, and EVERYONE was using his weapons at the time, it was a trap that people didn't want to climb out of
    Still do use his weapons, only ever change off them when doing alatreon and Safi, (use either a fire LS or ice Hammer for alatreon, and sticky demonbuster for Safi while I'm still making a aquashot)
I got a big shield, and little legs, so I just want him to not jump around every 5 seconds. My elemental deeps are there... I just don't want to play extreme tag with him for 30 minutes.
I think alot of players don't hate the nova itself but rather the fact that it's just wasting their time when they failed to proc the elemental topple and are just waiting for EJ to hit. When they missed the elemtal dps check he still has to transition to the other element and then EJ, they know the cart is coming and they can't do anything about it anymore.
The only thing 3U Alatreon has going for it in terms of difficulty is a bloated heath pool. Iceborne Ala has a far better moveset, hits harder and doesn't stall you by flying around.
Sounds like a madcuzbad situation. If its any consolation, the pre fatalis alatreon quest is like a half hp much easier alatreon. If you were anywhere remotely close to beating normal alatreon, or if you did already, then that pre fatalis quest should not be an issue for you. You may end up liking the Fatalis fight so I'd say its worth it.
    Cut him a break will you? Alatreons elemental check is nothing short of annoying and anytime anyone talks bad about it they basically get crucified. I get the idea, but why not make so that if you played by alatreons rules you get significantly more damage on him instead of not being able to fight him if you cant.
        Everything but the first sentence was meant to be cutting him a break already. But anyways, not sure what you mean by not being able to fight him if you dont play by alatreons rules. Even if you wanna ungabunga raw dmg dps him down, you've got a whole 15-18ish minutes to do it on 3 faints, add another cycle to the clock if you've got insurance. Or in the case of some weapons, do so much dmg that you kill him before he can even EJ. You dont have to play by Alatreon's rules at all. But, that is an interesting idea, getting extra dmg on him from ele, and I'd like to point out that we kind of have that? In the form of how much time he spends flopping on the ground during ele topples, which are dmg windows raw weapons cant get. And its possible to get 3 or so topples per EJ cycle. 

Caveat: i will come out and say that i dont like the concept of how his EJ works, but am indifferent to it in application, because its downsides (no ele topple full dmg EJ) never happen to me.
            I moreso meant having to deal with elemental bullshit at all. I ignored elemntal damage throught all the game so it was kidna annoying having to learn about it for 1 fight. My weapon class had bad elemntal damage so getting the check was harder. I had no idea which attacks did more ele damage, if any. The most infuriating part of this fight is other weapon classes either saying get gud cause they had to work half as hard for a mechanic I hated , and when I asked for help no came but when I healed through escaton instead everyone came by to tell at me.

I think my problem is that I love this community until this 1 dogshit fight that only exist just to piss me off.

Tdlr I dont like this guys fight so my advice was to switch up ur strat so u didnt have to deal with his mechanic at all
    I love how I complain and immediately there‚Äôs an assumption of ‚Äúmadcuzbad‚Äù. Actually getting really sick of the community‚Äôs go to answer for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this fight‚Äù is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash then‚Äù. I‚Äôve fashion hunted the entire game. I was a MH newbie and had no idea what I was even doing. It wasn‚Äôt until near Behemoth‚Äôs release that I learned traps were a thing and I was super confused on what capturing meant on investigations. I was by no means the smartest player. But with all the disadvantages I gave myself, willingly and unwittingly, I never thought the game was as hard as people said it was. Challenging, sure. But always fun.

And already I can see people saying, ‚ÄúOh well that‚Äôs the problem: you can‚Äôt fashion hunt Alatreon.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs literally the only one I figured I‚Äôd respect enough not to because everyone was putting mad hype on him because ‚ÄúBlack Dragon‚Äù. I actually went in there with a plan. And in my own friend group I had the least amount of carts against him.

And with all that. Even with me having defeated Alatreon multiple times now. I don‚Äôt like his fight.  It‚Äôs a garbage fight. Quite frankly it‚Äôs a disappointment in almost every regard. HELL, I like Behemoth‚Äôs fight more, and I‚Äôve carted more to him, than Alatreon! I didn‚Äôt beat him until like a quarter way through Iceborne, AND IVE BEEN WITH THIS GAME LAUNCH. (Note: I did beat him using an old armor set because professionals have standards) If I was to complain about any fight, it should be that one. But I like that fight!

And I know pre-res Alatreon‚Äôs health is half. I. Do not. Care. When I said I‚Äôd rather do anything else other than fight him again, I meant it. I‚Äôd rather go into a private server to see how long it would take to farm Safi‚Äôs weapons by myself. And I can‚Äôt even tell you how much time I wasted doing that the first time. And even that was a more enjoyable experience.
        With a rant that long id say madcuzbad was a safe assumption üòÇ for real tho bro at least have someone power u thru that fatty prereq quest if u dont wanna do it yourself, cause u may like fatty, he doesnt have alatreon's "bs". Super hard but no exact EJ type mechanic, nostalgic to many, good finale for mhw, godtier armor/weaps.
Yeah alatreons mechanic is a real piece of work, my personal recommendation that everyone shits on is just try to outlast him. Get really good at his normal shit, take the loss at eschaton judgement (his nova) and come back harder. Should be enough to beat the  one needed to unlock fatalis.
You should. It's arguably one of the best fights in the game.
If you want to miss out on the second best fight in the game because of some whiny redditors, that‚Äôs your choice.
People are just bad, and refuse to adapt to a frankly simple mechanic, then complain when they die despite the game very clearly telling them they have to use elements.
this is making me excited to get to him lmao what are you talking about
As much as I hate this monster he's still got charm to him, I suggest just doing it.

I have my own reason why I'd rather get decked by three fatalis before I seriously fight him again but don't let that discourage you.
Because it's that annoying of a mechanic. This fight singlehandedly managed to make the community as annoying as DS1 community when it came out. Because the only thing that comes out of people's mouth is "git gud"
    Look man, I really think the complaints are over-exaggerated. 

He‚Äôs extremely fun. One of the best monsters in the game. 

Escathon really isn‚Äôt a big deal. I‚Äôve beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably.
        YOU'VE beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably and consider the fight as good. That doesn't mean that everyone else share the same sentiment as you have. I've beaten him enough times to get consistent procs to not die from EJ and still my opinion on it is that it's mid at best and just a frustrating snooze fest because of EJ. 

They're not exaggerating when alot of players consider that mechanic to be tedious than fun. Sure the outliers that does not learn are a part of the crowd but most often than not the ones criticising that mechanic are experienced players that can solo him.

Yes his hitboxes are good, if not the best in Iceborne. And yes his presentation is absolutely S tier that feels like he's an actual threat despite the progress we've made as a hunter at that point. And yes his moves are pretty predictable and easy to learn. But EJ completely up turns all that and changes a fight that was supposed to be exciting into a fight that can ultimately boils down to either adapt and have a chance to beat him or continuously slam your head against a wall until he dies or you relents and adapts.

Everyone eventually will learn how to beat him, that's not a debate. But the problem is is the time and effort required to do so even worth it. And for alot of players that up to this point in the game wasn't as invested to a mechanic that isn't even that good, it's not.
We've been violated ever since GL came out. But alatreon is whole another level of disrespect.
    Hmm. You mean the guiding land? I don't know if gunlancers had been specifically suffered there. Can you elaborate?

Honestly, I like Alatreon. But it doesn't take a saint to feel sympathy with gunlancers.
        I meant since FU when Gunlance was introduced.
Also unpopular opinion, EJ is completely unnecessary as a mechanic and resulted in a potentially great fight into a mid at best one.
I think people think I hated the fight by posting this but it's the opposite üòÖ  I just wanted to post this I loved the fight although some of the fire attacks passed me off lol
They usually play too passive. They try to play really safe and end up missing way too many openings.
All these comments saying how perfect and fair alatreon was... meanwhile if you used the wrong weapon type/element you just....lose. Not to mention he spends as much time in the air as Kushala so that damage check timer is a reeeeeaaaal bitch if your weapon can't reach, on top of the element issue. 

I'll never understand how people could love alatreon but hate kushala, as annoying as the windshield/flying is, you don't instantly fail for being methodical/patient...just takes forever.

Fatalis is perfect and it's literally calculated to be finished in the last minute/second perfectly. The only issue is being stuck on him when he goes to drop on the floor. Even if you don't break the horns, there's no instant bullshit loss. You can still win....if you're good enough to not get hit.
What platform are you on?
    Ps4 what about yourself
        Oh nice I'm on ps5
            Is it compatible for online
                Yeah
                Grinding to get gear for fatalis now after I beat altreon
There's a few different ways you can do it raw. Solo you can tank Escaton, with a squad you can kill him before the first Escaton.



If I remember correctly, Alatreons hitzones are actually weaker to raw damage. Kinda funny
    I don't know how people tank a full damage Nova. 1100 defense, health boost 3, divine blessing 5, mantles, a health booster and jerky and still die before I can heal more than a couple times. I managed to beat it with a dragon build but it's still just insane to me
        I think he meant tank as in just eating it and using a cart.

Ala takes substantially more raw damage so if you‚Äôre proficient enough it‚Äôs still considerably faster to eat a judgement and run raw.
        You can't tank a full damage nova by yourself. It just isn't possible. It MIGHT be possible with a very well coordinated squad.

When the guy said "tank" it, he means just cart to the nova and come back.
            [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxnVOb8ch4) your right
Yes, my first kill was solo raw hammer, with fortitude and I also ate to get another cart.


It was very intense and exhilarating to win despite but using the intended way!
Not true with the solo. A group of friends and I beat Alatreon with Heavy Bow guns. You can tank the Judgement with a bonus cart or by killing him quick enough.
Damn, its almost like raw weapons arent the only gear available
    We should make a physics prop bowgun that shoots explosive barrels
        Gravity Bowgun
            I want to pick up a jagras and fling it at 60 mph into an Anjanath's face
                Me too, my friend. Me too
                Deviljho time.
                    Great idea! I just need a deviljho's head on a big stick!
        Tape a stick to explosive barrel and it's a hammer
            I wanna chuck the thing like a football
    I feel offended reading this as a Greatsword main.
        Ok greatswords and maybe hammers are excused, but the rest arent.
elementless Gang
Cut off "my friend" and Michael scott would Burst* through the wall with "that's what she said"
I mean, sure and you can also shower with ostrich eggs every morning.
    That's true as well.
    Waste of eggs and money at that point.
Did you ever try using ele GS on alatreon? They gave typically raw weapons a boost in the fight specifically to address that point
    I tried awhile back and couldn't ever get the check but maybe ill try it again later. I've also heard that it's still more difficult for hammer and greatsword than other weapons even with the boost.
        Its more difficult with GS for sure than DB for example. But it is very doable. I say this as someone who's solo'ed him with both.
            Good to know. Really dislike how im getting downvote bombed though. Then again ive found I dislike most of the Monster Hunter community since the vets hate new players.
While that's usually true, Alatreon has different elemental multipliers for each weapon type to balance them all out. There was never a need to switch weapon type against it, just don't use raw.
some people hated it when they have to get kjarr just to kill alatreon. So my argument was for those kind of people who felt that kjarr is just too hard to get. You don;t need it actually so there's no reason on hating alatreon just because you are forced to use elemental weapons
    You can use two piece velkhana to get crit element, which I actually recommend over true crit element because silverlos/azure age armor has pretty mediocre slots. Silver rath/ and frostfang weapons can get the job done.
*cries in having killed him first time with silver ratholos cause safi out of rotation and terrible luck*
Heck, even Glavenus or Rathalos GS works against ICE starting alatreon. I dont get the hate. To me alatreon is if not 1st then 2nd best fight in the game.
Ion like the beyblade

I wanna keep my lunch man it was super good
It kinda takes away from the flow, they could have lowered it just a bit imo
    Go in with full confidence and ala won‚Äôt dictate the flow
On the flip side I loved it because I never ever really take the time to make elemental sets as I always felt it was a pain to make one for each element. This time not only had I a strong incentive to fully build one, I only needed to build one for a single element. The ice set is still my only elemental set to this day, but it was nice to build something different than raw on a raw centric weapon.
    Same here. I normally just ran poison or blast damage. Alatreon made me make an elemental build. After I beat him. I spent a couple months building new Safi elemental Charge Blades. Now I have a tab of Alatreon armor sets paired with various elemental CB‚Äôs and decorations that I‚Äôll swap between accordingly.
    As a bow player at the time, I just swapped to my ice/fire sets but fuck it was still a lame fight. Better than Safi, but most of World/Iceborne‚Äôs big monsters let me down. 

I really liked KT, Behemoth, and Fatty tho
You can kill him with raw, especially solo. You just have to be really good. Alatreon is a fair fight, he just poked holes people's playstyle.
    you do NOT have to be that good to kill him raw solo

eat for fortify, he escatons every ~6 minutes, giving you ~24 minutes to kill him

very easily doable especially when stacking fortify
You can do that for pretty much every monster if you're patient enough with the plunderblade
    The point is that it's unintentional lol
        The whole point of the plunder blade is to let you cat get materials. Being able to get equipment from a monster you haven't killed is just part of how it works. Potentially an oversight, but one they haven't changed. It could very well be intentional.

If they didn't want that to be possible all they would have to do make it so the parts gathered by your palico was only given to you if you completed the hunt. Yet they didn't.
            No.


The *point* is that you want to kill the monster. As this game is called monster *hunter* and the people who can craft the full armor set before killing him are literally not accomplishing their own objective üòÇ
                Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
                    Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.


Are you really going to act like the point of monster hunter isn't killing monsters? Are you really going to sit here and downvote me and argue that a notable amount of MHW buyers paid $60 USD so they can run around with  a plunderblade?


Ffs are you hearing yourself? Are you just a contrarian or a legit troll? This is so childish good lord.



#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
                        >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
            The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
                Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
Many such cases.
    And the worst part is the fact that everyone defending this fight is a carbon copy, they always have the exact same argument.
        Even I git his weapon before a kill. It was pain, but atleast it's not the worst fight (looking at you Jay Leno)
            Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
                Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
                    Good god, that chin is impressive.
                        I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
        What do people say to defend the fight? I‚Äôm not on mhw Reddit so I didn‚Äôt even know people hated this fight. I personally think this is in my top 3 fights of all time
            The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
                But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
                    Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
            "Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
                The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
                    Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
                probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
                    So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
                        When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                            Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
                    Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
                        Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                            My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
That was me with Fatalis.
Funny story, I was helping someone get ala yesterday who said "ala is an amazing fight but since I use CB it was impossible to get the elemental check as it's not a good elemental weapon". Couldn't believe my ears, was an MR250ish as well.
    "My brother in Christ, don't you realize that Impact phials aren't the only option?"

"Huh?!"
    my god, lmao

Safi armour + ele CB is a lot of fun and most of the time my preferred way to play CB (i just love safi set in general but it makes savage axe really nice)
    Wtf, the element check is so essy with the ice kjarr cb
        Im not very good at CB at all, but with a kjarr strongarm ice(and ice attack 6), I can get 2 elemental checks being the only one using an elemental build in a 4p hunt. CB savage axe is definitely the easiest way to suppress alatreons judgement, as for whatever reason they didn't put a modifier on it.
    To add onto the quote, elemental CB is absolutely brutal and most of the time will outmatch impact. For CBers out there, Charged Sword will give extra elemental damage if using elements power phials. If using Savage Axe, always make sure Power Axe Mode is active.
It was absolutely a turning point for me as well. I was around mr200 when I solod my first ala as I spent a lot of time doing event quests, guiding lands and helping others. Since "mastering" ala and fatalis ive helped so many hunters with them and reached mr999 quite quickly as ive now seen almost 500 alas slayed and around 200 fatalis'.
I was in the same boat, and I absolutely miss it. I felt like a badass when I killed it. My wife even got into it because she kept watching me lose to this guy over and over. 

 For some reason, Rise just isn‚Äôt as fun for me as World was.
Yeah, I'd guess that regular lance would be better. Not sure how different it is from gun though.
    Regular frostfang Lance with 4-6 ice attack gems is *very comfy*. You start to run into an issue of low Raw, if anything.
        Yeah I remember seeing an alatreon lance speedrun and was so impressed, just endlessly poking away with heroics and alatreon couldn't touch em.
Just one example, not a speedrun or anything like that, they're getting hit a lot.

https://youtu.be/4fSp3zxduOQ
    I'm not asking for proof, I did hunt him with a Gunlance it's not impossible. I'm asking if you've personally hunted him with a Gunlance.
        I have hunted him with every single weapon, and?
            Your original comment sound like you don't.
                I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
                    It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
It's completely doable, but requires a proper build and relies on slaps and pokes rather than any shelling. Or you can brute force.
    Gunlance Alatreon really needs u to make a set to pump out any element u can and its a 100% slaplance playstyle at least to get the topple first
        I know most people bash you if you're not using ice or fire. But like... GL kinda struggles to keep up with Alatreons mobility some what, even with EE3 imo. And even with White Knight fully kitted and a proper elemental Safi build I couldn't do it. Whne you can keep up with him, the damage you can do just isn't really there and basic pokes don't add up to fuck all. Meeting the check is... rough.

So I farmed my ass off against Kulve until I got the Kjarr Water Buster for that fat free crit ele, augmented the shit out of it with regen 1 + element 2 (plus every custom element upgrade), made my best fuck Alatreon Safi set, and went to work.

Turns out water being meh doesn't matter a whole lot when you're rocking 1100+ element, and smacking the poor thing for 500-800~ using your full burst slap-lance combo, and poking for 200-300, it's disgusting.

It's absolutely doable, and I've since done it solo/multi-player with different weapons (easier with kjarrs by far, and the Alatreon GL, with drag. Atk6, imo) but man does it not feel good to fight with that weapon at all.
            Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
                I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
    Once u get the topple then u can go back to mixing it up with shells again
    Doable, but no way in hell viable.
All weapons are viable and the elemental check is actually very easy to achieve the hard part is breaking the horns so he doesn't swap elements
    But not all play styles are viable. If you use primarily shelling with gunlance, you will do only a tiny amount of elemental damage excluding the 3 fire damage from each blast.
        Even with an only shelling run you could easily get sub 10 you just have to take a cart at 6 mins
        That goes for a ton of monsters too though. Crit Draw GS works very well on kirin due to it's shitzones everywhere but the head, constant movement and AOEs, but is absolutely unnecessary on dodogama who practically explodes taking a TCS off its massive gullet
just kill him in under 3 carts
well hunters can mash the heavy swings instead of artillery tho,.  howevery yeah im curious if the elemental on gunlances is enough for alatreon's element dps check?
    I can with a fully element focused augmented water kjarr, or alatreons gunlance. 1100+ water element if built properly. Alatreon's GL I feel just nets more trips in general. But the damage is solid since dragon is okay in general. Unless you play it perfect and Alatreon hardly moves from like 2 spots, you're probably not dishing enough damage before a phase shift, if you're using fire or ice. 

The only real damage GL deals to Alatreon is in the full burst combo, without shellings, they're not worth it mostly, and it moves A LOT. So you're not gonna get that off unless it's basically down or does 1-2 specific moves.
        Why choose water over the elements he's weakest to?
            Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
                I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
                    I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
I think it was probably an experience thing for me. World was the first MH I ever played. Even using defender gear in low rank, I got beat up. 

I had to make legiana armor and an ice bow to beat high rank Diablos. It took me a long time to get it figured out. Black Diablos would still beat me down in my HR gear. 

In Rise, I'm not sure I ever failed a hunt. I'd maybe cart once or twice, but that's about it. 

I think part of it is that 1shot damage is toned down, and you are so much more mobile you can just avoid things.
    tbh I'm perfectly fine with 1shot damage being lowered, there's hardly a point in time where that *isn't* frustrating
        I think I'd rather be 1 shot than just stunlocked or something, though.
That's what i'm wishing for in Sunbreak the most right now: Monsters that truly feel imposing and are a goal to work towards to.  
Sure, there are high level investigations, but it's not the same.
    I have felt it was pretty easy overall but finally started working through the HR event quests grinding to 100 and there have been a few apex fights that were surprisingly tough. I am enjoying having to be somewhat careful in my build and playstyle. The beginning was all just the same weapon for everyone but I'm getting some challenge now. I havent gotten to sunbreak yet but I hope there are some of the Alatreon Behemoth Fatalis level fights thrown in.
If you‚Äôre good at the fight and using a suitable weapon, the dps check won‚Äôt be a problem. People spend half the fight running away and healing, then wonder why they died to EJ.
nah, it wasn't "bad difficulty". it was just a monster with a different challenge to it.

all monsters are designed with "artificial difficulty" lol

just get out of your comfort zone and use an elemental weapon

>Most people who die to Ala die from his EJ attack.

yeah no shit lol

OP image is silly too, yeah you *are* bad at monster hunting if you get so comfortable with one weapon that you can't even change up your tactics for one of the hardest mons in the game
Literally every monster is a DPS check. You just actually have to be good to beat this one.
    Technically yes, but also technically inaccurate. The DPS checks are only last resorts for other monsters. The main method of failure for every other monster fight is carting 3 times by any of the monster's moves.

If you're only failing Alatreon's quest from the EJ, that means the main monster you're fighting isn't Alatreon, but his artificial DPS check.
        Same with Alatreon. Even if you cart to just the EJ you have enough time to kill him with raw weapons. 

No, it means you've failed to either build a proper set, and or play well enough.
Can we even consider it a dps check given how easy it is? Can take any weapon in the game, find its best craftable fire/ice weapon on the tree, throw in fire/ice attack and no other skills and still get the topple. All while doing pitiful dmg, but high elemental. Or you could just kill him with raw. If people are really only dying to EJ, that gives them 3 EJ's, a whole 15-18 min, to kill him in whatever way they want. 4 EJ's and 20+ min if insurance.
More that i couldn't fight it with SnS or dual blades
    Throw a smoke bomb during an attack, he will look around and land.
        Fuck that's genius.

I haven't done the fight. Didn't even realize we had smoke bombs.

But that's genius.
            Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
            Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
I‚Äôm not saying that the arrival of Alatreon‚Äôs weapons shook up the meta. 

What I said was the fact that for 4 months, Raging brachy weapons were meta for raw heavy weapons. 

Then the arrival of Alatreon made those weapons unusable against it due to the escaton judgement. 

So unless you‚Äôre one of the few who went in bulldozes Alatreon with fortify, you have to put aside your raging brachy set with agitator 7 and master‚Äôs touch and go back and use/create a fire and ice set again specifically for this new additional monster
true true. also i hated that theres no good wall placement for us to wallbang alatreon. its really hard to angle ourselves when alatreon is just mad flailing around, so we're mostlikely miss wallbang
    Only replying to mention a couple of caveats. Firstly, there's setups to wallbang him at the very start of the fight, reliably, on that tiny wall behind him which i find amusing. Secondly, if he's un-enraged, and starts flying, those are free downs, get up there and blow your slinger in his face :)
        wait what you can actually wallbang him during the start of the hunt??
            Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
                yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
            There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
            I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
On xbox, thanks for the offer but I really wanna solo this dragon since that's what I've done for the whole game. I just gotta get better so I'm gonna start practicing more üëç
 The reason it split the community in half is because half of it couldn‚Äôt put down their Raw builds. That‚Äôs not a hard fight, just a different one. It‚Äôs literally never been about how tough Alatreon is, people just don‚Äôt like that they can‚Äôt use the same build they steamrolled the rest of the game with. 

 We‚Äôre having this discussion in the comment thread of a meme *literally* only about Alatreon‚Äôs damage check. There‚Äôs even a bit of text in the meme that says ‚Äúonly get killed by the nova‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have good elemental sets‚Äù so even OP knows it‚Äôs just about the damage check
    That is a straight up lie. Tons of people find it hard despite using elemental builds.
        Exactly, the biggest problem that I have is the fact that I'm spending half the fight chasing him around the arena because he refuses to stay still.
        Exactly. I tried making an ice elemental set and still got wiped everytime. Even playing with randoms we just got owned. 

I got -11 downvotes in my other comment just for saying his need to make a "meta" set made me quit the game. 

Sorry but I don't want to grind 10+ hours or more just so I can make a set AND THEN actually starting to fight ans learn the monster...
    REALLY? I can't even count how many times I've used the exact builds from people who have beaten him and still not hitting the check. I've teamed up with people who actually do use element builds and we still got our asses handed to us. I've actually sat down and watched people beat his ass with a raw build so raw builds being unviable clearly isn't accurate. Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it.
        \>i've teamed up with people  


honestly that was a bit of a mistake. i found soloing him way more enjoyable and easier because you can triple topple him easier. Then again i may just be a scrub ls/cb/bow main so oh well :\^)
        > Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it. 

 So, in the same sentence, you‚Äôve stated that I‚Äôm not allowed to assume things and then you immediately make an assumption about me? The mental gymnastics on display, holy crap 

 Look, I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess? I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you‚Äôve watched people beat Alatreon with a Raw damage build but you can‚Äôt do it the intended way, with builds other people have beaten him with, then maybe you are just bad at the game. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, this game‚Äôs old af and people have been arguing over what makes Alatreon tough since it came out

 My flair is literally hammer. You can *see* that I main hammer. And you‚Äôre really going to talk to me about how difficult Alatreon was.
            You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
                I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
                    But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
                        Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                            Thanks for the advice.
                I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
                    Nice, good job.
                I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
        I‚Äôm guessing the team you played with probably got dragonblighted a bunch and didnt check to nullberry it.

If you use alatreon‚Äôs lbg, the fight will become extremely easy. As long as you remember his movesets and to just keep walking left or right away from the walls. Then just keep shooting his front feet.

You won‚Äôt get any horn breaks but it‚Äôll be a piece of cake. Bring iceammo and fireammo crafts and you‚Äôre good to go.

Raw builds are possible but usually only recommended for solo to prevent wipe on first nova unless everyone in the team knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

But if you‚Äôre really struggling with alatreon, I recommend ala lbg. It does enough elem check even if you‚Äôre the only elem in a 4 man team.
    yeah, keep being a condescending prick. Not all people have sharp skill like you, thus the complaining
I‚Äôm not talking about the fight. I‚Äôm specifically talking about the Nova, which OP is also doing in their meme.
    Ah alright
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playing since MH2. Alatreon in MH3 was way better‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a bad player. They, like many, just don‚Äôt like that they have to change how they play for one single monster in the entire game. Not even Fatalis asks you to change your build or playstyle. It‚Äôs one monster that you don‚Äôt even need to kill if you really don‚Äôt want to use an elemental build because Alatreon‚Äôs armour and weapons are all elemental damage focused anyway, and if you‚Äôre so in love with Raw damage then it‚Äôs all useless to you
[deleted]
    I think you missed my point, I used comment OP's text to spin their assumptions on them. I'm on your side of this debate.
        Ah, Sorry. I just got sick of people assuming that everyone who complains about him must suck. I legit had someone tell me on YouTube that Team Darkside beat him so it must be easy.
            Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.
                The sad thing is that Alatreon was partially the reason I stopped playing World. I came back for Fatalis but I could never get to phase 3 but I liked him better because I could at the very least see what I did wrong and I wasn't having to rush to avoid a single move. Team Darkside themselves even proved that you could get through all of base game without taking damage, even now you still can but Alatreon is the only exception.
I'm bad with any weapon besides the long sword and a lot of the fails were either I had a really bad run or other people never healed themselves(health dust supply depleted very fast),

I've had many almost wins(past 2 novas but had 2 downs) but always ended up failing because me or someone messed up and died
    Nah bruh you got this i believe in you. My buddy touched the lbg first time during alatreon and he was fine , and he's not even that crazy with his main weapon , and i was more of a HBG guy in terms of bow guns. I believe in you , just move and shoot üëç. 

I think we used this : https://youtu.be/gYO8z8pXa_g

Use the first build
        Actually made a post yesterday about how I finally beat Alatreon and showcasing the 3 legends that helped me, 

I will definitely look at the build and try it for doing the second Alatreon special assignment
Still do use his weapons, only ever change off them when doing alatreon and Safi, (use either a fire LS or ice Hammer for alatreon, and sticky demonbuster for Safi while I'm still making a aquashot)
Cut him a break will you? Alatreons elemental check is nothing short of annoying and anytime anyone talks bad about it they basically get crucified. I get the idea, but why not make so that if you played by alatreons rules you get significantly more damage on him instead of not being able to fight him if you cant.
    Everything but the first sentence was meant to be cutting him a break already. But anyways, not sure what you mean by not being able to fight him if you dont play by alatreons rules. Even if you wanna ungabunga raw dmg dps him down, you've got a whole 15-18ish minutes to do it on 3 faints, add another cycle to the clock if you've got insurance. Or in the case of some weapons, do so much dmg that you kill him before he can even EJ. You dont have to play by Alatreon's rules at all. But, that is an interesting idea, getting extra dmg on him from ele, and I'd like to point out that we kind of have that? In the form of how much time he spends flopping on the ground during ele topples, which are dmg windows raw weapons cant get. And its possible to get 3 or so topples per EJ cycle. 

Caveat: i will come out and say that i dont like the concept of how his EJ works, but am indifferent to it in application, because its downsides (no ele topple full dmg EJ) never happen to me.
        I moreso meant having to deal with elemental bullshit at all. I ignored elemntal damage throught all the game so it was kidna annoying having to learn about it for 1 fight. My weapon class had bad elemntal damage so getting the check was harder. I had no idea which attacks did more ele damage, if any. The most infuriating part of this fight is other weapon classes either saying get gud cause they had to work half as hard for a mechanic I hated , and when I asked for help no came but when I healed through escaton instead everyone came by to tell at me.

I think my problem is that I love this community until this 1 dogshit fight that only exist just to piss me off.

Tdlr I dont like this guys fight so my advice was to switch up ur strat so u didnt have to deal with his mechanic at all
I love how I complain and immediately there‚Äôs an assumption of ‚Äúmadcuzbad‚Äù. Actually getting really sick of the community‚Äôs go to answer for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this fight‚Äù is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash then‚Äù. I‚Äôve fashion hunted the entire game. I was a MH newbie and had no idea what I was even doing. It wasn‚Äôt until near Behemoth‚Äôs release that I learned traps were a thing and I was super confused on what capturing meant on investigations. I was by no means the smartest player. But with all the disadvantages I gave myself, willingly and unwittingly, I never thought the game was as hard as people said it was. Challenging, sure. But always fun.

And already I can see people saying, ‚ÄúOh well that‚Äôs the problem: you can‚Äôt fashion hunt Alatreon.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs literally the only one I figured I‚Äôd respect enough not to because everyone was putting mad hype on him because ‚ÄúBlack Dragon‚Äù. I actually went in there with a plan. And in my own friend group I had the least amount of carts against him.

And with all that. Even with me having defeated Alatreon multiple times now. I don‚Äôt like his fight.  It‚Äôs a garbage fight. Quite frankly it‚Äôs a disappointment in almost every regard. HELL, I like Behemoth‚Äôs fight more, and I‚Äôve carted more to him, than Alatreon! I didn‚Äôt beat him until like a quarter way through Iceborne, AND IVE BEEN WITH THIS GAME LAUNCH. (Note: I did beat him using an old armor set because professionals have standards) If I was to complain about any fight, it should be that one. But I like that fight!

And I know pre-res Alatreon‚Äôs health is half. I. Do not. Care. When I said I‚Äôd rather do anything else other than fight him again, I meant it. I‚Äôd rather go into a private server to see how long it would take to farm Safi‚Äôs weapons by myself. And I can‚Äôt even tell you how much time I wasted doing that the first time. And even that was a more enjoyable experience.
    With a rant that long id say madcuzbad was a safe assumption üòÇ for real tho bro at least have someone power u thru that fatty prereq quest if u dont wanna do it yourself, cause u may like fatty, he doesnt have alatreon's "bs". Super hard but no exact EJ type mechanic, nostalgic to many, good finale for mhw, godtier armor/weaps.
Look man, I really think the complaints are over-exaggerated. 

He‚Äôs extremely fun. One of the best monsters in the game. 

Escathon really isn‚Äôt a big deal. I‚Äôve beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably.
    YOU'VE beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably and consider the fight as good. That doesn't mean that everyone else share the same sentiment as you have. I've beaten him enough times to get consistent procs to not die from EJ and still my opinion on it is that it's mid at best and just a frustrating snooze fest because of EJ. 

They're not exaggerating when alot of players consider that mechanic to be tedious than fun. Sure the outliers that does not learn are a part of the crowd but most often than not the ones criticising that mechanic are experienced players that can solo him.

Yes his hitboxes are good, if not the best in Iceborne. And yes his presentation is absolutely S tier that feels like he's an actual threat despite the progress we've made as a hunter at that point. And yes his moves are pretty predictable and easy to learn. But EJ completely up turns all that and changes a fight that was supposed to be exciting into a fight that can ultimately boils down to either adapt and have a chance to beat him or continuously slam your head against a wall until he dies or you relents and adapts.

Everyone eventually will learn how to beat him, that's not a debate. But the problem is is the time and effort required to do so even worth it. And for alot of players that up to this point in the game wasn't as invested to a mechanic that isn't even that good, it's not.
Hmm. You mean the guiding land? I don't know if gunlancers had been specifically suffered there. Can you elaborate?

Honestly, I like Alatreon. But it doesn't take a saint to feel sympathy with gunlancers.
    I meant since FU when Gunlance was introduced.
Ps4 what about yourself
    Oh nice I'm on ps5
        Is it compatible for online
            Yeah
            Grinding to get gear for fatalis now after I beat altreon
I don't know how people tank a full damage Nova. 1100 defense, health boost 3, divine blessing 5, mantles, a health booster and jerky and still die before I can heal more than a couple times. I managed to beat it with a dragon build but it's still just insane to me
    I think he meant tank as in just eating it and using a cart.

Ala takes substantially more raw damage so if you‚Äôre proficient enough it‚Äôs still considerably faster to eat a judgement and run raw.
    You can't tank a full damage nova by yourself. It just isn't possible. It MIGHT be possible with a very well coordinated squad.

When the guy said "tank" it, he means just cart to the nova and come back.

We should make a physics prop bowgun that shoots explosive barrels
    Gravity Bowgun
        I want to pick up a jagras and fling it at 60 mph into an Anjanath's face
            Me too, my friend. Me too
            Deviljho time.
                Great idea! I just need a deviljho's head on a big stick!
    Tape a stick to explosive barrel and it's a hammer
        I wanna chuck the thing like a football
I feel offended reading this as a Greatsword main.
    Ok greatswords and maybe hammers are excused, but the rest arent.
That's true as well.
Waste of eggs and money at that point.
I tried awhile back and couldn't ever get the check but maybe ill try it again later. I've also heard that it's still more difficult for hammer and greatsword than other weapons even with the boost.
    Its more difficult with GS for sure than DB for example. But it is very doable. I say this as someone who's solo'ed him with both.
        Good to know. Really dislike how im getting downvote bombed though. Then again ive found I dislike most of the Monster Hunter community since the vets hate new players.
You can use two piece velkhana to get crit element, which I actually recommend over true crit element because silverlos/azure age armor has pretty mediocre slots. Silver rath/ and frostfang weapons can get the job done.
Go in with full confidence and ala won‚Äôt dictate the flow
Same here. I normally just ran poison or blast damage. Alatreon made me make an elemental build. After I beat him. I spent a couple months building new Safi elemental Charge Blades. Now I have a tab of Alatreon armor sets paired with various elemental CB‚Äôs and decorations that I‚Äôll swap between accordingly.
As a bow player at the time, I just swapped to my ice/fire sets but fuck it was still a lame fight. Better than Safi, but most of World/Iceborne‚Äôs big monsters let me down. 

I really liked KT, Behemoth, and Fatty tho
you do NOT have to be that good to kill him raw solo

eat for fortify, he escatons every ~6 minutes, giving you ~24 minutes to kill him

very easily doable especially when stacking fortify
The point is that it's unintentional lol
    The whole point of the plunder blade is to let you cat get materials. Being able to get equipment from a monster you haven't killed is just part of how it works. Potentially an oversight, but one they haven't changed. It could very well be intentional.

If they didn't want that to be possible all they would have to do make it so the parts gathered by your palico was only given to you if you completed the hunt. Yet they didn't.
        No.


The *point* is that you want to kill the monster. As this game is called monster *hunter* and the people who can craft the full armor set before killing him are literally not accomplishing their own objective üòÇ
            Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
                Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.


Are you really going to act like the point of monster hunter isn't killing monsters? Are you really going to sit here and downvote me and argue that a notable amount of MHW buyers paid $60 USD so they can run around with  a plunderblade?


Ffs are you hearing yourself? Are you just a contrarian or a legit troll? This is so childish good lord.



#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
                    >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
        The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
            Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
And the worst part is the fact that everyone defending this fight is a carbon copy, they always have the exact same argument.
    Even I git his weapon before a kill. It was pain, but atleast it's not the worst fight (looking at you Jay Leno)
        Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
            Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
                Good god, that chin is impressive.
                    I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
    What do people say to defend the fight? I‚Äôm not on mhw Reddit so I didn‚Äôt even know people hated this fight. I personally think this is in my top 3 fights of all time
        The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
            But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
                Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
        "Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
            The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
                Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
            probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
                So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
                    When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                        Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
                Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
                    Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                        My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
"My brother in Christ, don't you realize that Impact phials aren't the only option?"

"Huh?!"
my god, lmao

Safi armour + ele CB is a lot of fun and most of the time my preferred way to play CB (i just love safi set in general but it makes savage axe really nice)
Wtf, the element check is so essy with the ice kjarr cb
    Im not very good at CB at all, but with a kjarr strongarm ice(and ice attack 6), I can get 2 elemental checks being the only one using an elemental build in a 4p hunt. CB savage axe is definitely the easiest way to suppress alatreons judgement, as for whatever reason they didn't put a modifier on it.
To add onto the quote, elemental CB is absolutely brutal and most of the time will outmatch impact. For CBers out there, Charged Sword will give extra elemental damage if using elements power phials. If using Savage Axe, always make sure Power Axe Mode is active.
Regular frostfang Lance with 4-6 ice attack gems is *very comfy*. You start to run into an issue of low Raw, if anything.
    Yeah I remember seeing an alatreon lance speedrun and was so impressed, just endlessly poking away with heroics and alatreon couldn't touch em.
I'm not asking for proof, I did hunt him with a Gunlance it's not impossible. I'm asking if you've personally hunted him with a Gunlance.
    I have hunted him with every single weapon, and?
        Your original comment sound like you don't.
            I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
                It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
Gunlance Alatreon really needs u to make a set to pump out any element u can and its a 100% slaplance playstyle at least to get the topple first
    I know most people bash you if you're not using ice or fire. But like... GL kinda struggles to keep up with Alatreons mobility some what, even with EE3 imo. And even with White Knight fully kitted and a proper elemental Safi build I couldn't do it. Whne you can keep up with him, the damage you can do just isn't really there and basic pokes don't add up to fuck all. Meeting the check is... rough.

So I farmed my ass off against Kulve until I got the Kjarr Water Buster for that fat free crit ele, augmented the shit out of it with regen 1 + element 2 (plus every custom element upgrade), made my best fuck Alatreon Safi set, and went to work.

Turns out water being meh doesn't matter a whole lot when you're rocking 1100+ element, and smacking the poor thing for 500-800~ using your full burst slap-lance combo, and poking for 200-300, it's disgusting.

It's absolutely doable, and I've since done it solo/multi-player with different weapons (easier with kjarrs by far, and the Alatreon GL, with drag. Atk6, imo) but man does it not feel good to fight with that weapon at all.
        Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
            I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
Once u get the topple then u can go back to mixing it up with shells again
Doable, but no way in hell viable.
But not all play styles are viable. If you use primarily shelling with gunlance, you will do only a tiny amount of elemental damage excluding the 3 fire damage from each blast.
    Even with an only shelling run you could easily get sub 10 you just have to take a cart at 6 mins
    That goes for a ton of monsters too though. Crit Draw GS works very well on kirin due to it's shitzones everywhere but the head, constant movement and AOEs, but is absolutely unnecessary on dodogama who practically explodes taking a TCS off its massive gullet
I can with a fully element focused augmented water kjarr, or alatreons gunlance. 1100+ water element if built properly. Alatreon's GL I feel just nets more trips in general. But the damage is solid since dragon is okay in general. Unless you play it perfect and Alatreon hardly moves from like 2 spots, you're probably not dishing enough damage before a phase shift, if you're using fire or ice. 

The only real damage GL deals to Alatreon is in the full burst combo, without shellings, they're not worth it mostly, and it moves A LOT. So you're not gonna get that off unless it's basically down or does 1-2 specific moves.
    Why choose water over the elements he's weakest to?
        Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
            I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
                I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
tbh I'm perfectly fine with 1shot damage being lowered, there's hardly a point in time where that *isn't* frustrating
    I think I'd rather be 1 shot than just stunlocked or something, though.
I have felt it was pretty easy overall but finally started working through the HR event quests grinding to 100 and there have been a few apex fights that were surprisingly tough. I am enjoying having to be somewhat careful in my build and playstyle. The beginning was all just the same weapon for everyone but I'm getting some challenge now. I havent gotten to sunbreak yet but I hope there are some of the Alatreon Behemoth Fatalis level fights thrown in.
Technically yes, but also technically inaccurate. The DPS checks are only last resorts for other monsters. The main method of failure for every other monster fight is carting 3 times by any of the monster's moves.

If you're only failing Alatreon's quest from the EJ, that means the main monster you're fighting isn't Alatreon, but his artificial DPS check.
    Same with Alatreon. Even if you cart to just the EJ you have enough time to kill him with raw weapons. 

No, it means you've failed to either build a proper set, and or play well enough.
Throw a smoke bomb during an attack, he will look around and land.
    Fuck that's genius.

I haven't done the fight. Didn't even realize we had smoke bombs.

But that's genius.
        Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
        Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
Only replying to mention a couple of caveats. Firstly, there's setups to wallbang him at the very start of the fight, reliably, on that tiny wall behind him which i find amusing. Secondly, if he's un-enraged, and starts flying, those are free downs, get up there and blow your slinger in his face :)
    wait what you can actually wallbang him during the start of the hunt??
        Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
            yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
        There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
        I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
That is a straight up lie. Tons of people find it hard despite using elemental builds.
    Exactly, the biggest problem that I have is the fact that I'm spending half the fight chasing him around the arena because he refuses to stay still.
    Exactly. I tried making an ice elemental set and still got wiped everytime. Even playing with randoms we just got owned. 

I got -11 downvotes in my other comment just for saying his need to make a "meta" set made me quit the game. 

Sorry but I don't want to grind 10+ hours or more just so I can make a set AND THEN actually starting to fight ans learn the monster...
REALLY? I can't even count how many times I've used the exact builds from people who have beaten him and still not hitting the check. I've teamed up with people who actually do use element builds and we still got our asses handed to us. I've actually sat down and watched people beat his ass with a raw build so raw builds being unviable clearly isn't accurate. Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it.
    \>i've teamed up with people  


honestly that was a bit of a mistake. i found soloing him way more enjoyable and easier because you can triple topple him easier. Then again i may just be a scrub ls/cb/bow main so oh well :\^)
    > Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it. 

 So, in the same sentence, you‚Äôve stated that I‚Äôm not allowed to assume things and then you immediately make an assumption about me? The mental gymnastics on display, holy crap 

 Look, I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess? I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you‚Äôve watched people beat Alatreon with a Raw damage build but you can‚Äôt do it the intended way, with builds other people have beaten him with, then maybe you are just bad at the game. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, this game‚Äôs old af and people have been arguing over what makes Alatreon tough since it came out

 My flair is literally hammer. You can *see* that I main hammer. And you‚Äôre really going to talk to me about how difficult Alatreon was.
        You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
            I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
                But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
                    Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                        Thanks for the advice.
            I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
                Nice, good job.
            I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
    I‚Äôm guessing the team you played with probably got dragonblighted a bunch and didnt check to nullberry it.

If you use alatreon‚Äôs lbg, the fight will become extremely easy. As long as you remember his movesets and to just keep walking left or right away from the walls. Then just keep shooting his front feet.

You won‚Äôt get any horn breaks but it‚Äôll be a piece of cake. Bring iceammo and fireammo crafts and you‚Äôre good to go.

Raw builds are possible but usually only recommended for solo to prevent wipe on first nova unless everyone in the team knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

But if you‚Äôre really struggling with alatreon, I recommend ala lbg. It does enough elem check even if you‚Äôre the only elem in a 4 man team.
yeah, keep being a condescending prick. Not all people have sharp skill like you, thus the complaining
Ah alright
I think you missed my point, I used comment OP's text to spin their assumptions on them. I'm on your side of this debate.
    Ah, Sorry. I just got sick of people assuming that everyone who complains about him must suck. I legit had someone tell me on YouTube that Team Darkside beat him so it must be easy.
        Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.
            The sad thing is that Alatreon was partially the reason I stopped playing World. I came back for Fatalis but I could never get to phase 3 but I liked him better because I could at the very least see what I did wrong and I wasn't having to rush to avoid a single move. Team Darkside themselves even proved that you could get through all of base game without taking damage, even now you still can but Alatreon is the only exception.
Nah bruh you got this i believe in you. My buddy touched the lbg first time during alatreon and he was fine , and he's not even that crazy with his main weapon , and i was more of a HBG guy in terms of bow guns. I believe in you , just move and shoot üëç. 

I think we used this : https://youtu.be/gYO8z8pXa_g

Use the first build
    Actually made a post yesterday about how I finally beat Alatreon and showcasing the 3 legends that helped me, 

I will definitely look at the build and try it for doing the second Alatreon special assignment
Everything but the first sentence was meant to be cutting him a break already. But anyways, not sure what you mean by not being able to fight him if you dont play by alatreons rules. Even if you wanna ungabunga raw dmg dps him down, you've got a whole 15-18ish minutes to do it on 3 faints, add another cycle to the clock if you've got insurance. Or in the case of some weapons, do so much dmg that you kill him before he can even EJ. You dont have to play by Alatreon's rules at all. But, that is an interesting idea, getting extra dmg on him from ele, and I'd like to point out that we kind of have that? In the form of how much time he spends flopping on the ground during ele topples, which are dmg windows raw weapons cant get. And its possible to get 3 or so topples per EJ cycle. 

Caveat: i will come out and say that i dont like the concept of how his EJ works, but am indifferent to it in application, because its downsides (no ele topple full dmg EJ) never happen to me.
    I moreso meant having to deal with elemental bullshit at all. I ignored elemntal damage throught all the game so it was kidna annoying having to learn about it for 1 fight. My weapon class had bad elemntal damage so getting the check was harder. I had no idea which attacks did more ele damage, if any. The most infuriating part of this fight is other weapon classes either saying get gud cause they had to work half as hard for a mechanic I hated , and when I asked for help no came but when I healed through escaton instead everyone came by to tell at me.

I think my problem is that I love this community until this 1 dogshit fight that only exist just to piss me off.

Tdlr I dont like this guys fight so my advice was to switch up ur strat so u didnt have to deal with his mechanic at all
With a rant that long id say madcuzbad was a safe assumption üòÇ for real tho bro at least have someone power u thru that fatty prereq quest if u dont wanna do it yourself, cause u may like fatty, he doesnt have alatreon's "bs". Super hard but no exact EJ type mechanic, nostalgic to many, good finale for mhw, godtier armor/weaps.
YOU'VE beaten him with nearly all melee weapons comfortably and consider the fight as good. That doesn't mean that everyone else share the same sentiment as you have. I've beaten him enough times to get consistent procs to not die from EJ and still my opinion on it is that it's mid at best and just a frustrating snooze fest because of EJ. 

They're not exaggerating when alot of players consider that mechanic to be tedious than fun. Sure the outliers that does not learn are a part of the crowd but most often than not the ones criticising that mechanic are experienced players that can solo him.

Yes his hitboxes are good, if not the best in Iceborne. And yes his presentation is absolutely S tier that feels like he's an actual threat despite the progress we've made as a hunter at that point. And yes his moves are pretty predictable and easy to learn. But EJ completely up turns all that and changes a fight that was supposed to be exciting into a fight that can ultimately boils down to either adapt and have a chance to beat him or continuously slam your head against a wall until he dies or you relents and adapts.

Everyone eventually will learn how to beat him, that's not a debate. But the problem is is the time and effort required to do so even worth it. And for alot of players that up to this point in the game wasn't as invested to a mechanic that isn't even that good, it's not.
I meant since FU when Gunlance was introduced.
Oh nice I'm on ps5
    Is it compatible for online
        Yeah
        Grinding to get gear for fatalis now after I beat altreon
I think he meant tank as in just eating it and using a cart.

Ala takes substantially more raw damage so if you‚Äôre proficient enough it‚Äôs still considerably faster to eat a judgement and run raw.
You can't tank a full damage nova by yourself. It just isn't possible. It MIGHT be possible with a very well coordinated squad.

When the guy said "tank" it, he means just cart to the nova and come back.

Ok greatswords and maybe hammers are excused, but the rest arent.
Its more difficult with GS for sure than DB for example. But it is very doable. I say this as someone who's solo'ed him with both.
    Good to know. Really dislike how im getting downvote bombed though. Then again ive found I dislike most of the Monster Hunter community since the vets hate new players.
The whole point of the plunder blade is to let you cat get materials. Being able to get equipment from a monster you haven't killed is just part of how it works. Potentially an oversight, but one they haven't changed. It could very well be intentional.

If they didn't want that to be possible all they would have to do make it so the parts gathered by your palico was only given to you if you completed the hunt. Yet they didn't.
    No.


The *point* is that you want to kill the monster. As this game is called monster *hunter* and the people who can craft the full armor set before killing him are literally not accomplishing their own objective üòÇ
        Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
            Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.


Are you really going to act like the point of monster hunter isn't killing monsters? Are you really going to sit here and downvote me and argue that a notable amount of MHW buyers paid $60 USD so they can run around with  a plunderblade?


Ffs are you hearing yourself? Are you just a contrarian or a legit troll? This is so childish good lord.



#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
                >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
    The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
        Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
Even I git his weapon before a kill. It was pain, but atleast it's not the worst fight (looking at you Jay Leno)
    Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
        Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
            Good god, that chin is impressive.
                I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
What do people say to defend the fight? I‚Äôm not on mhw Reddit so I didn‚Äôt even know people hated this fight. I personally think this is in my top 3 fights of all time
    The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
        But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
            Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
    "Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
        The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
            Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
        probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
            So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
                When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                    Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
            Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
                Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                    My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
Im not very good at CB at all, but with a kjarr strongarm ice(and ice attack 6), I can get 2 elemental checks being the only one using an elemental build in a 4p hunt. CB savage axe is definitely the easiest way to suppress alatreons judgement, as for whatever reason they didn't put a modifier on it.
Yeah I remember seeing an alatreon lance speedrun and was so impressed, just endlessly poking away with heroics and alatreon couldn't touch em.
I have hunted him with every single weapon, and?
    Your original comment sound like you don't.
        I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
            It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
I know most people bash you if you're not using ice or fire. But like... GL kinda struggles to keep up with Alatreons mobility some what, even with EE3 imo. And even with White Knight fully kitted and a proper elemental Safi build I couldn't do it. Whne you can keep up with him, the damage you can do just isn't really there and basic pokes don't add up to fuck all. Meeting the check is... rough.

So I farmed my ass off against Kulve until I got the Kjarr Water Buster for that fat free crit ele, augmented the shit out of it with regen 1 + element 2 (plus every custom element upgrade), made my best fuck Alatreon Safi set, and went to work.

Turns out water being meh doesn't matter a whole lot when you're rocking 1100+ element, and smacking the poor thing for 500-800~ using your full burst slap-lance combo, and poking for 200-300, it's disgusting.

It's absolutely doable, and I've since done it solo/multi-player with different weapons (easier with kjarrs by far, and the Alatreon GL, with drag. Atk6, imo) but man does it not feel good to fight with that weapon at all.
    Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
        I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
Even with an only shelling run you could easily get sub 10 you just have to take a cart at 6 mins
That goes for a ton of monsters too though. Crit Draw GS works very well on kirin due to it's shitzones everywhere but the head, constant movement and AOEs, but is absolutely unnecessary on dodogama who practically explodes taking a TCS off its massive gullet
Why choose water over the elements he's weakest to?
    Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
        I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
            I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
I think I'd rather be 1 shot than just stunlocked or something, though.
Same with Alatreon. Even if you cart to just the EJ you have enough time to kill him with raw weapons. 

No, it means you've failed to either build a proper set, and or play well enough.
Fuck that's genius.

I haven't done the fight. Didn't even realize we had smoke bombs.

But that's genius.
    Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
    Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
wait what you can actually wallbang him during the start of the hunt??
    Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
        yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
    There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
    I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
Exactly, the biggest problem that I have is the fact that I'm spending half the fight chasing him around the arena because he refuses to stay still.
Exactly. I tried making an ice elemental set and still got wiped everytime. Even playing with randoms we just got owned. 

I got -11 downvotes in my other comment just for saying his need to make a "meta" set made me quit the game. 

Sorry but I don't want to grind 10+ hours or more just so I can make a set AND THEN actually starting to fight ans learn the monster...
\>i've teamed up with people  


honestly that was a bit of a mistake. i found soloing him way more enjoyable and easier because you can triple topple him easier. Then again i may just be a scrub ls/cb/bow main so oh well :\^)
> Maybe you should actually play the game before you make assumptions about the people who dare to complain about it. 

 So, in the same sentence, you‚Äôve stated that I‚Äôm not allowed to assume things and then you immediately make an assumption about me? The mental gymnastics on display, holy crap 

 Look, I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess? I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. If you‚Äôve watched people beat Alatreon with a Raw damage build but you can‚Äôt do it the intended way, with builds other people have beaten him with, then maybe you are just bad at the game. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me, this game‚Äôs old af and people have been arguing over what makes Alatreon tough since it came out

 My flair is literally hammer. You can *see* that I main hammer. And you‚Äôre really going to talk to me about how difficult Alatreon was.
    You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
        I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
            But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
                Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                    Thanks for the advice.
        I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
            Nice, good job.
        I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
I‚Äôm guessing the team you played with probably got dragonblighted a bunch and didnt check to nullberry it.

If you use alatreon‚Äôs lbg, the fight will become extremely easy. As long as you remember his movesets and to just keep walking left or right away from the walls. Then just keep shooting his front feet.

You won‚Äôt get any horn breaks but it‚Äôll be a piece of cake. Bring iceammo and fireammo crafts and you‚Äôre good to go.

Raw builds are possible but usually only recommended for solo to prevent wipe on first nova unless everyone in the team knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

But if you‚Äôre really struggling with alatreon, I recommend ala lbg. It does enough elem check even if you‚Äôre the only elem in a 4 man team.
Ah, Sorry. I just got sick of people assuming that everyone who complains about him must suck. I legit had someone tell me on YouTube that Team Darkside beat him so it must be easy.
    Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.

#Getting alatreon armor does NOT help the objective because the purpose of this entire thread was talking about how MHW alatreon is hard because of an elemental dps check. 


The armor doesn't change that at all so try again.
            >Alatreon needs element to beat. 

>Alatreon armor boosts element damage

>"DOESNT HELP THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE OF *ELEMENTAL* DPS CHECK"

Now I know you're just stupid.

Like, everything else you've said is really dumb, but that just takes the cake. I could point out how someone who payed 100 bucks for the game can do whatever thr fuck they want. And if they want the armor without actually needing to kill somthing that's their choice. But I don't think you'd even comprehend the words I'm saying considering you said that last bit. Its just objectivly wrong on literally every level lmfao
The point is that this doesn't happen on purpose,people are trying and trying and they just so happen to get his set piece by piece along the way.
    Ok, but its not like that's an issue. The game just works like that. Plenty of people do it on purpose, and those who don't probably never even notice.
Do I want to know who Jay Leno is?
    Uragaan. It's a joke due to his massive chin. For more context, google Jay Leno lol
        Good god, that chin is impressive.
            I call uragaan the crimson chin personally
The game got review bombed when alatreon was released because it is "too hard"
    But it‚Äôs not to hard you just use an elemental build and it‚Äôs back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù elder dragon
        Well, yeah, i like the fight. And it's definitely not that hard.

But some people disagree apparently
"Use elements, git gud lmao."

But the moment you tell then it doesn't always work and it's mostly luck based then you get made fun of.
    The git gud is a meme, but use elements is partly good advice. Even with elemental weapons it‚Äôs still a hard fight, but idk what people expected from such a late game elder dragon
        Oh, I also hear them say "he's a god, he's a god, he's a god." And pretend that using lore to justify anything is reasonable. By thier own logic, Moon Presence from Bloodborne should instakill you the moment the fight starts considering its literally one of the outer gods but instead, it's a joke of a fight and really anticlimactic ending for an amazing game.
    probably because luck doesn't play a part in that
        So every time he starts flying or zooming to the opposite side of the arena, that's scripted?
            When he starts to fly is, yeah.
                Really? Next you'll tell me that every attack is scripted too.
        Good luck saying that when your palico gets separated from you and he zoomed to the other end of the map chasing him.
            Then don't bring a palico? or use Provoker? I never had this issue with Alatreon
                My guy I tried both to not bring my palico and only used Vigrowasp gadget on it.

Still the same rng bs
Your original comment sound like you don't.
    I'm sorry, which part led you to that conclusion?
        It's the last part, "easily getting the check once you learn the fight even a little". Only people that doesn't know how Alatreon operates think like this, if you seriously go in with that mindset you won't even survive even before you get to the first EJ.

&#x200B;

Even with a full Lvl 6 Ice Attack and critical element it isn't enough to guarantee an elemental topple, much less get it easily. I've asked you if you've hunted him with a gunlance specifically because out of all the weapons in my experience GL requires you to have the highest level of knowledge about him to compensate the lackluster mobility and elemental damage that it has. I guarantee you if you brought a gunlance against him as your first attempts to hunt Alatreon you're not gonna last even if you bring Frostfang GL with full Elemental Set.
Yeah i definitely agree. Thats honestly my biggest and main issue with this threshold thing. Sure, you can use the argument that any weapon can meet it. Youre right. But holy shit, the amount of crap you have to do for some weapons just to make it viable is a real pain sometimes. Even then, the fight has to go almost as planned or you may fail.
    I still don't understand what moves to use on hammer to meet the elemental check.

So i just use bug
Tl;DR: it really is just easier, and a lot less stressful. 

Little lengthy reply, but bear with me. This also is what worked best for me out of the several weeks/months I beat my head against this brick wall trying to clear the check with this S++ tier weapon...

Mobility reasons, or lack thereof. It's a hell of a lot easier to have all 6 or so minutes before the nova. Because you're going to spend most of that time chasing Alatreon with GL. Since half his attacks have it literally jumping across the arena nonstop. And there just isn't room for quick sheath, so you're left with pivot hopping to try and get around after it. Needless to say, it's a giant game of tag (more than monsters like Tigrex or Barioth), and it sucks since you can't just wait for it to come to you like those guys. You have to actively chase, and GL ain't too good at that.

Plus the damage is there if you use water. Anywhere from 500-800 on slap combo, and pokes range from ~200-350 give or take. No need to try and play perfect if you can still meet the check just fine. 

Slightly more personal reasons:

1) I kinda like wide shellings just as a playstyle more, and the water kjarr is wide level 7, so shellings are "viable" if all you can do is poke. Aside from Alatreons gunlance(?) It's either the highest, or second highest base elemental gunlace in the game at some 630 base water elent pre augments/armor/skills.

2) Higher than other GL base element and has access to more augments than other weapons. So post augments, custom augments, water atk 6 with free crit ele, and safi armor, your stats look something like raw: 660~(? Which is big, it is just under Lightbreaks 690 raw) Off top my head, and element: 1100-1200~ water. Some fat white sharpness, and after safi armor a base of 55% crit before skills like WEX, or Crit Eye. So it's essentially always "up" and I promise you're going to meet the check with it no problem.

Other weapons may have their issues against Alatreon, but it fucking sucks to fight with GL because elemental damage is bad for the weapons design since in World its in a weird limbo state. Where 80% of your damage is tied to shellings in general, and it's slow af, like great sword all 3 hits of TCS slow. But spending 70-90% of a hunt hopping after alatreon for literally 2-4 pokes just feels, really fucking bad.
    I guess i see your perspective now. I use all weapons, but when i do pick up gunlance, its been slapstick GL 99% of the time, ever since the deviljho title update. And i didnt have any issues using ice or fire to get the topples although it was usually later, about 3-4 min into each cycle (as opposed to the roughly 30 seconds, 2 min, 4 min 3x ele topples im used to as an element weapon lover) I also didnt try GL against him until i was like 500 ala kills deep so i guess i had experience working in my favor to get rid of all the difficulties i see people mention about GL Hammer and GS. 

P.S. Thanks for godtier explanations on your train of thought
        I can do it with other GL now, but by far the water kjarr is just the best bang for your buck in my exp.

A lot of alatreons fight is just at odds with my ideal playstyle for gunlance however, which is very shield reliant. Tanks are cool.

Guard 5 sadly takes too many skill slots unless you're rocking like fatty armor and can fit whatever you want wherever, there just isn't space. So it's just a pivot hop reliant fight, unless RNJesus himself comes down to bless your bathwater for the perfect run...

So it didn't help me specifically that even after I shifted to a hop reliant build, my muscle memory go to response more often is to guard and high poke out of a block. Which just flat out don't work.
Just be careful cause sometimes he may still attack you, i don't really know what triggers him to lose agro. I usually use it during a long attack so i can hide while he is still commiting to it.
Bring smoke bombs to the final boss fight because the same will happen also.
Yea... Used to do it quite literally every hunt. People have different setups though. As an example, rocksteady, he roars, you clutchclaw the right side of his face (his right your left) and he does the face lightning aura, 2 clutchclaw turns and a clutchclaw yeet will hit that back wall most of the time. If he does other attacks after the roar that arent the face lightning, that setup can and will often fail. 
My personal favorite since i speedran him in groups was to equip evasion mantle, dodge roar for evasion buff, clutch to his right face side my left, a friend would flashbang to his right our left, then 2 turns and 1 yeet. The flash would move him right in such a way that the wallbang hit 100% of the time.
    yooo aite this is a very good insight, thanks for the tip!
There‚Äôs a rock right behind him. It‚Äôs tricky, but if you can claw him before he roars, you can slap him twice, and wall bang.
I‚Äôd check YouTube for alatreon speed runs, haven‚Äôt looked in a while but every weapon basically runs the same opening where you grapple the right side of its face after/during(?) roar, slap twice and wall bang just barely into the rock
You think he's easy so to say someone with that line of thinking doesn't know what they're talking about isn't exactly a leap in logic considering they think endgame content is fucking easy. And congrats on beating him with hammer, that's the only weapon I've seen people use against him aside from greatsword.
    I've beaten him with Swag Axe. Altraeon isn't that bad just takes being aggressive as hell.
        But then I die in 2 hits no matter what armor I'm wearing.
            Just wear decent enough armor. And if I have to reccomend any skill is Blight resistance so you can ignore dragon blight. That's what screws most as it reduces your elemental damage. If your armor is okay enough and you bring a elemental weapon your pretty much good. At that point it just takes practice against it. Best thing is Altraeon has the best hit boxes so it won't take to long.
  
You really don't need to min/max for it. Just meet the bare minimum then just know how to fight it.
                Thanks for the advice.
    I beat him with a longsword when he was still new lol
        Nice, good job.
    I didn‚Äôt beat him with a hammer. Again, you made an assumption. 

My point in saying that I main hammer is that I had to change my build to fight Alatreon, because the builds I used for the entire game including Fatalis was a Raw dmg for the bass game and then a Blast one for Iceborne. 

I beat him with an insect glaive. Fighting Alatreon also made me realize I really enjoy using the glaive, and now I use it just as much as a hammer in Rise.
Yeah and just because someone's been playing for years doesn't mean they're elite at the game either. I don't know why so many gaming subs have such a problem with people who don't like parts of the game.
    The sad thing is that Alatreon was partially the reason I stopped playing World. I came back for Fatalis but I could never get to phase 3 but I liked him better because I could at the very least see what I did wrong and I wasn't having to rush to avoid a single move. Team Darkside themselves even proved that you could get through all of base game without taking damage, even now you still can but Alatreon is the only exception.
Yeah
Grinding to get gear for fatalis now after I beat altreon
Me too, my friend. Me too
Deviljho time.
    Great idea! I just need a deviljho's head on a big stick!
Yea, and getting said armor helps them complete that objective. 

^(if that even is their own)

Also I love how you just happened to know what every single person's objective is. I'm so glad you took the time to ask every single player if they're objective was to beat Alatreon, and not just to get the armor! So considerate of you.
    Lmao you keep missing the point here.


I'm literally just saying whst the game is.


The guy who made the original comment was specifically talking about how it is easier to get the armor set than to kill the actual monster.


That is the fucking point Jesus chris dude.
