[[I'm getting stock and it's my fault]]


I finished the pre-tutorial aka Ishvalda, but my gear is like trash defense and some good skills.

Playing solo 100% and no allowed to do event cause I jailbreak my PS4. 

Ultimately, it's the decorations farm that fck me. Cluch claw boost, very useful but absurdly expensive and quick sheath for better timing at my LS.

I don't regret jailbreak, though. I didn't have that much money, so. 


What exactly are you asking for help on? Or are you just saying that you’re upset?
    I'm no asking. Just upset. I used Discussion cause it's similar to what I wanted to talk. It's not a Question I'm making.
        Ah I gotcha. Yeah it’s pretty booty. I remember saving up for years just to buy my first console. Didn’t have a job at the time but I was almost out of high school. Definitely my own fault for not having more income, but it was still rough
I might have a workaround. Make sure you get the 2nd headbreak for a guaranteed Evil Eyes (needed for weapon upgrades & certain armor pieces), then just "Return from quest". You get at least his horn & eyes. "DO NOT KILL HIM" until you manage to craft every single thing on your to-do list.

Also, for best results bring along your Palico with Plunderblade equipped.
Quick Sheathe really isn't all that good in World for LS. At Lv3, it's .1s off the special sheathe time, which is very little for quite a large investment.

I dont Like Decoration Farming either so im Always looking for a good Alpha Armour Set and then Just Putting some defense Decorations in. Im currently using the Tigrex Armour bc it has pretty nice stats
    Defense decos are essentially useless
        My 900 defense say otherwise.
            Defence decos definitely are useless. Currently sat at over 1,100 defence on all my builds with no defence decorations present.

You really don’t need them.
                "You really dont need them"
 
im playing completely solo and i dont even have Access to better Armour so yes If i wanna Beat any Elder Dragon i need my 900 defence Armour
                    Get evade extender and evade window and stop getting hit.
                        If you can read i said i dont like farming and dont tell me how to play lol
                            Not sure what game you're playing, as you don't have to farm decos to get them, you just play the game.
                                Funfact: There is a reason why everyone hates to farm for specific decorations
                                    Evade extender and Evade window are very common decos, as common as defense ones. You very likely have them. People who actively farm them are trying to make the best build possible, which isn't necessary to play the game. But defense in MR has extremely diminishing returns compared to pretty much any other comfort - divine blessing, evade, + to health, etc.

No reason to get snappy.
Deco farming is like 50% of the game tbh. Its inevetable. Either you do it or you cant do optimal dmg. Try to run a fatalis build when you get to a higher lvl. You get some decent skills without the deco farming. You still need decos to optimize your build though
    Might be rough for him because he cannot redo the special assignment quest to farm Fatalis armors@ weapons because he is locked-out of event quests.
