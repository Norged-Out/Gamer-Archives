Most unsurprising S+ tier ever. 
    Evil prydwen: having more SP is bad actually
        Also evil prydwen: "Cycling SP causes environmental damage, Arlan S++ tier"
            One day my boy, you will be viable, one day
                Hoping for some Enmity deck support next. Especially with tons of revives and high risk, high reward gameplay.
        But SP, damage buffing, and action advance are bad things!!! Sparkle should be F tier! F for Fool!
            E. For she is Elation
        Reminds me of black swan's con being dealing too much damage.
        i mean she breakes Quantum QuiQui teams and and i just tested Otto+Hanabi+Tingyun+Danheng this shit goes Wild
            Was this comment written by AI?
                i guess you dont know the alternative Characters from Impact3D and Names from China/japan i dont blame you for bieng a Casual
                    My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
                    Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
                        were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
                            He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
                                'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
    Yeah. Even a person that does not follow meta would know about it.
    I think the more surprising thing there is why is Bronya not at the top too?
        Uses too much SP and buff only lasts for a character's turn which makes her less flexible, I'm guessing.
            Just to nitpick, more than "uses too much SP", I think it's better worded as "has a negative net SP generation". Since they both use SP at the same rate, but sparkle's SP rate is positive due her ultimate.
            Also she's harder to use than other amplifiers and she's mainly only for single dps teams. Sparkle is easier to use effectively, and ruan is super easy to use well and she works for dual dps.
        Because she's not as good as the S+ tier units before those units arrived she's the sole S+ harmony unit.
        Mostly because Bronya is too SP heavy. At E1S1 she’s a lot better.

Then she is close to Sparkle level, more like slightly inferior sidegrade
            Nah e1s1 bronya over e0s0 sparkle imo. Esp if ur playing her fast her sp gen is big also
                I would hope a 5 star at e1s1 would outperform one at e0s0...although I would add, that even then, sparkle is far more versatily. bronya only works for hypercarry.
                    ? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
                        No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
                            Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
                                >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                                    Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
                There are a lot of limitations on Bronya’s sp gen capacity and h r compatibility with SP hungry units(even at E1S1). A good example of that is pairing her with SP heavy characters like DHIL. Her SP generation capacity is limited, why? Because you are limited to 5SP with bronya. I use an E1S1 Bronya with 161 speed. The problem with her is when she does E to an SP hungry unit like QQ and DH and consumes 3 SP. You are left with 1 sp after that and have to generate with your other units by basic attacking. With sparkle, that limitation is bypassed since your max SP is 7, plus she can ult and restore 4sp every single time. With this setup, it allows your 2 other characters on using their skills freely and/or when you are in a pinch(low health and needsHealing/bursting and needs to do debuffs etc).


No one is saying Bronya is not good. The premium 5 star is just better than her and that’s just the usual trend being followed.
                    It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
            The actual review on Prydwen notes that Bronya's raw potential in a vacuum likely outweighs Sparkle (by a small amount), but she requires more investment, team tuning, and skill to reach her maximum effectiveness - whereas Sparkle in comparison is very easy to use effectively and efficiently.

I think I agree with that assessment, personally, although I haven't used Sparkle much yet. She seems very powerful and simple to use, primarily because her SP economy is just nuts so you can use her with as many SP-hungry teammates as you want. The rest of her kit is just the cherry on top, frankly.
                Wdym Bronya has more raw power. Sparkle has better buffs even if you ignore the sp difference. 100% advance forward buff vs 50% is literally the same in most teams. Bronya spamming her skill is too much sp heavy unless you play Jingliu/Blade and you have E1S1 Bronya. Ignoring those two there is not a single scenario that you would choose Bronya over Sparkle. 
                    50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
        Sparkle just has all round greater flexibility, her slow and fast builds work with every DPS except DoT teams, whereas Bronya's slow build is trickier to make work with DPS that aren't Jingliu/Blade (though easier with E1/S1), and Bronya is not good with follow up attackers pre-E6. 

Sparkle also functions well in dual DPS comps whereas Bronya doesn't really - and there's options there too, either as a fast buffer same as hypercarry, or in a quirky auto-attack only comp where you just go for insane SP generation over ever using her skill (I.e. if you have 2 DPS that want to skill every turn, and a support that needs to skill every few turns, like HuoHuo - auto spam Sparkle with ER rope, and ER 2pc set will be able to fuel the whole team's ridiculous SP demands - this boosts energy regen for the whole team as well, since more skills are being used).  

Her only weakness is she wants good/specific relics in terms of Speed, but hey, Bronya has the same weakness. 

She's not better than Bronya in every situation, but she definitely has more options.
        Bronya is SP hungry.
            too hungry she always shout when she cast ulti.
        bronya trash + boring. Everytime she use ulti she always scream like hysteric girl
    Ruan Mei would like a word. She has the most busted kit to date and its not close. She does way too much.
        Yeah not sure if sparkle will replace ruan Mei fore yet. But maybe some teams? Dunno yet.
            Ruan Mei is for Dual DPS and Sparkle for Hypercarry obv
                Ruan is for basically every team, including hypercarry. Probably gonna be used with sparkle a fair amount
                RM is amazing for everything, also hypercarry
                You forgot Ruan Mei work with dot team and Sparkles doesnt
                    I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
    Prydwen just draining half court shots like Curry right now.
Well deserved. Even ur team isn't skill point intensive as DHIL, imagine having a lot of skill points u just gotta spam their skills for them to recharge their burst faster.
    Everyone *likes* skill points even if not everyone *needs* skill points.

Things like Gepard freezing or Asta keeping a higher charge count are nice to have.
        My Fuxuan can just reset her cc sheild every turn now.
            Yeah, I liked Fu Xuan for her lack of need to spam her skill, but it was still annoying against certain cc heavy enemies. Sparkle has enabled the perpetual cc shield, which is a nice little perk I don't really see anybody else mentioning.
    Helps enable other traditional DPS better than bronya  (which is great especially those that use SP per turn or tons of them) and since we need two teams in MOC, can put both at one side as well
        GuobaCertified came up with a meme Sparkle 2 turn ult, where you stack enough ER and Shared Feeling on the healer, letting you get Sparkle's Ult up every 2nd turn by just spamming basic attack. 

This means Sparkle generates 3 SP a turn (for comparison, thats ~10 times as much SP as Ruan Mei who only generates 0.33 SP a turn).

This means Sparkle by herself would be able to fund enough SP for all 3 other teammembers to spam skill EVERY TURN
            Thisbis with Huohuo yes ?
                No he didn’t count Huohuo ult energy, just meshing cogs and shared feeling lc. But you need to skill spam with your healer for shared healing and Huohuo makes the best use of the extra energy you get from skill spamming by actually buffing your team with her ult.
                    That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
                    Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
            Lmao what team would needs even this much skillpoint?
                Sparkle out here enable DHIL+QQ teams like a chaos elemental.
                    What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
                        Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
                you know with bronya... it go fast. You can look his vid, he said than Sparkle beat Pela in a team like Welt dps bronya.
                E2 DHIL.
    Reminds me of a guy saying luocha wasnt as good as huohuo because you couldnt make use of all ths sp he generated. It was insane
        Huohuo is better at cleansing lol. Luocha in the virtual boss events can't cleanse everyone in the team. Huohuo however bypass her freeze mechanic.
            Clearly, but thats not what the guy was trying to say lol.
                People that skipped Luocha cope extremely hard
                    but the cleansing!
                    Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
                        E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
            She only cleanse oneat a time right? Lynx can team cleanse
                Her talent makes her always cleanse.
                    Ah true
                If a CC hits your teammate and action delays or skips their turn, it will still action delay or skip their turn. If they are frozen or imprisoned, when it is their turn HuoHuo's talent will cleanse the CC and they can still act.
                    Oh true. forgot about her talent
        [removed]
        with sparkle luocha can fuk off tbh. 

"HUo huo welcome to the team"
    100%
The reason I pull Sparkle, other than being a total simp, was to improve my Qingque in mono quantum.
Well well well, guess who somehow also got improved in my account? The most beautiful character in HSR, Mr. Argenti(na).
Being able to spam E without managing SP distribution is such a blessing for the knight of beauty.
    Only DPS I have is Jingliu, not sure if she pairs well with sparkle since she doesn't eat up as much SP. I have a follow up team, not sure if she fits better than Mei or Aventurine
        Calculations has been done for jingliu on the character subreddit, better to pair sparkle with other DPS
            I'll replace mei with her in FUA team, and keep mei for Jingliu
                Don't do that, ruan mei is way better for follow-up (assuming you mean topaz ratio). Keep her there and give jingliu pela and bronya
                    I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
                        Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
        I think she will go OK with JL. But JLs best pairs are Blade and Pela. Neither of them want sp.

Maybe if we get a sp hungry Nihility in the future that could work.
    I mean, her existence in the team already increase the skill point intensivity as she consume SP + your dps can play twice each rotation (with proper speed tuning).

Also if you use RM in another team or don't have RM, well she enable your sup DPS to actually use skill frequently. Welt come in mind, and you get more ult due to energy generation.

Worst case scenario you can spam spam you sustain skill, who is actually a nice QOL for your team. I mean the biggest exemple i can see is gepard spamming is skill for freeze and actually the avance foward will become a lesser problem for his shield uptime.
        Assuming you're talking about sparkle she can only have your DPS twice every other rotation. So it isn't quite as SP intensive as Bronya
            I mean, that's still 3 SP consumed in one rotation. That still intensive in a vacuum, hell that near unsustainable in the long run unless you have SP printer Luocha, potentialy with a Pela on top of that. (though i mean "in the long run" if you achieve that is not really something that happen)
                she give 7 sp limit and her ultimate is on 3 turn cool down and give 4 skill point you'll need some massive skill issue or bad luck with qingque to waste all of that.
                    She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
                        Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
                    You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.
7 hrs till I'm able to pull .. edit:  I LOST THE 50 TO YANQING! AGAIN !

            I like him :(
        same. e3 Yanqing now. rather have E1 Himiko.

    2 more hours on eu 😭
        Me too, counting down minutes.. Good luck on your pulls
            Idk if your comment gave me luck but I got sparkle on guaranteed and then I got yanging as well 😭
                I lost 50/50 😭😭😭 Happy for you tho
    Sameeee
I cant wait
Just tried sparkle in a bunch of teams that I used bronya in, instantly noticed how much smoother it was to play with all the extra skill points. Energy regen was a lot faster too due to more skills. 

Biggest difference was my DHIL team, took me like 4-5 rounds to clear one half of moc with bronya (he’s got abysmal crit value and not rly invested), switched bronya to sparkle cleared it in 2 rounds. The extra skill points rly magnified the advantage of moc buff and allowed DH to use tier 3 auto every turn
    Is your Sparkle s0? I have Bronya e0s1 idk how much noticeable would it be for Sparkle without LC.
        Apparently not that much, could just use bronya's lc for her. It only makes a difference if you're using with follow up team
            I just slapped S5DDD on her and she is already a better Bronya. I can't even imagine an S1.
                iirc over a more extended fight s5 ddd is actually close to her s1
        My sparkle is e0s1 vs my bronya e1s1. Sparkle’s LC essentially gives another 55 crit value to her allies (assuming her skill is 10/10 maxed) so it could just be that. Having e0s1 Sparkle + fu xuan in any team makes all my dps have a baseline of 90/300 crit ratio after using sparkle skill
            Honestly ,You seems to have So much CD, even Dhil with his massive 151.2 % of  DMG% increase, assuming element orb,Rutilant,and musketeer, will have way more reward increasing Dmg% instead of CV at this point. Even with Sparkle Ultimate + TY ultimate he will reach only 255 % Dmg% increase. So still 50% Under 300% CD, and you're not supose to have 100% uptime on those Buffs. Therfore the diff between sig 55CV and 32% of P&F is prolly not that far in YOUR case.
        E0s1 bronya has same rotation as sparkle.

Bronya needs er rope and lc to do 3 skill rotations, sparkle only needs er rope.

Bronya had energy cost of 120, sparkle has cost of 110
    Sparkle isn't really competing with Bronya for a spot on DHIL teams, it's more like the Pelas and E6 Yukongs that are being threatened.
        And hanyas
            Yeah, I might swap my hanya for sparkle, but I really want that super Acheron lol
                acheron really need 2 nihility in her team lmao. That will limit your freedom. Thats why i will skip her
                    Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
                    I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
                        you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
                            Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
        is Tingyun better then E6 Yukong?
            They do different things. Tingyun will be in more or less every DHIL team comp though, so it's not really worth thinking about.
                True, but using fribbeles i noticed that Yukong gives a bigger boost. The energy regeneration of Tingyun is op, but getting 20k or more from Yukong is pretty good. Anyway I think i will stick to Tingyun so I can play in auto ahahah
                    Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
            I think you're comparing the wrong members of his team comp. When I got E6 Yukong I took out Pela and ran Tingyun and Yukong. Now I'm going to run Tingyun and Sparkle.
    for dmg and loud scream when she cast ulti : bronya

for fun : sparkle

for op and boringness : ruan mei
    I just tried DHIL with Sparkle AND Bronya in MoC. That shit was hilarious, just non-stop DHIL full 3 charge turns for 200K, so many per cycle. Probably the smoothest autobattle 3* clear of floor 11 I've ever done. Sparkle doesn't need to replace Bronya, she needs to stand with her ;)
People should read full breakdown since it contains good points and comparison vs bronya.

TLDR: Very similar to bronya, but much easier to use. Bronya still amazing and even better in some situations but sparkle is generally amazing
    What makes sparkle easier to use?
        No thoughts, just skill your DPS. No need to weave basic attacks unless you mismanage your skill points.

And even if you need to basic attack, it's typically once a fight, considering how long they last.
            lmao no, thats only happen with hyperspeed sparkle or if team consist alot of sp positive chars
            bruh if u need to basic attack with bronya and cant skill spam, you either have a skill issue or team building issue. Like why u making the team so sp negative. use a pela or smth
                Yeah, a skill point issue, which Sparkle doesn't have, thank you for proving the point.

You can just constantly skill with Sparkle and still be a point positive.
                    why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
                        because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
                            So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
                                no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                                    You are absolutely right about that XD
                                I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
                Do you think only one team comp exists or something?
                    Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
                        omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
                            But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
            It feels like she would still benefit from some spd tuning and weaving to get the Max out of her. I saw one streamer using her each turn to speed up his dps by about 10.
                If it only moves it up by 10, he is misusing her. Either the DPS has no skillpoints or is faster than Sparkle. So yes, some speedtuning is needed but far less than Bronya.
                the tldr is, as long as Sparkle is faster, but not more than 2x, she'll always push DPS to top. i.e  100spd dps and 100-200spd Sparkle work perfectly. Assuming no enemy pushes the DPS back before Sparkle's turn.     
   
Slow Sparkle also works, but instead of getting the DPS a turn every time, the build is focuses on maximising the value of the 50%aa. Where Fast Sparkle will realistically boost the dps only like 30-40%, slow Sparkle will always make use of the full 50%.    
    
For full explanation you can google "hsr action value guide", it's surprisingly simple how it works.
        You spam skill every rotation and still come out with +1 sp every 3 turns while bronya needs e1 s1 in 3 turns to break even which too is rng so you might be at -2 and -3 at e0 s0 

Also with extra sp your supports can spam more skill for more energy and more skills so not only sparkle but the entire team feels wayyyyyy smoother
        SP + easier speed tuning. For bronya( unless e2 but e2 bronya is a monster) you generally want her at -1 speed but with sparkle you can just make her gigafast while focusing only on offensive stats on your carry( no speed only ark and crit)
            Better ask here as it seems relevant to the conversation. I have E2S1 Bronya, so how should I gear my DPS to make the most out of the Spd buff from E2? I'm still running the -1 Spd thing with Jingliu but I feel that's wasting the Spd buff. Is the build for E2 hyperspeed Bronya?
                The most "perfect" scenario is for Bronya to be 29 speed faster than your DPS so that when she advances them, they will get 1 advanced turn and then 1 regular turn right before Bronya (and repeat). If your Bronya is 134 spd and your dps is 135ish then you can just take off speed boots and this concept will still apply.

Basically E2 Bronya just makes slow bronya even better because you can drop speed boots (or substats) on your dps. If you play Bronya hyperspeed (160+) and you don't skill > auto > repeat, then the E2 is not noticeable tbh.
                    Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
        Everything other commenters said + she actually enables FUA users (like Jing Yuan, Topaz, Ratio) better since her buffs last until the unit's next turn. So she can fit in better in those teams. You can also ult out of turn while still buffed.
Finally after only investing in dps I can get peak support
any changes on dhil and qq ranking?
    It says they need more time to test specific damage dealers, so any changes will happen at least tomorrow.
        aight thx
    Both will probably jump a tier with her.
        To be fair QQ is too high as S pre-Sparkle.
            yeah she'll probably stay the same.
            They could have a caveat to her little "RNG" dice 

>If used with Sparkle - significantly less praying required
                Nah you still wanna pray for bad rolls until you get full buffs. Yeah... Qingque RNG is rather punishing quick rolls
                Sparkle only get her 1 SP every 3 turns unless you do basic spam. praying still exists.

            My QQ outperforming BS and Kafka in the previous MOC 12 second half with meh could be better stats. I think it’s deserved.
                What? For real? I use both team and BS Kafka is overwhelmingly stronger.
                    On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
                        No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
                            wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
                                All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                                    hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
                            Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
                except the last moc 12 had both 40% lightning and wind resist on both halves
                Bro these fuckers are downvoting you cause they think you trash talked their dear black swan. Smh I hate these kids
            I'd personally rate Qingque actually at the tier of current Imbib without sparkle, or maybe she could actually have the performance of an Imbib without Sparkle, but Qingque without Sparkle even on E6 is not that great, Sparkle is just straight up broken.
    Greatly buff DHIL(0) and Qingque, but not good with DHIL(2 and above).  
Edit: maybe I have not made myself clear. Example: Sparkle is a 200% damage multiplier for Qingque/DHIL(0) but 140% multiplier for Seele/DHIL(2+).   
She is still good with them, just not that outstanding.
        Not necessarily IMO, DanIL at E2+ basically guarantees that you can have a fully positive SP rotation once every other turn, it practically opens up alot for his team-building as his biggest flaw was dependancy on SP for big dmg. 

With Sparkle, DanIL + SW is now a viable strategy, DanIL + a sub DPS is a viable strategy, DanIL + Bronya + Sparkle is also a viable strategy. It opens up DanIL teambuilding and overall gives alot of flexibility for him, which i think is huge. But this is also assuming people have him at E2, which is a tall ask.
        So those with DHIL E2 doesnt need sparkle ?
            Well, the buff is still there, just not a huge one.
Its just wayyy too comfortable. Seriously, it just make me laugh like a manic whenever i get 4 skill points just from a single ultimate
    &#x200B;

I mean ofc she is, she is the second character so far that breaks one of the game’s rules ( skill points limits in her case ), the first one was silverwolf that made you not care about weaknesses 

Oh and a bronya lite on her skill if that wasn’t broken enough
    You mean third. RM's ultimate causes enemy to experience ''second'' weakness break when they were supposed to recover.

Edit:  Was thinking  about how Xueyi's ultimate completely ignores weakness type and still reduces toughness but this is quite similar (although different) to SW.

Edit: Kafka also fits the bit since DoT was centered around dealing damage when enemy affected by it has their turn but she made it that you can detonate it earlier, without consuming stack.
        I dont have ruan but I thought she just applies her own weakness break outside/in correlation, the usual break effect.  Something welt also was doing  on demand when casting ultimate. He force imprisons enemies

> When these enemies attempt to recover from Weakness Break, Thanatoplum Rebloom is triggered, extending the duration of their Weakness Break, delaying their action by an amount equal to 20% of Ruan Mei's Break Effect plus 10%, and dealing Break DMG equal to 30%—54% of Ruan Mei's Ice Break DMG.


Edit: I love being downvoted for literally mentioning the idea is pre-existing and not anything "new". Imagine if I also said that kafka isn't the first to front-load dots as sampo e4 is a mini kafka for wind dots. Kafka didn't break any "rule", it just made it proper and work for all dots.
    And both of them are short Quantum girls.

Quantum truly is the best element.
        Quantum: All girls, all gas, some gremlins.
            I know it's an unpopular opinion but I kinda want it to stay that way lol.
        Nah lightning is the best element. Lightning got the hottest women. Kafka, Tingyun, Jing Yuan and Acheron, do I need to say more
    Oh yes, silver ''totally not worse than pela' ' wolf
        Silver "single target only" wolf
    >the first one was silverwolf that made you not care about weaknesses

Yeah, her problem is that the rest of her kit is mid
        How are DEF shred on ult and 3 different debuffs on basic attack mid? SW offers value each and every turn.
            Ult charges too long and ST and debuffs on basic are barely do anything. Pela is just miles better
            Opportunity cost. Just because something offers value on every turn it doesn't mean it can't be bad or mid. While her passive and ulti shred are not bad, they arent anything crazy either. ,they are single target and need time to stack. Almost every harmony would be a better option than sw without her weakness mechanic, especially if the dps is capable of aoe/blast dmg.


That being said I don't get the point of talking with "ifs". That's core part of her kit. No point judging a kit in parts. You judge it as a whole.

Edit: forgot that the majority of players here can only feel'scraft. No one would ever play sw if she didn't have her main mechanic. You guys really are meta ignorant if you think she would be good support compared to the rest options
Shocker
Man playing Mono Quantum with Sparkle FEELS SO FREAKING GREAT
Malding in NA i just want my sparkle😭😭😭
    Its only a couple of hours difference. Also, not like getting her late would change anything in a PVE game.

Edit: Lol. Just admit yall are gacha addicts that can't wait a couple of hours.
        it won't change anything, but it is nerve wracking wondering how your pulls will go
            Sounds like a gambling problem there bud lol.  But let me help you….I’m sending you some of my luck and positive energy, to a fellow NA server dweller.  I hope your pulls are short and 50/50 is won today.
        I think it gives a little less time to complete old MoC with her? If you were unable to play this weekend that's a lot of time lost. But barely anyone should be actually affected by the roll out, especially since there shouldn't be much story to spoil in thumbnails being released.
            You don't lose those hours because the old MoC ends at NA server times anyways.
Honestly I think the only reason Sparkle is S+ tiers while Bronya has been relegated is that Sparkle is more convenient to work with, alongside SP regen for certain teams.

But Bronya stay better in some teams.
    Bronya is better for Jingliu and Blade, Sparkle is better for everyone else (DHIL, Seele, QQ, JY, Ratio, Topaz, Argenti).
        Yeah, basically teams with any SP/spam issues, or that don't synergize well from the beginning due to 1 turn buff unless E6.

I forgot Bronya cleanse too, for the few times it clutched my SU run or MoC.
            Wait, Bronya can cleanse? So I don't have to try using Lynx in my Bronya team??
                Her skill cleanse (only the advanced forward ally, ie your carry most probably). Unlike Lynx who have AoE cleanse if my memory is good.
                    Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!
                If you aren't afraid of Bronya herself being CC'd sure
                    just gotta pump up that effect res
        I mean, for Balde and Jingliu you can run both if you want to. Easier to do on Blade, but it can work on Jingliu as well with a little more effort.
    I agree and I kinda disagree with this ranking to an extent. Everything sparkle does seems weaker than Bronya aside from the comfort but people are acting like they didn't spend an entire year playing the game around 5 skill points. 

For DHIL and QQ I agree but saying sparkle is flat out better everywhere else is just plain wrong. Take sparkle into a Abundance deer or Kafka or anything that CCs and you will instantly feel the lack of cleanse. 

I'm not saying she is horrible but I think S tier is the correct spot for her. The moment any new Hamony that does something actually unique she will drop faster than uou can blink
        You know how this community works, overhype and then they come back to their senses, however this shows how Star Rail has direct powercreep as we just saw with sparkle on top of the bronya
It's Bronyover.


/s
    My Jingliu says otherwise. She does not tolerate another insane woman beside her.
        Yea, JL benefits more from DMG bonus that Bronya provides than CrtDmg of Sparkle. Also Bronya provides cleanse.
            Bronya is supposed to move after JL to double her turn so her cleanse loses a lot of value.  

Other than that yeah this combo with defo stay for the time being
        Considering how much JL also likes RM, I am not sure she is so against crazy ass woman
            I don't think Ruan Mei is crazy in the traditional sense.

A bit autistic (due to having trouble understanding emotions) and laser focused on her research goals but not crazy.
They better place Imbib back in S+, I've played bunch of different teams, from Jingliu E1 with cone and bronya, to Black Swan and Kafka but none of them come close to what Sparkle boosts Imbib.

To think back in the day Imbib was a massive jump on DPS standards and now he gets more SP to use plus massive buffs which essentially boosts higher than even Ruan Mei which was already bonkers is just ridiculous.
    I mean given they dropped him from S+ because they had skill issue managing SP, it would only make sense to put him back up - since their argument back then wasn't that he dealt less damage.
I can't wait until I can get Sparkle (15 more minutes...) and finally have a proper dedicated support for him.
    What does it matter if he's S or S+ in a tier list that constantly changes every MoC or PF.

DHIL is an amazing DPS that others doesn't even come close especially at E2.
        Prydwen's tier list is stated to be based on e0 5 stars, e6 4 stars and is agnostic to the current endgame layout. Prydwen in the update notes have said Black Swan is S+ for Pure Fiction because of testing of her in the old Pure Fiction, not just because there is a DoT cacophony right now.
            Did that change? I thought they based it all on the current moc/pf?
                It did change to that method yeah. It's been ignoring layout at least since Pure Fiction was added and treating 5 stars as e0 (and 4 stars as e6) at least since Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae dropped from S+.
        >What does it matter if he's S or S+ in a tier list that constantly changes every MoC or PF.

Because that's their job. And it also Stop the argument about Dhil is behind JL.
            I thought that JL was only ahead because everything had ice weakness.
    what the actual fk lmbib, speak with human language
        Bruh who else could they mean other than Imbibitor Lunae aka 5 star Dan Heng?? Isn't that obvious?
DHil becomes S++ if you pair him with Sparkle.
In other equally shocking news, the floor is made of floor
cool. but don't take them as gospel
    Too late. Every update someone take out this list. And every time a lot of players complain; but I noticed that there are less complainers each time and more normal discussion...too late
        Its the twice per patch HSR PvP event, of course its getting posted.


The real event has yet to get started, as DPS haven't been placed.
        HSR players finally calming down their hate boner against tier lists? That's great!
    Incoming "Sparkle good, Bronya Mid"

Get Sparkle if you're a human being, your DoT team needs it
    Not happening. The Sparkle glazers already overtook the QQ glazers days ago. Hoyo marketing goes crazy.

                    Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects . The difference is way too big to ignore . I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants
                        >Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects .

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

    Same.
Fu xuan still being the only s+ sustain is crazy
    Huohuo gets slept on in discussions so hard
        Yeah Fr huohuo can pretty much render any debuff heavy fight a breeze. And is a lot stronger in Situations where FX may get overwhelmed by stuff like true stings wind shear or Fem Auramaton’s stuns.

That being said FX can still bruteforce through everything if you built her well, I’ve even brought lvl 60 supports with me to MoC 12 without maxed relics and they still survive due to FX insane mitigation.
            Pretty much the only place my FX has struggled has been Gold and Gears where her tanking the entire team’s damage just straight up 1 shot her at higher difficulties lol.

For all normal content + PF + MoC, she’s a god.

HH is still my preferred sustain character though just because I like her as a character more lol.
        She's sp neutral so it slightly holds back her. Same with Luocha. He's S tier only because he's sp positive.
            She's a bit more than that if you are going for low cycles. You don't worry about healing as much and take hits on the chin. I'll at Max skill twice but hope for one and just evade a debuff while it's still up. 

Where she shines is turboing ults at the start while also having buffs. 

You can run setups with fine fruit (legit one of her best cones) to get everyone including herself at a starting ult level. This is especially nuts if you managed to pull Ruan Mei cone but it's not necessary. It lets you start off with with a huge burst phase out the gate and put her a skill and auto away from her own ult so you are ready going into wave 2 with her skill still going. 

I have e1 Fu Xuan and E0 Huohuo and I end up taking Huohuo more while Fu has been slowly getting benched more and more. Her SP is usually about the equivalent of Fu's starting rotation of...

Auto -) take some hits -) Skill and then hopefully you are in a position where you can auto the rest of use one more skill
        Fr. Duo battery TY+HH carrying my ass to get ult frequently, because most of dmg dealers relies alot on their ult. 

FX is good. But lately, I've been using Huohuo more than FX.
    meh she's boring anyway
Still don't understand why Dhil isn't S+ after this
    Tier list gonna be update tomorrow, they just added Sparkle right now
     ''There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!''

from prydwen site
    I don't think the tier list should rate characters based on being teamed with other, specific, characters. Otherwise Kafka and BS should be in the same tier since they make each other broken.
    Because Jingliu still exists and is just that much better.
        Currently DHIL outpreforms her by 16-18%, so no she's not.
        Lmao what? Look at the fucking calcs bro, IL's best team with sparkle already humiliates Jingliu's best team in a neutral wave.

People act like Jingliu is some god unit when she is only good cuz Bronya exists, but now IL has his own Bronya so she gets dusted
            Damage doesn't tell the whole story. Hu Tao does considerably more damage than Neuvillette yet most people put him a tier higher. Jingliu using 0.4 sp a cycle just makes her much better and more future-proof.

The second they release another sp negative support, and use that as justification to power creep existing options, it will be even more obvious she is just a busted unit.
                goofy ahh simp💀 no DPS is futureproof bruh and calcs were already out, IL/TY/Sparkle/Huohuo is out damaging a team consisting of JL/Bronya/Ruan Mei/Huohuo, and there are gameplays as well already so if you still think she's better, you need to get your eyes checked.

and how does Hu Tao and Neuvillette correlate with the topic anyway? Hu Tao's a nuker while Neuv's a pew pew typa dealer; it would've made more sense if you compare Al-Haitham and Neuvillette.
                Tf is this logic? They can also release another sp generator that is more busted you know? Just because she is sp negative doesn't make her future proof cuz IL's sp problems can easily be fixed by using a brain on making team comps. 

And Sparkle existing already fixes his sp problem anyways so even if they release another sp negative support it wont matter at all since Sparkle mitigate the sp consumption.
                    Uneducated people grossly overestimate how much SP she generates. She front-loads it, but Tingyun and Ruan Generate more SP. Her main benefit is not being an SP sync like Bronya while also enabling AV. A strong, sp negative support is the obvious progression. People undervalue SP and the tier list will continue to reflect the opinion of people who aren't reactionary and have functional brains.
                        More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
                            They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
                                >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
                                    The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
                            Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
                                the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
                                JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
strangely she's only S in pure fiction, with no explanation as to why she's apparently worse there compared to MoC
    supports as a whole tend to be worse in pure fiction, because their buffs are  usually simply overkill.
    Probably due to ruan mei,Sparkle make overkill on one ally,while RM buff both,and just damage about right(not counting extra survivability with the breaks delay,no healer is available)and extra speed for everyone

That if we talk double DPS.

Definitely allowing some hypercarry on PF tho,like DHIL that wasn't so good on PF
        Yep. 100% a buff for Argenti. RM however is way better as a generalist for PF.
        Couldn't you run one on each side? Maxxing out the points is very difficult so I don't see why you wouldn't need two supports
    Which is strange, since she's one of the few supports that can theoretically sustain dual DPS comps with higher SP reqs, which can be favored by PF. 

Then again I've rarely seen any discussion of any rotation other than 3x skill.
        Tbh Dual DPS have Ruan Mei.. do they need sparkle really? Ruan Mei herself is SP positive already.. with the fact that she will always be 1+ like Sparkle Rotations(Unless you don’t use her skill every turn which is dumb) and in start of the battle 2+(since her skill is triggered).. 

Unless you are gonna replace the sustain.. you would more likely to use Ruan Mei in Duo DPS then Sparkle..
            There’s only one ruan Mei and 2 sides
                4 dps's?!?!?!??!
                    Not the first time for PF. We already have Herta + Himeko on one side with Kafka + Black Swan on the other being one of the most meta picks.
                    Not unheard of… I’ve done Jingliu herta and Jingyuan Himeko for PF before
                    I play dual dps all the time between Jingliu Blade, Ratio Topaz and the DoT ladies so it's not unheard of

And everywhere including MoC so I would very much appreciate another Ruan Mei lol
        Eh.... I think there's a gap between RM and Sparkle in PF as a dual dps support. In MOC, they're about equal. But Ruan mei in a dual dps comp in pf, is much better for breaking and overall team damage.

So she's an S tier support their, because you can do dual dps with her, but she's not on RM's level in pf specifically.
not suprising, considering how people have been calling her the better Bronya is most case, and Bronya placement being S
wish they rolled out some bad 5 star sometimes,to you know,get some breathing room
    Nuh huh! No breathing room for you in 2.x!

Acheron is next! And then Aventurine! And then who knows!
I'm surprised Jing Yuan, Seele and Imbibitor didn't go up.

CN bros are saying those three are now T0 thanks to Sparkle. Jingliu still prefers Bronya, so no improvement.

Maybe they are just saying the obvious without considering the implications yet.
    Read their website:

> There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!
        I don't care enough for that, but good to know my assumption was correct.

 The update will be a hot topic around here for sure.
I’m shocked I tells ya!

Flabbergasted even!

How can she be S+ tier?

Impossible!

Shocking!

She’s supposed to be only good for mono quantum… aight I think I should stop here
Damn now I have to pull her
As expected.
How surprising
She almost dubbled my seele's dmg
Who could've guessed a that a skill point generating Bronya would be S+
This character has singlehandedly revived my Seele.
After not pulling since December... i got Sparkle!! Just wanted to say that somewhere!!
To be honest all Sustain and Supports (limited 5 star) Are minimum S Tier. None them are will make you feel bad if you pull for them. 

Sw : Best Debuffer (Only 3 exists Anyway) 

Ruan Mei : Easy S Tier, Versatile and can be used against Ice Enemies too. 

Luocha : Lot of Sp Generation + Removes Buff

Huohuo : Buffs attack, Regenerates Energy, Best Cleanse

Sparkle : Sp Generation, Crit damage and Lot more stuff which I forgot. 

Tingyun : Damage buff, Atk Buff, Er 

did I forget any Limited 5 star?  them Harmony are of course Superior. I have a Feeling that Aventurine will also be Overpowered as Hell. I know tingyun is not a Limited 5 star but she is still a 5 star.
    Sorry forgot Fu xuan But again she is a S Tier. Can heal, Can deal Damage, Gives Eff Res.
        Don't forget her crit rate buff
            I don't have her man. I don't know. But from how much I read. She can Heal, She Can Reduce damage taken, She can deal decent Damage, gives Eff Res. She is Already like SSS tier sustain.
Shouldn't QQ and Daniel be moved up a rank since Sparkle exist ?....cuz...I mean if Bronya didn't exist I doubt Jingliu would be in S+
Like Kafka and Black Swan to me, it's niggt and day when their best partner in crime is paired up with them
Only my humble opinion tho as I own all the aforementioned units except Daniel
    Daniel? Sure

QQ? No, putting them in the same tier was a mistake in the first place
There Is some tier list in my bias
As much as I want Sparkle, I don't think she's worth it for my account. I'm new at the game an currently have an Asta-Lynx-Kafka-Black Swan comp and a trailblazer(???)-Natasha-Ratio-Welt comp.   

  

Fu Xuan is a must pull, Topaz is a must pull and they're both in next patch. Then I will be forced to click on Houhou and Ruan Mei whenever they come back.  

  

Shit's hard without abusing my wallet, smh
    Topaz isn't a particularly good pull unless you like the char, just FYI. If you're pulling for your Ratio team, Ratio + Tingyun + Pela will be just as good or better than a comp with Topaz.
        Idk, a fully built Topaz using elation path just dominates any of the Simulated Universes, especially with Ratio
Why does anyone still think prydwen ranking is relevant?
    I feel like it's about as relevant as it should be as a general overview of the game that's useful to many players. The vast majority of the playerbase is pretty casual and is still trying to beat harder content. The people who it's not useful to don't need it anyways so I don't think there's a problem with it. If a new player were to look at the tier list and prioritize picking up and investing in the high tier characters their account would be in a pretty decent state imo.
    They don't have another options, only people that have played this game for a long time realizes the many issues with its tier lists.

Its a good reference for guides, but the tier list is garbage, it has been for a very long time.
    people I think, the masses pay attention and this attracts more masses in the end, now these tier lists are considered golden proofs as if they were completely factual
Neat I guess? Fully expected, she modifies game central game mechanics. Their build guides are a good starting point, but their tier lists are fairly useless. They dont even follow their own guidelines.
Is pyrdwen even accurate? I’ve heard questionable things about that website
    Yes and no. They are good for getting general direction, but their favorism for some characters is visible
Hahaha lost to Ruan Mei. Sparkle is easy skip. Better use bronya who is faster and have cleanse. Sparkle is not second to Ruan Mei but she is third at best maybe fourth behind bronya and tingyun
Sparkle is overrated. She should be below TY. There no room for sp generation. Imagine wasting sp when there's not necessarily to do it. Pela or other sp positive units can already provide enough sp.
As expected of my queen(the queen title shall quickly go to Acheron once she's out)
Ok, I am gonna pull her now
I called it. Easiest things to see coming ever.

Knew it was a finesse move when they put Bronya in S last time so they could do this.

Not that I don't think that she doesn't deserve it, she does.
    They put Bronya in S because of Ruan Mei, not to preempt Sparkle.

Seems her sp positivity is a bit redundant on blade teams but maybe works clunkily with bronya as a second support so they can spam skill.


Currently running blade one side jingliu the other. I hope she works with Sam otherwise hard to justify for my acct
Gonna ask here.
My only limited characters are Ratio and Argenti. Standard units are Himeko (not built yet I barely have time and resources to make one team) and Gepard.

Should I pull for Sparkle or save up for Fu Xuan and Ruan Mei and/or one between HuoHuo and Luocha?
What would you suggest for a newish account?
    limited 5 star sustain will improve your account way more than DPS or support.
Cool but I don't really feel like I need her as I have Bronya and Ruan. I've never really felt the need for a 'better Bronya's and she's never let me down so we sticking with her!
Sparkle is the honestly the first character where im like: “oh yeah, we’re definitely slamming the gas pedal onwards to powercreep huh”
Selee ain't s+ anymore ? And where is blade ? Should get back to this game...
Still skipping her. Acheron is priority.
Well, so much for them picking and choosing only one unit to be in S+ for each role
    Was this ever a rule? Their Pure Fiction ratings have had multiple units in S+ for a while.
        No, but Gachasmack looked at their tier list somewhat recently, saw one in each category and assumed that was the rule, and now his simps treat that like gospel.
    since when this is their rule?
    They literally never said this lol. The only reason DHIL dropped was because with the supports we had at the time Jingliu was just better. Not by much, but she was. I highly expect in 24hrs when they update it all for DHIL to jump back up to S+ because he synergies with Sparkle the same way Jingliu does with Bronya, allowing greater potential.
    After all this time, you still think that they are consistent event with themselves? They never were and never will be :)
I mean, whenever a character releases, they must make the MoC/PF to be meta of that character thru the gimmick (and then, possibly, flop on the next one)
    They don’t factor the MoC buff into it.
        I am very sure they do. Not to mention that you cant play without it.
I disagree. Ruan Mei is a tier above all the others. I literally can't think of a team where she isn't a massive boost. She benefits every single DPS, enables at least two playstyles.

I can't say the same for Sparkle. Maybe drop Bronya down to A or create an S- tier to separate them, cause Sparkle is generally better than Bronya. Just not as good as RM.
    Definitely disagree with ruan mei being a tier above all others. She’s more universally applicable due to her general buffs but how big a boost she is depends on the team.

She’s the best damage buff for dual dps teams and her break efficiency is great for enabling break comps

Meanwhile sparkle is generally the best hypercarry buffer (the exception being jl/blade) and the most frontloaded sp provider you can currently get

Biggest difference between them comes with higher investment where 168 wind set sparkle enabling 3 turns for a no speed hypercarry (or 4 in niche setups) allows e0 character 0 cycles that weren’t attainable before
    Sure, drop down Bronya even more. She is still the best support of one of the best dps character in the game, but sure, drop her more down.
    Bro, The reason why Rm is fit for every team. Is because she is your secondary support in hypercarry, Not primary.

Her Dmg amp is not in same level As bronya and Sparkle. Just Play character Like Dhil, Blade, JL without Bronya or Sparkle and Used RM. You will see those Dps number Drop. For example a team of JL+Ruan mei+Ty/pela will always be worse than JL+Bronya+Pela.
    I also think RM is just above both Bronya and Sparkle lol. She is such a strong Generalist that can go *with* Bronya and Sparkle anyway. 

Sparkle is generally better than Bronya, but Bronya actually still better in JL and Blade team.
    [deleted]
        Are you telling me that e4 pela with 12% ice res and 40% def down is better than e0 RM with 68% dmg, 50% break efficiency, 25% all type res pen on top of giving everyone essentially 10 spd?


That's kind of a ridiculous comparison.


Literally anyone can make full use of her kit, from hypercarry to dual dps to even dot.
        >There are many situations where even pela beats her.

Eh? Wasn't that disproven?

Anyways, the point isn't that she's BiS on every team, it's that she's universal and enables so many comps, strats, and builds. Besides her massive damage buffs:

- She enables dual DPS.
- Her break efficiency enables break teams and pseudo-sustain, and makes sustainless so much more accessible.
- Her speed buffing allows characters to hit the 134 breakpoint often with just speed boots, or plus 1-2 rolls into speed.

Bronya is strictly for hypercarries and severely restricts the teammates you can use.

Sparkle is mostly for hypercarry, but is significantly more flexible with teammates and, besides mono-Quantum, allows every DPS she's paired with to use ATK or HP boots. Her buff is also flat out better for FUA characters.

She is not universal like RM, doesn't enable as much, and doesn't create as much flexibility RM does.

Tingyun with Dance^3 specifically is crazy, yeah. She's definitely Sparkle tier.
I want her but Acheron is a physical need. Do we know yet if Acheron is banner 1 or 2 next patch?
    The first one. The second one is Adventurine.
    Check how many pulls you have. 2.1 phase 1 will come with new freebies!

If you have some but not enough, try and pull on Sparkle until the 50/50, if you win - you have her. If you lose, you save for guaranteed Acheron.
She's literally just bronya but better (unless you can't get 160 speed or need cleanse on a harmony) so it's no real surprise lol.
    Not in Blade or Jingliu teams..
        She is better in DHIL, Seele, QQ, JY, Ratio, Topaz and Argenti teams
        definitely yes on both each (unless you're running them both)
            Jingliu main sub recommend bronya over sparkle though after calculation is done on their end
                please show the calc, otherwise cap (and have they consider bronya as the other support on top of sparkle)
                    Yeah someone did the calcs.. It is her worst team(even worse than Pela+Mei) From Jingliu mains.

https://preview.redd.it/frhhnm5z4hlc1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09d5be06e5c2aeca2f9855923507aa01b4bee96
                        SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
                            Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
            Bronya is still better for Jingliu, Blade and Jingliu + Blade. That's what CN bros had been cooking. These 2 have enough self buffs to keep going for another turn without needing any setups beyond that.

Oh and they both don't really need the extra SP.
            No, Bronya is definitively better for both Blade and Jingliu.
    I didn’t really get into theory crafting on Sparkle, but is she even better? I’d say her 50% turn advance instead of the 100% makes her alt Bronya as opposed to one being solidly better, even considering her SP Generation.
        They go into this on the guide, but basically in terms of pure buff numbers, an E0S0 Bronya is better than an E0S0 Sparkle unless you're using a Quantum DPS, and their main points are that Sparkle has a better floor and is just generally easier to use, as well as benefitting FUA units (Dr. Ratio, Jing Yuan, Clara) which Bronya can't do until E6.

Also, for Blade and Jingliu, Bronya is pretty much always better (I remember the Jingliu sub doing some calcs on it before and Sparkle only outdoes Bronya at E2, and only by 0.02%).

So it's not so much Sparkle being universally better, as Bronya is still very good and better than Sparkle for several characters, but that Sparkle just has a better floor that's easier to work with, similar to why they have Ruan Mei in S+ as well.
            As someone who doesn't have blade or JL, what's the high level reasoning for this? Is this related to the fact they don't really use SP at all (compared to other DPS options) so you'd just have too many level over SP? Or is this related to the characters having high CDMG baked into kit so the extra DMG Bronya provides would scale better?

edit: and for blade the attack from trace is worthless
                Both of those are correct.
                and also it's 100% action advance, you can always spam Bronya's skill with them it speeds up their damage by a lot
                It's pretty much this: sparkle is best when you go 160+ speed sparkle, 200+ cd and your DPS you use is going to use attack boots(hp boots for blade) and sits at 100ish speed, this makes sparkle give like 50% more overall turns to your DPS, 15-45%  atk (based on mono quantum) and +43% because they can use attack boots instead of speed, 48(or 80 if bronya cone/past and future), inc damage for 2turns on 3t ult (18 otherwise), and 110ish crit damage while sp positive

Bronya is best (assuning the following doesn't burn out sp) when you go 134-140 speed and 1 speed slower than your DPS, so your DPS acts, bronya acts, and then your DPS immediately acts again, giving your DPS 100% more turns than normal, 100ish increase damage on the 2nd turn (past and future or sig cone, major trace), and 55% attack with 55-70% inc crit damage for 2 turns on a 3t ult(3t with sig cone).

For jing liu, she has so much crit value built in that it is easy to hit something like 50/200-240 whereas she only 60%ish increased damage if using fall of an aeon, or 105ish if using her signature/s5 secret vow. She will also have roughly 220ish increased attack from her talent giving 180, and 43 from rope. So what she lacks most of is speed and increased damage, both of which bronya gives more of than sparkle, at the cost of being sp negative. Even if using Ruan mei +bronya+jing liu, she'd at most have 183% inc damage, which is still less than the 260-300 inc crit damage she could have while under bronya Ult. Jing and bronya + a 3rd sp positive support just match perfectly currently.
        Because only characters who don’t use SP every turn can maximise Bronya. It’s impossible to sustain -1 Bronya with a dps that uses SP every turn
        Bronya buffs are stronger on paper however she's -3SP per rotation which make her not optimal for the averange team

Sparkle is better than Bronya for the FUA characters in every scenario since Bronya can't buff FUA
Also Sparkle>Bronya for mono quantum
        For most carries it doesn't matter at all since Sparkle won't have over double their speed.
        She mostly invalidates Fastya/hyperspeed Bronya, which is the most common set up for non-Blade/JL due to SP costs. 

There are still a few other setups besides traditional Slowya Bronya can do (Slowya with DPS using 1 basic for SP, 170 spd Bronya using 1 basic to come up behind a 100 SPD DPS), but these are a bit more niche set-ups that not everyone will take the time to tune, with some fairly restrictive drawbacks as well. Bronya E1 also helps make her more competitive in all scenarios, and E2 in some niche ones (eg Bronya + RM allowing DPS to be 134 SPD with only a few SPD subs) but not everyone will get her there.
        There honestly aren't very many limited DPSs that make full use of Bronya's 100% advance, it's really just Blade and Jingliu.

Everyone else either does not rely much on basic/skill damage (instead relying on ults or summons), relies too much on follow-ups, has too much turn manipulation for Bronya to keep up with, uses too many skill points, or some combination of the above.

Note that Sparkle's skill buffs out of turn follow-up damage while Bronya's does not.

Sparkle is a DPS increase (generally significant but not always) for DHIL, QQ, Seele, JY, Ratio, Topaz, and Argenti.

Bronya is still better for JL and Blade.

Prydwen didn't rank her high just for her ease of use, she wouldn't be S+ unless her damage amp was outright better for many chars. This is shown in calcs too.
        The 50% really doesn't matter as long as you hit 160 speed. And she just gives more multipliers in CDMG and atk (and this isn't mentioning her SP generation NOR her extra steroids for mono quantum)

But you also just use both for silly hypercarry scenarios such as using them together with blade and they both just keep action advancing him forward.
            She only gives 15% atk permanent to everyone who isn't quantum while bronya gives 55% atk to everyone on ulti regardless of element

Sparkle give lots of cdmg while bronya give lots of dmg bonus

Spd reduction debuff by enemy is impactful even for 160 sparkle

Both are similar but work with different characters so there really isn't "sparkle is better than bronya or bronya is better than sparkle" 

Sparkle can't replace Bronya from JL or blade team while Bronya can't replace Sparkle from qq, dhil and jy
                Check some Sparkle/Bronya/Blade setups. I'm saying that you use her with bronya for blade lol Also you're missing the damage buff sparkle gives with her talent,  which gives a damage boost team wide for every SP used. 


Really the thing that boosts Sparkle over is that her buffs have easy more consistent up time.  It's pretty much permanent and also usable for stuff like lightning lord. 
                    Sparkle gives 18% dmg bonus while Bronya give 10% dmg bonus as trace permanent

Bronya with signature LC can also 3T ulti just like Sparkle..... really don't understand when does Bronya have inconsistent buff uptime? The only thing she can't do is buff FUA with her skill

Also only FUA benefit from extended buff from sparkle while character itself loose it when they take 2nd turn

At 200% cdmg for non-quantum

Bronya - 96% dmg (skill) + 10% dmg (permanent) + 55% atk (2 turns) + 52% cdmg (2 turn)

Sparkle - 93% cdmg (skill) + 15% atk (permanent) + 18% dmg (permanent) + 30% dmg (2-3 turn)

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?
                        Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
                            I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
                    You know that using double harmony has diminishing returns, right? Harmony + nihility would be much much better.
            The 50% does matter, since your only build is going for 160 speed and pulling the dps to that speed. Slow Bronya at 134 speed allows you to give your dps 2 turns, meaning it becomes roughly equivalent to 268 speed. The first attack of your dps will be unbuffed, but in the end it's still an extra turn. For units that care more about the number of attacks, this is especially important.
            160spd on her or the dps?
                On her.
        More of a match to slightly better than Bronya at Bronya's best (i.e. -1 speed from your main DPS/speed-tuned). In a mono-quantum party Sparkle's unequivocally the better of the two. Sparkle's buffs are also easier to keep up and are more versatile.

* Sparkle's buff actually can affect DoT and FuA characters who get the bulk of their damage out of their turn. 
* She's SP positive even when she's using her skill non-stop, whereas Bronya doing the same requires both her E1, sig 5\* LC, and alot of RNG to do the same.
* There's less impetus to speed-tune Sparkle because her 50% turn advance means there's alot less wasted turn advancing on her compared to Bronya.
* She gets the same amount of energy normal attacking as with using her skill because of her traces. This means you can truly amass SP for the two characters we currently have that guzzle them down (QQ and DHIL).
            When did dot characters started using cdmg?
    She invalidates Fast Bronya-Slow DPS setup, but never gonna replace her in 135-134 spd setup (ex: Blade and JL). But well, you can just use both at same time like XQ-Yelan situation in Genshin lmao
    why not put both of em in the same team
My only DPSs are Blade and Ratio. Is Sparkle worth it with them?
    Blade+Sparkle+Bronya+Sustain is really fun team. And There is possibility that it his strongest team.

Ratio hypercarry setup also benefit a lot from having Sparkle. Ratio+Sw+Sparkle+Sustain should be his strongest team. Because unlike bronya, Her skill buff can last until the start of Dps next turn.
    Yes with Ratio, meh with Blade.
    Yes totally, she is great for every hypercarry
We need s- tier. She is better then Bronya and below Ruan mei. That or just push everyone down a tier so sparkle can be in s alone
    She is better than Ruan Mei with most Hyper carry units. She is definitely deserved at S+ in MoC. But even then, always take Prydwen with a grain of salt.
    They put her as S+/S for MoC/PF, i believe it is a good assessment and differentiate her from RM in the way you want
And I’m still skipping Sparkle.
Isn't every new character S+ Tier because the current MoC cycle will be tailor made for them?
Sparkle is definitely stronger than E0S0 Bronya. 

But for me the main Bronya strength, that's she is standard banner character. You can get her lightcone from the shop and get her dupes from 50/50 or standard banner. 

When I finish my 300 standard pulls, my Bronya become E1S1. 

So I'm not sure, that's Sparkle E0S0 is better than E1S1 Bronya or E2S1 Bronya or its wise to pull her just before Acheron release, who is also very LC hungry.
I have my Bronya at E3 due to lost pity and I'll probably get even more in yhe future which will make her even better. Bronya is S+ no doubt
So we have no male character in S+ in MOC, again?
It's insulting to put SW in the same tier as Bronya and Ting and higher than Pela. Ting and Pela have been consistent and SW is not even close to Bronya. Mono quantum being a thing doesn't make her S rank, it's super premium.
I think they need to make separate S++ tier, S+ just doesnt cut it anymore
Just give me Acheron already lol
Who cares about tier list ranking...
Imagine putting silver wolf on S and not S+ even tho she is the only character that can add wekense Type
    because she's entirely single target and unless you're running mono quantum, her weakness implant's rng can potentially cost so much SP if you're unlucky
        Wich is super false, you can get around RNG by facing qunetem enemies, or have sup charchter that match the cprispondng enemy wekense Type so the wekense will alawys be for your main Dps
And even if you don't do that her skill debuff still  aplly all res anayws
            and that right there is why she's S and not S+

her skill is RNG and in order to make it not RNG, you need to work around it and like I said, the only way you can get the guaranteed is either mono quantum or as you said, fight an enemy with quantum weakness while matching allies

also while her All Res shred is really good, a weakness break is infinitely better due to the action pushback, damage reduction removed, and the potential break damage
    Adding weakness type is not all that good after your account gets strong enough.

Sw used to carry me through the game after getting her e1 + tutorial but she has been benched for a long time now.

She will be getting more relevant with some upcoming teams but still shes not nowhere as insane as ruan mei, bronya and now I assume sparkle.
        I mean treu she ain't no match for 5 star harmony character, but until somone else in future will have her mechanic to aplly wekense Type or change it, she will still  be S+ in her own tier for me
    SW should definitely be lower than S, her ult uptime is terrible - factoring that in alongside her ST nature, her amp is consistently lower than Pela's.

She's frankly only good when you desperately need to implant weakness or your DPS is low enough for SW to keep up.
        Bruhh this is so funny 🤣 . My guy said everything wrong like i am 100% sure that either you don't have sw or never knew how to use her(too complex for you)
            Feel free to explain how to properly use her and what makes her so complex
                I was trolling but how long do you want the explanation 🤔?
            I have her and legit almost never use her because Pela is just better overall. She is super over rated and is mostly there for mono-quantum enjoyers.
                Skill issue bruh . Remember this is a turn based rpg . You can literally win fights you are not supposed to win before entering the fights .  I don't want to write a 1000 words essay because nobody cares but you do what you are doing with your shallow approach to sw 😬
is she still good without her signature lightcone? feels like you need her signature to be good.
    Her LC is among the worst limited LCs. 28 cdmg sounds good, but not when you have 300 cdmg post sparkle buff, making it 428/400 vs something like 282/250 or better for past & future.

The crit rate is nice and what makes it BiS, but not by much.
        Yeah I was surprised when I plugged the mono quantum team into fribbels optimizer and I only got a 7% dmg increase on Seele going from S5 planetary to S1 Sig LC. And for reference my Seele after being buffed by 3 keels and Sparkle skill is normally at 99/300 ratio with Planetary.

So I’d imagine the Sig LC is a lot stronger when your crit ratio isn’t good or your relics not fully built maximised
            Why would you post such a misleading post of course Sparkle LC is useless for you if your crit is 99%, what did you expect?
                As in the optimiser simulates all your best possible builds based off your whole relic list. And the diff between my best build without sig LC on sparkle and with was 7%.

The build with sparkle sig LC was at a much higher cdmg but both builds are simulated to be at 100% crit. However because of diminishing returns the diff is not that huge especially after you consider Sparkle’s skill will buff around 100cdmg
                    Okay, with this context, it makes sense.
                        Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
    Why would you think that ??. Like i see people like you always saying stuff like this. Explain bruhhh Writing 2 lines and expecting 10 lines of education 🦧😂
        i mean some character dont need their signature lightcone to be effective and thats what i call f2p friendly but some character really need to get their signature lightcone to be effective and that's what i call not f2p friendly. I mean Sparkle is harmony but she need crt. dmg and the only lightcone with crt. dmg is her lightcone other harmony lightcone feels useless to her.
for SP regen, Hanya outperforms Sparkle. for double turn dps combo with bonus buff, Bronya outperforms Sparkle. but if you want both of those skill sets, Sparkle is the best choice. if you want a 2nd Bronya or a 2nd Hanya for your 2nd MoC team or if you don't have any of those two, Sparkle can fill their roles.


so she is a extremely great unit. though she is skippable if your Bronya or Hanya can do their job fine already for you. you can skip and save for other meta units. though i already pulled her even if i have good Bronya and Hanya just because for waifu reasons.


edit: Sparkle is great with HuoHuo. so consider getting Sparkle too if you have HuoHuo.


additional edit: i tested above on normal bosses without using her technique. but on MoC where you can use your technique for free, Sparkle can outperform Hanya with her technique. she gives +3 SP at the start. extremely good for DHIL or Qingque users. but if you don't need SP boost at the start, then Hanya is enough.
would sparkle replace you bronya?  
if the trailblazer use Daniel as their main dps then i would have a hard time i guess.  
but would you lose?  
nah, my e1 bis lc build would win
Pple still use Prydwen? Eww, I like game8 a lot more tbh
Let Jingliu remain alone on the DPS S+ tier please. DHIL needed Sparkle to be at least on her level, which doesn’t qualify him for S+. Sparkle also have a strict build requirement of 161 speed and DHIL will need another support of higher speed to supply him SP. His playstyle is still restrictive and have strict build requirements. 

~~jk, i just don’t want him to be on top because he’s a husbando bait~~
    jingliu is only up in s+ because of bronya. same with kafka being s+ because of black swan💀
    my guy is here is feeling threatened over a male character lolol.
    Casually ignores the fact that Jingliu needs Bronya to be S+ tier.
    Reminder: Your "waifu" isn't real. She doesn't love you back.
    Are u ignoring the waifu baits then? Occupying most of the top list, how ironic lol
    it'll be stupid of Prydwen not to put IL on S+ again after Sparkle's release, when the only reason JL is still on S+ is because of Bronya. 


>DHIL needed Sparkle to be at least on her level, which doesn’t qualify him for S+.

the double standard💀
    "I don't want him on top because he's a husbando bait. Oh? There are three waifu baits in S+? That's fine"

🗿
    ☠️☠️☠️ look at the top of the list it’s all female, give males a chance to go up smh unless ur calling all 5 of them there waifu bait as well :)
    What a loser, go touch grass
    Bro, You got Cook Lmao
    Chill bro DHIL looks feminine so he's not strictly husbando
I disagree with this tier list. S+ tier should only limited to 1 character. So either Sparkle in S rank or Ruan Mei in S rank.
    Why should S+ tier be limited to 1 unit? Makes no sense.
Thoughts on synergy with Archeron?
    She's not even released yet, we don't know what she does.

>!Ask that question on the other subreddit!<
As expected.
Oh, they put her on S+ but didn't move anyone else up? Daniel mains about to go into their Juan mains arc.
    > There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!

From Prydwen.
        So they put her on the TL without having "safely tested her impact on damage dealers"? These guys don't really help their own reputation huh.
            ... That's not what that sentence means. 

They are not moving other characters up and down until they tested everything, but Sparkle herself is S+. It seems reasonable to me, idk what you are yapping about...
                How'd you test a support character without testing their impact on the characters they're supposed to be supporting? 🤔 Seems counterintuitive.

Inb4 this is the same as when they said "Juan mains will be satisfied with our next update" and then they didn't change anything 😂
Why not Bronya and Sparkle on the same team. Keep pushing that dps all day.
is she worth pulling for bronya e2s1 haver? can't decide, my main dps is JL so i'm not sure if it's an improvment.
    Bronya's better than Sparkle in JL and Blade teams
Now my Bronya can skill EVERY turn heck yeah
She's literally a powercreep Bronya. Ofc, she's S+
Limited Harmony 5* is S+ tier?????

In other news, water is wet, fire is hot.

I'm more interested in seeing how characters like DHIL, QQ, Seele and Xueyi are going to be affected in tiering with her release in comparison to other units.
i have no jades maaaan but i really want her....
She's literally a better bronya. It's not really surprising
Jing Liu and blade mains in shambles when bronya is still their lord and savior
    Why would we be in shambles?
        Because everyone is literally saying “bronya fell off, Bronya sucks, Bronya trash, even sparkle better for Jing Liu and blade now” and garbage like that 

I’m a blade Jing Liu main too btw and tired of seeing that sort of stuff
Right up there with Queen Mei
Just got bronya recently and her lc. I do have a character pity left since i didn't get the character and i failed the initial 50/50 chance to gepard. 

Would it be worth it to go for sparkle anyways? i mainly use blade/seele as dps characters since i'm still working on dragon boy and or dr ratio and their relics.
Siiiiighhh fineeee I'll pull
if you use monoquantum she is ssssssssssss+.
I'll be honest I wasn't really expecting *Bronya* of all characters to get powercrept in such a way.

It makes sense, kinda, but hot damn are they blowing us away with these supports.
Need your advice. I'm kinda new and just got Bronya. Should I still get Sparkle? My DPS currently is Dr Ratio and Qq.
So her kit is like, if Bronya ate Hanya?
My QQ deals 100-300K dmg (consistently) on MoC with her (and mono quantum) it's actually insane lol
Hi , im a returning player on honkai , i pulled lunae when he was first realeased , i dont have a lot of knowledge in the game i just finished the lunae boss , and a friend of mine told me to w8 for sparkle , cause she was realy good with lunae , then i came to reddit and saw u guys talking that she should be F tier beacuse of the SP , should i pool for her or not?
back then : shit i got only 1 sp

now : shit, i got too much sp must throw it away
Has quantum had a "bad" unit yet? Like, Xueyi and Lynx might be considered the "worst" of them, but are still really good for what they do, especially with investment. Quantum stonks keep getting better.
Imo luocha should be S+ for the simple fact that he heals alot, cleanses enemies and allies, and is the only real SP positive healer in the game. My luocha literally never has to use SP and his field is almost always up once its down.

I have both fuxuan and luocha and although i can see fuxuan being better for high lvl SU runs, for most other content, theyre really quite equal in terms of utility.
I still dont knlw whether to try pulling for her or not.
Frankly speaking, im satisfied with what i got, just got bronya via 300 pulls, got black swan rather fast (still weak though), and while i still need to grind several characters to 80, im overall satisfied. But id like to pull something like jingliu or luocha or fu xuan, since i only have few good dps or tanks (i recently got gepard so hes too weak, and i heard fu xuan is the best tank so far).

I dont know what ill do. Maybe ill try a couple rolls and wait. Got 6000+ jades so it couldnt hurt...right?
    Id rather save and wait for sustain unit, Sparkle is stronger that Bronya but shes not really necessary, FX or Luocha however will make your life much more easier.
As a QQ main I see this as an absolute win
I have ruan mei and bronya. Might I be okay if I skip sparkle for acheron?
It's so cool how I've lost all the 50/50s in this game over almost a year
Well deserved, no surprises at all.

Poor Yukong though.  Our silver fox had exactly 1 niche and RM/Sparkle just powercrept her out of existence into copium-tier.
Well, as expected. She's too good, she's a must have for everyone.
I'm a new player so I only have blade as my limited character for now and dr ratio ig? Should I wait for another dps character or huohuo/loucha and Ruan Mei or should i just pull sparkle?
Guys I'm new in to honkai star rail I got black swan and Dr ratio (witch was free) and the ice boy on the beginning banner but we don't talk of him, and I was thinking what is the best way to try spend my gems, um on pity and I lost 50/50 to ice boy on Dan hein banner (pls just let me go ice boy I don't like you) so I was thinking about go for acheron and fu xuan (é see some speculation that fu xuan will come with acheron)
BRONYA'S DOWN, BRONYA'S DOWN
Dumb question but if i got ruan mei, bronya and e6 tingyun, should i pull for sparkle or save for acheron?
Got her at first pull and decided to go for 4 more to get hanya and instead of hanya got 5 sampo....
wow fr? on god? no cap? who couldve thought... i fr thought she was going to f tier for fool. /s
Bronya was already S tier, and rightfully so, and sparkle is the upgrade.
She is so busted, powercrept bronya pretty much.

JinglLiu/Blade Hypercarry is probably the one where she is not exactly an upgrade over bronya.
Saved a total of 40 pulls for her.
Yesterday night I was explaining the lore and nature of Masked Fools to a friend.
If I didn't get her, I would pull for Acheron.
Apparently, Aha heard me loud and clear. 
Only one 10 pull without guarantee, after a streak of getting Himeko (E2-3 I think).
Fuck Nihility. Give me my mask.
PLEASE, SHOULD I PULL FOR HER OR JINGYUAN 😭 (i don't have lightning dps 🥲 but i main danheng il, i alr have silver wolf and fuxuan) BUT I LIKE JINGYUAN BUT
Evil prydwen: having more SP is bad actually
    Also evil prydwen: "Cycling SP causes environmental damage, Arlan S++ tier"
        One day my boy, you will be viable, one day
            Hoping for some Enmity deck support next. Especially with tons of revives and high risk, high reward gameplay.
    But SP, damage buffing, and action advance are bad things!!! Sparkle should be F tier! F for Fool!
        E. For she is Elation
    Reminds me of black swan's con being dealing too much damage.
    i mean she breakes Quantum QuiQui teams and and i just tested Otto+Hanabi+Tingyun+Danheng this shit goes Wild
        Was this comment written by AI?
            i guess you dont know the alternative Characters from Impact3D and Names from China/japan i dont blame you for bieng a Casual
                My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
                Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
                    were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
                        He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
                            'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
Yeah. Even a person that does not follow meta would know about it.
I think the more surprising thing there is why is Bronya not at the top too?
    Uses too much SP and buff only lasts for a character's turn which makes her less flexible, I'm guessing.
        Just to nitpick, more than "uses too much SP", I think it's better worded as "has a negative net SP generation". Since they both use SP at the same rate, but sparkle's SP rate is positive due her ultimate.
        Also she's harder to use than other amplifiers and she's mainly only for single dps teams. Sparkle is easier to use effectively, and ruan is super easy to use well and she works for dual dps.
    Because she's not as good as the S+ tier units before those units arrived she's the sole S+ harmony unit.
    Mostly because Bronya is too SP heavy. At E1S1 she’s a lot better.

Then she is close to Sparkle level, more like slightly inferior sidegrade
        Nah e1s1 bronya over e0s0 sparkle imo. Esp if ur playing her fast her sp gen is big also
            I would hope a 5 star at e1s1 would outperform one at e0s0...although I would add, that even then, sparkle is far more versatily. bronya only works for hypercarry.
                ? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
                    No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
                        Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
                            >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                                Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
            There are a lot of limitations on Bronya’s sp gen capacity and h r compatibility with SP hungry units(even at E1S1). A good example of that is pairing her with SP heavy characters like DHIL. Her SP generation capacity is limited, why? Because you are limited to 5SP with bronya. I use an E1S1 Bronya with 161 speed. The problem with her is when she does E to an SP hungry unit like QQ and DH and consumes 3 SP. You are left with 1 sp after that and have to generate with your other units by basic attacking. With sparkle, that limitation is bypassed since your max SP is 7, plus she can ult and restore 4sp every single time. With this setup, it allows your 2 other characters on using their skills freely and/or when you are in a pinch(low health and needsHealing/bursting and needs to do debuffs etc).


No one is saying Bronya is not good. The premium 5 star is just better than her and that’s just the usual trend being followed.
                It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
        The actual review on Prydwen notes that Bronya's raw potential in a vacuum likely outweighs Sparkle (by a small amount), but she requires more investment, team tuning, and skill to reach her maximum effectiveness - whereas Sparkle in comparison is very easy to use effectively and efficiently.

I think I agree with that assessment, personally, although I haven't used Sparkle much yet. She seems very powerful and simple to use, primarily because her SP economy is just nuts so you can use her with as many SP-hungry teammates as you want. The rest of her kit is just the cherry on top, frankly.
            Wdym Bronya has more raw power. Sparkle has better buffs even if you ignore the sp difference. 100% advance forward buff vs 50% is literally the same in most teams. Bronya spamming her skill is too much sp heavy unless you play Jingliu/Blade and you have E1S1 Bronya. Ignoring those two there is not a single scenario that you would choose Bronya over Sparkle. 
                50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
    Sparkle just has all round greater flexibility, her slow and fast builds work with every DPS except DoT teams, whereas Bronya's slow build is trickier to make work with DPS that aren't Jingliu/Blade (though easier with E1/S1), and Bronya is not good with follow up attackers pre-E6. 

Sparkle also functions well in dual DPS comps whereas Bronya doesn't really - and there's options there too, either as a fast buffer same as hypercarry, or in a quirky auto-attack only comp where you just go for insane SP generation over ever using her skill (I.e. if you have 2 DPS that want to skill every turn, and a support that needs to skill every few turns, like HuoHuo - auto spam Sparkle with ER rope, and ER 2pc set will be able to fuel the whole team's ridiculous SP demands - this boosts energy regen for the whole team as well, since more skills are being used).  

Her only weakness is she wants good/specific relics in terms of Speed, but hey, Bronya has the same weakness. 

She's not better than Bronya in every situation, but she definitely has more options.
    Bronya is SP hungry.
        too hungry she always shout when she cast ulti.
    bronya trash + boring. Everytime she use ulti she always scream like hysteric girl
Ruan Mei would like a word. She has the most busted kit to date and its not close. She does way too much.
    Yeah not sure if sparkle will replace ruan Mei fore yet. But maybe some teams? Dunno yet.
        Ruan Mei is for Dual DPS and Sparkle for Hypercarry obv
            Ruan is for basically every team, including hypercarry. Probably gonna be used with sparkle a fair amount
            RM is amazing for everything, also hypercarry
            You forgot Ruan Mei work with dot team and Sparkles doesnt
                I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
Prydwen just draining half court shots like Curry right now.
Everyone *likes* skill points even if not everyone *needs* skill points.

Things like Gepard freezing or Asta keeping a higher charge count are nice to have.
    My Fuxuan can just reset her cc sheild every turn now.
        Yeah, I liked Fu Xuan for her lack of need to spam her skill, but it was still annoying against certain cc heavy enemies. Sparkle has enabled the perpetual cc shield, which is a nice little perk I don't really see anybody else mentioning.
Helps enable other traditional DPS better than bronya  (which is great especially those that use SP per turn or tons of them) and since we need two teams in MOC, can put both at one side as well
    GuobaCertified came up with a meme Sparkle 2 turn ult, where you stack enough ER and Shared Feeling on the healer, letting you get Sparkle's Ult up every 2nd turn by just spamming basic attack. 

This means Sparkle generates 3 SP a turn (for comparison, thats ~10 times as much SP as Ruan Mei who only generates 0.33 SP a turn).

This means Sparkle by herself would be able to fund enough SP for all 3 other teammembers to spam skill EVERY TURN
        Thisbis with Huohuo yes ?
            No he didn’t count Huohuo ult energy, just meshing cogs and shared feeling lc. But you need to skill spam with your healer for shared healing and Huohuo makes the best use of the extra energy you get from skill spamming by actually buffing your team with her ult.
                That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
                Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
        Lmao what team would needs even this much skillpoint?
            Sparkle out here enable DHIL+QQ teams like a chaos elemental.
                What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
                    Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
            you know with bronya... it go fast. You can look his vid, he said than Sparkle beat Pela in a team like Welt dps bronya.
            E2 DHIL.
Reminds me of a guy saying luocha wasnt as good as huohuo because you couldnt make use of all ths sp he generated. It was insane
    Huohuo is better at cleansing lol. Luocha in the virtual boss events can't cleanse everyone in the team. Huohuo however bypass her freeze mechanic.
        Clearly, but thats not what the guy was trying to say lol.
            People that skipped Luocha cope extremely hard
                but the cleansing!
                Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
                    E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
        She only cleanse oneat a time right? Lynx can team cleanse
            Her talent makes her always cleanse.
                Ah true
            If a CC hits your teammate and action delays or skips their turn, it will still action delay or skip their turn. If they are frozen or imprisoned, when it is their turn HuoHuo's talent will cleanse the CC and they can still act.
                Oh true. forgot about her talent
    [removed]
    with sparkle luocha can fuk off tbh. 

"HUo huo welcome to the team"
100%
The reason I pull Sparkle, other than being a total simp, was to improve my Qingque in mono quantum.
Well well well, guess who somehow also got improved in my account? The most beautiful character in HSR, Mr. Argenti(na).
Being able to spam E without managing SP distribution is such a blessing for the knight of beauty.
Only DPS I have is Jingliu, not sure if she pairs well with sparkle since she doesn't eat up as much SP. I have a follow up team, not sure if she fits better than Mei or Aventurine
    Calculations has been done for jingliu on the character subreddit, better to pair sparkle with other DPS
        I'll replace mei with her in FUA team, and keep mei for Jingliu
            Don't do that, ruan mei is way better for follow-up (assuming you mean topaz ratio). Keep her there and give jingliu pela and bronya
                I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
                    Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
    I think she will go OK with JL. But JLs best pairs are Blade and Pela. Neither of them want sp.

Maybe if we get a sp hungry Nihility in the future that could work.
I mean, her existence in the team already increase the skill point intensivity as she consume SP + your dps can play twice each rotation (with proper speed tuning).

Also if you use RM in another team or don't have RM, well she enable your sup DPS to actually use skill frequently. Welt come in mind, and you get more ult due to energy generation.

Worst case scenario you can spam spam you sustain skill, who is actually a nice QOL for your team. I mean the biggest exemple i can see is gepard spamming is skill for freeze and actually the avance foward will become a lesser problem for his shield uptime.
    Assuming you're talking about sparkle she can only have your DPS twice every other rotation. So it isn't quite as SP intensive as Bronya
        I mean, that's still 3 SP consumed in one rotation. That still intensive in a vacuum, hell that near unsustainable in the long run unless you have SP printer Luocha, potentialy with a Pela on top of that. (though i mean "in the long run" if you achieve that is not really something that happen)
            she give 7 sp limit and her ultimate is on 3 turn cool down and give 4 skill point you'll need some massive skill issue or bad luck with qingque to waste all of that.
                She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
                    Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
                You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.

2 more hours on eu 😭
    Me too, counting down minutes.. Good luck on your pulls
        Idk if your comment gave me luck but I got sparkle on guaranteed and then I got yanging as well 😭
            I lost 50/50 😭😭😭 Happy for you tho
Sameeee
I cant wait
Is your Sparkle s0? I have Bronya e0s1 idk how much noticeable would it be for Sparkle without LC.
    Apparently not that much, could just use bronya's lc for her. It only makes a difference if you're using with follow up team
        I just slapped S5DDD on her and she is already a better Bronya. I can't even imagine an S1.
            iirc over a more extended fight s5 ddd is actually close to her s1
    My sparkle is e0s1 vs my bronya e1s1. Sparkle’s LC essentially gives another 55 crit value to her allies (assuming her skill is 10/10 maxed) so it could just be that. Having e0s1 Sparkle + fu xuan in any team makes all my dps have a baseline of 90/300 crit ratio after using sparkle skill
        Honestly ,You seems to have So much CD, even Dhil with his massive 151.2 % of  DMG% increase, assuming element orb,Rutilant,and musketeer, will have way more reward increasing Dmg% instead of CV at this point. Even with Sparkle Ultimate + TY ultimate he will reach only 255 % Dmg% increase. So still 50% Under 300% CD, and you're not supose to have 100% uptime on those Buffs. Therfore the diff between sig 55CV and 32% of P&F is prolly not that far in YOUR case.
    E0s1 bronya has same rotation as sparkle.

Bronya needs er rope and lc to do 3 skill rotations, sparkle only needs er rope.

Bronya had energy cost of 120, sparkle has cost of 110
Sparkle isn't really competing with Bronya for a spot on DHIL teams, it's more like the Pelas and E6 Yukongs that are being threatened.
    And hanyas
        Yeah, I might swap my hanya for sparkle, but I really want that super Acheron lol
            acheron really need 2 nihility in her team lmao. That will limit your freedom. Thats why i will skip her
                Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
                I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
                    you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
                        Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
    is Tingyun better then E6 Yukong?
        They do different things. Tingyun will be in more or less every DHIL team comp though, so it's not really worth thinking about.
            True, but using fribbeles i noticed that Yukong gives a bigger boost. The energy regeneration of Tingyun is op, but getting 20k or more from Yukong is pretty good. Anyway I think i will stick to Tingyun so I can play in auto ahahah
                Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
        I think you're comparing the wrong members of his team comp. When I got E6 Yukong I took out Pela and ran Tingyun and Yukong. Now I'm going to run Tingyun and Sparkle.
for dmg and loud scream when she cast ulti : bronya

for fun : sparkle

for op and boringness : ruan mei
I just tried DHIL with Sparkle AND Bronya in MoC. That shit was hilarious, just non-stop DHIL full 3 charge turns for 200K, so many per cycle. Probably the smoothest autobattle 3* clear of floor 11 I've ever done. Sparkle doesn't need to replace Bronya, she needs to stand with her ;)
What makes sparkle easier to use?
    No thoughts, just skill your DPS. No need to weave basic attacks unless you mismanage your skill points.

And even if you need to basic attack, it's typically once a fight, considering how long they last.
        lmao no, thats only happen with hyperspeed sparkle or if team consist alot of sp positive chars
        bruh if u need to basic attack with bronya and cant skill spam, you either have a skill issue or team building issue. Like why u making the team so sp negative. use a pela or smth
            Yeah, a skill point issue, which Sparkle doesn't have, thank you for proving the point.

You can just constantly skill with Sparkle and still be a point positive.
                why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
                    because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
                        So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
                            no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                                You are absolutely right about that XD
                            I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
            Do you think only one team comp exists or something?
                Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
                    omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
                        But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
        It feels like she would still benefit from some spd tuning and weaving to get the Max out of her. I saw one streamer using her each turn to speed up his dps by about 10.
            If it only moves it up by 10, he is misusing her. Either the DPS has no skillpoints or is faster than Sparkle. So yes, some speedtuning is needed but far less than Bronya.
            the tldr is, as long as Sparkle is faster, but not more than 2x, she'll always push DPS to top. i.e  100spd dps and 100-200spd Sparkle work perfectly. Assuming no enemy pushes the DPS back before Sparkle's turn.     
   
Slow Sparkle also works, but instead of getting the DPS a turn every time, the build is focuses on maximising the value of the 50%aa. Where Fast Sparkle will realistically boost the dps only like 30-40%, slow Sparkle will always make use of the full 50%.    
    
For full explanation you can google "hsr action value guide", it's surprisingly simple how it works.
    You spam skill every rotation and still come out with +1 sp every 3 turns while bronya needs e1 s1 in 3 turns to break even which too is rng so you might be at -2 and -3 at e0 s0 

Also with extra sp your supports can spam more skill for more energy and more skills so not only sparkle but the entire team feels wayyyyyy smoother
    SP + easier speed tuning. For bronya( unless e2 but e2 bronya is a monster) you generally want her at -1 speed but with sparkle you can just make her gigafast while focusing only on offensive stats on your carry( no speed only ark and crit)
        Better ask here as it seems relevant to the conversation. I have E2S1 Bronya, so how should I gear my DPS to make the most out of the Spd buff from E2? I'm still running the -1 Spd thing with Jingliu but I feel that's wasting the Spd buff. Is the build for E2 hyperspeed Bronya?
            The most "perfect" scenario is for Bronya to be 29 speed faster than your DPS so that when she advances them, they will get 1 advanced turn and then 1 regular turn right before Bronya (and repeat). If your Bronya is 134 spd and your dps is 135ish then you can just take off speed boots and this concept will still apply.

Basically E2 Bronya just makes slow bronya even better because you can drop speed boots (or substats) on your dps. If you play Bronya hyperspeed (160+) and you don't skill > auto > repeat, then the E2 is not noticeable tbh.
                Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
    Everything other commenters said + she actually enables FUA users (like Jing Yuan, Topaz, Ratio) better since her buffs last until the unit's next turn. So she can fit in better in those teams. You can also ult out of turn while still buffed.
It says they need more time to test specific damage dealers, so any changes will happen at least tomorrow.
    aight thx
Both will probably jump a tier with her.
    To be fair QQ is too high as S pre-Sparkle.
        yeah she'll probably stay the same.
        They could have a caveat to her little "RNG" dice 

>If used with Sparkle - significantly less praying required
            Nah you still wanna pray for bad rolls until you get full buffs. Yeah... Qingque RNG is rather punishing quick rolls
            Sparkle only get her 1 SP every 3 turns unless you do basic spam. praying still exists.

        My QQ outperforming BS and Kafka in the previous MOC 12 second half with meh could be better stats. I think it’s deserved.
            What? For real? I use both team and BS Kafka is overwhelmingly stronger.
                On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
                    No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
                        wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
                            All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                                hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
                        Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
            except the last moc 12 had both 40% lightning and wind resist on both halves
            Bro these fuckers are downvoting you cause they think you trash talked their dear black swan. Smh I hate these kids
        I'd personally rate Qingque actually at the tier of current Imbib without sparkle, or maybe she could actually have the performance of an Imbib without Sparkle, but Qingque without Sparkle even on E6 is not that great, Sparkle is just straight up broken.
Greatly buff DHIL(0) and Qingque, but not good with DHIL(2 and above).  
Edit: maybe I have not made myself clear. Example: Sparkle is a 200% damage multiplier for Qingque/DHIL(0) but 140% multiplier for Seele/DHIL(2+).   
She is still good with them, just not that outstanding.
    Not necessarily IMO, DanIL at E2+ basically guarantees that you can have a fully positive SP rotation once every other turn, it practically opens up alot for his team-building as his biggest flaw was dependancy on SP for big dmg. 

With Sparkle, DanIL + SW is now a viable strategy, DanIL + a sub DPS is a viable strategy, DanIL + Bronya + Sparkle is also a viable strategy. It opens up DanIL teambuilding and overall gives alot of flexibility for him, which i think is huge. But this is also assuming people have him at E2, which is a tall ask.
    So those with DHIL E2 doesnt need sparkle ?
        Well, the buff is still there, just not a huge one.

You mean third. RM's ultimate causes enemy to experience ''second'' weakness break when they were supposed to recover.

Edit:  Was thinking  about how Xueyi's ultimate completely ignores weakness type and still reduces toughness but this is quite similar (although different) to SW.

Edit: Kafka also fits the bit since DoT was centered around dealing damage when enemy affected by it has their turn but she made it that you can detonate it earlier, without consuming stack.
    I dont have ruan but I thought she just applies her own weakness break outside/in correlation, the usual break effect.  Something welt also was doing  on demand when casting ultimate. He force imprisons enemies

> When these enemies attempt to recover from Weakness Break, Thanatoplum Rebloom is triggered, extending the duration of their Weakness Break, delaying their action by an amount equal to 20% of Ruan Mei's Break Effect plus 10%, and dealing Break DMG equal to 30%—54% of Ruan Mei's Ice Break DMG.


Edit: I love being downvoted for literally mentioning the idea is pre-existing and not anything "new". Imagine if I also said that kafka isn't the first to front-load dots as sampo e4 is a mini kafka for wind dots. Kafka didn't break any "rule", it just made it proper and work for all dots.
And both of them are short Quantum girls.

Quantum truly is the best element.
    Quantum: All girls, all gas, some gremlins.
        I know it's an unpopular opinion but I kinda want it to stay that way lol.
    Nah lightning is the best element. Lightning got the hottest women. Kafka, Tingyun, Jing Yuan and Acheron, do I need to say more
Oh yes, silver ''totally not worse than pela' ' wolf
    Silver "single target only" wolf
>the first one was silverwolf that made you not care about weaknesses

Yeah, her problem is that the rest of her kit is mid
    How are DEF shred on ult and 3 different debuffs on basic attack mid? SW offers value each and every turn.
        Ult charges too long and ST and debuffs on basic are barely do anything. Pela is just miles better
        Opportunity cost. Just because something offers value on every turn it doesn't mean it can't be bad or mid. While her passive and ulti shred are not bad, they arent anything crazy either. ,they are single target and need time to stack. Almost every harmony would be a better option than sw without her weakness mechanic, especially if the dps is capable of aoe/blast dmg.


That being said I don't get the point of talking with "ifs". That's core part of her kit. No point judging a kit in parts. You judge it as a whole.

Edit: forgot that the majority of players here can only feel'scraft. No one would ever play sw if she didn't have her main mechanic. You guys really are meta ignorant if you think she would be good support compared to the rest options
Its only a couple of hours difference. Also, not like getting her late would change anything in a PVE game.

Edit: Lol. Just admit yall are gacha addicts that can't wait a couple of hours.
    it won't change anything, but it is nerve wracking wondering how your pulls will go
        Sounds like a gambling problem there bud lol.  But let me help you….I’m sending you some of my luck and positive energy, to a fellow NA server dweller.  I hope your pulls are short and 50/50 is won today.
    I think it gives a little less time to complete old MoC with her? If you were unable to play this weekend that's a lot of time lost. But barely anyone should be actually affected by the roll out, especially since there shouldn't be much story to spoil in thumbnails being released.
        You don't lose those hours because the old MoC ends at NA server times anyways.
Bronya is better for Jingliu and Blade, Sparkle is better for everyone else (DHIL, Seele, QQ, JY, Ratio, Topaz, Argenti).
    Yeah, basically teams with any SP/spam issues, or that don't synergize well from the beginning due to 1 turn buff unless E6.

I forgot Bronya cleanse too, for the few times it clutched my SU run or MoC.
        Wait, Bronya can cleanse? So I don't have to try using Lynx in my Bronya team??
            Her skill cleanse (only the advanced forward ally, ie your carry most probably). Unlike Lynx who have AoE cleanse if my memory is good.
                Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!
            If you aren't afraid of Bronya herself being CC'd sure
                just gotta pump up that effect res
    I mean, for Balde and Jingliu you can run both if you want to. Easier to do on Blade, but it can work on Jingliu as well with a little more effort.
I agree and I kinda disagree with this ranking to an extent. Everything sparkle does seems weaker than Bronya aside from the comfort but people are acting like they didn't spend an entire year playing the game around 5 skill points. 

For DHIL and QQ I agree but saying sparkle is flat out better everywhere else is just plain wrong. Take sparkle into a Abundance deer or Kafka or anything that CCs and you will instantly feel the lack of cleanse. 

I'm not saying she is horrible but I think S tier is the correct spot for her. The moment any new Hamony that does something actually unique she will drop faster than uou can blink
    You know how this community works, overhype and then they come back to their senses, however this shows how Star Rail has direct powercreep as we just saw with sparkle on top of the bronya
My Jingliu says otherwise. She does not tolerate another insane woman beside her.
    Yea, JL benefits more from DMG bonus that Bronya provides than CrtDmg of Sparkle. Also Bronya provides cleanse.
        Bronya is supposed to move after JL to double her turn so her cleanse loses a lot of value.  

Other than that yeah this combo with defo stay for the time being
    Considering how much JL also likes RM, I am not sure she is so against crazy ass woman
        I don't think Ruan Mei is crazy in the traditional sense.

A bit autistic (due to having trouble understanding emotions) and laser focused on her research goals but not crazy.
I mean given they dropped him from S+ because they had skill issue managing SP, it would only make sense to put him back up - since their argument back then wasn't that he dealt less damage.
I can't wait until I can get Sparkle (15 more minutes...) and finally have a proper dedicated support for him.
What does it matter if he's S or S+ in a tier list that constantly changes every MoC or PF.

DHIL is an amazing DPS that others doesn't even come close especially at E2.
    Prydwen's tier list is stated to be based on e0 5 stars, e6 4 stars and is agnostic to the current endgame layout. Prydwen in the update notes have said Black Swan is S+ for Pure Fiction because of testing of her in the old Pure Fiction, not just because there is a DoT cacophony right now.
        Did that change? I thought they based it all on the current moc/pf?
            It did change to that method yeah. It's been ignoring layout at least since Pure Fiction was added and treating 5 stars as e0 (and 4 stars as e6) at least since Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae dropped from S+.
    >What does it matter if he's S or S+ in a tier list that constantly changes every MoC or PF.

Because that's their job. And it also Stop the argument about Dhil is behind JL.
        I thought that JL was only ahead because everything had ice weakness.
what the actual fk lmbib, speak with human language
    Bruh who else could they mean other than Imbibitor Lunae aka 5 star Dan Heng?? Isn't that obvious?
Too late. Every update someone take out this list. And every time a lot of players complain; but I noticed that there are less complainers each time and more normal discussion...too late
    Its the twice per patch HSR PvP event, of course its getting posted.


The real event has yet to get started, as DPS haven't been placed.
    HSR players finally calming down their hate boner against tier lists? That's great!

                Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects . The difference is way too big to ignore . I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants
                    >Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects .

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

Same.
Huohuo gets slept on in discussions so hard
    Yeah Fr huohuo can pretty much render any debuff heavy fight a breeze. And is a lot stronger in Situations where FX may get overwhelmed by stuff like true stings wind shear or Fem Auramaton’s stuns.

That being said FX can still bruteforce through everything if you built her well, I’ve even brought lvl 60 supports with me to MoC 12 without maxed relics and they still survive due to FX insane mitigation.
        Pretty much the only place my FX has struggled has been Gold and Gears where her tanking the entire team’s damage just straight up 1 shot her at higher difficulties lol.

For all normal content + PF + MoC, she’s a god.

HH is still my preferred sustain character though just because I like her as a character more lol.
    She's sp neutral so it slightly holds back her. Same with Luocha. He's S tier only because he's sp positive.
        She's a bit more than that if you are going for low cycles. You don't worry about healing as much and take hits on the chin. I'll at Max skill twice but hope for one and just evade a debuff while it's still up. 

Where she shines is turboing ults at the start while also having buffs. 

You can run setups with fine fruit (legit one of her best cones) to get everyone including herself at a starting ult level. This is especially nuts if you managed to pull Ruan Mei cone but it's not necessary. It lets you start off with with a huge burst phase out the gate and put her a skill and auto away from her own ult so you are ready going into wave 2 with her skill still going. 

I have e1 Fu Xuan and E0 Huohuo and I end up taking Huohuo more while Fu has been slowly getting benched more and more. Her SP is usually about the equivalent of Fu's starting rotation of...

Auto -) take some hits -) Skill and then hopefully you are in a position where you can auto the rest of use one more skill
    Fr. Duo battery TY+HH carrying my ass to get ult frequently, because most of dmg dealers relies alot on their ult. 

FX is good. But lately, I've been using Huohuo more than FX.
meh she's boring anyway
Tier list gonna be update tomorrow, they just added Sparkle right now
 ''There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!''

from prydwen site
I don't think the tier list should rate characters based on being teamed with other, specific, characters. Otherwise Kafka and BS should be in the same tier since they make each other broken.
Because Jingliu still exists and is just that much better.
    Currently DHIL outpreforms her by 16-18%, so no she's not.
    Lmao what? Look at the fucking calcs bro, IL's best team with sparkle already humiliates Jingliu's best team in a neutral wave.

People act like Jingliu is some god unit when she is only good cuz Bronya exists, but now IL has his own Bronya so she gets dusted
        Damage doesn't tell the whole story. Hu Tao does considerably more damage than Neuvillette yet most people put him a tier higher. Jingliu using 0.4 sp a cycle just makes her much better and more future-proof.

The second they release another sp negative support, and use that as justification to power creep existing options, it will be even more obvious she is just a busted unit.
            goofy ahh simp💀 no DPS is futureproof bruh and calcs were already out, IL/TY/Sparkle/Huohuo is out damaging a team consisting of JL/Bronya/Ruan Mei/Huohuo, and there are gameplays as well already so if you still think she's better, you need to get your eyes checked.

and how does Hu Tao and Neuvillette correlate with the topic anyway? Hu Tao's a nuker while Neuv's a pew pew typa dealer; it would've made more sense if you compare Al-Haitham and Neuvillette.
            Tf is this logic? They can also release another sp generator that is more busted you know? Just because she is sp negative doesn't make her future proof cuz IL's sp problems can easily be fixed by using a brain on making team comps. 

And Sparkle existing already fixes his sp problem anyways so even if they release another sp negative support it wont matter at all since Sparkle mitigate the sp consumption.
                Uneducated people grossly overestimate how much SP she generates. She front-loads it, but Tingyun and Ruan Generate more SP. Her main benefit is not being an SP sync like Bronya while also enabling AV. A strong, sp negative support is the obvious progression. People undervalue SP and the tier list will continue to reflect the opinion of people who aren't reactionary and have functional brains.
                    More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
                        They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
                            >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
                                The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
                        Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
                            the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
                            JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
supports as a whole tend to be worse in pure fiction, because their buffs are  usually simply overkill.
Probably due to ruan mei,Sparkle make overkill on one ally,while RM buff both,and just damage about right(not counting extra survivability with the breaks delay,no healer is available)and extra speed for everyone

That if we talk double DPS.

Definitely allowing some hypercarry on PF tho,like DHIL that wasn't so good on PF
    Yep. 100% a buff for Argenti. RM however is way better as a generalist for PF.
    Couldn't you run one on each side? Maxxing out the points is very difficult so I don't see why you wouldn't need two supports
Which is strange, since she's one of the few supports that can theoretically sustain dual DPS comps with higher SP reqs, which can be favored by PF. 

Then again I've rarely seen any discussion of any rotation other than 3x skill.
    Tbh Dual DPS have Ruan Mei.. do they need sparkle really? Ruan Mei herself is SP positive already.. with the fact that she will always be 1+ like Sparkle Rotations(Unless you don’t use her skill every turn which is dumb) and in start of the battle 2+(since her skill is triggered).. 

Unless you are gonna replace the sustain.. you would more likely to use Ruan Mei in Duo DPS then Sparkle..
        There’s only one ruan Mei and 2 sides
            4 dps's?!?!?!??!
                Not the first time for PF. We already have Herta + Himeko on one side with Kafka + Black Swan on the other being one of the most meta picks.
                Not unheard of… I’ve done Jingliu herta and Jingyuan Himeko for PF before
                I play dual dps all the time between Jingliu Blade, Ratio Topaz and the DoT ladies so it's not unheard of

And everywhere including MoC so I would very much appreciate another Ruan Mei lol
    Eh.... I think there's a gap between RM and Sparkle in PF as a dual dps support. In MOC, they're about equal. But Ruan mei in a dual dps comp in pf, is much better for breaking and overall team damage.

So she's an S tier support their, because you can do dual dps with her, but she's not on RM's level in pf specifically.
Nuh huh! No breathing room for you in 2.x!

Acheron is next! And then Aventurine! And then who knows!
Read their website:

> There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!
    I don't care enough for that, but good to know my assumption was correct.

 The update will be a hot topic around here for sure.
Sorry forgot Fu xuan But again she is a S Tier. Can heal, Can deal Damage, Gives Eff Res.
    Don't forget her crit rate buff
        I don't have her man. I don't know. But from how much I read. She can Heal, She Can Reduce damage taken, She can deal decent Damage, gives Eff Res. She is Already like SSS tier sustain.
Daniel? Sure

QQ? No, putting them in the same tier was a mistake in the first place
Topaz isn't a particularly good pull unless you like the char, just FYI. If you're pulling for your Ratio team, Ratio + Tingyun + Pela will be just as good or better than a comp with Topaz.
    Idk, a fully built Topaz using elation path just dominates any of the Simulated Universes, especially with Ratio
I feel like it's about as relevant as it should be as a general overview of the game that's useful to many players. The vast majority of the playerbase is pretty casual and is still trying to beat harder content. The people who it's not useful to don't need it anyways so I don't think there's a problem with it. If a new player were to look at the tier list and prioritize picking up and investing in the high tier characters their account would be in a pretty decent state imo.
They don't have another options, only people that have played this game for a long time realizes the many issues with its tier lists.

Its a good reference for guides, but the tier list is garbage, it has been for a very long time.
people I think, the masses pay attention and this attracts more masses in the end, now these tier lists are considered golden proofs as if they were completely factual
Yes and no. They are good for getting general direction, but their favorism for some characters is visible
They put Bronya in S because of Ruan Mei, not to preempt Sparkle.
limited 5 star sustain will improve your account way more than DPS or support.
Was this ever a rule? Their Pure Fiction ratings have had multiple units in S+ for a while.
    No, but Gachasmack looked at their tier list somewhat recently, saw one in each category and assumed that was the rule, and now his simps treat that like gospel.
since when this is their rule?
They literally never said this lol. The only reason DHIL dropped was because with the supports we had at the time Jingliu was just better. Not by much, but she was. I highly expect in 24hrs when they update it all for DHIL to jump back up to S+ because he synergies with Sparkle the same way Jingliu does with Bronya, allowing greater potential.
After all this time, you still think that they are consistent event with themselves? They never were and never will be :)
They don’t factor the MoC buff into it.
    I am very sure they do. Not to mention that you cant play without it.
Definitely disagree with ruan mei being a tier above all others. She’s more universally applicable due to her general buffs but how big a boost she is depends on the team.

She’s the best damage buff for dual dps teams and her break efficiency is great for enabling break comps

Meanwhile sparkle is generally the best hypercarry buffer (the exception being jl/blade) and the most frontloaded sp provider you can currently get

Biggest difference between them comes with higher investment where 168 wind set sparkle enabling 3 turns for a no speed hypercarry (or 4 in niche setups) allows e0 character 0 cycles that weren’t attainable before
Sure, drop down Bronya even more. She is still the best support of one of the best dps character in the game, but sure, drop her more down.
Bro, The reason why Rm is fit for every team. Is because she is your secondary support in hypercarry, Not primary.

Her Dmg amp is not in same level As bronya and Sparkle. Just Play character Like Dhil, Blade, JL without Bronya or Sparkle and Used RM. You will see those Dps number Drop. For example a team of JL+Ruan mei+Ty/pela will always be worse than JL+Bronya+Pela.
I also think RM is just above both Bronya and Sparkle lol. She is such a strong Generalist that can go *with* Bronya and Sparkle anyway. 

Sparkle is generally better than Bronya, but Bronya actually still better in JL and Blade team.
[deleted]
    Are you telling me that e4 pela with 12% ice res and 40% def down is better than e0 RM with 68% dmg, 50% break efficiency, 25% all type res pen on top of giving everyone essentially 10 spd?


That's kind of a ridiculous comparison.


Literally anyone can make full use of her kit, from hypercarry to dual dps to even dot.
    >There are many situations where even pela beats her.

Eh? Wasn't that disproven?

Anyways, the point isn't that she's BiS on every team, it's that she's universal and enables so many comps, strats, and builds. Besides her massive damage buffs:

- She enables dual DPS.
- Her break efficiency enables break teams and pseudo-sustain, and makes sustainless so much more accessible.
- Her speed buffing allows characters to hit the 134 breakpoint often with just speed boots, or plus 1-2 rolls into speed.

Bronya is strictly for hypercarries and severely restricts the teammates you can use.

Sparkle is mostly for hypercarry, but is significantly more flexible with teammates and, besides mono-Quantum, allows every DPS she's paired with to use ATK or HP boots. Her buff is also flat out better for FUA characters.

She is not universal like RM, doesn't enable as much, and doesn't create as much flexibility RM does.

Tingyun with Dance^3 specifically is crazy, yeah. She's definitely Sparkle tier.
The first one. The second one is Adventurine.
Check how many pulls you have. 2.1 phase 1 will come with new freebies!

If you have some but not enough, try and pull on Sparkle until the 50/50, if you win - you have her. If you lose, you save for guaranteed Acheron.
Not in Blade or Jingliu teams..
    She is better in DHIL, Seele, QQ, JY, Ratio, Topaz and Argenti teams
    definitely yes on both each (unless you're running them both)
        Jingliu main sub recommend bronya over sparkle though after calculation is done on their end
            please show the calc, otherwise cap (and have they consider bronya as the other support on top of sparkle)
                Yeah someone did the calcs.. It is her worst team(even worse than Pela+Mei) From Jingliu mains.

https://preview.redd.it/frhhnm5z4hlc1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09d5be06e5c2aeca2f9855923507aa01b4bee96
                    SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
                        Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
        Bronya is still better for Jingliu, Blade and Jingliu + Blade. That's what CN bros had been cooking. These 2 have enough self buffs to keep going for another turn without needing any setups beyond that.

Oh and they both don't really need the extra SP.
        No, Bronya is definitively better for both Blade and Jingliu.
I didn’t really get into theory crafting on Sparkle, but is she even better? I’d say her 50% turn advance instead of the 100% makes her alt Bronya as opposed to one being solidly better, even considering her SP Generation.
    They go into this on the guide, but basically in terms of pure buff numbers, an E0S0 Bronya is better than an E0S0 Sparkle unless you're using a Quantum DPS, and their main points are that Sparkle has a better floor and is just generally easier to use, as well as benefitting FUA units (Dr. Ratio, Jing Yuan, Clara) which Bronya can't do until E6.

Also, for Blade and Jingliu, Bronya is pretty much always better (I remember the Jingliu sub doing some calcs on it before and Sparkle only outdoes Bronya at E2, and only by 0.02%).

So it's not so much Sparkle being universally better, as Bronya is still very good and better than Sparkle for several characters, but that Sparkle just has a better floor that's easier to work with, similar to why they have Ruan Mei in S+ as well.
        As someone who doesn't have blade or JL, what's the high level reasoning for this? Is this related to the fact they don't really use SP at all (compared to other DPS options) so you'd just have too many level over SP? Or is this related to the characters having high CDMG baked into kit so the extra DMG Bronya provides would scale better?

edit: and for blade the attack from trace is worthless
            Both of those are correct.
            and also it's 100% action advance, you can always spam Bronya's skill with them it speeds up their damage by a lot
            It's pretty much this: sparkle is best when you go 160+ speed sparkle, 200+ cd and your DPS you use is going to use attack boots(hp boots for blade) and sits at 100ish speed, this makes sparkle give like 50% more overall turns to your DPS, 15-45%  atk (based on mono quantum) and +43% because they can use attack boots instead of speed, 48(or 80 if bronya cone/past and future), inc damage for 2turns on 3t ult (18 otherwise), and 110ish crit damage while sp positive

Bronya is best (assuning the following doesn't burn out sp) when you go 134-140 speed and 1 speed slower than your DPS, so your DPS acts, bronya acts, and then your DPS immediately acts again, giving your DPS 100% more turns than normal, 100ish increase damage on the 2nd turn (past and future or sig cone, major trace), and 55% attack with 55-70% inc crit damage for 2 turns on a 3t ult(3t with sig cone).

For jing liu, she has so much crit value built in that it is easy to hit something like 50/200-240 whereas she only 60%ish increased damage if using fall of an aeon, or 105ish if using her signature/s5 secret vow. She will also have roughly 220ish increased attack from her talent giving 180, and 43 from rope. So what she lacks most of is speed and increased damage, both of which bronya gives more of than sparkle, at the cost of being sp negative. Even if using Ruan mei +bronya+jing liu, she'd at most have 183% inc damage, which is still less than the 260-300 inc crit damage she could have while under bronya Ult. Jing and bronya + a 3rd sp positive support just match perfectly currently.
    Because only characters who don’t use SP every turn can maximise Bronya. It’s impossible to sustain -1 Bronya with a dps that uses SP every turn
    Bronya buffs are stronger on paper however she's -3SP per rotation which make her not optimal for the averange team

Sparkle is better than Bronya for the FUA characters in every scenario since Bronya can't buff FUA
Also Sparkle>Bronya for mono quantum
    For most carries it doesn't matter at all since Sparkle won't have over double their speed.
    She mostly invalidates Fastya/hyperspeed Bronya, which is the most common set up for non-Blade/JL due to SP costs. 

There are still a few other setups besides traditional Slowya Bronya can do (Slowya with DPS using 1 basic for SP, 170 spd Bronya using 1 basic to come up behind a 100 SPD DPS), but these are a bit more niche set-ups that not everyone will take the time to tune, with some fairly restrictive drawbacks as well. Bronya E1 also helps make her more competitive in all scenarios, and E2 in some niche ones (eg Bronya + RM allowing DPS to be 134 SPD with only a few SPD subs) but not everyone will get her there.
    There honestly aren't very many limited DPSs that make full use of Bronya's 100% advance, it's really just Blade and Jingliu.

Everyone else either does not rely much on basic/skill damage (instead relying on ults or summons), relies too much on follow-ups, has too much turn manipulation for Bronya to keep up with, uses too many skill points, or some combination of the above.

Note that Sparkle's skill buffs out of turn follow-up damage while Bronya's does not.

Sparkle is a DPS increase (generally significant but not always) for DHIL, QQ, Seele, JY, Ratio, Topaz, and Argenti.

Bronya is still better for JL and Blade.

Prydwen didn't rank her high just for her ease of use, she wouldn't be S+ unless her damage amp was outright better for many chars. This is shown in calcs too.
    The 50% really doesn't matter as long as you hit 160 speed. And she just gives more multipliers in CDMG and atk (and this isn't mentioning her SP generation NOR her extra steroids for mono quantum)

But you also just use both for silly hypercarry scenarios such as using them together with blade and they both just keep action advancing him forward.
        She only gives 15% atk permanent to everyone who isn't quantum while bronya gives 55% atk to everyone on ulti regardless of element

Sparkle give lots of cdmg while bronya give lots of dmg bonus

Spd reduction debuff by enemy is impactful even for 160 sparkle

Both are similar but work with different characters so there really isn't "sparkle is better than bronya or bronya is better than sparkle" 

Sparkle can't replace Bronya from JL or blade team while Bronya can't replace Sparkle from qq, dhil and jy
            Check some Sparkle/Bronya/Blade setups. I'm saying that you use her with bronya for blade lol Also you're missing the damage buff sparkle gives with her talent,  which gives a damage boost team wide for every SP used. 


Really the thing that boosts Sparkle over is that her buffs have easy more consistent up time.  It's pretty much permanent and also usable for stuff like lightning lord. 
                Sparkle gives 18% dmg bonus while Bronya give 10% dmg bonus as trace permanent

Bronya with signature LC can also 3T ulti just like Sparkle..... really don't understand when does Bronya have inconsistent buff uptime? The only thing she can't do is buff FUA with her skill

Also only FUA benefit from extended buff from sparkle while character itself loose it when they take 2nd turn

At 200% cdmg for non-quantum

Bronya - 96% dmg (skill) + 10% dmg (permanent) + 55% atk (2 turns) + 52% cdmg (2 turn)

Sparkle - 93% cdmg (skill) + 15% atk (permanent) + 18% dmg (permanent) + 30% dmg (2-3 turn)

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?
                    Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
                        I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
                You know that using double harmony has diminishing returns, right? Harmony + nihility would be much much better.
        The 50% does matter, since your only build is going for 160 speed and pulling the dps to that speed. Slow Bronya at 134 speed allows you to give your dps 2 turns, meaning it becomes roughly equivalent to 268 speed. The first attack of your dps will be unbuffed, but in the end it's still an extra turn. For units that care more about the number of attacks, this is especially important.
        160spd on her or the dps?
            On her.
    More of a match to slightly better than Bronya at Bronya's best (i.e. -1 speed from your main DPS/speed-tuned). In a mono-quantum party Sparkle's unequivocally the better of the two. Sparkle's buffs are also easier to keep up and are more versatile.

* Sparkle's buff actually can affect DoT and FuA characters who get the bulk of their damage out of their turn. 
* She's SP positive even when she's using her skill non-stop, whereas Bronya doing the same requires both her E1, sig 5\* LC, and alot of RNG to do the same.
* There's less impetus to speed-tune Sparkle because her 50% turn advance means there's alot less wasted turn advancing on her compared to Bronya.
* She gets the same amount of energy normal attacking as with using her skill because of her traces. This means you can truly amass SP for the two characters we currently have that guzzle them down (QQ and DHIL).
        When did dot characters started using cdmg?
She invalidates Fast Bronya-Slow DPS setup, but never gonna replace her in 135-134 spd setup (ex: Blade and JL). But well, you can just use both at same time like XQ-Yelan situation in Genshin lmao
why not put both of em in the same team
Blade+Sparkle+Bronya+Sustain is really fun team. And There is possibility that it his strongest team.

Ratio hypercarry setup also benefit a lot from having Sparkle. Ratio+Sw+Sparkle+Sustain should be his strongest team. Because unlike bronya, Her skill buff can last until the start of Dps next turn.
Yes with Ratio, meh with Blade.
Yes totally, she is great for every hypercarry
She is better than Ruan Mei with most Hyper carry units. She is definitely deserved at S+ in MoC. But even then, always take Prydwen with a grain of salt.
They put her as S+/S for MoC/PF, i believe it is a good assessment and differentiate her from RM in the way you want
because she's entirely single target and unless you're running mono quantum, her weakness implant's rng can potentially cost so much SP if you're unlucky
    Wich is super false, you can get around RNG by facing qunetem enemies, or have sup charchter that match the cprispondng enemy wekense Type so the wekense will alawys be for your main Dps
And even if you don't do that her skill debuff still  aplly all res anayws
        and that right there is why she's S and not S+

her skill is RNG and in order to make it not RNG, you need to work around it and like I said, the only way you can get the guaranteed is either mono quantum or as you said, fight an enemy with quantum weakness while matching allies

also while her All Res shred is really good, a weakness break is infinitely better due to the action pushback, damage reduction removed, and the potential break damage
Adding weakness type is not all that good after your account gets strong enough.

Sw used to carry me through the game after getting her e1 + tutorial but she has been benched for a long time now.

She will be getting more relevant with some upcoming teams but still shes not nowhere as insane as ruan mei, bronya and now I assume sparkle.
    I mean treu she ain't no match for 5 star harmony character, but until somone else in future will have her mechanic to aplly wekense Type or change it, she will still  be S+ in her own tier for me
SW should definitely be lower than S, her ult uptime is terrible - factoring that in alongside her ST nature, her amp is consistently lower than Pela's.

She's frankly only good when you desperately need to implant weakness or your DPS is low enough for SW to keep up.
    Bruhh this is so funny 🤣 . My guy said everything wrong like i am 100% sure that either you don't have sw or never knew how to use her(too complex for you)
        Feel free to explain how to properly use her and what makes her so complex
            I was trolling but how long do you want the explanation 🤔?
        I have her and legit almost never use her because Pela is just better overall. She is super over rated and is mostly there for mono-quantum enjoyers.
            Skill issue bruh . Remember this is a turn based rpg . You can literally win fights you are not supposed to win before entering the fights .  I don't want to write a 1000 words essay because nobody cares but you do what you are doing with your shallow approach to sw 😬
Her LC is among the worst limited LCs. 28 cdmg sounds good, but not when you have 300 cdmg post sparkle buff, making it 428/400 vs something like 282/250 or better for past & future.

The crit rate is nice and what makes it BiS, but not by much.
    Yeah I was surprised when I plugged the mono quantum team into fribbels optimizer and I only got a 7% dmg increase on Seele going from S5 planetary to S1 Sig LC. And for reference my Seele after being buffed by 3 keels and Sparkle skill is normally at 99/300 ratio with Planetary.

So I’d imagine the Sig LC is a lot stronger when your crit ratio isn’t good or your relics not fully built maximised
        Why would you post such a misleading post of course Sparkle LC is useless for you if your crit is 99%, what did you expect?
            As in the optimiser simulates all your best possible builds based off your whole relic list. And the diff between my best build without sig LC on sparkle and with was 7%.

The build with sparkle sig LC was at a much higher cdmg but both builds are simulated to be at 100% crit. However because of diminishing returns the diff is not that huge especially after you consider Sparkle’s skill will buff around 100cdmg
                Okay, with this context, it makes sense.
                    Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
Why would you think that ??. Like i see people like you always saying stuff like this. Explain bruhhh Writing 2 lines and expecting 10 lines of education 🦧😂
    i mean some character dont need their signature lightcone to be effective and thats what i call f2p friendly but some character really need to get their signature lightcone to be effective and that's what i call not f2p friendly. I mean Sparkle is harmony but she need crt. dmg and the only lightcone with crt. dmg is her lightcone other harmony lightcone feels useless to her.
jingliu is only up in s+ because of bronya. same with kafka being s+ because of black swan💀
my guy is here is feeling threatened over a male character lolol.
Casually ignores the fact that Jingliu needs Bronya to be S+ tier.
Reminder: Your "waifu" isn't real. She doesn't love you back.
Are u ignoring the waifu baits then? Occupying most of the top list, how ironic lol
it'll be stupid of Prydwen not to put IL on S+ again after Sparkle's release, when the only reason JL is still on S+ is because of Bronya. 


>DHIL needed Sparkle to be at least on her level, which doesn’t qualify him for S+.

the double standard💀
"I don't want him on top because he's a husbando bait. Oh? There are three waifu baits in S+? That's fine"

🗿
☠️☠️☠️ look at the top of the list it’s all female, give males a chance to go up smh unless ur calling all 5 of them there waifu bait as well :)
What a loser, go touch grass
Bro, You got Cook Lmao
Chill bro DHIL looks feminine so he's not strictly husbando
Why should S+ tier be limited to 1 unit? Makes no sense.
She's not even released yet, we don't know what she does.

>!Ask that question on the other subreddit!<
> There were no other Tier List changes besides adding Sparkle as we need one more day to safely test her impact on damage dealers in MoC and PF. We will update the tier list within 24 hours with her impact on others!

From Prydwen.
    So they put her on the TL without having "safely tested her impact on damage dealers"? These guys don't really help their own reputation huh.
        ... That's not what that sentence means. 

They are not moving other characters up and down until they tested everything, but Sparkle herself is S+. It seems reasonable to me, idk what you are yapping about...
            How'd you test a support character without testing their impact on the characters they're supposed to be supporting? 🤔 Seems counterintuitive.

Inb4 this is the same as when they said "Juan mains will be satisfied with our next update" and then they didn't change anything 😂
Bronya's better than Sparkle in JL and Blade teams
Why would we be in shambles?
    Because everyone is literally saying “bronya fell off, Bronya sucks, Bronya trash, even sparkle better for Jing Liu and blade now” and garbage like that 

I’m a blade Jing Liu main too btw and tired of seeing that sort of stuff
Id rather save and wait for sustain unit, Sparkle is stronger that Bronya but shes not really necessary, FX or Luocha however will make your life much more easier.
Also evil prydwen: "Cycling SP causes environmental damage, Arlan S++ tier"
    One day my boy, you will be viable, one day
        Hoping for some Enmity deck support next. Especially with tons of revives and high risk, high reward gameplay.
But SP, damage buffing, and action advance are bad things!!! Sparkle should be F tier! F for Fool!
    E. For she is Elation
Reminds me of black swan's con being dealing too much damage.
i mean she breakes Quantum QuiQui teams and and i just tested Otto+Hanabi+Tingyun+Danheng this shit goes Wild
    Was this comment written by AI?
        i guess you dont know the alternative Characters from Impact3D and Names from China/japan i dont blame you for bieng a Casual
            My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
            Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
                were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
                    He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
                        'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
Uses too much SP and buff only lasts for a character's turn which makes her less flexible, I'm guessing.
    Just to nitpick, more than "uses too much SP", I think it's better worded as "has a negative net SP generation". Since they both use SP at the same rate, but sparkle's SP rate is positive due her ultimate.
    Also she's harder to use than other amplifiers and she's mainly only for single dps teams. Sparkle is easier to use effectively, and ruan is super easy to use well and she works for dual dps.
Because she's not as good as the S+ tier units before those units arrived she's the sole S+ harmony unit.
Mostly because Bronya is too SP heavy. At E1S1 she’s a lot better.

Then she is close to Sparkle level, more like slightly inferior sidegrade
    Nah e1s1 bronya over e0s0 sparkle imo. Esp if ur playing her fast her sp gen is big also
        I would hope a 5 star at e1s1 would outperform one at e0s0...although I would add, that even then, sparkle is far more versatily. bronya only works for hypercarry.
            ? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
                No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
                    Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
                        >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                            Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
        There are a lot of limitations on Bronya’s sp gen capacity and h r compatibility with SP hungry units(even at E1S1). A good example of that is pairing her with SP heavy characters like DHIL. Her SP generation capacity is limited, why? Because you are limited to 5SP with bronya. I use an E1S1 Bronya with 161 speed. The problem with her is when she does E to an SP hungry unit like QQ and DH and consumes 3 SP. You are left with 1 sp after that and have to generate with your other units by basic attacking. With sparkle, that limitation is bypassed since your max SP is 7, plus she can ult and restore 4sp every single time. With this setup, it allows your 2 other characters on using their skills freely and/or when you are in a pinch(low health and needsHealing/bursting and needs to do debuffs etc).


No one is saying Bronya is not good. The premium 5 star is just better than her and that’s just the usual trend being followed.
            It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
    The actual review on Prydwen notes that Bronya's raw potential in a vacuum likely outweighs Sparkle (by a small amount), but she requires more investment, team tuning, and skill to reach her maximum effectiveness - whereas Sparkle in comparison is very easy to use effectively and efficiently.

I think I agree with that assessment, personally, although I haven't used Sparkle much yet. She seems very powerful and simple to use, primarily because her SP economy is just nuts so you can use her with as many SP-hungry teammates as you want. The rest of her kit is just the cherry on top, frankly.
        Wdym Bronya has more raw power. Sparkle has better buffs even if you ignore the sp difference. 100% advance forward buff vs 50% is literally the same in most teams. Bronya spamming her skill is too much sp heavy unless you play Jingliu/Blade and you have E1S1 Bronya. Ignoring those two there is not a single scenario that you would choose Bronya over Sparkle. 
            50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
Sparkle just has all round greater flexibility, her slow and fast builds work with every DPS except DoT teams, whereas Bronya's slow build is trickier to make work with DPS that aren't Jingliu/Blade (though easier with E1/S1), and Bronya is not good with follow up attackers pre-E6. 

Sparkle also functions well in dual DPS comps whereas Bronya doesn't really - and there's options there too, either as a fast buffer same as hypercarry, or in a quirky auto-attack only comp where you just go for insane SP generation over ever using her skill (I.e. if you have 2 DPS that want to skill every turn, and a support that needs to skill every few turns, like HuoHuo - auto spam Sparkle with ER rope, and ER 2pc set will be able to fuel the whole team's ridiculous SP demands - this boosts energy regen for the whole team as well, since more skills are being used).  

Her only weakness is she wants good/specific relics in terms of Speed, but hey, Bronya has the same weakness. 

She's not better than Bronya in every situation, but she definitely has more options.
Bronya is SP hungry.
    too hungry she always shout when she cast ulti.
bronya trash + boring. Everytime she use ulti she always scream like hysteric girl
Yeah not sure if sparkle will replace ruan Mei fore yet. But maybe some teams? Dunno yet.
    Ruan Mei is for Dual DPS and Sparkle for Hypercarry obv
        Ruan is for basically every team, including hypercarry. Probably gonna be used with sparkle a fair amount
        RM is amazing for everything, also hypercarry
        You forgot Ruan Mei work with dot team and Sparkles doesnt
            I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
My Fuxuan can just reset her cc sheild every turn now.
    Yeah, I liked Fu Xuan for her lack of need to spam her skill, but it was still annoying against certain cc heavy enemies. Sparkle has enabled the perpetual cc shield, which is a nice little perk I don't really see anybody else mentioning.
GuobaCertified came up with a meme Sparkle 2 turn ult, where you stack enough ER and Shared Feeling on the healer, letting you get Sparkle's Ult up every 2nd turn by just spamming basic attack. 

This means Sparkle generates 3 SP a turn (for comparison, thats ~10 times as much SP as Ruan Mei who only generates 0.33 SP a turn).

This means Sparkle by herself would be able to fund enough SP for all 3 other teammembers to spam skill EVERY TURN
    Thisbis with Huohuo yes ?
        No he didn’t count Huohuo ult energy, just meshing cogs and shared feeling lc. But you need to skill spam with your healer for shared healing and Huohuo makes the best use of the extra energy you get from skill spamming by actually buffing your team with her ult.
            That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
            Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
    Lmao what team would needs even this much skillpoint?
        Sparkle out here enable DHIL+QQ teams like a chaos elemental.
            What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
                Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
        you know with bronya... it go fast. You can look his vid, he said than Sparkle beat Pela in a team like Welt dps bronya.
        E2 DHIL.
Huohuo is better at cleansing lol. Luocha in the virtual boss events can't cleanse everyone in the team. Huohuo however bypass her freeze mechanic.
    Clearly, but thats not what the guy was trying to say lol.
        People that skipped Luocha cope extremely hard
            but the cleansing!
            Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
                E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
    She only cleanse oneat a time right? Lynx can team cleanse
        Her talent makes her always cleanse.
            Ah true
        If a CC hits your teammate and action delays or skips their turn, it will still action delay or skip their turn. If they are frozen or imprisoned, when it is their turn HuoHuo's talent will cleanse the CC and they can still act.
            Oh true. forgot about her talent
[removed]
with sparkle luocha can fuk off tbh. 

"HUo huo welcome to the team"
Calculations has been done for jingliu on the character subreddit, better to pair sparkle with other DPS
    I'll replace mei with her in FUA team, and keep mei for Jingliu
        Don't do that, ruan mei is way better for follow-up (assuming you mean topaz ratio). Keep her there and give jingliu pela and bronya
            I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
                Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
I think she will go OK with JL. But JLs best pairs are Blade and Pela. Neither of them want sp.

Maybe if we get a sp hungry Nihility in the future that could work.
Assuming you're talking about sparkle she can only have your DPS twice every other rotation. So it isn't quite as SP intensive as Bronya
    I mean, that's still 3 SP consumed in one rotation. That still intensive in a vacuum, hell that near unsustainable in the long run unless you have SP printer Luocha, potentialy with a Pela on top of that. (though i mean "in the long run" if you achieve that is not really something that happen)
        she give 7 sp limit and her ultimate is on 3 turn cool down and give 4 skill point you'll need some massive skill issue or bad luck with qingque to waste all of that.
            She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
                Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
            You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.
Rip

Another brother/sister bites the dust by the cruel hands of Yanqing :(
    I like him :(
same. e3 Yanqing now. rather have E1 Himiko.
Me too, counting down minutes.. Good luck on your pulls
    Idk if your comment gave me luck but I got sparkle on guaranteed and then I got yanging as well 😭
        I lost 50/50 😭😭😭 Happy for you tho
Apparently not that much, could just use bronya's lc for her. It only makes a difference if you're using with follow up team
    I just slapped S5DDD on her and she is already a better Bronya. I can't even imagine an S1.
        iirc over a more extended fight s5 ddd is actually close to her s1
My sparkle is e0s1 vs my bronya e1s1. Sparkle’s LC essentially gives another 55 crit value to her allies (assuming her skill is 10/10 maxed) so it could just be that. Having e0s1 Sparkle + fu xuan in any team makes all my dps have a baseline of 90/300 crit ratio after using sparkle skill
    Honestly ,You seems to have So much CD, even Dhil with his massive 151.2 % of  DMG% increase, assuming element orb,Rutilant,and musketeer, will have way more reward increasing Dmg% instead of CV at this point. Even with Sparkle Ultimate + TY ultimate he will reach only 255 % Dmg% increase. So still 50% Under 300% CD, and you're not supose to have 100% uptime on those Buffs. Therfore the diff between sig 55CV and 32% of P&F is prolly not that far in YOUR case.
E0s1 bronya has same rotation as sparkle.

Bronya needs er rope and lc to do 3 skill rotations, sparkle only needs er rope.

Bronya had energy cost of 120, sparkle has cost of 110
And hanyas
    Yeah, I might swap my hanya for sparkle, but I really want that super Acheron lol
        acheron really need 2 nihility in her team lmao. That will limit your freedom. Thats why i will skip her
            Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
            I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
                you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
                    Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
is Tingyun better then E6 Yukong?
    They do different things. Tingyun will be in more or less every DHIL team comp though, so it's not really worth thinking about.
        True, but using fribbeles i noticed that Yukong gives a bigger boost. The energy regeneration of Tingyun is op, but getting 20k or more from Yukong is pretty good. Anyway I think i will stick to Tingyun so I can play in auto ahahah
            Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
    I think you're comparing the wrong members of his team comp. When I got E6 Yukong I took out Pela and ran Tingyun and Yukong. Now I'm going to run Tingyun and Sparkle.
No thoughts, just skill your DPS. No need to weave basic attacks unless you mismanage your skill points.

And even if you need to basic attack, it's typically once a fight, considering how long they last.
    lmao no, thats only happen with hyperspeed sparkle or if team consist alot of sp positive chars
    bruh if u need to basic attack with bronya and cant skill spam, you either have a skill issue or team building issue. Like why u making the team so sp negative. use a pela or smth
        Yeah, a skill point issue, which Sparkle doesn't have, thank you for proving the point.

You can just constantly skill with Sparkle and still be a point positive.
            why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
                because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
                    So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
                        no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                            You are absolutely right about that XD
                        I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
        Do you think only one team comp exists or something?
            Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
                omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
                    But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
    It feels like she would still benefit from some spd tuning and weaving to get the Max out of her. I saw one streamer using her each turn to speed up his dps by about 10.
        If it only moves it up by 10, he is misusing her. Either the DPS has no skillpoints or is faster than Sparkle. So yes, some speedtuning is needed but far less than Bronya.
        the tldr is, as long as Sparkle is faster, but not more than 2x, she'll always push DPS to top. i.e  100spd dps and 100-200spd Sparkle work perfectly. Assuming no enemy pushes the DPS back before Sparkle's turn.     
   
Slow Sparkle also works, but instead of getting the DPS a turn every time, the build is focuses on maximising the value of the 50%aa. Where Fast Sparkle will realistically boost the dps only like 30-40%, slow Sparkle will always make use of the full 50%.    
    
For full explanation you can google "hsr action value guide", it's surprisingly simple how it works.
You spam skill every rotation and still come out with +1 sp every 3 turns while bronya needs e1 s1 in 3 turns to break even which too is rng so you might be at -2 and -3 at e0 s0 

Also with extra sp your supports can spam more skill for more energy and more skills so not only sparkle but the entire team feels wayyyyyy smoother
SP + easier speed tuning. For bronya( unless e2 but e2 bronya is a monster) you generally want her at -1 speed but with sparkle you can just make her gigafast while focusing only on offensive stats on your carry( no speed only ark and crit)
    Better ask here as it seems relevant to the conversation. I have E2S1 Bronya, so how should I gear my DPS to make the most out of the Spd buff from E2? I'm still running the -1 Spd thing with Jingliu but I feel that's wasting the Spd buff. Is the build for E2 hyperspeed Bronya?
        The most "perfect" scenario is for Bronya to be 29 speed faster than your DPS so that when she advances them, they will get 1 advanced turn and then 1 regular turn right before Bronya (and repeat). If your Bronya is 134 spd and your dps is 135ish then you can just take off speed boots and this concept will still apply.

Basically E2 Bronya just makes slow bronya even better because you can drop speed boots (or substats) on your dps. If you play Bronya hyperspeed (160+) and you don't skill > auto > repeat, then the E2 is not noticeable tbh.
            Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
Everything other commenters said + she actually enables FUA users (like Jing Yuan, Topaz, Ratio) better since her buffs last until the unit's next turn. So she can fit in better in those teams. You can also ult out of turn while still buffed.
aight thx
To be fair QQ is too high as S pre-Sparkle.
    yeah she'll probably stay the same.
    They could have a caveat to her little "RNG" dice 

>If used with Sparkle - significantly less praying required
        Nah you still wanna pray for bad rolls until you get full buffs. Yeah... Qingque RNG is rather punishing quick rolls
        Sparkle only get her 1 SP every 3 turns unless you do basic spam. praying still exists.

    My QQ outperforming BS and Kafka in the previous MOC 12 second half with meh could be better stats. I think it’s deserved.
        What? For real? I use both team and BS Kafka is overwhelmingly stronger.
            On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
                No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
                    wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
                        All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                            hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
                    Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
        except the last moc 12 had both 40% lightning and wind resist on both halves
        Bro these fuckers are downvoting you cause they think you trash talked their dear black swan. Smh I hate these kids
    I'd personally rate Qingque actually at the tier of current Imbib without sparkle, or maybe she could actually have the performance of an Imbib without Sparkle, but Qingque without Sparkle even on E6 is not that great, Sparkle is just straight up broken.
Not necessarily IMO, DanIL at E2+ basically guarantees that you can have a fully positive SP rotation once every other turn, it practically opens up alot for his team-building as his biggest flaw was dependancy on SP for big dmg. 

With Sparkle, DanIL + SW is now a viable strategy, DanIL + a sub DPS is a viable strategy, DanIL + Bronya + Sparkle is also a viable strategy. It opens up DanIL teambuilding and overall gives alot of flexibility for him, which i think is huge. But this is also assuming people have him at E2, which is a tall ask.
So those with DHIL E2 doesnt need sparkle ?
    Well, the buff is still there, just not a huge one.
I dont have ruan but I thought she just applies her own weakness break outside/in correlation, the usual break effect.  Something welt also was doing  on demand when casting ultimate. He force imprisons enemies

> When these enemies attempt to recover from Weakness Break, Thanatoplum Rebloom is triggered, extending the duration of their Weakness Break, delaying their action by an amount equal to 20% of Ruan Mei's Break Effect plus 10%, and dealing Break DMG equal to 30%—54% of Ruan Mei's Ice Break DMG.


Edit: I love being downvoted for literally mentioning the idea is pre-existing and not anything "new". Imagine if I also said that kafka isn't the first to front-load dots as sampo e4 is a mini kafka for wind dots. Kafka didn't break any "rule", it just made it proper and work for all dots.
Quantum: All girls, all gas, some gremlins.
    I know it's an unpopular opinion but I kinda want it to stay that way lol.
Nah lightning is the best element. Lightning got the hottest women. Kafka, Tingyun, Jing Yuan and Acheron, do I need to say more
Silver "single target only" wolf
How are DEF shred on ult and 3 different debuffs on basic attack mid? SW offers value each and every turn.
    Ult charges too long and ST and debuffs on basic are barely do anything. Pela is just miles better
    Opportunity cost. Just because something offers value on every turn it doesn't mean it can't be bad or mid. While her passive and ulti shred are not bad, they arent anything crazy either. ,they are single target and need time to stack. Almost every harmony would be a better option than sw without her weakness mechanic, especially if the dps is capable of aoe/blast dmg.


That being said I don't get the point of talking with "ifs". That's core part of her kit. No point judging a kit in parts. You judge it as a whole.

Edit: forgot that the majority of players here can only feel'scraft. No one would ever play sw if she didn't have her main mechanic. You guys really are meta ignorant if you think she would be good support compared to the rest options
it won't change anything, but it is nerve wracking wondering how your pulls will go
    Sounds like a gambling problem there bud lol.  But let me help you….I’m sending you some of my luck and positive energy, to a fellow NA server dweller.  I hope your pulls are short and 50/50 is won today.
I think it gives a little less time to complete old MoC with her? If you were unable to play this weekend that's a lot of time lost. But barely anyone should be actually affected by the roll out, especially since there shouldn't be much story to spoil in thumbnails being released.
    You don't lose those hours because the old MoC ends at NA server times anyways.
Yeah, basically teams with any SP/spam issues, or that don't synergize well from the beginning due to 1 turn buff unless E6.

I forgot Bronya cleanse too, for the few times it clutched my SU run or MoC.
    Wait, Bronya can cleanse? So I don't have to try using Lynx in my Bronya team??
        Her skill cleanse (only the advanced forward ally, ie your carry most probably). Unlike Lynx who have AoE cleanse if my memory is good.
            Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!
        If you aren't afraid of Bronya herself being CC'd sure
            just gotta pump up that effect res
I mean, for Balde and Jingliu you can run both if you want to. Easier to do on Blade, but it can work on Jingliu as well with a little more effort.
You know how this community works, overhype and then they come back to their senses, however this shows how Star Rail has direct powercreep as we just saw with sparkle on top of the bronya
Yea, JL benefits more from DMG bonus that Bronya provides than CrtDmg of Sparkle. Also Bronya provides cleanse.
    Bronya is supposed to move after JL to double her turn so her cleanse loses a lot of value.  

Other than that yeah this combo with defo stay for the time being
Considering how much JL also likes RM, I am not sure she is so against crazy ass woman
    I don't think Ruan Mei is crazy in the traditional sense.

A bit autistic (due to having trouble understanding emotions) and laser focused on her research goals but not crazy.
Prydwen's tier list is stated to be based on e0 5 stars, e6 4 stars and is agnostic to the current endgame layout. Prydwen in the update notes have said Black Swan is S+ for Pure Fiction because of testing of her in the old Pure Fiction, not just because there is a DoT cacophony right now.
    Did that change? I thought they based it all on the current moc/pf?
        It did change to that method yeah. It's been ignoring layout at least since Pure Fiction was added and treating 5 stars as e0 (and 4 stars as e6) at least since Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae dropped from S+.
>What does it matter if he's S or S+ in a tier list that constantly changes every MoC or PF.

Because that's their job. And it also Stop the argument about Dhil is behind JL.
    I thought that JL was only ahead because everything had ice weakness.
Bruh who else could they mean other than Imbibitor Lunae aka 5 star Dan Heng?? Isn't that obvious?
Its the twice per patch HSR PvP event, of course its getting posted.

            Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects . The difference is way too big to ignore . I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants
                >Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects .

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

Yeah Fr huohuo can pretty much render any debuff heavy fight a breeze. And is a lot stronger in Situations where FX may get overwhelmed by stuff like true stings wind shear or Fem Auramaton’s stuns.

That being said FX can still bruteforce through everything if you built her well, I’ve even brought lvl 60 supports with me to MoC 12 without maxed relics and they still survive due to FX insane mitigation.
    Pretty much the only place my FX has struggled has been Gold and Gears where her tanking the entire team’s damage just straight up 1 shot her at higher difficulties lol.

For all normal content + PF + MoC, she’s a god.

HH is still my preferred sustain character though just because I like her as a character more lol.
She's sp neutral so it slightly holds back her. Same with Luocha. He's S tier only because he's sp positive.
    She's a bit more than that if you are going for low cycles. You don't worry about healing as much and take hits on the chin. I'll at Max skill twice but hope for one and just evade a debuff while it's still up. 

Where she shines is turboing ults at the start while also having buffs. 

You can run setups with fine fruit (legit one of her best cones) to get everyone including herself at a starting ult level. This is especially nuts if you managed to pull Ruan Mei cone but it's not necessary. It lets you start off with with a huge burst phase out the gate and put her a skill and auto away from her own ult so you are ready going into wave 2 with her skill still going. 

I have e1 Fu Xuan and E0 Huohuo and I end up taking Huohuo more while Fu has been slowly getting benched more and more. Her SP is usually about the equivalent of Fu's starting rotation of...

Auto -) take some hits -) Skill and then hopefully you are in a position where you can auto the rest of use one more skill
Fr. Duo battery TY+HH carrying my ass to get ult frequently, because most of dmg dealers relies alot on their ult. 

FX is good. But lately, I've been using Huohuo more than FX.
Currently DHIL outpreforms her by 16-18%, so no she's not.
Lmao what? Look at the fucking calcs bro, IL's best team with sparkle already humiliates Jingliu's best team in a neutral wave.

People act like Jingliu is some god unit when she is only good cuz Bronya exists, but now IL has his own Bronya so she gets dusted
    Damage doesn't tell the whole story. Hu Tao does considerably more damage than Neuvillette yet most people put him a tier higher. Jingliu using 0.4 sp a cycle just makes her much better and more future-proof.

The second they release another sp negative support, and use that as justification to power creep existing options, it will be even more obvious she is just a busted unit.
        goofy ahh simp💀 no DPS is futureproof bruh and calcs were already out, IL/TY/Sparkle/Huohuo is out damaging a team consisting of JL/Bronya/Ruan Mei/Huohuo, and there are gameplays as well already so if you still think she's better, you need to get your eyes checked.

and how does Hu Tao and Neuvillette correlate with the topic anyway? Hu Tao's a nuker while Neuv's a pew pew typa dealer; it would've made more sense if you compare Al-Haitham and Neuvillette.
        Tf is this logic? They can also release another sp generator that is more busted you know? Just because she is sp negative doesn't make her future proof cuz IL's sp problems can easily be fixed by using a brain on making team comps. 

And Sparkle existing already fixes his sp problem anyways so even if they release another sp negative support it wont matter at all since Sparkle mitigate the sp consumption.
            Uneducated people grossly overestimate how much SP she generates. She front-loads it, but Tingyun and Ruan Generate more SP. Her main benefit is not being an SP sync like Bronya while also enabling AV. A strong, sp negative support is the obvious progression. People undervalue SP and the tier list will continue to reflect the opinion of people who aren't reactionary and have functional brains.
                More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
                    They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
                        >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
                            The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
                    Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
                        the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
                        JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
Yep. 100% a buff for Argenti. RM however is way better as a generalist for PF.
Couldn't you run one on each side? Maxxing out the points is very difficult so I don't see why you wouldn't need two supports
Tbh Dual DPS have Ruan Mei.. do they need sparkle really? Ruan Mei herself is SP positive already.. with the fact that she will always be 1+ like Sparkle Rotations(Unless you don’t use her skill every turn which is dumb) and in start of the battle 2+(since her skill is triggered).. 

Unless you are gonna replace the sustain.. you would more likely to use Ruan Mei in Duo DPS then Sparkle..
    There’s only one ruan Mei and 2 sides
        4 dps's?!?!?!??!
            Not the first time for PF. We already have Herta + Himeko on one side with Kafka + Black Swan on the other being one of the most meta picks.
            Not unheard of… I’ve done Jingliu herta and Jingyuan Himeko for PF before
            I play dual dps all the time between Jingliu Blade, Ratio Topaz and the DoT ladies so it's not unheard of

And everywhere including MoC so I would very much appreciate another Ruan Mei lol
Eh.... I think there's a gap between RM and Sparkle in PF as a dual dps support. In MOC, they're about equal. But Ruan mei in a dual dps comp in pf, is much better for breaking and overall team damage.

So she's an S tier support their, because you can do dual dps with her, but she's not on RM's level in pf specifically.
I don't care enough for that, but good to know my assumption was correct.

 The update will be a hot topic around here for sure.
Don't forget her crit rate buff
    I don't have her man. I don't know. But from how much I read. She can Heal, She Can Reduce damage taken, She can deal decent Damage, gives Eff Res. She is Already like SSS tier sustain.
Idk, a fully built Topaz using elation path just dominates any of the Simulated Universes, especially with Ratio
No, but Gachasmack looked at their tier list somewhat recently, saw one in each category and assumed that was the rule, and now his simps treat that like gospel.
I am very sure they do. Not to mention that you cant play without it.
Are you telling me that e4 pela with 12% ice res and 40% def down is better than e0 RM with 68% dmg, 50% break efficiency, 25% all type res pen on top of giving everyone essentially 10 spd?


That's kind of a ridiculous comparison.


Literally anyone can make full use of her kit, from hypercarry to dual dps to even dot.
>There are many situations where even pela beats her.

Eh? Wasn't that disproven?

Anyways, the point isn't that she's BiS on every team, it's that she's universal and enables so many comps, strats, and builds. Besides her massive damage buffs:

- She enables dual DPS.
- Her break efficiency enables break teams and pseudo-sustain, and makes sustainless so much more accessible.
- Her speed buffing allows characters to hit the 134 breakpoint often with just speed boots, or plus 1-2 rolls into speed.

Bronya is strictly for hypercarries and severely restricts the teammates you can use.

Sparkle is mostly for hypercarry, but is significantly more flexible with teammates and, besides mono-Quantum, allows every DPS she's paired with to use ATK or HP boots. Her buff is also flat out better for FUA characters.

She is not universal like RM, doesn't enable as much, and doesn't create as much flexibility RM does.

Tingyun with Dance^3 specifically is crazy, yeah. She's definitely Sparkle tier.
She is better in DHIL, Seele, QQ, JY, Ratio, Topaz and Argenti teams
definitely yes on both each (unless you're running them both)
    Jingliu main sub recommend bronya over sparkle though after calculation is done on their end
        please show the calc, otherwise cap (and have they consider bronya as the other support on top of sparkle)
            Yeah someone did the calcs.. It is her worst team(even worse than Pela+Mei) From Jingliu mains.

https://preview.redd.it/frhhnm5z4hlc1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09d5be06e5c2aeca2f9855923507aa01b4bee96
                SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
                    Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
    Bronya is still better for Jingliu, Blade and Jingliu + Blade. That's what CN bros had been cooking. These 2 have enough self buffs to keep going for another turn without needing any setups beyond that.

Oh and they both don't really need the extra SP.
    No, Bronya is definitively better for both Blade and Jingliu.
They go into this on the guide, but basically in terms of pure buff numbers, an E0S0 Bronya is better than an E0S0 Sparkle unless you're using a Quantum DPS, and their main points are that Sparkle has a better floor and is just generally easier to use, as well as benefitting FUA units (Dr. Ratio, Jing Yuan, Clara) which Bronya can't do until E6.

Also, for Blade and Jingliu, Bronya is pretty much always better (I remember the Jingliu sub doing some calcs on it before and Sparkle only outdoes Bronya at E2, and only by 0.02%).

So it's not so much Sparkle being universally better, as Bronya is still very good and better than Sparkle for several characters, but that Sparkle just has a better floor that's easier to work with, similar to why they have Ruan Mei in S+ as well.
    As someone who doesn't have blade or JL, what's the high level reasoning for this? Is this related to the fact they don't really use SP at all (compared to other DPS options) so you'd just have too many level over SP? Or is this related to the characters having high CDMG baked into kit so the extra DMG Bronya provides would scale better?

edit: and for blade the attack from trace is worthless
        Both of those are correct.
        and also it's 100% action advance, you can always spam Bronya's skill with them it speeds up their damage by a lot
        It's pretty much this: sparkle is best when you go 160+ speed sparkle, 200+ cd and your DPS you use is going to use attack boots(hp boots for blade) and sits at 100ish speed, this makes sparkle give like 50% more overall turns to your DPS, 15-45%  atk (based on mono quantum) and +43% because they can use attack boots instead of speed, 48(or 80 if bronya cone/past and future), inc damage for 2turns on 3t ult (18 otherwise), and 110ish crit damage while sp positive

Bronya is best (assuning the following doesn't burn out sp) when you go 134-140 speed and 1 speed slower than your DPS, so your DPS acts, bronya acts, and then your DPS immediately acts again, giving your DPS 100% more turns than normal, 100ish increase damage on the 2nd turn (past and future or sig cone, major trace), and 55% attack with 55-70% inc crit damage for 2 turns on a 3t ult(3t with sig cone).

For jing liu, she has so much crit value built in that it is easy to hit something like 50/200-240 whereas she only 60%ish increased damage if using fall of an aeon, or 105ish if using her signature/s5 secret vow. She will also have roughly 220ish increased attack from her talent giving 180, and 43 from rope. So what she lacks most of is speed and increased damage, both of which bronya gives more of than sparkle, at the cost of being sp negative. Even if using Ruan mei +bronya+jing liu, she'd at most have 183% inc damage, which is still less than the 260-300 inc crit damage she could have while under bronya Ult. Jing and bronya + a 3rd sp positive support just match perfectly currently.
Because only characters who don’t use SP every turn can maximise Bronya. It’s impossible to sustain -1 Bronya with a dps that uses SP every turn
Bronya buffs are stronger on paper however she's -3SP per rotation which make her not optimal for the averange team

Sparkle is better than Bronya for the FUA characters in every scenario since Bronya can't buff FUA
Also Sparkle>Bronya for mono quantum
For most carries it doesn't matter at all since Sparkle won't have over double their speed.
She mostly invalidates Fastya/hyperspeed Bronya, which is the most common set up for non-Blade/JL due to SP costs. 

There are still a few other setups besides traditional Slowya Bronya can do (Slowya with DPS using 1 basic for SP, 170 spd Bronya using 1 basic to come up behind a 100 SPD DPS), but these are a bit more niche set-ups that not everyone will take the time to tune, with some fairly restrictive drawbacks as well. Bronya E1 also helps make her more competitive in all scenarios, and E2 in some niche ones (eg Bronya + RM allowing DPS to be 134 SPD with only a few SPD subs) but not everyone will get her there.
There honestly aren't very many limited DPSs that make full use of Bronya's 100% advance, it's really just Blade and Jingliu.

Everyone else either does not rely much on basic/skill damage (instead relying on ults or summons), relies too much on follow-ups, has too much turn manipulation for Bronya to keep up with, uses too many skill points, or some combination of the above.

Note that Sparkle's skill buffs out of turn follow-up damage while Bronya's does not.

Sparkle is a DPS increase (generally significant but not always) for DHIL, QQ, Seele, JY, Ratio, Topaz, and Argenti.

Bronya is still better for JL and Blade.

Prydwen didn't rank her high just for her ease of use, she wouldn't be S+ unless her damage amp was outright better for many chars. This is shown in calcs too.
The 50% really doesn't matter as long as you hit 160 speed. And she just gives more multipliers in CDMG and atk (and this isn't mentioning her SP generation NOR her extra steroids for mono quantum)

But you also just use both for silly hypercarry scenarios such as using them together with blade and they both just keep action advancing him forward.
    She only gives 15% atk permanent to everyone who isn't quantum while bronya gives 55% atk to everyone on ulti regardless of element

Sparkle give lots of cdmg while bronya give lots of dmg bonus

Spd reduction debuff by enemy is impactful even for 160 sparkle

Both are similar but work with different characters so there really isn't "sparkle is better than bronya or bronya is better than sparkle" 

Sparkle can't replace Bronya from JL or blade team while Bronya can't replace Sparkle from qq, dhil and jy
        Check some Sparkle/Bronya/Blade setups. I'm saying that you use her with bronya for blade lol Also you're missing the damage buff sparkle gives with her talent,  which gives a damage boost team wide for every SP used. 


Really the thing that boosts Sparkle over is that her buffs have easy more consistent up time.  It's pretty much permanent and also usable for stuff like lightning lord. 
            Sparkle gives 18% dmg bonus while Bronya give 10% dmg bonus as trace permanent

Bronya with signature LC can also 3T ulti just like Sparkle..... really don't understand when does Bronya have inconsistent buff uptime? The only thing she can't do is buff FUA with her skill

Also only FUA benefit from extended buff from sparkle while character itself loose it when they take 2nd turn

At 200% cdmg for non-quantum

Bronya - 96% dmg (skill) + 10% dmg (permanent) + 55% atk (2 turns) + 52% cdmg (2 turn)

Sparkle - 93% cdmg (skill) + 15% atk (permanent) + 18% dmg (permanent) + 30% dmg (2-3 turn)

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?
                Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
                    I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
            You know that using double harmony has diminishing returns, right? Harmony + nihility would be much much better.
    The 50% does matter, since your only build is going for 160 speed and pulling the dps to that speed. Slow Bronya at 134 speed allows you to give your dps 2 turns, meaning it becomes roughly equivalent to 268 speed. The first attack of your dps will be unbuffed, but in the end it's still an extra turn. For units that care more about the number of attacks, this is especially important.
    160spd on her or the dps?
        On her.
More of a match to slightly better than Bronya at Bronya's best (i.e. -1 speed from your main DPS/speed-tuned). In a mono-quantum party Sparkle's unequivocally the better of the two. Sparkle's buffs are also easier to keep up and are more versatile.

* Sparkle's buff actually can affect DoT and FuA characters who get the bulk of their damage out of their turn. 
* She's SP positive even when she's using her skill non-stop, whereas Bronya doing the same requires both her E1, sig 5\* LC, and alot of RNG to do the same.
* There's less impetus to speed-tune Sparkle because her 50% turn advance means there's alot less wasted turn advancing on her compared to Bronya.
* She gets the same amount of energy normal attacking as with using her skill because of her traces. This means you can truly amass SP for the two characters we currently have that guzzle them down (QQ and DHIL).
    When did dot characters started using cdmg?
Wich is super false, you can get around RNG by facing qunetem enemies, or have sup charchter that match the cprispondng enemy wekense Type so the wekense will alawys be for your main Dps
And even if you don't do that her skill debuff still  aplly all res anayws
    and that right there is why she's S and not S+

her skill is RNG and in order to make it not RNG, you need to work around it and like I said, the only way you can get the guaranteed is either mono quantum or as you said, fight an enemy with quantum weakness while matching allies

also while her All Res shred is really good, a weakness break is infinitely better due to the action pushback, damage reduction removed, and the potential break damage
I mean treu she ain't no match for 5 star harmony character, but until somone else in future will have her mechanic to aplly wekense Type or change it, she will still  be S+ in her own tier for me
Bruhh this is so funny 🤣 . My guy said everything wrong like i am 100% sure that either you don't have sw or never knew how to use her(too complex for you)
    Feel free to explain how to properly use her and what makes her so complex
        I was trolling but how long do you want the explanation 🤔?
    I have her and legit almost never use her because Pela is just better overall. She is super over rated and is mostly there for mono-quantum enjoyers.
        Skill issue bruh . Remember this is a turn based rpg . You can literally win fights you are not supposed to win before entering the fights .  I don't want to write a 1000 words essay because nobody cares but you do what you are doing with your shallow approach to sw 😬
Yeah I was surprised when I plugged the mono quantum team into fribbels optimizer and I only got a 7% dmg increase on Seele going from S5 planetary to S1 Sig LC. And for reference my Seele after being buffed by 3 keels and Sparkle skill is normally at 99/300 ratio with Planetary.

So I’d imagine the Sig LC is a lot stronger when your crit ratio isn’t good or your relics not fully built maximised
    Why would you post such a misleading post of course Sparkle LC is useless for you if your crit is 99%, what did you expect?
        As in the optimiser simulates all your best possible builds based off your whole relic list. And the diff between my best build without sig LC on sparkle and with was 7%.

The build with sparkle sig LC was at a much higher cdmg but both builds are simulated to be at 100% crit. However because of diminishing returns the diff is not that huge especially after you consider Sparkle’s skill will buff around 100cdmg
            Okay, with this context, it makes sense.
                Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
i mean some character dont need their signature lightcone to be effective and thats what i call f2p friendly but some character really need to get their signature lightcone to be effective and that's what i call not f2p friendly. I mean Sparkle is harmony but she need crt. dmg and the only lightcone with crt. dmg is her lightcone other harmony lightcone feels useless to her.
So they put her on the TL without having "safely tested her impact on damage dealers"? These guys don't really help their own reputation huh.
    ... That's not what that sentence means. 

They are not moving other characters up and down until they tested everything, but Sparkle herself is S+. It seems reasonable to me, idk what you are yapping about...
        How'd you test a support character without testing their impact on the characters they're supposed to be supporting? 🤔 Seems counterintuitive.

Inb4 this is the same as when they said "Juan mains will be satisfied with our next update" and then they didn't change anything 😂
Because everyone is literally saying “bronya fell off, Bronya sucks, Bronya trash, even sparkle better for Jing Liu and blade now” and garbage like that 

I’m a blade Jing Liu main too btw and tired of seeing that sort of stuff
One day my boy, you will be viable, one day
    Hoping for some Enmity deck support next. Especially with tons of revives and high risk, high reward gameplay.
E. For she is Elation
Was this comment written by AI?
    i guess you dont know the alternative Characters from Impact3D and Names from China/japan i dont blame you for bieng a Casual
        My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
        Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
            were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
                He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
                    'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
Just to nitpick, more than "uses too much SP", I think it's better worded as "has a negative net SP generation". Since they both use SP at the same rate, but sparkle's SP rate is positive due her ultimate.
Also she's harder to use than other amplifiers and she's mainly only for single dps teams. Sparkle is easier to use effectively, and ruan is super easy to use well and she works for dual dps.
Nah e1s1 bronya over e0s0 sparkle imo. Esp if ur playing her fast her sp gen is big also
    I would hope a 5 star at e1s1 would outperform one at e0s0...although I would add, that even then, sparkle is far more versatily. bronya only works for hypercarry.
        ? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
            No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
                Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
                    >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                        Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
    There are a lot of limitations on Bronya’s sp gen capacity and h r compatibility with SP hungry units(even at E1S1). A good example of that is pairing her with SP heavy characters like DHIL. Her SP generation capacity is limited, why? Because you are limited to 5SP with bronya. I use an E1S1 Bronya with 161 speed. The problem with her is when she does E to an SP hungry unit like QQ and DH and consumes 3 SP. You are left with 1 sp after that and have to generate with your other units by basic attacking. With sparkle, that limitation is bypassed since your max SP is 7, plus she can ult and restore 4sp every single time. With this setup, it allows your 2 other characters on using their skills freely and/or when you are in a pinch(low health and needsHealing/bursting and needs to do debuffs etc).


No one is saying Bronya is not good. The premium 5 star is just better than her and that’s just the usual trend being followed.
        It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
The actual review on Prydwen notes that Bronya's raw potential in a vacuum likely outweighs Sparkle (by a small amount), but she requires more investment, team tuning, and skill to reach her maximum effectiveness - whereas Sparkle in comparison is very easy to use effectively and efficiently.

I think I agree with that assessment, personally, although I haven't used Sparkle much yet. She seems very powerful and simple to use, primarily because her SP economy is just nuts so you can use her with as many SP-hungry teammates as you want. The rest of her kit is just the cherry on top, frankly.
    Wdym Bronya has more raw power. Sparkle has better buffs even if you ignore the sp difference. 100% advance forward buff vs 50% is literally the same in most teams. Bronya spamming her skill is too much sp heavy unless you play Jingliu/Blade and you have E1S1 Bronya. Ignoring those two there is not a single scenario that you would choose Bronya over Sparkle. 
        50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
too hungry she always shout when she cast ulti.
Ruan Mei is for Dual DPS and Sparkle for Hypercarry obv
    Ruan is for basically every team, including hypercarry. Probably gonna be used with sparkle a fair amount
    RM is amazing for everything, also hypercarry
    You forgot Ruan Mei work with dot team and Sparkles doesnt
        I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
Yeah, I liked Fu Xuan for her lack of need to spam her skill, but it was still annoying against certain cc heavy enemies. Sparkle has enabled the perpetual cc shield, which is a nice little perk I don't really see anybody else mentioning.
Thisbis with Huohuo yes ?
    No he didn’t count Huohuo ult energy, just meshing cogs and shared feeling lc. But you need to skill spam with your healer for shared healing and Huohuo makes the best use of the extra energy you get from skill spamming by actually buffing your team with her ult.
        That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
        Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
Lmao what team would needs even this much skillpoint?
    Sparkle out here enable DHIL+QQ teams like a chaos elemental.
        What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
            Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
    you know with bronya... it go fast. You can look his vid, he said than Sparkle beat Pela in a team like Welt dps bronya.
    E2 DHIL.
Clearly, but thats not what the guy was trying to say lol.
    People that skipped Luocha cope extremely hard
        but the cleansing!
        Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
            E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
She only cleanse oneat a time right? Lynx can team cleanse
    Her talent makes her always cleanse.
        Ah true
    If a CC hits your teammate and action delays or skips their turn, it will still action delay or skip their turn. If they are frozen or imprisoned, when it is their turn HuoHuo's talent will cleanse the CC and they can still act.
        Oh true. forgot about her talent
I'll replace mei with her in FUA team, and keep mei for Jingliu
    Don't do that, ruan mei is way better for follow-up (assuming you mean topaz ratio). Keep her there and give jingliu pela and bronya
        I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
            Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
I mean, that's still 3 SP consumed in one rotation. That still intensive in a vacuum, hell that near unsustainable in the long run unless you have SP printer Luocha, potentialy with a Pela on top of that. (though i mean "in the long run" if you achieve that is not really something that happen)
    she give 7 sp limit and her ultimate is on 3 turn cool down and give 4 skill point you'll need some massive skill issue or bad luck with qingque to waste all of that.
        She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
            Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
        You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.
I like him :(
Idk if your comment gave me luck but I got sparkle on guaranteed and then I got yanging as well 😭
    I lost 50/50 😭😭😭 Happy for you tho
I just slapped S5DDD on her and she is already a better Bronya. I can't even imagine an S1.
    iirc over a more extended fight s5 ddd is actually close to her s1
Honestly ,You seems to have So much CD, even Dhil with his massive 151.2 % of  DMG% increase, assuming element orb,Rutilant,and musketeer, will have way more reward increasing Dmg% instead of CV at this point. Even with Sparkle Ultimate + TY ultimate he will reach only 255 % Dmg% increase. So still 50% Under 300% CD, and you're not supose to have 100% uptime on those Buffs. Therfore the diff between sig 55CV and 32% of P&F is prolly not that far in YOUR case.
Yeah, I might swap my hanya for sparkle, but I really want that super Acheron lol
    acheron really need 2 nihility in her team lmao. That will limit your freedom. Thats why i will skip her
        Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
        I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
            you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
                Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
They do different things. Tingyun will be in more or less every DHIL team comp though, so it's not really worth thinking about.
    True, but using fribbeles i noticed that Yukong gives a bigger boost. The energy regeneration of Tingyun is op, but getting 20k or more from Yukong is pretty good. Anyway I think i will stick to Tingyun so I can play in auto ahahah
        Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
I think you're comparing the wrong members of his team comp. When I got E6 Yukong I took out Pela and ran Tingyun and Yukong. Now I'm going to run Tingyun and Sparkle.
lmao no, thats only happen with hyperspeed sparkle or if team consist alot of sp positive chars
bruh if u need to basic attack with bronya and cant skill spam, you either have a skill issue or team building issue. Like why u making the team so sp negative. use a pela or smth
    Yeah, a skill point issue, which Sparkle doesn't have, thank you for proving the point.

You can just constantly skill with Sparkle and still be a point positive.
        why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
            because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
                So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
                    no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                        You are absolutely right about that XD
                    I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
    Do you think only one team comp exists or something?
        Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
            omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
                But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
It feels like she would still benefit from some spd tuning and weaving to get the Max out of her. I saw one streamer using her each turn to speed up his dps by about 10.
    If it only moves it up by 10, he is misusing her. Either the DPS has no skillpoints or is faster than Sparkle. So yes, some speedtuning is needed but far less than Bronya.
    the tldr is, as long as Sparkle is faster, but not more than 2x, she'll always push DPS to top. i.e  100spd dps and 100-200spd Sparkle work perfectly. Assuming no enemy pushes the DPS back before Sparkle's turn.     
   
Slow Sparkle also works, but instead of getting the DPS a turn every time, the build is focuses on maximising the value of the 50%aa. Where Fast Sparkle will realistically boost the dps only like 30-40%, slow Sparkle will always make use of the full 50%.    
    
For full explanation you can google "hsr action value guide", it's surprisingly simple how it works.
Better ask here as it seems relevant to the conversation. I have E2S1 Bronya, so how should I gear my DPS to make the most out of the Spd buff from E2? I'm still running the -1 Spd thing with Jingliu but I feel that's wasting the Spd buff. Is the build for E2 hyperspeed Bronya?
    The most "perfect" scenario is for Bronya to be 29 speed faster than your DPS so that when she advances them, they will get 1 advanced turn and then 1 regular turn right before Bronya (and repeat). If your Bronya is 134 spd and your dps is 135ish then you can just take off speed boots and this concept will still apply.

Basically E2 Bronya just makes slow bronya even better because you can drop speed boots (or substats) on your dps. If you play Bronya hyperspeed (160+) and you don't skill > auto > repeat, then the E2 is not noticeable tbh.
        Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
yeah she'll probably stay the same.
They could have a caveat to her little "RNG" dice 

>If used with Sparkle - significantly less praying required
    Nah you still wanna pray for bad rolls until you get full buffs. Yeah... Qingque RNG is rather punishing quick rolls
    Sparkle only get her 1 SP every 3 turns unless you do basic spam. praying still exists.

My QQ outperforming BS and Kafka in the previous MOC 12 second half with meh could be better stats. I think it’s deserved.
    What? For real? I use both team and BS Kafka is overwhelmingly stronger.
        On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
            No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
                wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
                    All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                        hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
                Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
    except the last moc 12 had both 40% lightning and wind resist on both halves
    Bro these fuckers are downvoting you cause they think you trash talked their dear black swan. Smh I hate these kids
I'd personally rate Qingque actually at the tier of current Imbib without sparkle, or maybe she could actually have the performance of an Imbib without Sparkle, but Qingque without Sparkle even on E6 is not that great, Sparkle is just straight up broken.
Well, the buff is still there, just not a huge one.
I know it's an unpopular opinion but I kinda want it to stay that way lol.
Ult charges too long and ST and debuffs on basic are barely do anything. Pela is just miles better
Opportunity cost. Just because something offers value on every turn it doesn't mean it can't be bad or mid. While her passive and ulti shred are not bad, they arent anything crazy either. ,they are single target and need time to stack. Almost every harmony would be a better option than sw without her weakness mechanic, especially if the dps is capable of aoe/blast dmg.


That being said I don't get the point of talking with "ifs". That's core part of her kit. No point judging a kit in parts. You judge it as a whole.

Edit: forgot that the majority of players here can only feel'scraft. No one would ever play sw if she didn't have her main mechanic. You guys really are meta ignorant if you think she would be good support compared to the rest options
Sounds like a gambling problem there bud lol.  But let me help you….I’m sending you some of my luck and positive energy, to a fellow NA server dweller.  I hope your pulls are short and 50/50 is won today.
You don't lose those hours because the old MoC ends at NA server times anyways.
Wait, Bronya can cleanse? So I don't have to try using Lynx in my Bronya team??
    Her skill cleanse (only the advanced forward ally, ie your carry most probably). Unlike Lynx who have AoE cleanse if my memory is good.
        Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!
    If you aren't afraid of Bronya herself being CC'd sure
        just gotta pump up that effect res
Bronya is supposed to move after JL to double her turn so her cleanse loses a lot of value.  

Other than that yeah this combo with defo stay for the time being
I don't think Ruan Mei is crazy in the traditional sense.

A bit autistic (due to having trouble understanding emotions) and laser focused on her research goals but not crazy.
Did that change? I thought they based it all on the current moc/pf?
    It did change to that method yeah. It's been ignoring layout at least since Pure Fiction was added and treating 5 stars as e0 (and 4 stars as e6) at least since Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae dropped from S+.
I thought that JL was only ahead because everything had ice weakness.

        Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects . The difference is way too big to ignore . I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants
            >Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects .

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

https://youtu.be/BeQFfg4S4V8?si=xWo0tQHDpNvGl5Om
Pretty much the only place my FX has struggled has been Gold and Gears where her tanking the entire team’s damage just straight up 1 shot her at higher difficulties lol.

For all normal content + PF + MoC, she’s a god.

HH is still my preferred sustain character though just because I like her as a character more lol.
She's a bit more than that if you are going for low cycles. You don't worry about healing as much and take hits on the chin. I'll at Max skill twice but hope for one and just evade a debuff while it's still up. 

Where she shines is turboing ults at the start while also having buffs. 

You can run setups with fine fruit (legit one of her best cones) to get everyone including herself at a starting ult level. This is especially nuts if you managed to pull Ruan Mei cone but it's not necessary. It lets you start off with with a huge burst phase out the gate and put her a skill and auto away from her own ult so you are ready going into wave 2 with her skill still going. 

I have e1 Fu Xuan and E0 Huohuo and I end up taking Huohuo more while Fu has been slowly getting benched more and more. Her SP is usually about the equivalent of Fu's starting rotation of...

Auto -) take some hits -) Skill and then hopefully you are in a position where you can auto the rest of use one more skill
Damage doesn't tell the whole story. Hu Tao does considerably more damage than Neuvillette yet most people put him a tier higher. Jingliu using 0.4 sp a cycle just makes her much better and more future-proof.

The second they release another sp negative support, and use that as justification to power creep existing options, it will be even more obvious she is just a busted unit.
    goofy ahh simp💀 no DPS is futureproof bruh and calcs were already out, IL/TY/Sparkle/Huohuo is out damaging a team consisting of JL/Bronya/Ruan Mei/Huohuo, and there are gameplays as well already so if you still think she's better, you need to get your eyes checked.

and how does Hu Tao and Neuvillette correlate with the topic anyway? Hu Tao's a nuker while Neuv's a pew pew typa dealer; it would've made more sense if you compare Al-Haitham and Neuvillette.
    Tf is this logic? They can also release another sp generator that is more busted you know? Just because she is sp negative doesn't make her future proof cuz IL's sp problems can easily be fixed by using a brain on making team comps. 

And Sparkle existing already fixes his sp problem anyways so even if they release another sp negative support it wont matter at all since Sparkle mitigate the sp consumption.
        Uneducated people grossly overestimate how much SP she generates. She front-loads it, but Tingyun and Ruan Generate more SP. Her main benefit is not being an SP sync like Bronya while also enabling AV. A strong, sp negative support is the obvious progression. People undervalue SP and the tier list will continue to reflect the opinion of people who aren't reactionary and have functional brains.
            More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
                They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
                    >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
                        The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
                Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
                    the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
                    JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
There’s only one ruan Mei and 2 sides
    4 dps's?!?!?!??!
        Not the first time for PF. We already have Herta + Himeko on one side with Kafka + Black Swan on the other being one of the most meta picks.
        Not unheard of… I’ve done Jingliu herta and Jingyuan Himeko for PF before
        I play dual dps all the time between Jingliu Blade, Ratio Topaz and the DoT ladies so it's not unheard of

And everywhere including MoC so I would very much appreciate another Ruan Mei lol
I don't have her man. I don't know. But from how much I read. She can Heal, She Can Reduce damage taken, She can deal decent Damage, gives Eff Res. She is Already like SSS tier sustain.
Jingliu main sub recommend bronya over sparkle though after calculation is done on their end
    please show the calc, otherwise cap (and have they consider bronya as the other support on top of sparkle)
        Yeah someone did the calcs.. It is her worst team(even worse than Pela+Mei) From Jingliu mains.

https://preview.redd.it/frhhnm5z4hlc1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09d5be06e5c2aeca2f9855923507aa01b4bee96
            SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
                Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
Bronya is still better for Jingliu, Blade and Jingliu + Blade. That's what CN bros had been cooking. These 2 have enough self buffs to keep going for another turn without needing any setups beyond that.

Oh and they both don't really need the extra SP.
No, Bronya is definitively better for both Blade and Jingliu.
As someone who doesn't have blade or JL, what's the high level reasoning for this? Is this related to the fact they don't really use SP at all (compared to other DPS options) so you'd just have too many level over SP? Or is this related to the characters having high CDMG baked into kit so the extra DMG Bronya provides would scale better?

edit: and for blade the attack from trace is worthless
    Both of those are correct.
    and also it's 100% action advance, you can always spam Bronya's skill with them it speeds up their damage by a lot
    It's pretty much this: sparkle is best when you go 160+ speed sparkle, 200+ cd and your DPS you use is going to use attack boots(hp boots for blade) and sits at 100ish speed, this makes sparkle give like 50% more overall turns to your DPS, 15-45%  atk (based on mono quantum) and +43% because they can use attack boots instead of speed, 48(or 80 if bronya cone/past and future), inc damage for 2turns on 3t ult (18 otherwise), and 110ish crit damage while sp positive

Bronya is best (assuning the following doesn't burn out sp) when you go 134-140 speed and 1 speed slower than your DPS, so your DPS acts, bronya acts, and then your DPS immediately acts again, giving your DPS 100% more turns than normal, 100ish increase damage on the 2nd turn (past and future or sig cone, major trace), and 55% attack with 55-70% inc crit damage for 2 turns on a 3t ult(3t with sig cone).

For jing liu, she has so much crit value built in that it is easy to hit something like 50/200-240 whereas she only 60%ish increased damage if using fall of an aeon, or 105ish if using her signature/s5 secret vow. She will also have roughly 220ish increased attack from her talent giving 180, and 43 from rope. So what she lacks most of is speed and increased damage, both of which bronya gives more of than sparkle, at the cost of being sp negative. Even if using Ruan mei +bronya+jing liu, she'd at most have 183% inc damage, which is still less than the 260-300 inc crit damage she could have while under bronya Ult. Jing and bronya + a 3rd sp positive support just match perfectly currently.
She only gives 15% atk permanent to everyone who isn't quantum while bronya gives 55% atk to everyone on ulti regardless of element

Sparkle give lots of cdmg while bronya give lots of dmg bonus

Spd reduction debuff by enemy is impactful even for 160 sparkle

Both are similar but work with different characters so there really isn't "sparkle is better than bronya or bronya is better than sparkle" 

Sparkle can't replace Bronya from JL or blade team while Bronya can't replace Sparkle from qq, dhil and jy
    Check some Sparkle/Bronya/Blade setups. I'm saying that you use her with bronya for blade lol Also you're missing the damage buff sparkle gives with her talent,  which gives a damage boost team wide for every SP used. 


Really the thing that boosts Sparkle over is that her buffs have easy more consistent up time.  It's pretty much permanent and also usable for stuff like lightning lord. 
        Sparkle gives 18% dmg bonus while Bronya give 10% dmg bonus as trace permanent

Bronya with signature LC can also 3T ulti just like Sparkle..... really don't understand when does Bronya have inconsistent buff uptime? The only thing she can't do is buff FUA with her skill

Also only FUA benefit from extended buff from sparkle while character itself loose it when they take 2nd turn

At 200% cdmg for non-quantum

Bronya - 96% dmg (skill) + 10% dmg (permanent) + 55% atk (2 turns) + 52% cdmg (2 turn)

Sparkle - 93% cdmg (skill) + 15% atk (permanent) + 18% dmg (permanent) + 30% dmg (2-3 turn)

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?
            Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
                I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
        You know that using double harmony has diminishing returns, right? Harmony + nihility would be much much better.
The 50% does matter, since your only build is going for 160 speed and pulling the dps to that speed. Slow Bronya at 134 speed allows you to give your dps 2 turns, meaning it becomes roughly equivalent to 268 speed. The first attack of your dps will be unbuffed, but in the end it's still an extra turn. For units that care more about the number of attacks, this is especially important.
160spd on her or the dps?
    On her.
When did dot characters started using cdmg?
and that right there is why she's S and not S+

her skill is RNG and in order to make it not RNG, you need to work around it and like I said, the only way you can get the guaranteed is either mono quantum or as you said, fight an enemy with quantum weakness while matching allies

also while her All Res shred is really good, a weakness break is infinitely better due to the action pushback, damage reduction removed, and the potential break damage
Feel free to explain how to properly use her and what makes her so complex
    I was trolling but how long do you want the explanation 🤔?
I have her and legit almost never use her because Pela is just better overall. She is super over rated and is mostly there for mono-quantum enjoyers.
    Skill issue bruh . Remember this is a turn based rpg . You can literally win fights you are not supposed to win before entering the fights .  I don't want to write a 1000 words essay because nobody cares but you do what you are doing with your shallow approach to sw 😬
Why would you post such a misleading post of course Sparkle LC is useless for you if your crit is 99%, what did you expect?
    As in the optimiser simulates all your best possible builds based off your whole relic list. And the diff between my best build without sig LC on sparkle and with was 7%.

The build with sparkle sig LC was at a much higher cdmg but both builds are simulated to be at 100% crit. However because of diminishing returns the diff is not that huge especially after you consider Sparkle’s skill will buff around 100cdmg
        Okay, with this context, it makes sense.
            Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
... That's not what that sentence means. 

They are not moving other characters up and down until they tested everything, but Sparkle herself is S+. It seems reasonable to me, idk what you are yapping about...
    How'd you test a support character without testing their impact on the characters they're supposed to be supporting? 🤔 Seems counterintuitive.

Inb4 this is the same as when they said "Juan mains will be satisfied with our next update" and then they didn't change anything 😂
Hoping for some Enmity deck support next. Especially with tons of revives and high risk, high reward gameplay.
i guess you dont know the alternative Characters from Impact3D and Names from China/japan i dont blame you for bieng a Casual
    My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
    Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
        were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
            He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
                'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
I would hope a 5 star at e1s1 would outperform one at e0s0...although I would add, that even then, sparkle is far more versatily. bronya only works for hypercarry.
    ? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
        No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
            Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
                >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                    Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
There are a lot of limitations on Bronya’s sp gen capacity and h r compatibility with SP hungry units(even at E1S1). A good example of that is pairing her with SP heavy characters like DHIL. Her SP generation capacity is limited, why? Because you are limited to 5SP with bronya. I use an E1S1 Bronya with 161 speed. The problem with her is when she does E to an SP hungry unit like QQ and DH and consumes 3 SP. You are left with 1 sp after that and have to generate with your other units by basic attacking. With sparkle, that limitation is bypassed since your max SP is 7, plus she can ult and restore 4sp every single time. With this setup, it allows your 2 other characters on using their skills freely and/or when you are in a pinch(low health and needsHealing/bursting and needs to do debuffs etc).


No one is saying Bronya is not good. The premium 5 star is just better than her and that’s just the usual trend being followed.
    It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
Wdym Bronya has more raw power. Sparkle has better buffs even if you ignore the sp difference. 100% advance forward buff vs 50% is literally the same in most teams. Bronya spamming her skill is too much sp heavy unless you play Jingliu/Blade and you have E1S1 Bronya. Ignoring those two there is not a single scenario that you would choose Bronya over Sparkle. 
    50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
Ruan is for basically every team, including hypercarry. Probably gonna be used with sparkle a fair amount
RM is amazing for everything, also hypercarry
You forgot Ruan Mei work with dot team and Sparkles doesnt
    I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
No he didn’t count Huohuo ult energy, just meshing cogs and shared feeling lc. But you need to skill spam with your healer for shared healing and Huohuo makes the best use of the extra energy you get from skill spamming by actually buffing your team with her ult.
    That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
    Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
Sparkle out here enable DHIL+QQ teams like a chaos elemental.
    What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
        Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
you know with bronya... it go fast. You can look his vid, he said than Sparkle beat Pela in a team like Welt dps bronya.
E2 DHIL.
People that skipped Luocha cope extremely hard
    but the cleansing!
    Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
        E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
Her talent makes her always cleanse.
    Ah true
If a CC hits your teammate and action delays or skips their turn, it will still action delay or skip their turn. If they are frozen or imprisoned, when it is their turn HuoHuo's talent will cleanse the CC and they can still act.
    Oh true. forgot about her talent
Don't do that, ruan mei is way better for follow-up (assuming you mean topaz ratio). Keep her there and give jingliu pela and bronya
    I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
        Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
she give 7 sp limit and her ultimate is on 3 turn cool down and give 4 skill point you'll need some massive skill issue or bad luck with qingque to waste all of that.
    She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
        Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
    You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.
I lost 50/50 😭😭😭 Happy for you tho
iirc over a more extended fight s5 ddd is actually close to her s1
acheron really need 2 nihility in her team lmao. That will limit your freedom. Thats why i will skip her
    Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
    I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
        you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
            Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
True, but using fribbeles i noticed that Yukong gives a bigger boost. The energy regeneration of Tingyun is op, but getting 20k or more from Yukong is pretty good. Anyway I think i will stick to Tingyun so I can play in auto ahahah
    Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
Yeah, a skill point issue, which Sparkle doesn't have, thank you for proving the point.

You can just constantly skill with Sparkle and still be a point positive.
    why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
        because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
            So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
                no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                    You are absolutely right about that XD
                I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
Do you think only one team comp exists or something?
    Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
        omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
            But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
If it only moves it up by 10, he is misusing her. Either the DPS has no skillpoints or is faster than Sparkle. So yes, some speedtuning is needed but far less than Bronya.
the tldr is, as long as Sparkle is faster, but not more than 2x, she'll always push DPS to top. i.e  100spd dps and 100-200spd Sparkle work perfectly. Assuming no enemy pushes the DPS back before Sparkle's turn.     
   
Slow Sparkle also works, but instead of getting the DPS a turn every time, the build is focuses on maximising the value of the 50%aa. Where Fast Sparkle will realistically boost the dps only like 30-40%, slow Sparkle will always make use of the full 50%.    
    
For full explanation you can google "hsr action value guide", it's surprisingly simple how it works.
The most "perfect" scenario is for Bronya to be 29 speed faster than your DPS so that when she advances them, they will get 1 advanced turn and then 1 regular turn right before Bronya (and repeat). If your Bronya is 134 spd and your dps is 135ish then you can just take off speed boots and this concept will still apply.

Basically E2 Bronya just makes slow bronya even better because you can drop speed boots (or substats) on your dps. If you play Bronya hyperspeed (160+) and you don't skill > auto > repeat, then the E2 is not noticeable tbh.
    Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
Nah you still wanna pray for bad rolls until you get full buffs. Yeah... Qingque RNG is rather punishing quick rolls
Sparkle only get her 1 SP every 3 turns unless you do basic spam. praying still exists.
What? For real? I use both team and BS Kafka is overwhelmingly stronger.
    On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
        No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
            wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
                All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                    hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
            Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
except the last moc 12 had both 40% lightning and wind resist on both halves
Bro these fuckers are downvoting you cause they think you trash talked their dear black swan. Smh I hate these kids
Her skill cleanse (only the advanced forward ally, ie your carry most probably). Unlike Lynx who have AoE cleanse if my memory is good.
    Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!
If you aren't afraid of Bronya herself being CC'd sure
    just gotta pump up that effect res
It did change to that method yeah. It's been ignoring layout at least since Pure Fiction was added and treating 5 stars as e0 (and 4 stars as e6) at least since Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae dropped from S+.
Ah ok, that’s understandable

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

https://youtu.be/BeQFfg4S4V8?si=xWo0tQHDpNvGl5Om
goofy ahh simp💀 no DPS is futureproof bruh and calcs were already out, IL/TY/Sparkle/Huohuo is out damaging a team consisting of JL/Bronya/Ruan Mei/Huohuo, and there are gameplays as well already so if you still think she's better, you need to get your eyes checked.

and how does Hu Tao and Neuvillette correlate with the topic anyway? Hu Tao's a nuker while Neuv's a pew pew typa dealer; it would've made more sense if you compare Al-Haitham and Neuvillette.
Tf is this logic? They can also release another sp generator that is more busted you know? Just because she is sp negative doesn't make her future proof cuz IL's sp problems can easily be fixed by using a brain on making team comps. 

And Sparkle existing already fixes his sp problem anyways so even if they release another sp negative support it wont matter at all since Sparkle mitigate the sp consumption.
    Uneducated people grossly overestimate how much SP she generates. She front-loads it, but Tingyun and Ruan Generate more SP. Her main benefit is not being an SP sync like Bronya while also enabling AV. A strong, sp negative support is the obvious progression. People undervalue SP and the tier list will continue to reflect the opinion of people who aren't reactionary and have functional brains.
        More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
            They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
                >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
                    The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
            Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
                the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
                JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
4 dps's?!?!?!??!
    Not the first time for PF. We already have Herta + Himeko on one side with Kafka + Black Swan on the other being one of the most meta picks.
    Not unheard of… I’ve done Jingliu herta and Jingyuan Himeko for PF before
    I play dual dps all the time between Jingliu Blade, Ratio Topaz and the DoT ladies so it's not unheard of

And everywhere including MoC so I would very much appreciate another Ruan Mei lol
please show the calc, otherwise cap (and have they consider bronya as the other support on top of sparkle)
    Yeah someone did the calcs.. It is her worst team(even worse than Pela+Mei) From Jingliu mains.

https://preview.redd.it/frhhnm5z4hlc1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c09d5be06e5c2aeca2f9855923507aa01b4bee96
        SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
            Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
Both of those are correct.
and also it's 100% action advance, you can always spam Bronya's skill with them it speeds up their damage by a lot
It's pretty much this: sparkle is best when you go 160+ speed sparkle, 200+ cd and your DPS you use is going to use attack boots(hp boots for blade) and sits at 100ish speed, this makes sparkle give like 50% more overall turns to your DPS, 15-45%  atk (based on mono quantum) and +43% because they can use attack boots instead of speed, 48(or 80 if bronya cone/past and future), inc damage for 2turns on 3t ult (18 otherwise), and 110ish crit damage while sp positive

Bronya is best (assuning the following doesn't burn out sp) when you go 134-140 speed and 1 speed slower than your DPS, so your DPS acts, bronya acts, and then your DPS immediately acts again, giving your DPS 100% more turns than normal, 100ish increase damage on the 2nd turn (past and future or sig cone, major trace), and 55% attack with 55-70% inc crit damage for 2 turns on a 3t ult(3t with sig cone).

For jing liu, she has so much crit value built in that it is easy to hit something like 50/200-240 whereas she only 60%ish increased damage if using fall of an aeon, or 105ish if using her signature/s5 secret vow. She will also have roughly 220ish increased attack from her talent giving 180, and 43 from rope. So what she lacks most of is speed and increased damage, both of which bronya gives more of than sparkle, at the cost of being sp negative. Even if using Ruan mei +bronya+jing liu, she'd at most have 183% inc damage, which is still less than the 260-300 inc crit damage she could have while under bronya Ult. Jing and bronya + a 3rd sp positive support just match perfectly currently.
Check some Sparkle/Bronya/Blade setups. I'm saying that you use her with bronya for blade lol Also you're missing the damage buff sparkle gives with her talent,  which gives a damage boost team wide for every SP used. 


Really the thing that boosts Sparkle over is that her buffs have easy more consistent up time.  It's pretty much permanent and also usable for stuff like lightning lord. 
    Sparkle gives 18% dmg bonus while Bronya give 10% dmg bonus as trace permanent

Bronya with signature LC can also 3T ulti just like Sparkle..... really don't understand when does Bronya have inconsistent buff uptime? The only thing she can't do is buff FUA with her skill

Also only FUA benefit from extended buff from sparkle while character itself loose it when they take 2nd turn

At 200% cdmg for non-quantum

Bronya - 96% dmg (skill) + 10% dmg (permanent) + 55% atk (2 turns) + 52% cdmg (2 turn)

Sparkle - 93% cdmg (skill) + 15% atk (permanent) + 18% dmg (permanent) + 30% dmg (2-3 turn)

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?
        Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
            I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
    You know that using double harmony has diminishing returns, right? Harmony + nihility would be much much better.
On her.
I was trolling but how long do you want the explanation 🤔?
Skill issue bruh . Remember this is a turn based rpg . You can literally win fights you are not supposed to win before entering the fights .  I don't want to write a 1000 words essay because nobody cares but you do what you are doing with your shallow approach to sw 😬
As in the optimiser simulates all your best possible builds based off your whole relic list. And the diff between my best build without sig LC on sparkle and with was 7%.

The build with sparkle sig LC was at a much higher cdmg but both builds are simulated to be at 100% crit. However because of diminishing returns the diff is not that huge especially after you consider Sparkle’s skill will buff around 100cdmg
    Okay, with this context, it makes sense.
        Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
How'd you test a support character without testing their impact on the characters they're supposed to be supporting? 🤔 Seems counterintuitive.

Inb4 this is the same as when they said "Juan mains will be satisfied with our next update" and then they didn't change anything 😂
My eyes just rolled so hard that they're now stuck staring at the inside of my skull.

On the bright side, at least I can't see comments like these anymore.
Look dude, you aren't better just for calling them with their alternative names, if the guy is here he isn't really a casual
    were was i implying this? he ws the one shit talking me
        He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
            'MMO_Boomer' living up to his name I see
? Sparkle only works w hyper carry too. She’s more versatile cuz she works with chars who do follow up atks, not bc she’s not hyper carry only.
    No, Sparkle has hypercarry utility, but her SP generation means she also works in dual DPS skill spam comps.
        Like what comps? Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that… and it’s not like bronya would be a slouch either in that category w her na advance
            >Having a char just there for sp seems kinda weird I haven’t seen anything like that

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
                Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
It is much easier to get Bronya to E1S1 then it is to get Sparkle at all, considering that she can allways drop.... with that said i have Sparkle + her Light Cone but no Bronya, i will head to my corner now.
50% forward is not the same as 100%, not even remotely.

Bronya requires 1 speed below the Unit you wanna boost automatically resulting in \~100% getting used, getting the items for both characters is however a absolute rng festival.

Now Sparkles 50%, how do you use the maximum useage of that? Basically still if a unit is right behind her but that would only work for a single turn as they immeadiatly fall out of sync due to the usage. So more or less for the Unit that went right prior to her and there is allways some wasted potential past Turn 1.

Do not get me wrong. Most of the time the figth should be over before any serios influence happens from the wasted potential and Sparkle more then makes up for it with SP alone. Just in a heavily fine tuned team and/or a LONG fight Bronya becomes better and better in comparison.

The bigger issue is that Bronya requires extremly specific team builds to work that way and Sparkle can just wing it and is absolutely great. Meaning that most Meta Teams should, my guess, not properly benefit from Bronya leaving Sparkle as the superior support for most situations.
I use Sparkle e2s1 with Crit Kafka + Black Swan. It’s insane.
That might be actually the play with blade + bronya + sparkle + Lynx comp. You want to spam your skill on Lynx to constantly apply aggro and HP bonus on Blade so shared feelings suits her well. Although idk if you need that many sp in this team so I need to test it out
Could this be big for the Blade, Bronya, Sparkle idea people are passing around? Spam with Lynx and then just go nuts with Blade and Sparkle skills. Lynx has no sig LC, seems like it's a solid fit.
What about DHIL + QQ + Seele?
    Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
but the cleansing!
Me with an e2s2 Luocha with 3.9k attack: cope harder 😌
    E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
Ah true
Oh true. forgot about her talent
I don’t have bronya.

Planning to do topaz + flex (ratio/clara) + sparkle + aventurine

& BS + mei + huohuo + sampo (kafka when she reruns )
    Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
She also burns 3 sp with 3 turns so she only really generates 1 sp every 3 turns. She’s as sp positive as TY and Ruan Mei. She does give 3 SP at the beginning of the fight with her technique so even in a sp negative line up that drains 0.33 sp per turn for example, it’ll take you a long time to drain that initial 6 sp.
    Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
You say that, but I went into her trial, which had QQ on the team. Sparkle got first turn (or maybe second after Tingyun?), she boosted QQ, there were five SPs left, used up all, still didn't get a full hand.

Sure, the chances of that happening are astronomically low, but the Random Number God is capricious by nature, and loves to spite the people expecting his favor.
Oh yeah? When I get her she'll have Pela alone and she better take it.
I mean, you don’t necessarily need 2, but the boost would be nice
    you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
        Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
Yukong gives more damage, but Tingyun's energy regen is quite important to making the SP economy work, especially if you don't have Luocha.

Looking at new Sparkle teams, Tingyun gives you more SP to work with, and is pretty much necessary if you want Sparkle to advance DHIL every turn.
why would you skill every turn with a sustain? or a debuffer? it seems a bit silly that people are making it seem like more skill point use = more dmg all around
    because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
        So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
            no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
                You are absolutely right about that XD
            I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
Its not that. You can literally run bronya and dhil together but you need to run dhil at -1 speed and basic attack with him first.   
Like its literally doable
    omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
        But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
Problem is that guy is talking specifically about Jingliu and this runs into a problem when e2 Bronya skills Jingliu who is currently on 1 out of 2 counter because she will skill, go into advanced mode and waste the speed buff because she takes two turns in a row. I'm not sure there is a great way to take advantage of e2 Bronya with Jingliu in this case but you will have some positives.
On my try BS and Kafka took 6 turns to clear MOC 12. I don’t have either of their sig LC. Decent artifacts and mega support RM and Huohuo. 

Meanwhile QQ took 5 with FX, Silverwolf and Hanya. 

The only hype they have for me now is when MOC buffs dot or they have weakness advantage. QQ still better for me.
    No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
        wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
            All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
                hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
        Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.
Ah, thanks that is good to know. Much better than nothing!

Now tell me when does bronya doesn't have 100% uptime on buff for a character who isn't FUA?

Yes because most just can't generate that much. And it's not like she doesn't provide major buffs on top of SP generation,  even without her skill

And bronya's biggest stremgth us her advance. For sparkle just one tool of many
            Can u tell me some teams? I really haven’t heard of any duo dps teams with sparkle
Can't for this particular build because you need the 4th slot for a healer for that light cone.
E2S1 here. Homie is a Preservation, Nihility, Harmony, Abundance, sub-DPS all at once.
Those are very solid teams.  You'll do very well for a long time
Yes that's more about that. Yes she is not Extremely SP positive, but you have so much starting SP than if you don't throw your SP management you're suppose to end before encountering big SP issue. Obviously you still cannot play 3 ppl Spamming Skill like idk an asta next to Sparkle and hook. even luocha will not save you here
you would be giving up between 45 to 60% final damage modifer by not running 2 nihliity.
    Maybe, but depending on her damage, and Kit, could be overkill except in the highest percentile
because people don't want to have point spending management, they just want to have a lot to use skills every turn and sparkle does that for them while bronya doesn't
    So your solution is to skill spam with sustain? Is healing every turn or re applying shields really that hard to figure out how to space? Is it breaking minds to figure out when to reapply tingyun buff or use pela skill? I don't really get it. When did Basic attack become a bad thing all of a sudden? There are plenty of characters created so we don't have to use their skill every single turn?
        no, we don't need it (unless you use DHIL as main) but at the same time people don't care, they just want to see points left to use even when they don't need it
            You are absolutely right about that XD
        I mean with extra SP you can now just throw SP because I could. Fu xuan with unlimited CC protection sounds so fun
omg yes I love running basic attack spam DHIL. If you're doing first turn basic into bronya advance into 3 sp basic just to not go sp negative with bronya, then you might as well not run bronya in the first place.
    But you get like two extra turns bcuz bronya just advances ur action forward again, this time just with a massive damage boost and a cleanse.  
so you can basically get more turns in a cycle, which means giving dhil more energy and sp recovery  


ppl don't know how to use bronya just because she uses sp has a skill issue or cant build proper teams because they have to rely on "extra skill points".

Like you can literally play her with any dps in the game, but obviously shes more comfortable with blade/jingliu. Who the hell doesn't want sp-efficient dps's to not use skill points. But she can LITERALLY be played with any dps who uses -1sp every turn to use their skill too which is the majority of dps's in this game bruh (including dr ratio, all hunt characters etc) Only characters i cant see work with bronya well is like follow up chars or DOT teams. But even then topaz/jingyuan can work well enoguh with her. Y'all have skill issue damn bcuz u cant manage skill points. 

She is literally still universal in a lot of teams, thats legit why she has been branded as OP, still.
No Eidolon, LC for any 5 star:

What the hell? The moc this time favors BS Kafka more. I only do one try but I got 3 cycle BS Kafka (could probably push 2 cycle but I played safe with Huohuo), 4 cycle QQ SW Tingyun Fuxuan. However the BS Kafka is way more comfy and so much stronger that its not even close (probably because of RM). I also use IL Tingyun Bronya Fuxuan for another try, 3 cycle.

Stats: 
Dot
BS 2k8 atk, 122 EHR, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Kafka 3k7 atk, 151 speed (161 with RM)
Both Prisoner

QQ
65/190 crit. I don't remember the atk rating lol (I use Tingyun anyway). Quantum
She use the same artifact for seele, I decided not to used seele this time.

IL
80/180 crit. Musketeer.
Bronya 161 speed e1s1, alternate normal and skill.

The dot team is stronger than 2 of them. Not by *that* much, they all shredding MOC, but I can clearly see the difference.
    wait are you taking about first half (Gepard) or second half (Death)? Because I tried BS Kafka Ruan Huohuo (no sign LC or Eidolon too) in both and it was very different, 2-3 cycle in 1st half and 5 cycles for the later
        All of them was test on second half.

Dot team and IL destroyed first half like it sweet cheese.

I only use Qingque in second half because SW only applied weakness to one of them.

Edit: also the reason why I said dot is more comfy is because SW applied lightning weakness.
            hmm my BS is strong though (3k4 atk, 150 speed), maybe Kafka is the weak point 3k5 atk 146 spd with GNSW only S2 . I checked on youtube and don't see people use DOT team in 2nd half very much so I am not sure if this team comp suits this floor
    Last MoC. I said it pretty clearly. This MOC is tailored for Dot so yeah.

>Don't know why you are being downvoted for speaking facts but i disagree in some aspects .

It's basically Reddit in nutshell. If you talk stupid thing for their Fav waifu you got kick to the ground ( Even know it's a Fact). And im appreciate You understand unlike those guys

>I literally feel the difference between jy with lc and without. 

JY Lc vs Acheron Lc is different. Acheron Sig Lc main gimmick is make it so you can guarantee 2 turn ult. Jy Sig Lc is make JY doing higher Dmg. The difference between both is that Acheron Lc can be fix with right setup, But Jy can't the reason because it was Dmg buff.

My point is that Acheron Lc is not as Important as people hyping up. Don't get me wrong it's really good, But not mandatory. And Between Sparkle and Acheron Lc, There is basically no reason to pick Acheron Lc over a broken Support character

>Depending on trend is way too annoying its like depending on sw implants

Maybe that's what you see. But Imo, There is a lot of way to make acheron 2 turn without Her sig Lc. I guess, we will see when She is released. 

Lastly, im hoped this video should make Those people who downvoted me Open their Eyes :

More like Jingliu fans just crying now that IL proved that she is a fraud. Keep coping no matter how much you cry it wont stop hoyoverse from releasing more sp generators in the future. IL has always and will always be better than Jingliu and that gap between them will just grow larger as time passes since IL scales waay harder in terms of vertical investment
    They are both gonna be in S+ tier so chill. JL was never stronger then DHIL she was in S+ because she was just so much easier to build and could use a lot of different teams, DHIL getting a limited 5\* support isn't gonna change that.
        >JL was never stronger then DHIL

That's what you thought and what I've thought all this time but that's not what the overwhelming majority sentiment in the Star Rail community was saying. Let's not try to act that the notion going around wasn't that JL was stronger/out damaged DHIL. Even "greatly" out damaged him was the main claim being made.
            The majority of the hsr community has little to no idea what they are talking about and just repeat what they read/hear from somebody else. At release everybody knew that JL did slightly less dmg then DHIL but achieved that dmg way way easier and nothing has changed since then (other then now sparkle releasing) don't know why people thought that DHIL lost his dmg just because he got placed in a lower tier
    Calm down brother, you are shitting on the 2nd best hyper carry of HSR for some reason and act like she is dogshit. 

Be happy that DHIL is currently the best, and move on. Not if it would matter, as long as it gets the job done, anything goes.
        the duality???? if JL mains do stuff like that, it's fine? but when they're getting the taste of their own medicine, it's wrong? 

no one is saying she is dogshit but the dude above is still trying to force that she's the best when she's not is just being blind atp.
        JL fans keep saying that she were the best DPS in the game, now they are just getting what they did back
SP and Bronya is worse than even Bronya and Pela? How come? Are the extra turns not good?
    Well there are reasons for that..

1. Jingliu doesn’t like shit ton of crit damage.. she prefers other ways to increase her damage like Pela’s debuffs.. putting two crit buffers is way too much.. a single one is enough.

2. She can’t really benefit from Sparkle’s SP since she can’t use that SP..
Trying to argue with Sparkle fanboys, even with facts, is a waste of time. If they are prydwen fanboys, its even more of a waste of time.
    I built each and every support released till now including sparkle (building as of now)..... some peoples really don't know how a character work they see tier list and think yep this character is bad and worst
Sure thanks for pointing it out. I’ll ensure that my observations are clearer with the build differences next time
He just asked if the comment was written with AI because it's weird that you call them in a different way as if you were trying hard to be different, then you replied showing your superiority complex pointing out that the guy doesn't know something you do as if it would be wrong to just call the characters just by the names the game shows in english.
