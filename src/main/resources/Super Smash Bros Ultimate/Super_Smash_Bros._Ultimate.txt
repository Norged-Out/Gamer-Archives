'''''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Super Smash Bros. Special'''''|大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ SPECIAL|Dai Rantō Sumasshu Burazāzu Supesharu|lead=yes}}}} is a 2018 [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] [[fighting game]] developed by [[Bandai Namco Studios]] and Sora Ltd. and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It is the fifth{{efn|Officially, ''Ultimate'' is the sixth installment in the series, as [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']] are considered to be separate titles by Nintendo.}} installment in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, succeeding [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']] (2014). The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay, in which players control one of the [[Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series|various characters]] and use attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of [[game modes]], including a [[single-player]] [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] and [[multiplayer]] versus modes. ''Ultimate'' features 89 playable fighters, including all characters from previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games as well as newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo characters to those from [[Third party developer|third-party]] franchises.
Planning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of ''3DS''/''Wii U''{{'s}} [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed ''3DS''/''Wii U,'' with their return speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with ''Ultimate'' was to include every character from previous games in the series, despite the various development and licensing challenges this would present. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with [[Hideki Sakamoto]] writing the main theme "Lifelight".
Nintendo first teased ''Ultimate'' in a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2018 and fully revealed it at [[E3 2018]] the following June. It later received two additional Directs prior to its release on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best game in the series; they praised its large amount of content and fine-tuning of existing ''Smash'' gameplay elements, although its online mode received criticism. ''Ultimate'' is the best-selling fighting game of all time and [[List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games|the third best-selling Nintendo Switch game]], having sold over 32 million copies as of September 2023. It is also a popular [[Super Smash Bros. in esports|competitive fighting game]], and has commonly been ranked as one of the best fighting games ever made and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The game won ten Game of the Year awards and received thirteen nominations. The game received [[downloadable content]] adding new fighters, stages, and other content from its release until October 2021.
==Gameplay==
{{Main|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Super Smash Bros.}}
[[File:Super Smash Bros. Ultimate gameplay.jpg|thumb|Pre-release screenshot of a four-player match on the Great Plateau stage (from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'') between [[Ganondorf]], [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], [[Mario]] and [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]]|alt=|left]]
''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' is a [[platform fighter]] for up to eight players in which characters from [[Nintendo]] games and third-party franchises fight to knock each other out of an arena. Each player has a percentage meter which raises as they take damage, thus increasing the knockback they take and making them easier to launch in the air and out of the arena. Standard battles use one of three victory conditions: Timed, where players aim to win the most points by defeating opponents within a time limit; Stock, where players have a set number of lives and aim to be the last player standing; and Stamina, where players reduce their opponent's health down to zero to defeat them. Players can adjust the rules to their liking and save them as presets for future matches.
Players can also enable various items which attack enemies or grant them power-ups, along with Poké Balls and Assist Trophies, which respectively summon [[Pokémon]] and other non-playable characters to assist them in battle. In Timed matches, certain Assist Trophies can be attacked and defeated to earn points. Other tweaks include new icons and gauges for character-specific abilities, such as [[Cloud Strife|Cloud]]'s Limit gauge.
In addition to returning modes such as Classic, Special Smash, and Home-Run Contest, ''Ultimate'' adds new modes. These are Smashdown, where each character can only be played once; Squad Strike, where players battle in teams of multiple characters; and a tournament mode that allows up to 32 players to battle in playoff brackets.
=== Spirits ===
[[File:Smash Ultimate spirit.jpg|thumb|A typical Spirit battle. Here, players must fight an [[Incineroar]] meant to represent [[Tom Nook]] from the [[Animal Crossing|''Animal Crossing'' series]].]]
''Ultimate'' introduces the Spirits mechanic, replacing the collectible trophies from previous games. Each of these Spirits, based on characters from represented franchises, can be used to power up a fighter with unique abilities. Certain Spirits will also become an "enhanced" form upon reaching max level, but will return to level 1. Nintendo offers limited-timed Spirit events in cross-promotion with other games and franchises, with the Spirits featured only available to collect during the event. Eventually, these Spirits make their way into general rotation and can be found on the Spirit Board. The local multiplayer mode also allows for the option to use Spirits.
==== World of Light ====
''Ultimate'' features the return of Adventure Mode, which was absent in ''3DS/Wii U.'' It is now integrated into the Spirits mode with a new story, ''World of Light'', which prominently utilizes the game's Spirit mechanics. The mode's narrative begins with an evil entity, Galeem, destroying the ''Smash Bros.'' world, vaporizing almost all of the fighter characters and placing them under his imprisonment; only [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], due to his Warp Star, evades this attack. Players explore the titular World of Light, a new world that Galeem created in the original world's place, to rescue captured fighters and Spirits -the remnants of other characters' physical forms- by completing marked Spirit Battles. Players can use regained allies and Spirits to overcome certain challenges on the map and defeat Galeem.
=== Additional features ===
The game supports local multiplayer, local wireless with other systems, and online play via [[Wi-Fi]] or [[LAN party|LAN connections]]. By defeating players online, players earn tags which can be traded for in-game currency to buy new Spirits, music, and [[Mii]] Fighter costumes. The game is compatible with [[Joy-Con]] controllers, the [[Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]], and [[GameCube controller]]s via a USB adapter. Like the previous entry, [[amiibo]] figurines can be used to create AI-controlled Figure Players, which can be trained to become stronger. Shortly after the game's release, a service for the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app, known as "Smash World", was launched, which allows players to check their game statistics and share images and videos captured from the game to social media. ''Ultimate'' features over 900 music tracks, which can be played through the Switch's handheld mode while in standby mode. Version 3.0 of the game, released in April 2019, adds a Stage Builder, which allows players to create custom stages which can be shared or downloaded through the Switch Online service. The update also includes a replay editor, allowing players to edit stored replays, which can be shared online or downloaded to other devices. These replays are available within the Smash World app. An update in May 2019 provided limited support for the [[virtual reality]] VR Kit of [[Nintendo Labo]], allowing players to view computer-only matches in VR or play in a 1-on-1 mode against the computer. An update in September 2019 added the Home-Run Contest mode from previous ''Smash'' games.
===Playable characters===
{{See also|List of Super Smash Bros. series characters}}
''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'', like other games in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, features a [[Crossover (video games)|crossover]] cast of fighters from several different [[Nintendo franchises]], as well as fighters from series by [[Third-party developer|third-party]] developers such as [[Konami]], [[Sega]], [[Capcom]], [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]], [[Square Enix]], [[PlatinumGames]], [[Microsoft]], [[SNK]], and [[Disney]]. The base game features 74 playable fighters,{{efn|Pokémon Trainer, who uses three summonable Pokémon, is regarded as a single character; the total number of fighters goes to 76 if one counts each of their Pokémon individually.}} consisting of all 63 previous fighters from past entries and 11 newcomers: the [[Inkling (Splatoon)|Inklings]] from ''[[Splatoon]]''; [[Princess Daisy]] from the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' series; [[Ridley (Metroid)|Ridley]] and Dark Samus from the ''[[Metroid]]'' series; [[Simon Belmont]] and Richter Belmont from the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series; [[Chrom]] from ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]''; [[King K. Rool]] from the ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' series; [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] from the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series; [[Ken Masters]] from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series; and Incineroar from [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|''Pokémon Sun'' and ''Moon'']]. When starting the game, players only have access to the eight starter characters of the original ''[[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and unlock the rest by completing the game's Classic modes, playing through World of Light, or fighting a certain amount of battles.
Certain characters whose movesets are directly based on other characters are now classified as "Echo Fighters", possessing similar movesets and proportions to the fighters they are based on, but with unique animations and gameplay differences. On the character selection screen, these characters can either be listed individually or stacked with the fighters they are based on. Several returning characters received updates to their appearances, such as [[Mario]] having Cappy from ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' accompanying him and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' 's incarnation of [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] replacing the one from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]''.
Additional fighters have been added to the game via post-release [[downloadable content]] (DLC). The first of these, [[Piranha Plant]] from the ''Mario'' series, was released in January 2019 and made available for free to those who purchased and registered the game with a [[My Nintendo]] account before the end of that month. Additional fighters, each coming with a unique stage and related music, have been released both individually and as part of two Fighters Pass bundles. The first Fighters Pass consisted of five characters: [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] from [[Atlus]]' ''[[Persona 5]]'', released in April 2019;}} from Square Enix's ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, released in July 2019; [[Banjo & Kazooie]] from [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' series, released in September 2019; [[Terry Bogard]] from [[SNK]]'s ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' series, released in November 2019; and [[Byleth (Fire Emblem)|Byleth]] from ''[[Fire Emblem: Three Houses]]'', released in January 2020.
The second Fighters Pass, titled Fighters Pass Volume 2, consisted of six additional fighters and was the final content planned for ''Ultimate''. The first character in this collection, [[Min Min (character)|Min Min]] from ''[[Arms (video game)|ARMS]]'', was released in June 2020. [[Steve (Minecraft)|Steve]],{{efn|Alex, Zombie, and Enderman are included as alternate skins.
}} the default player avatar from [[Mojang Studios]]' ''[[Minecraft]]'', was released in October 2020. [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], the antagonist from Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', was released in December 2020, with players able to unlock him a few days early by defeating him in a limited-time boss battle known as the "Sephiroth Challenge". Pyra and Mythra, a dual character from ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]]'', were released in March 2021. [[Kazuya Mishima]] from Bandai Namco's ''[[Tekken]]'' series was released in June 2021. [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and Square Enix series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' was the final fighter to be added in October 2021.
==Development==
[[File:Masahiro Sakurai 2021.jpg|thumb|right|''Super Smash Bros.'' series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] in 2021]]
''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' was developed by [[Bandai Namco Studios]] and [[Sora Ltd.]], the same studios that developed [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], for the [[Nintendo Switch]], with series creator [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returning as game director. Staff gathering was done soon afterward. The development period was shorter compared to previous entries in the series. [[Hatena (company)|Hatena]] assisted with the development of some elements, and [[tri-Crescendo]] contributed to programming and design.
According to Sakurai, producing a ''Super Smash Bros.'' game for the Switch was the last request that former Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] had given him before his death in 2015, and he wanted to make the game the best possible product he could to respect him. Sakurai sought to include every character from previous games, as to not disappoint fans. Sakurai also wanted to adjust character abilities to speed up the game,
Voice lines recorded by [[David Hayter]] for Snake were re-used for ''Ultimate''. [[Xander Mobus]], who voiced Crazy Hand, [[Master Hand]], and the announcer in ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U,'' also made a return with new voice clips, in addition to reprising his role as [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] from ''[[Persona 5]]'' when he was added as DLC''.'' The addition of Ridley from ''Metroid'' as a playable character had been highly requested within the ''Super Smash Bros.'' community for some time. In 2008, Sakurai stated that he knew Ridley was a high-demand character, but thought that he was "impossible" to add unless they were able to sacrifice the character's size for balancing purposes. So that Ridley could be included in the game, Sakurai studied the art of the character and redesigned him so he could stand upright. the team instead left a space open for a ''Sun and Moon'' Pokémon. The Inklings' ink [[game mechanic|mechanic]] proved challenging to implement due to its interactions with environments.
The team built ''Ultimate'' from scratch with new assets and content. Localization manager Nate Bihldorff stated that the game significantly upgraded lighting effects and texture rendering from the [[game engine]] of the ''Wii U'' version. The World of Light mode was inspired by ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]''{{'s}} (2008) Subspace Emissary, and Sakurai chose to start it with a cataclysmic event because he thought it would leave a greater impact on players. One part of the team chose Spirits to include in the game and had to thoroughly research them; according to Sakurai, the Spirits mode was essential for using various franchises.
=== Music ===
Like previous games in the series, ''Ultimate'' features several well-known video game music composers and arrangers providing a mix of original music and rearrangements of various tracks for the represented franchises, with over 1,000 tracks in total. New to ''Ultimate'' is the tying of tracks to franchises instead of individual stages, as well as the ability to create custom [[playlist]]s to listen to outside of the game when the Switch is in handheld mode. In addition, he allowed them to submit their own personal favorites, with those choices being given priority for inclusion.
=== Downloadable content ===
As with previous entries, Nintendo planned to offer new fighters through DLC; however, unlike with the ''3DS'' and ''Wii U,'' where players could request which characters they wished to see in the game, Nintendo chose which characters they would add by November 2018. Like the previous title, additional Mii costumes were released as paid DLC, with certain costumes also adding new music tracks to the game. Sakurai believed that despite characters like [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the first announced DLC fighter, not being from games usually associated with Nintendo, they were added because they were "emblematic" of the types of characters they wanted to add to ''Ultimate.'' He also stated that they "bring just a whole different level of fun and enjoyment for players". The Piranha Plant was chosen as a DLC character because Sakurai wanted to add diversity to the roster. Sakurai noted that Banjo and Kazooie were the second most requested character for ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'' in a Nintendo-sanctioned fan vote in 2015, and that their addition happened "quite easily", despite the property being owned by [[Microsoft]] through its acquisition of [[Rare (company)|Rare]]. [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]], the head of [[Xbox]], stated that negotiating their inclusion was "an easy deal to make" thanks to Microsoft's strong partnership with Nintendo.
The development of Fighters Pass Volume 2 was heavily affected by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020, as due to [[stay-at-home order]]s in Japan, Sakurai and his development team had to work remotely. The character's inclusion required the development team to rework every stage in the game in order to accommodate Steve's gameplay mechanics. Sakurai had wanted to include [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] from ''Kingdom Hearts'' in the game because he was the top fighter requested for ''Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'' in the 2015 fan vote. However, they initially thought that the legality surrounding the [[intellectual property]] with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] would be insurmountable, and originally planned for only five fighters in the second pass. However, Sakurai met a Disney representative at an award venue, which facilitated the start of negotiations for Sora's inclusion. Nintendo, Disney, and [[Square Enix]] saw towards including Sora in the game and overseeing all aspects related to his inclusion, with several limitations and guidelines they were required to follow. The Sora Challenger Pack featured a promotional tie-in with the 2020 rhythm game ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory]]'': players with ''Melody of Memory'' save data on their Nintendo Switch would unlock the music track "Dearly Beloved (Swing Version)".
==Release==
[[File:Nintendo booth (29723948888).jpg|right|thumb|Attendees at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] playing a demo of ''Ultimate'']]
''Ultimate'' was teased during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on March 8, 2018, under the [[working title]] ''Super Smash Bros.'', with the release year shown to be 2018. Nintendo formally announced the game at [[E3 2018]], revealing that the full roster of characters from past games would be included, as well as its release date. [[Game demo|Demo]] versions were playable at E3 in June and at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] the following month. ''[[IGN]]'' nominated ''Ultimate'' for its Best Game of E3 2018 award; the game won Best Nintendo Switch Game from both ''IGN'' and [[Gamescom]]. Two Nintendo Direct presentations in 2018, one on August 8 and another one on November 1, were devoted to the game, revealing new characters, stages, and game modes.
Nintendo released ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' worldwide on December 7, 2018. and a Switch with a download code was also released. An additional special edition contained a pair of ''Super Smash Bros.''-themed [[Joy-Con]] as well as a Switch console, a ''Super Smash Bros.''-themed dock, and a download code for the game. A [[GameCube controller]] with the ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' logo was released on November 2, 2018.
One of the game's new additions had the character [[Mr. Game & Watch]] assuming the appearance of a feather- and loincloth-wearing [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] when using one of his attacks—a reference to [[List of Game & Watch games#Fire Attack|''Fire Attack'']] (1982), in which players controlled a [[cowboy]] defending his fort from attacking indigenous people. Some users on social media saw this as racist, leading to Nintendo of America apologizing and removing the animation in an update shortly after release. Two weeks before its release, a leaked copy of the game was distributed across the internet. Nintendo took steps to issue copyright strikes on YouTube videos using [[data mined]] content, while fans worked to isolate [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]], particularly the World of Light story mode, from those that had played the leaked version.

''Ultimate'' received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to the [[review aggregator]] platform [[Metacritic]]. French video game website ''[[Jeuxvideo.com]]'' called it the best game in the series, praising its features which "brilliantly mix gargantuan content with nostalgia". [[Bleacher Report]] hailed the game's colorful art style, faster gameplay, and unique stages. ''[[IGN]]'' praised the game's decision to bring back every character from the series as "ambitious and excellent".
However, the game's online mode received criticism for its technical performance and matchmaking. Many players found significant [[lag (video games)|lag]] affecting their games, even when using wired connections over wireless, while the game's matchmaking features did not adhere to players' criteria, with players frequently playing matches with rule sets they did not choose. The matchmaking process was further criticized for making it difficult for friends to join matches over random players, and not allowing multiple local players to join in online matches. There had been so many complaints on ''Ultimate''{{'s}} [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] that the administrators forwarded all complaints to a separate thread. ''Ultimate''{{'s}} ''World of Light'' mode also received mixed reviews. While some found the single-player mode both accessible and challenging, others found the mode tedious and excessive.
===Sales===
In November 2018, Nintendo announced ''Ultimate'' was the most pre-ordered game for the Switch and in the series. [[The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment]] reported that ''Ultimate'' was the fastest-selling Switch and ''Super Smash Bros.'' game in the United Kingdom, with physical launch sales 302% higher than those for ''Super Smash Bros. for Wii U'', 233% higher than those for ''3DS'', and 62.5% higher than those for ''Brawl''.

[[EVO 2019]], held on August 2–4, 2019, featured ''Ultimate'' as one of its main events. It was the largest offline ''Smash Bros.'' tournament of all time, with 3,534 entrants signed up. It set a new record for EVO concurrent viewership, with over 279,000 viewers during Top 8. On May 8–10, 2020, top ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' player [[Hungrybox]] partnered with [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Le'Veon Bell]] and esports organization [[Team Liquid]] to host The Box, an online tournament with a $10,000 prize pool. With over 8,000 entrants, it was the largest online ''Smash Bros.'' tournament of all time.
In February 2020, it was announced that the Smash World Tour would feature both ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' and ''Ultimate'' players for a grand prize pool of $250,000. The tournament would have included international qualifiers, with the grand finals' location to be in the United States. However, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] quickly led to several of the qualifiers getting either postponed or canceled. The Smash World Tour was successfully relaunched in 2021, featuring a mix of online and offline qualifiers and culminating in a final offline championship. In 2022, an officially licensed circuit was introduced, being the Panda Cup, featuring ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. However on November 24, 2022, Nintendo stated that the Smash World Tour 2022 could not continue, as they did not have a license from Nintendo. Accusations of Panda CEO, Alan Bunney, caused many players who had qualified for the Panda Cup to drop out. This caused both the Panda Cup and the Smash World Tour 2022 Championships to be cancelled, along with the Smash World Tour 2023.
