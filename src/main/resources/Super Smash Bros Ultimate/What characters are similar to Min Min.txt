[[What characters are similar to Min Min]]


Which characters have a similar playstyle to Min Min? I’m still thinking about getting her despite people telling me she’s boring to play. So what characters are kinda similar to her, so I can see if I also like them?


I personally hate every character, so therefore you aren't allowed to play anyone

  
go ahead and name a character. I'll give you at least one reason why you aren't allowed to
    Hmmm… Lucario?
        Rewarded for playing badly, lucario gets aura the higher the damage to them is, meaning attacks get better range and stronger. Its a kind of cheap gimmick
            Imagine outplaying your opponent for 5 minutes and then he hard reads your ledge option with fsmash at 20 percent and you fucking die

Firstly, play whoever you want. There's a lot of characters in this game people label as boring, but as long as you like playing them nothing else matters. 

Secondly, Min Min is quite unique in how her moves work considering both A and B buttons work similarly to each other. However, the characters I would say are most similar are Sephiroth, Byleth and Ike. Their gameplan revolves more around spacing their moves and keeping opponents as far away as possible than most of the cast (unless you count projectile users)
    Thank you! I was mostly just asking because I have to pay money to get the character, so I’m not 100% sure if I won’t to get her or not.
tbh no one is similar to min min, she has a very unique playstyle, even her button inputs are unique
Every characters are hated by a vast amount of people. If you want to play Min Min, it's totally fine.

Belmonts are probably the closest you’d get. They’ve got the narrow disjoints and the tether recovery, they just have projectiles and better ledgetrapping instead of being able to hit them before they get to ledge.
She’s very unique as many others have pointed out, IMO the best way to figure out if you wanna buy it or not is just watch videos/tourney sets of Min Min
    Thanks for the tip!
        You got it!
Snake but youre only allowed to use side b. Have fun.
Maybe samus, snake, young link, or rob. I’m sure there are others but I think min min fits closer into the true zoner archetype than a bit swordie archetype like others have recommended
The only one I can think of is Mega Man.
Byleth might be the closest but min min has a very unique playstyle that doesn't quute fit with any other character
Don't listen to others. Main Min Min if you like her. Hey, I main Ganondorf and I'm asking you that
    I was mostly just asking because idk if I wanna pay money to get her or not lol
That's the neat part there ain't
She's a zoner but in smash she is one of a kind because she doesn't have any projectiles, only long reaching normals (plus a ground only reflector with her up smash). The characters that get the closest to her are the two belmont with their whip
prolly seph ig, long range, pressure from far, struggles when they get closer, and have a bull shit up air and winged form mechanic
Hmmm… Lucario?
    Rewarded for playing badly, lucario gets aura the higher the damage to them is, meaning attacks get better range and stronger. Its a kind of cheap gimmick
