[[I'm picking up Steve. Any tips]]


[deleted]


Maybe go to r/crazyhand if you are wanting some good advice. This subreddit is mostly casuals who never been to tourneys before, so tips here wouldn‚Äôt be as valuable
Here's a tip: put him back down. He doesn't like being picked up.

And be careful, he might bite.
Don‚Äôt.

Please.
    Please.

Do.
        Wait why. It was a joke, you didn‚Äôt deserve that.
            That's just how much everyone hates Steve, i guess. Or my joke was just bad.

Either way, it doesn't bother me. I appreciate you defending me though. You're a real one. ü•∫
    Tell your sweaty friends y'all ruined it by constantly playing busted top 20 characters or relying on cheese lol
        You‚Äôre going to main Steve and still lose lol. 

Steve is undoubtedly good, but I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre acting like he‚Äôs an instant win button.
        Maybe you shouldn't play a game you don't like
Sure. Make sure you always roll in, it's op trust me bro. Always roll from ledge. Don't even worry about placing blocks or mining it's mad over rated. Stock weapons are the best one.
be prepared to get a lot of hate.

the comments here seam to be a great start on how to ignore jerks
Be ready to receive criticism for your choice
Just say "do you wanna like ü•∫üëâüëà kiss under the ender dragon later"
1: Get ready to get hate

2: Steve's smash attacks are really good online, even more if you trap someone using minecart

3: Camp, after all you are playing a campy and hated character, so may as well play him optimally (for you)

4: Remember, if your opponent isn't having fun, you are having all the fun they aren't having!

5: Learn to play against Cloud

Good luck

Jab jab jab jab jab jab jab jab jab‚Ä¶

Minecart randomly & when projectiles

Anvil when above player

Place blocks like Donald Trump‚Äôs Wall when mining for Diamond Hoe.

When you get bored, /op yourself, go into creative mode & /kill @p. 

Easy Gameplanüò†
This‚Äôll get downvoted but it‚Äôs the truth, Steve is hard to pick up. He‚Äôs got his own game plan that you need to get down or else you‚Äôll never get results. He‚Äôs a character I would say is hard to play but easy to win with, meaning once you figure him out your results will skyrocket. However you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll plateau, especially when folks learn the matchup. My region for example is notoriously strong against Steve cause of me lol, it sucks when they just know what to do at all times. 

And being so unique, he‚Äôs also not fun to play as for a large majority of people. Committing to his game plan is boring for lots like myself, and being aggressive gets you actively punished. So just go into it knowing this. People will say you can just mash minecart but they know nothing, that is one of Steve‚Äôs easiest moves to punish AND bait out AND it takes up a resource too. Learn to control yourself and don‚Äôt minecart nearly as much, try using it to catch landings, recover, or to armor certain moves you know are coming. Don‚Äôt just throw it out in neutral unless the opponent is above you.

For placing blocks, I‚Äôve been told trigger jump is better but I use tap jump and it works nicely. For the three high wall for example you just gotta practice the timing. 

Also, use his whole kit, he has lots of fun tricks to try. Many Steve‚Äôs don‚Äôt use TNT enough, it has some crazy ledgetrapping potential when mastered.
    Well said. The character is super strong and has a weird base kit learning curve but, even more of an issue, everyone who plays this game seriously has mastered fighting "default" Steve gameplay out of necessity. Breaking into the more advanced NIL combos, block theory in neutral and ledge traps are what will actually start closing out more wins with the character. That stuff (at least for me) took a ton of research and dedicated consistent training mode time to learn. NIL 2 is still such a challenge to nail consistently.

As a seasoned Steve player, this is a must: Change one of you shoulder buttons to specia, and use that to place block. this will free your right hand for jumping, attacks in combos, and other species. 

Practice building a two block high wall with one jump+double jump, and learn what disjoints hit through it, and at what range. Learn leage traps and practice them until you can do them constantly. Mine as much as possible, and learn the timing to hit an approaching opponent with forward air or back air.

Finally, if you can, play on stages that have a dirt material (battlefield and FD variants work too) because then you will use the shovel when mining, a tool that is not used in attacks, which saves durability on the pickaxe.

Good luck and stay toxic üëë
Don‚Äôt pick him up
Rember to dig
If you don't want to get camped play hero, you're just going to turn into what it sounds like you hate with Steve lol.
    Fine with me. I'm giving the scene a taste of it's own medicine.
        Just know imma walk off three times if we play online fuck off with that noise

*Oough*
Have fun with everyone hating you. And I‚Äôm not saying this to sound mean, but genuinely as a warning, prepare for people to legitimately try and bully you.
There a plenty of good guides on Youtube. Despite what everyone is saying play whoever you want to play. I lotta people hate Steve, but that‚Äôs not a problem with you, it‚Äôs a problem with them. My advice is always to just play around enough until you‚Äôre at least a little familiar with them, but I‚Äôm no professional.

So you hate getting camped, therefore you're going to start camping?
    Says the samus main

Also yes. It's what y'all deserve. Get hard 0 to deathed then out camped.
        I don't camp usually. Also nobody "deserves" shit it's a video game, just admit you're trash and move on
            I have almost max GSP with 5 characters that are all "fundies" based yet can't do anything in brackets due to their limits. None of them are viable in this meta so I'm dropping them for Steve.

It doesn't matter if I am trash if y'all can't stop my Steve.
                Being toxic because you don't enjoy high competitive makes no sense, just don't get into the higher competitive
The mine cart is so shit to deal with.
Lame, ‚Äú I can‚Äôt with the enemy and I don‚Äôt have fun if I don‚Äôt win‚Äù

To be watched in order, for new steves to learn the essentials. The further down you go the less essential it is to learn.
play falcon
Tell your loved ones you're sorry in advance.
Steve is so hype ikr üòç
You go on about your GSP as if it means shit, it doesn't. No one at a local cares how you feel, they will use any strategy to win. You need to understand that seeing these "cheap strategies" as a hard barrier is why you're losing.

You need to really work on your mental both in and out of game. Forming proper solutions to issues instead of being irritated that people are trying to win at all costs. 

A character switch won't help you because you're already being defeated by yourself.
i mean, if you wanna keep friends, dont pick him up, go with someone like mario or fox or snake or smth like that

rlly tho go to r/CrazyHand for good  tips

Btw dont get overconfident just yet. Speaking from experience ( g&w and Sonic main and my dumbass cant get past 4 million gsp)
Don‚Äôt succumb to the dark side. Unless you want your friends to hate you.
Be prepared to lose your friends
Please.

Do.
    Wait why. It was a joke, you didn‚Äôt deserve that.
