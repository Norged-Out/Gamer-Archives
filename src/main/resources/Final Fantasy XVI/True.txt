"I unlocked Ifrit! Why is Find the Flame not playing?"
    "Dig, dig, dig, dig deeper!"
Honestly one of 16s biggest successes in my opinion. They gave every Eikon a user that will probably always be associated to that summon to me for now on. Clive is Ifrit and I will continue to believe his spirit is within every Ifrit from here on out.
    that's me when i see phoenix summon in FF7 Rebirth
        Be yelling “JOSHUA” like Clive does
            Joshua f***ed my shit up in that VR experience.
                Lmao the game asked me if I wanted to reduce the difficulty, to which I replied "I ain't no bitch."

_Narrator_: _He was, indeed, a bitch_
                What VR experience are you referring to? Aside from the FFXV fishing game I wasn’t aware of another VR related thing. If there’s another FF experience then I have no idea how I missed it
                    No, I meant the VR experience from Chadley in the FFVIIRebirth demo.
                        Oh thanks, I didn’t know that was a thing in Remake/Rebirth
                            You gotta play them if you haven't! They're excellent games and they really did do better than anyone probably expected.
                        Where do you find that?
                            Chocobo farm. Chadleys in the corner to the right of the barn
    They simply made the best iterations of Eikons.

XVI's Ifrit is the best Ifrit of all Final Fantasy, same goes for Titan, Shiva, Odin and the rest. And it's not like other FF have tried similar thing in the past.

FF XV has some cases and summons try to have a personality.

FF X's Eikons are straight-up people as well.

XVI just perfected it, it's going to be insanely hard to make another Titan that will surpass XVI's.
        I liked how epic the summons were in XV and that theme of them being massive beings was only perfected in XVI.
        Car Titan in the eden raids is pretty great though
    When FF XVI comes to PC someone needs to mod Clive's Ifrit into FFXV even if it's Wanky
        I NEED to see Clive’s Ifrit break dance dodging Bahamut’s swords
            An eikon battle against ff15 bahamut would have been beyond epic. God i love kaiju fights.
                I wish we got a fight with XVs Bahamut in general. A shame to waste such an amazing design to only a few cinematics
                    RIP Episode Noctis
                        TBF the whole game is an episode Noctis
                    Worse yet you can actually fight him, but it's only in the multiplayer. What a shame.
                    technically you can fight him, although only in the multiplayer.

&#x200B;

which makes sense I suppose, he would have no reason to fight Noctis.  
The Kingsglaive he can fight as a way to prove their worth, sure, but with Noctis, there's no reason for this.
        Just now realizing XVI gave us the best Ifrit
    Exactly, I was replaying FFXV and I was literally like Jill!!!! Omgg
    That, and design wise too. BOY DO THE EIKONS DESIGN GO HARD
    Yep freaking love them! Bahamut was and is my Fav Primal/Summon/Eikon, now with Dion *wink wink*

PS: Cid gives me the but don’t tell my wife!

![gif](giphy|ckB5razpgN2rd4qTfe)
        CID!  Definitely did it and broke my heart too.
            His one liners, his voice, his looks man, all just done perfect!
    And from here on out, I will ALWAYS shout "*Come to me, IFRIT!!!!!!!"*  whenever I summon one in present/future FF titles.
    Not just Clive and Joshua. I now have impossibly high standards concerning Bahamut. I loved ix's relationship between summoner and summons before this.
    Not to mention that it’s the one of the best appearances in the series for nearly all summons
    I feel the same about Bahamut too with Dion
    Exactly my thoughts
    I wish they added more.
        I mean that can be said for any game ever. More more more. I’m fine with what we got. Why worry about the could haves?
I was summoning Ifrit in Remake earlier today and couldn't help but think *Come to me Ifrit!*
    This is already me as a summoner in FF14. I summon Ifrit and put on chat COME TO ME IFRIT XD

I think I might not have Ifrit in Rebirth anymore, but for gods foresaken reasons we will have a way to access summons from Remake in Rebirth, I’d be on cloud nine! :P
        Choco mog was in a rebirth trailer so i assume all the old summons are in rebirth. 

Probably just VR rewards
            I would imagine we'll find the 'true versions' in rebirth as remake has vr versions lol
                Sadly i think most will be obtained through VR. 

VR is used to create materia through combat analysis. Basically the fight rights the AI needed to create them in materia form.
    When Jessie gave me the Ifrit materia, I knew I wasn't ever going to use another summon. Cloud just borrowed Clive from another dimension and asked for some help lmao. 

Also I know it doesn't fit with the tone but I really would've loved a silly ass side quest with the Dominant of Fat Chocobo.
        Ifrit is now Cloud’s summon and Cloud will eternally have fire paired with the elemental material so the buster sword has flames coming out of it.

And wherever it is possible to do this, every FF main character will have the same.
            I'd rather Hades paired with added effect materia for that sweet fuckfest of status applied on each swing
I never realised but this is actually one of FF16s greatest strengths...the summons are probably more memorable than they ever were in FF (barring bahamut for FF14)
    The only other contender is FF8, but obviously it's aged by now. Doomtrain anyone? "Could I offer you a Brothers in this trying time?"
        Theres a reason Dissidia NT and Opera Omnia used the FF8 summons for their games (BECAUSE THEYRE THE BEST)
        I'd say FF 10 would be the only contender.

Eikons are the very core of the story and they're people as well.

14 year old account with no posts outside of the last hour or so other than a nonsense comment on a 14 year old post with a nonsense title.
    How about Phoenix in FF14? (particularly in Bahamut raid and UCoB) For me I was always calling Master Louisoix in VC when we were progressing UCoB for the final phase.
    Bahamut always has the coolest story. Dion is best boy.
I’m gonna miss not becoming the summon. I wanna turn into a giant monster and reap havoc on the world.
    I highly recommend playing FF Type 0 if you want to play as summons. The game is dark and bloody like 16 but has the anime charms of something like 10 or 13
Out of the 3 final fantasy games I've played so far, it's the only game where they make sense and actually are a part of the story. The other games are "what, where, why?" seriously, what, and why?
    They have a pretty big role in X
        And XV!
            Only thing i hate about the way XV handles them is they don’t feel natural within the world. Like the people in XV acknowledge the gods but they are so nonchalant about it. Also the random summon mechanic was lame, should have been a gauge that filled over time during a fight depending on how much magic you had on you or something
                That's true, the gameplay aspect of summons didn't really work in XV - but I liked the story aspect of it. The Ifrit-Shiva arc was so sad, I just wish it had been fleshed out more
                    i lowkey enjoyed the summons in XV showing up whenever the fuck they felt like it lol some good old fashioned realism
                        Literally the only one who ever showed up for me before the final fight was Ramuh, Titan could not be arsed
                            there's something really amusing about that to me. a bunch of summons having the fuckits nonstop
                        yeah honestly the one thing I loved about the summons in XV is that they felt like actual gods, from an actual mythology, from both a worldbuilding, religious and gameplay standpoint.

Yes, i'll defend the gameplay part. They are gods. You don't control them. They lend you their aid just as a real god does. Does god in real life come down from the heavens and give you help at work just because you asked? No, sometimes (or maybe most of the time), you take care of it on your own. But other times, God will call, and its up to you to answer the phone.  


Ramuh wants to help, he calls. You make the choice on if you answer or not. Titan, Leviathan, they all help when they decide to help, but you still need to accept their help. They aren't tools for you to use. They aren't friends you have on speeddial. They are gods and act as such.

One might even say that them not helping, is in and of itself, helping, as its training you to get better at combat in the long run. If you truly want to get insane with an explanation at least.
                            That they can't be controlled, that's it in a nutshell

One thing I didn't appreciate until recently is that everything is deliberate in these games. So having non-help serving as training fits in with the overall narrative somewhere (imo). Maybe so Player can relate to Noctis's journey from pampered moody bro to an adulty adult.
                    I’m a sucker for a good old “fire and ice lovers” plot line. That last kiss that shattered Ifrit was very beautiful in a sad way
            They’re a big part of a certain character’s arc in IV where they also show where they come from in the game.
    6 and 9 also incorporate them heavily into the storyline. In 6 one of the main characters actually is one.
        I see, interesting. I've only played 15, 7remake and 16.
            Yeah I would say 6 does the best job of incorporating them mechanically and they’re HEAVILY involved in the story. I would say 16 does a better job of involving summons in the story.
            You'll probs start to notice these games like to 'recycle' things, only in a way that's pretty creative and different.

Such as when the Character *is* the summon like the other guy says, 'the empire' in some form, major battles where your buddies show up to cheer you on, having an antagonist and an even badder antagonist, the badder guy being some sort of alien that wants to erase the world, bahamut being used to destroy or almost destroy everything, an ancient extinct people that are really good at robotics, environmental allegories/use of nonrenewable resources, reincarnating young women, dead parents are a regular thing, inequality within a advanced society -- Midgar, and there's one in one of the XIV expansions, childhood BFFs, the decay of cloned individuals, royal females being kind of milquetoast, at least at the beginning. [And of course something completely batshit you don't see coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUOOgNzOv4).

I was revisiting IX on youtube and realized the entire point of the plot and its intricacies went over my head when i played it, when I was 14-15.  That's my next one, whenever I get to it

Edit: A resistance leader type character against 'the empire'
                Thats the appeal of FF after all. Every game is different, but they all contain the same themes, iconography and elements. They just do their own thing with all of them.
                    I'm kinda dumb, so i didn't notice the re-use of concepts/elements outright. Like I'd play them, enjoy the ride and not think about things too much, and then move on to the next game. The in-game wiki of 16, i really studied that thing so i had a more cohesive picture of what was going on -- since i felt they were nudging player to put disparate pieces together themselves for a more satisfying experience.

So, pretty much all these games have things that went over my head as a kid, or i didnt pay too much attention to, and im looking forward to revisiting them with this in mind
                        Yeah, final fantasy is an anthology series so that's kinda it's whole thing. All of these games take place in their own unique world with its own lore, aesthetic and story. But those recurring elements, themes and plot points are what tie them all together. And you are right about 16 kinda trying to nudge you on some things that are more implied, rather than directly stated.

FF16 might be dark fantasy, but it's dark final fantasy. So for instance the Eikonoklaste in Japanese are called Summoners. At first it might not make much sense, but I think especially after the dlc, the name makes perfect sense as a darker spin on a final fantasy class. Just instead of summoning the traditional summoned monsters, they instead summoned lifelike magitek creations (the bombs and flans you fight for instance) to life, and were possibly on the verge of summoning actual creatures to life (although in a much more "scientist playing god in a lab" way, as opposed to the normal "magically summons a monster" way).

Other stuff I've seen thats more implied is basically everything with Barnabas, Cid and Benedikta. Where essentially nothing in regards to their dynamic is explicitly stated. The mage cult that got exiled for trying to teach non-bearers to cast magic without crystals (which opens entirely new discussions on its own)... There's a lot here that's not directly stated and instead we just hear bits and pieces of.
        The esper story arc was one of the best parts of 6
    Some games they play an actual role, but for the others they're just gods of nature sort of thing that are always just around. Same as chocobos, they don't really make sense they just exist
    They are massively important in 6, 10 and 15.

Also relevant to the plot in 4, 8, 9 and 13

Tbh 3, 5, 7 and 12 are pretty rare in just having them be something the protagonists can use and not much else.
    They’re pretty big in FFXIV.

Like a major part of the story.
Plays FFXIV.

Summons Phoenix Mount.

My head: **AWAY…AWAAAAY**
Lol XVI has been “ruining” the summons to me since the Awakening trailer lol! When I got Ifrit in Remake all I could think was how pretty his fire was, and how Clive’s fire will be that beautiful. I then wanted a Phoenix materia to come with it. I also put Elemental Materia linked to Fire on Cloud, because in the trailer Clive seemed to put his sword on fire.

Then came Crisis Core Reunion. I remember being overjoyed when I found that there’s Phoenix Materia on the abandoned windmill in Nibelheim! By this time I already had Ifrit iirc. I have Firaga Blade on Zack for obvious reasons. xD

Funny thing, fate goes full circle and Clive actually gets to equip the Buster Sword… I’m not putting that thing down unless I need to record cutscenes! xD

This is ultimately the creative director’s doing… He started it with FF14’s Ysayle—the first person in that game to do summoning using her own body as a vessel for the summon—Shiva!
FF14 conditioned me to recognize Pheonix as Grandfather, not Joshua, but it's hard not think about Joshua when I see Phoenix anywhere else.
Everytime I staggered Phoenix in the FF7Rebirth demo I could hear Clive yelling in the background. T-T
    He'll kill you, he'll -
In FFXIV, once it was learned that the Rising Phoenix mount was a transformation and not a separate creature, players shouting "JOSHUAAAA!!" became such a meme
One thing I really liked about XVI is they made one of the most basic summons, Ifrit, into pretty much the face of the game.

What was once a simple design of "flame demon cast big fire attack" now turns into something that's more of a flaming berserker that has a very agile and speedy fighting style to offset his smaller size.

Even FFXIV, which used a rather similar design as XVI, had Ifrit as the first Summon/Primal you fight and he's very low on the power scale compared to other things you'll fight there.
    They turned one of the most basic summons into the most badass, and arguably the strongest one in FF16(at least top 3)
And every time I see ifrit and Phoenix in close proximity, I will think of banjo-kazooie
Thats me with Shiva in particular. Just hi Jill hiiii I'm sorry they put you in such annoyingly tiny bikini for the 16th time (bc 16 itself doesnt) thank youuu I love youuu

(Ramuh in Rebirth Demo too admittedly. Just "hey its zaddy" in Ben Starr's voice)
Legit if they go back to the old Ifrit design after this, I'mma be disappointed, 16 Ifrit is one of the best designs I've ever seen
Every time summoning Ifrit in 7 Remake: “Thanks Clive!”

Every time fighting Ifrit in Crisis Core Reunion: “Fuck off, Clive”
Ooh now if I ever get around to replaying ffx I have good things to name the aeons...
I am playing the Yuffie DLC for FF7 remake and you fight Ramuh in the VR arena, instantly thought of Cid.
Does not help for me that XVI probably has the best summon designs in the series tied with X
I think FF15 summons have affected my expectations more. Though I'm probably nearly alone in that.

It happened in the FF7 Rebirth demo when I got to summon Ramuh and while I was expecting a cutscene to play showing Ramuh obliterating the enemies, I got caught off guard when he just kinda hung around and zapped monsters a bit.

I think the reason why FF16 isn't coming to mind is because you didn't really summon during battles. The Eikons were completely restricted to scripted battles.
In Final Fantasy XIII, are Stiria and Nix both Jill?
    Motorcycle Jill vroom vroom
playing FF7 Remake rn and watching Ifrit be weak again is pissing me off
For me it's more the designs. I bist can't imagine Ifrit looking anything other than in XVI from here on out. Or Bahamut 😍
I was playing the DLC for FF7 Remake last night and when I saw Ramuh pop up in the VR missions, I was like “oh shit, it’s Cid!”
Can someone please mod one of the pixel games to just rename all summons with human names?

"Jill - Diamond Dust"
So phoenix downs are basically joshoua’s pubes?
I really like how this sub has become 16 vs 7 rebirth
Every time I see Garuda I’m going to think of breast implants.
I'm watching someone play FF7 Rebirth and that was immediately what happened lol. Every time I see Phoenix too I think that now
I cant be the only one that felt like ff16 was a decent game but wasn't a final fantasy title. I didn't much care for it tbh but I can see why people enjoyed it. It just doesn't feel like a final fantasy game to me.
    I mean for most people the "final fantasy" in the title is what makes it a final fantasy game. The games have been evolving and changing, it's a wonder that the fanbase hasn't gotten used to that yet. The games will continue to change, and continue to deviate from whatever idea you have of what "final fantasy" is. Get used to it and stop bitching, people like you are morons who just waste your efforts whining about something you don't even understand.
        I dont think you understand my complaint. It's not that the systems have changed, im open to new combat and new stories. The game felt hollow and short. The sidequests were meaningless and repetitive. It's the only final fantasy game that I've played that didn't evoke any emotion from me, nor any sense of needing to build a strategy.
            That just seems like a very personal disconnect with the game lmao, plenty of people got very emotional with the game. Short? If you do the main story and most side quests then you should be approaching 50 hours easily. I'm not a completionist, I'm not going for platinum, I'm not doing FF mode yet, and I've almost got 70 hours. The early game side quests were meaningless, but that's how it is in every JRPG. Endgame side quests were all very important, I think anyone can agree with that. Character development and lore, >!the fact Theodore died being a completely optional side quest event with an akashic dragon boss fight??!<. On your point that the game felt hollow, this is one of the most cohesively narrated final fantasy stories we've had, it's both easy to digest and still has depth. If *you* didn't feel any of these things, how does that make the game any less "final fantasy"? Instead of it being a game you just simply don't mesh with, it surely must be the identity of the game within the series itself that's conflicted, right?
                Dude, you need to calm the fuck down, all I said was it didn't feel like final fantasy to me, I've played them all. I even said I understood why people enjoy it. I can see why it was liked. It just didn't have the same appeal to me. But your right, im a moron who just doesn't understand modern games I guess. Clearly I shouldn't state my opinion on subreddits you frequent. Any others I should avoid?
                    I have no idea why you got so butthurt that I called you a moron in my first reply, and decided to respond to that now with my second reply? Trust me, I'm calm. If someone criticises your reasoning for your opinion, do you always immediately just shut down? Once again, why not actually respond to my second reply instead having a delayed reaction of victimhood now that we've gotten to me actually explaining why most of your criticisms make no sense? State your opinion as much as you want, and I'll state mine. That's how discourse works, but this is  actually a completely confusing reaction from you. First time talking to someone who disagrees with you?
                        I have a different opinion and you respond by name calling and im the one acting childish? I stated how the game made ME feel. You can feel like I'm wrong but adults don't discuss opinions by saying "your an idiot, me and my friends liked it". It wasn't for me, that's all I said. I stated how the game felt to me. This isn't discourse, it's just trolling at this point. I'm sorry my opinion made you feel like you needed to attack me as a person. I wish you well in future endeavors.
                I understand that you feel it was a personal attack against your ability to tell shit from food by me stating it wasn't for me but, maybe it's OK for us to have different opinions. I don't think it makes either of us dumb
                    I'm not even gonna respond properly to this, you gave your reasons why you think it's "not a final fantasy game", so I explained why I think those reasons are bullshit. You have now just not responded to my points at all, at least when I insult people I mix in actual points.
                        Cool
    You'd have a much easier time getting sympathy for your point if you didnt say stuff like "It's not Final Fantasy". Im sorry thats terrible criticism. Everything else you say has some merit but not really that
        I didn't say it wasn't, I said I can't be the only person that FELT like it was a decent game but not a final fantasy game. I litterally said that to me it didn't feel like a final fantasy game.
It got me on the first half. But i can only agree with this stranger
There's a very minor npc in Infinite Wealth called Ifrit. I immediately thought about Clive when I saw it's name.
    I have 70 hours in it and I have NOT seen him
        He's one of those NPCs you can greet as you walk around. He's a fire dancer near the road west of the orphanage.
JOSHUAAAAA
Now when do we get another Anima summon like please
Can’t wait to beat the snozz out of Joshua in the combat simulator.
Me when summoning Ramuh in the FF7RB Demo: "Oh hey, Cid..." 😭
Going to go play Final Fantasy 8 and summon my wheelly good friend "Thomas". Not sure what the Fat Controller has been feeding him though.
Come to me EEFREET!!!

Up until 16 I pronounced it IF-RIT

Alot of the other summons from past games look like chibi versions to me now lol.
I play marvel snap and had a Phoenix force deck named JOSHUAAAAA!! I feel this lol
"Come to me Ifrit!" I will never forget this line
This happened when I fought ifrit in ever crisis, I was like "oh hi clive"
I gotta use Joshua's Hair as Phoenix Downs now xD hahahaha
JOSHUAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Not just Joshua more like “JOSHUA !!!”
for me its that or >!louisoix!<
True chads think of Tenzen when they see Phoenix 😎
So you're reverse Dion.
The summons are used differently in the other so I can go back to them, but it's going to be weird going back to 15.
Like I thought the Titan, Leviathan, and Ifrit fights were epic.
Now they're probably just going to be like very mediocre
Me, playing FF15: Come on, Dion, leave Clive alone!
This was me during my final fantasy 
 Vii remake  playthrough. Anytime I summoned ifrit, I’d say “release the sad boy!!”  and confuse my brother who was watching me play. 😂😂😂
Lol 100% 
I haven't been a long time fan of the series or anything, played about a quarter of FF14 and completed FF7 remake before I played FF16. 

And I swear since I completed the game, I'll  see images or videos of Summons which I'd already seen BEFORE 16, and I still get a little annoyed 🤣 I be like "Uhg, that looks weird...That ain't Ifrit". 
Even calling them Summons doesn't sound right. 

After so many installments of the series, it was a really smart way to handle the Summons this time around by making them Eikons, with each attached to their own character. But just like other FF games, they also allowed you - the player to use a number of Different Summons by of Clive being Mythos being able to absorb all the other Eikons.
You gave me an idea when I do the summons in rebirth 🤣🤣🤣
Truth
Wonder who used Odin better Lighting or the King?
JOSHUAAAAAA
Joshua kicked my ass a couple times in the Rebirth demo.
Literally me in FFXIV when I fought Bahamut.

Said “Sup Dion” without thinking and my party members were wondering wtf I was talking about.
He lives rent free
I keep looking at Bahamut and immediately just think "oh look it's dion"
any time I play another ff I shout come to me ifrit whenever I see ifrit as an esper or summon it's bad
Hey that’s my friend!
Playing as the Eikons was so awesome too prob my fav part of the game. Not being able to control them in other FF games is gonna be hard now
False
Played rebirth demo and summoned Ramuh and I was like oh hi Cid good to see you.
Idk I still associate Odin & Shiva w Lightning & Snow
FFXVI undoubtedly did summons the best. FFVII may be my favorite Final Fantasy overall, but every time I summon Ifrit in Remake, I can subconsciously hear Clive screaming, *”COME TO ME IFRIT!”* in my brain. Plus, Ifrit has NEVER looked better than he does FFXVI. One of the sickest and rawest character designs ever. 💯🔥 I feel like all of the summons look and feel the most fleshed out and well respected in FFXVI as well. FFXVII has heavy shoes to lift and walk in following up what CBU3 accomplished.
Then cry a lil bit 🥹
lol, it’s true. I named my phoenix mount in FF14 Joshua.
I know what you mean Ifrit until 16 was always one of the weaker summons there will never be an Ifrit as powerful as Clive again
Is this really a spoiler when its in the first hour of the game and all the promos?
Quick question, I wasn't super into 15, should I give 16 a try? Combat feel is a big deal for me and 15's didn't quite feel good so I didn't stick with it.
I replayed FF7 Remake and every time I summoned Ifrit I yelled "COME TO ME IFRIT"


And when I summoned Shiva I said "JILLLLLL"
Not even sure if ff16 is anywhere near the top of my ff list, but man after playing it, it’s hard not to feel like every other single game’s summons are somewhat pathetic looking in comparison to the eikons
I am the summon!
JOSHUAAAA!
Unironically, XVI has ruined summons for me forever.

Like seriously, HOW would they top any of that without making them a major focus again? And I thought XV's were awe inspiring lmao
"Dig, dig, dig, dig deeper!"
that's me when i see phoenix summon in FF7 Rebirth
    Be yelling “JOSHUA” like Clive does
        Joshua f***ed my shit up in that VR experience.
            Lmao the game asked me if I wanted to reduce the difficulty, to which I replied "I ain't no bitch."

            What VR experience are you referring to? Aside from the FFXV fishing game I wasn’t aware of another VR related thing. If there’s another FF experience then I have no idea how I missed it
                No, I meant the VR experience from Chadley in the FFVIIRebirth demo.
                    Oh thanks, I didn’t know that was a thing in Remake/Rebirth
                        You gotta play them if you haven't! They're excellent games and they really did do better than anyone probably expected.
                    Where do you find that?

They simply made the best iterations of Eikons.

XVI's Ifrit is the best Ifrit of all Final Fantasy, same goes for Titan, Shiva, Odin and the rest. And it's not like other FF have tried similar thing in the past.

FF XV has some cases and summons try to have a personality.

FF X's Eikons are straight-up people as well.

XVI just perfected it, it's going to be insanely hard to make another Titan that will surpass XVI's.
    I liked how epic the summons were in XV and that theme of them being massive beings was only perfected in XVI.
    Car Titan in the eden raids is pretty great though
When FF XVI comes to PC someone needs to mod Clive's Ifrit into FFXV even if it's Wanky
    I NEED to see Clive’s Ifrit break dance dodging Bahamut’s swords
        An eikon battle against ff15 bahamut would have been beyond epic. God i love kaiju fights.
            I wish we got a fight with XVs Bahamut in general. A shame to waste such an amazing design to only a few cinematics
                RIP Episode Noctis
                    TBF the whole game is an episode Noctis
                Worse yet you can actually fight him, but it's only in the multiplayer. What a shame.
                technically you can fight him, although only in the multiplayer.

&#x200B;

which makes sense I suppose, he would have no reason to fight Noctis.  
The Kingsglaive he can fight as a way to prove their worth, sure, but with Noctis, there's no reason for this.
    Just now realizing XVI gave us the best Ifrit
Exactly, I was replaying FFXV and I was literally like Jill!!!! Omgg
That, and design wise too. BOY DO THE EIKONS DESIGN GO HARD
Yep freaking love them! Bahamut was and is my Fav Primal/Summon/Eikon, now with Dion *wink wink*

PS: Cid gives me the but don’t tell my wife!

![gif](giphy|ckB5razpgN2rd4qTfe)
    CID!  Definitely did it and broke my heart too.
        His one liners, his voice, his looks man, all just done perfect!
And from here on out, I will ALWAYS shout "*Come to me, IFRIT!!!!!!!"*  whenever I summon one in present/future FF titles.
Not just Clive and Joshua. I now have impossibly high standards concerning Bahamut. I loved ix's relationship between summoner and summons before this.
Not to mention that it’s the one of the best appearances in the series for nearly all summons
I feel the same about Bahamut too with Dion
Exactly my thoughts
I wish they added more.
    I mean that can be said for any game ever. More more more. I’m fine with what we got. Why worry about the could haves?
This is already me as a summoner in FF14. I summon Ifrit and put on chat COME TO ME IFRIT XD

I think I might not have Ifrit in Rebirth anymore, but for gods foresaken reasons we will have a way to access summons from Remake in Rebirth, I’d be on cloud nine! :P
    Choco mog was in a rebirth trailer so i assume all the old summons are in rebirth. 

Probably just VR rewards
        I would imagine we'll find the 'true versions' in rebirth as remake has vr versions lol
            Sadly i think most will be obtained through VR. 

VR is used to create materia through combat analysis. Basically the fight rights the AI needed to create them in materia form.
When Jessie gave me the Ifrit materia, I knew I wasn't ever going to use another summon. Cloud just borrowed Clive from another dimension and asked for some help lmao. 

Also I know it doesn't fit with the tone but I really would've loved a silly ass side quest with the Dominant of Fat Chocobo.
    Ifrit is now Cloud’s summon and Cloud will eternally have fire paired with the elemental material so the buster sword has flames coming out of it.

And wherever it is possible to do this, every FF main character will have the same.
        I'd rather Hades paired with added effect materia for that sweet fuckfest of status applied on each swing
The only other contender is FF8, but obviously it's aged by now. Doomtrain anyone? "Could I offer you a Brothers in this trying time?"
    Theres a reason Dissidia NT and Opera Omnia used the FF8 summons for their games (BECAUSE THEYRE THE BEST)
    I'd say FF 10 would be the only contender.

Eikons are the very core of the story and they're people as well.

How about Phoenix in FF14? (particularly in Bahamut raid and UCoB) For me I was always calling Master Louisoix in VC when we were progressing UCoB for the final phase.
Bahamut always has the coolest story. Dion is best boy.
I highly recommend playing FF Type 0 if you want to play as summons. The game is dark and bloody like 16 but has the anime charms of something like 10 or 13
They have a pretty big role in X
    And XV!
        Only thing i hate about the way XV handles them is they don’t feel natural within the world. Like the people in XV acknowledge the gods but they are so nonchalant about it. Also the random summon mechanic was lame, should have been a gauge that filled over time during a fight depending on how much magic you had on you or something
            That's true, the gameplay aspect of summons didn't really work in XV - but I liked the story aspect of it. The Ifrit-Shiva arc was so sad, I just wish it had been fleshed out more
                i lowkey enjoyed the summons in XV showing up whenever the fuck they felt like it lol some good old fashioned realism
                    Literally the only one who ever showed up for me before the final fight was Ramuh, Titan could not be arsed
                        there's something really amusing about that to me. a bunch of summons having the fuckits nonstop
                    yeah honestly the one thing I loved about the summons in XV is that they felt like actual gods, from an actual mythology, from both a worldbuilding, religious and gameplay standpoint.

Yes, i'll defend the gameplay part. They are gods. You don't control them. They lend you their aid just as a real god does. Does god in real life come down from the heavens and give you help at work just because you asked? No, sometimes (or maybe most of the time), you take care of it on your own. But other times, God will call, and its up to you to answer the phone.  


Ramuh wants to help, he calls. You make the choice on if you answer or not. Titan, Leviathan, they all help when they decide to help, but you still need to accept their help. They aren't tools for you to use. They aren't friends you have on speeddial. They are gods and act as such.

One might even say that them not helping, is in and of itself, helping, as its training you to get better at combat in the long run. If you truly want to get insane with an explanation at least.
                        That they can't be controlled, that's it in a nutshell

One thing I didn't appreciate until recently is that everything is deliberate in these games. So having non-help serving as training fits in with the overall narrative somewhere (imo). Maybe so Player can relate to Noctis's journey from pampered moody bro to an adulty adult.
                I’m a sucker for a good old “fire and ice lovers” plot line. That last kiss that shattered Ifrit was very beautiful in a sad way
        They’re a big part of a certain character’s arc in IV where they also show where they come from in the game.
6 and 9 also incorporate them heavily into the storyline. In 6 one of the main characters actually is one.
    I see, interesting. I've only played 15, 7remake and 16.
        Yeah I would say 6 does the best job of incorporating them mechanically and they’re HEAVILY involved in the story. I would say 16 does a better job of involving summons in the story.
        You'll probs start to notice these games like to 'recycle' things, only in a way that's pretty creative and different.

Such as when the Character *is* the summon like the other guy says, 'the empire' in some form, major battles where your buddies show up to cheer you on, having an antagonist and an even badder antagonist, the badder guy being some sort of alien that wants to erase the world, bahamut being used to destroy or almost destroy everything, an ancient extinct people that are really good at robotics, environmental allegories/use of nonrenewable resources, reincarnating young women, dead parents are a regular thing, inequality within a advanced society -- Midgar, and there's one in one of the XIV expansions, childhood BFFs, the decay of cloned individuals, royal females being kind of milquetoast, at least at the beginning. [And of course something completely batshit you don't see coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUOOgNzOv4).

I was revisiting IX on youtube and realized the entire point of the plot and its intricacies went over my head when i played it, when I was 14-15.  That's my next one, whenever I get to it

Edit: A resistance leader type character against 'the empire'
            Thats the appeal of FF after all. Every game is different, but they all contain the same themes, iconography and elements. They just do their own thing with all of them.
                I'm kinda dumb, so i didn't notice the re-use of concepts/elements outright. Like I'd play them, enjoy the ride and not think about things too much, and then move on to the next game. The in-game wiki of 16, i really studied that thing so i had a more cohesive picture of what was going on -- since i felt they were nudging player to put disparate pieces together themselves for a more satisfying experience.

So, pretty much all these games have things that went over my head as a kid, or i didnt pay too much attention to, and im looking forward to revisiting them with this in mind
                    Yeah, final fantasy is an anthology series so that's kinda it's whole thing. All of these games take place in their own unique world with its own lore, aesthetic and story. But those recurring elements, themes and plot points are what tie them all together. And you are right about 16 kinda trying to nudge you on some things that are more implied, rather than directly stated.

FF16 might be dark fantasy, but it's dark final fantasy. So for instance the Eikonoklaste in Japanese are called Summoners. At first it might not make much sense, but I think especially after the dlc, the name makes perfect sense as a darker spin on a final fantasy class. Just instead of summoning the traditional summoned monsters, they instead summoned lifelike magitek creations (the bombs and flans you fight for instance) to life, and were possibly on the verge of summoning actual creatures to life (although in a much more "scientist playing god in a lab" way, as opposed to the normal "magically summons a monster" way).

Other stuff I've seen thats more implied is basically everything with Barnabas, Cid and Benedikta. Where essentially nothing in regards to their dynamic is explicitly stated. The mage cult that got exiled for trying to teach non-bearers to cast magic without crystals (which opens entirely new discussions on its own)... There's a lot here that's not directly stated and instead we just hear bits and pieces of.
    The esper story arc was one of the best parts of 6
Some games they play an actual role, but for the others they're just gods of nature sort of thing that are always just around. Same as chocobos, they don't really make sense they just exist
They are massively important in 6, 10 and 15.

Also relevant to the plot in 4, 8, 9 and 13

Tbh 3, 5, 7 and 12 are pretty rare in just having them be something the protagonists can use and not much else.
They’re pretty big in FFXIV.

Like a major part of the story.
He'll kill you, he'll -
They turned one of the most basic summons into the most badass, and arguably the strongest one in FF16(at least top 3)
Motorcycle Jill vroom vroom
I mean for most people the "final fantasy" in the title is what makes it a final fantasy game. The games have been evolving and changing, it's a wonder that the fanbase hasn't gotten used to that yet. The games will continue to change, and continue to deviate from whatever idea you have of what "final fantasy" is. Get used to it and stop bitching, people like you are morons who just waste your efforts whining about something you don't even understand.
    I dont think you understand my complaint. It's not that the systems have changed, im open to new combat and new stories. The game felt hollow and short. The sidequests were meaningless and repetitive. It's the only final fantasy game that I've played that didn't evoke any emotion from me, nor any sense of needing to build a strategy.
        That just seems like a very personal disconnect with the game lmao, plenty of people got very emotional with the game. Short? If you do the main story and most side quests then you should be approaching 50 hours easily. I'm not a completionist, I'm not going for platinum, I'm not doing FF mode yet, and I've almost got 70 hours. The early game side quests were meaningless, but that's how it is in every JRPG. Endgame side quests were all very important, I think anyone can agree with that. Character development and lore, >!the fact Theodore died being a completely optional side quest event with an akashic dragon boss fight??!<. On your point that the game felt hollow, this is one of the most cohesively narrated final fantasy stories we've had, it's both easy to digest and still has depth. If *you* didn't feel any of these things, how does that make the game any less "final fantasy"? Instead of it being a game you just simply don't mesh with, it surely must be the identity of the game within the series itself that's conflicted, right?
            Dude, you need to calm the fuck down, all I said was it didn't feel like final fantasy to me, I've played them all. I even said I understood why people enjoy it. I can see why it was liked. It just didn't have the same appeal to me. But your right, im a moron who just doesn't understand modern games I guess. Clearly I shouldn't state my opinion on subreddits you frequent. Any others I should avoid?
                I have no idea why you got so butthurt that I called you a moron in my first reply, and decided to respond to that now with my second reply? Trust me, I'm calm. If someone criticises your reasoning for your opinion, do you always immediately just shut down? Once again, why not actually respond to my second reply instead having a delayed reaction of victimhood now that we've gotten to me actually explaining why most of your criticisms make no sense? State your opinion as much as you want, and I'll state mine. That's how discourse works, but this is  actually a completely confusing reaction from you. First time talking to someone who disagrees with you?
                    I have a different opinion and you respond by name calling and im the one acting childish? I stated how the game made ME feel. You can feel like I'm wrong but adults don't discuss opinions by saying "your an idiot, me and my friends liked it". It wasn't for me, that's all I said. I stated how the game felt to me. This isn't discourse, it's just trolling at this point. I'm sorry my opinion made you feel like you needed to attack me as a person. I wish you well in future endeavors.
            I understand that you feel it was a personal attack against your ability to tell shit from food by me stating it wasn't for me but, maybe it's OK for us to have different opinions. I don't think it makes either of us dumb
                I'm not even gonna respond properly to this, you gave your reasons why you think it's "not a final fantasy game", so I explained why I think those reasons are bullshit. You have now just not responded to my points at all, at least when I insult people I mix in actual points.
                    Cool
You'd have a much easier time getting sympathy for your point if you didnt say stuff like "It's not Final Fantasy". Im sorry thats terrible criticism. Everything else you say has some merit but not really that
    I didn't say it wasn't, I said I can't be the only person that FELT like it was a decent game but not a final fantasy game. I litterally said that to me it didn't feel like a final fantasy game.
I have 70 hours in it and I have NOT seen him
    He's one of those NPCs you can greet as you walk around. He's a fire dancer near the road west of the orphanage.

        I understand that you feel it was a personal attack against your ability to tell shit from food by me stating it wasn't for me but, maybe it's OK for us to have different opinions. I don't think it makes either of us dumb
            I'm not even gonna respond properly to this, you gave your reasons why you think it's "not a final fantasy game", so I explained why I think those reasons are bullshit. You have now just not responded to my points at all, at least when I insult people I mix in actual points.
                Cool
I didn't say it wasn't, I said I can't be the only person that FELT like it was a decent game but not a final fantasy game. I litterally said that to me it didn't feel like a final fantasy game.
He's one of those NPCs you can greet as you walk around. He's a fire dancer near the road west of the orphanage.
Joshua f***ed my shit up in that VR experience.
    Lmao the game asked me if I wanted to reduce the difficulty, to which I replied "I ain't no bitch."

_Narrator_: _He was, indeed, a bitch_
    What VR experience are you referring to? Aside from the FFXV fishing game I wasn’t aware of another VR related thing. If there’s another FF experience then I have no idea how I missed it
        No, I meant the VR experience from Chadley in the FFVIIRebirth demo.
            Oh thanks, I didn’t know that was a thing in Remake/Rebirth
                You gotta play them if you haven't! They're excellent games and they really did do better than anyone probably expected.
            Where do you find that?

An eikon battle against ff15 bahamut would have been beyond epic. God i love kaiju fights.
    I wish we got a fight with XVs Bahamut in general. A shame to waste such an amazing design to only a few cinematics
        RIP Episode Noctis
            TBF the whole game is an episode Noctis
        Worse yet you can actually fight him, but it's only in the multiplayer. What a shame.
        technically you can fight him, although only in the multiplayer.

&#x200B;

which makes sense I suppose, he would have no reason to fight Noctis.  
The Kingsglaive he can fight as a way to prove their worth, sure, but with Noctis, there's no reason for this.
His one liners, his voice, his looks man, all just done perfect!
I would imagine we'll find the 'true versions' in rebirth as remake has vr versions lol
    Sadly i think most will be obtained through VR. 

VR is used to create materia through combat analysis. Basically the fight rights the AI needed to create them in materia form.
I'd rather Hades paired with added effect materia for that sweet fuckfest of status applied on each swing
Only thing i hate about the way XV handles them is they don’t feel natural within the world. Like the people in XV acknowledge the gods but they are so nonchalant about it. Also the random summon mechanic was lame, should have been a gauge that filled over time during a fight depending on how much magic you had on you or something
    That's true, the gameplay aspect of summons didn't really work in XV - but I liked the story aspect of it. The Ifrit-Shiva arc was so sad, I just wish it had been fleshed out more
        i lowkey enjoyed the summons in XV showing up whenever the fuck they felt like it lol some good old fashioned realism
            Literally the only one who ever showed up for me before the final fight was Ramuh, Titan could not be arsed
                there's something really amusing about that to me. a bunch of summons having the fuckits nonstop
            yeah honestly the one thing I loved about the summons in XV is that they felt like actual gods, from an actual mythology, from both a worldbuilding, religious and gameplay standpoint.

Yes, i'll defend the gameplay part. They are gods. You don't control them. They lend you their aid just as a real god does. Does god in real life come down from the heavens and give you help at work just because you asked? No, sometimes (or maybe most of the time), you take care of it on your own. But other times, God will call, and its up to you to answer the phone.  


Ramuh wants to help, he calls. You make the choice on if you answer or not. Titan, Leviathan, they all help when they decide to help, but you still need to accept their help. They aren't tools for you to use. They aren't friends you have on speeddial. They are gods and act as such.

One might even say that them not helping, is in and of itself, helping, as its training you to get better at combat in the long run. If you truly want to get insane with an explanation at least.
                That they can't be controlled, that's it in a nutshell

One thing I didn't appreciate until recently is that everything is deliberate in these games. So having non-help serving as training fits in with the overall narrative somewhere (imo). Maybe so Player can relate to Noctis's journey from pampered moody bro to an adulty adult.
        I’m a sucker for a good old “fire and ice lovers” plot line. That last kiss that shattered Ifrit was very beautiful in a sad way
They’re a big part of a certain character’s arc in IV where they also show where they come from in the game.
Yeah I would say 6 does the best job of incorporating them mechanically and they’re HEAVILY involved in the story. I would say 16 does a better job of involving summons in the story.
You'll probs start to notice these games like to 'recycle' things, only in a way that's pretty creative and different.

Such as when the Character *is* the summon like the other guy says, 'the empire' in some form, major battles where your buddies show up to cheer you on, having an antagonist and an even badder antagonist, the badder guy being some sort of alien that wants to erase the world, bahamut being used to destroy or almost destroy everything, an ancient extinct people that are really good at robotics, environmental allegories/use of nonrenewable resources, reincarnating young women, dead parents are a regular thing, inequality within a advanced society -- Midgar, and there's one in one of the XIV expansions, childhood BFFs, the decay of cloned individuals, royal females being kind of milquetoast, at least at the beginning. [And of course something completely batshit you don't see coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUOOgNzOv4).

I was revisiting IX on youtube and realized the entire point of the plot and its intricacies went over my head when i played it, when I was 14-15.  That's my next one, whenever I get to it

Edit: A resistance leader type character against 'the empire'
    Thats the appeal of FF after all. Every game is different, but they all contain the same themes, iconography and elements. They just do their own thing with all of them.
        I'm kinda dumb, so i didn't notice the re-use of concepts/elements outright. Like I'd play them, enjoy the ride and not think about things too much, and then move on to the next game. The in-game wiki of 16, i really studied that thing so i had a more cohesive picture of what was going on -- since i felt they were nudging player to put disparate pieces together themselves for a more satisfying experience.

So, pretty much all these games have things that went over my head as a kid, or i didnt pay too much attention to, and im looking forward to revisiting them with this in mind
            Yeah, final fantasy is an anthology series so that's kinda it's whole thing. All of these games take place in their own unique world with its own lore, aesthetic and story. But those recurring elements, themes and plot points are what tie them all together. And you are right about 16 kinda trying to nudge you on some things that are more implied, rather than directly stated.

FF16 might be dark fantasy, but it's dark final fantasy. So for instance the Eikonoklaste in Japanese are called Summoners. At first it might not make much sense, but I think especially after the dlc, the name makes perfect sense as a darker spin on a final fantasy class. Just instead of summoning the traditional summoned monsters, they instead summoned lifelike magitek creations (the bombs and flans you fight for instance) to life, and were possibly on the verge of summoning actual creatures to life (although in a much more "scientist playing god in a lab" way, as opposed to the normal "magically summons a monster" way).

Other stuff I've seen thats more implied is basically everything with Barnabas, Cid and Benedikta. Where essentially nothing in regards to their dynamic is explicitly stated. The mage cult that got exiled for trying to teach non-bearers to cast magic without crystals (which opens entirely new discussions on its own)... There's a lot here that's not directly stated and instead we just hear bits and pieces of.
That just seems like a very personal disconnect with the game lmao, plenty of people got very emotional with the game. Short? If you do the main story and most side quests then you should be approaching 50 hours easily. I'm not a completionist, I'm not going for platinum, I'm not doing FF mode yet, and I've almost got 70 hours. The early game side quests were meaningless, but that's how it is in every JRPG. Endgame side quests were all very important, I think anyone can agree with that. Character development and lore, >!the fact Theodore died being a completely optional side quest event with an akashic dragon boss fight??!<. On your point that the game felt hollow, this is one of the most cohesively narrated final fantasy stories we've had, it's both easy to digest and still has depth. If *you* didn't feel any of these things, how does that make the game any less "final fantasy"? Instead of it being a game you just simply don't mesh with, it surely must be the identity of the game within the series itself that's conflicted, right?
    Dude, you need to calm the fuck down, all I said was it didn't feel like final fantasy to me, I've played them all. I even said I understood why people enjoy it. I can see why it was liked. It just didn't have the same appeal to me. But your right, im a moron who just doesn't understand modern games I guess. Clearly I shouldn't state my opinion on subreddits you frequent. Any others I should avoid?
        I have no idea why you got so butthurt that I called you a moron in my first reply, and decided to respond to that now with my second reply? Trust me, I'm calm. If someone criticises your reasoning for your opinion, do you always immediately just shut down? Once again, why not actually respond to my second reply instead having a delayed reaction of victimhood now that we've gotten to me actually explaining why most of your criticisms make no sense? State your opinion as much as you want, and I'll state mine. That's how discourse works, but this is  actually a completely confusing reaction from you. First time talking to someone who disagrees with you?
            I have a different opinion and you respond by name calling and im the one acting childish? I stated how the game made ME feel. You can feel like I'm wrong but adults don't discuss opinions by saying "your an idiot, me and my friends liked it". It wasn't for me, that's all I said. I stated how the game felt to me. This isn't discourse, it's just trolling at this point. I'm sorry my opinion made you feel like you needed to attack me as a person. I wish you well in future endeavors.
    I understand that you feel it was a personal attack against your ability to tell shit from food by me stating it wasn't for me but, maybe it's OK for us to have different opinions. I don't think it makes either of us dumb
