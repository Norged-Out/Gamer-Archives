[[I realised Cid knew alot more than we thought]]


While watching a YouTuber playthrough, I rewatched the cutscene just after the Fight with Typhon when we first see Ultima. 

When Cid sees him try to take Clive, he says "I know who you are, and I won't let you have him" 

I didn't notice this in my playthrough or think it through, but Seeing as how basically everyone else in Valesthea was clueless about Ultima, it seems Cid already has knowledge of him just by his appearance alone. His lack of confusion and immediate interrupting of Ultima taking Clive also tells me that by this point, Cid has likely figured out the mystery behind Clives existence and the whole 2nd dominant of fire thing. 

Seeing as hes a former Commander of Waloed, Cid likely caught wind of everything going on since Barnabas was basically controlled by Ultima early on, and most likely played a role in him leaving the Kingdom of Waloed. 
That whole sequence of events could warrant a cool DLC backstory for Cid.

There is also mention in the Active Time Lore that Dominants of Ramuh tend to be more wise/aware of a bigger picture that never really gets specified.
    This is the answer, and why the ATL is so crucial to understanding the world.
        Other interesting tidbits:  
\- Ramuh has the 'wise intelligent summon' thing going on in a number of FF games (ff14 and ff15 come to mind)

\- Cid in the other FF games is usually not just an engineer, but a defector from the evil empire who makes it his mission to take down that empire. He did this in ff4, ff6, ff14, and probably others in the series that I'm not remembering (I also haven't beaten 5, 8 and 9 yet).
            That is a neat observation! Though we should quality that "makes it his/her mission to take down an empire" encompasses almost every party member (and allies) in each game where there is an evil empire, so it's a slightly less unique trait than one might think :p
                Right-the point I was making is that Cid in a number of games is a defector- having previously worked as an engineer for said empire.
                    Sure, I was ribbing that "goes against the empire" is pretty common around these parts.

(I actually couldn't remember what FF7 Cid's position on Shinra (which is a corporate empire) was, but it looks like he was still hoping Shinra would come around and restart the space program?)
                        Looks like ff7 had a defector Cid as well. From the ff wiki:  


"Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra."
                            Eh, I dunno if calling him a shinra employee makes sense though really, at most a contractor for like a few months/years before being ditched by them for years. Less defector, more like another guy that was screwed over by shinra.
                                But the wiki stated shinra former engineer. That's basically meant former employee right? There's no need to dispute.
                                    The rocket program had been ended along with Cid's employment for many years before the events of VII, so he had no particular loyalty left with Shinra when he joins you. Which only happens because Shinra came to steal his airplane and wrecked its ability to fly when he refused to give it up.
            Balthier is the son of a non defected cid. Does that count?
                Balthier is kind of a Cid stand-in in that game! And the leading man, no less.
                    The true main character in my eyes. Probably my favorite FF character
                    He's literally the Mid stand-in. It's his middle name! Well Mied in the English version, but it's just Mid in Japanese.
                Balthier was my dude. Sky pirate with a heart of gold and a hot ass lancer lady at his side.
            Technically this is the case in VII as well, but with shinra instead
            X as well, Cid is an Al Bhed, who are defectors from the ways of Yevon
            In FFIX, Ramuh is also kind of a mentor. I won't spoil it for you. And Cid also helps the team go against the empire. I'm foggy on the details though.
            Wow! So this is my first FF game (I tried 14 but gave up after 3 separate attempts - just wasn't doing it for me) 

But yeah i have no knowledge of what prior character names and themes get carried over. I wanted to know... Who was Ultima in previous games? 
In the video I'd watched when Joshua addressed Ultima the entire chat kept spamming "Holy shit, Ultima!?" "OMG ULTIMA" "ITS Ultima! "
So I got the idea that like the Eikons, Ultima was also in past games. Was he also like..A main boss character in those games?
                Ultima was typically 'Ultima weapon'- essentially a beast that was created to be a weapon. It's also the name of 'the ultimate spell' called Ultima. So Ultima has been around in a number of forms in the various games. I don't recall a main villain being called Ultima before 16.
                    Tactics did it, but that Ultima was a woman and a demon.
                        I'm hopeful for a remake as I missed it the first time around somehow. Maybe once I finish the mainline entries I'll emulate if a remake isn't close at hand.
                Ultima, the High Seraph, was present in XII (not the same but the name is related) and was brought back in FFXIV too.
                This might be reading into it more than the devs intended, but I like the idea that Ultima is this FF’s incarnation of the Ultima Weapon. However in this game the Ultima Weapon is so powerful and destructive that Clive outright rejects “wielding” it and ultimately rejects magic altogether.
                Ultima is usually a monster or a spell or a weapon (or all of those!) but is also the final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics. As a monster it's usually called Ultima Weapon and tends to be either a major boss or an optional mega-boss. As a spell it's usually the ultimate destructive magic and in this role it's a part of the storylines of II, IX, and XIV.
            12 and 7 in a way as well.
            8 and 9 Cid have effectively the same role. They are the head of the good kingdom/school and want to see justice brought.
                I mean if you think about ff8 and 9 cids do in fact almost fit the same role. In ff8 Cid is creating a school to fight back against the sorceress his wife will become and her boss. In ff9 Cid starts the whole game by hiring to talons to kidnap garnet to fight back against the plans queen brahn is enacting. In both he isn't a defector but he is working against family and the evils they will be committing
            8 and 9, he's not necessarily the bad guy, but he doesn't do much to rectify much either. 8, he just has child soldiers XD and 9 his whole thing is he cheated on his wife.
            Cid in FF7 also used to work for Shinra's space program.
            Which is exactly why Cid in FF12 is such an interesting twist vs overall FF history.

In that instance Cid worked with the empire and made them stronger with manufactured nethicite. Plus I just liked his voice actor and the general bravado that was brought to his scenes.

            Such an awesome point you made there. Now that I think about it, it’s similar for FF tactics advance. Cid was a judge for the kingdom of Ivalice, and had a change of heart after the MC (Marche) convinced him
            Cid was the royal mechanic
        Lmao I though the ATL was referencing Atlanta and I spent like 5 minutes wondering what we had to do with Final Fantasy
        Literally had they put this in 15 I would have enjoyed 15 so much better. The ATL is the best thing final fantasy  added to the series.
        Isn’t that lazy though? Like, explain that naturally or in the cutscenes/gameplay.

As soon as that shit with Vivian was introduced I rolled my eyes
            Yea honestly i thought it's kinda lazy (especially vivian's map thing that gets overused) or they overloaded the dialogue with some fluff that couldve been some very crucial information instead.

The demo definitely handled this the best (and honestly it's still pretty good before the second timeskip), because they said and showed exactly what we needed to know, but used the ATL for worldbuilding that isnt necessary to the enjoyment of the story (like metia or jill and torgal's origin)
        As someone who compulsively read all the lore entries as they released there are a number of times I was having to do a double take as to whether or not that had been addressed in the game yet/or at all. There a some times where those entries jump the gun with revealing info early, "Ultima's Thralls" before Ultima is even introduced comes to mind.
    I think it's a neat explanation for several things in the plot and it's good that it's in there. But also I feel like it's a little... cheap? Convenient? It's basically the writers saying "Look, Cid/Ramuh just knows things" so there doesn't need to be further justification of how Cid comes to the **certain** conclusion that the crystals are sucking up mana, and why everyone jumps on board to such a heretical idea so quickly.
        I mean they explain throughout the game *why* everyone joined Cid. He didn't just approach them with that, he earned their trust fighting for people who had nothing, i.e. the bearers.

By the time he did tell others, they knew he was a good person and was fighting for the right cause.
            They explain why they join Cid at the hideaway and saving bearers. But his plan to destroy the crystals is pretty new. And Clive and Jill pretty quickly jump on his plan despite having 0 evidence for his theory (and still no evidence for it 5 years later, where they still keep to it).

This makes sense in-universe, because in-universe they know that Ramuh is just supposed to *know things*, so it's totally reasonable for them to trust Cid's crazy plan.
                Not entirely new though. Several people, even outside the hideout, mention Cid told them the truth and implied it was a plan long in the making.

That's why he invented things like the bellows, or initiated the gardening program. They exist because he knew mankind needed to live without crystals. It wasn't random, Cid had this going long before Clive came into the picture.
                Which, by the way, didn't really seem all that problematic for Ultima in the end. So there are limits to Ramuh's gift.
                To this point - I will say that for Final Fantasy 16 specifically where so much of the games story is explained in detail - from an entire encyclopedia to endless bits of dialogue with NPC's, to the Active Time lore.. I'm not disagreeing but I do feel like the explanation of Ramuh just knows things..Doesn't quite fit. Not saying it's wrong, just that in this game that feels like a cheap way to explain something. 

When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient. I overlooked this bit because that's a pretty broad statement, especially when places like Rosaria for instance and Elwin had a different mindset and treated Bearers better. Surely there'd have been enough people to realise this and for the well-being of the land do something about it. Just felt that little bit of reasoning was weak. Like if they were speaking specifically about one of the kingdoms then yeah...But the whole of Valesthia? Cmon now ..
                    The whole world knows what carbon emissions are doing to our planet but we can't seem to really do anything about it 🤷🏾‍♂️
                    >When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient.

Would you want to believe the very things that are thought to be your salvation are really just pushing you toward your doom?

Add in Ultima being the mastermind behind the scenes and the actual spoilers behind WHAT Ultima is, well, it's not really far fetched that no one would believe the logic Cid points out about the Blight.
                    There was an undercurrent in the whole story that people in positions of power had been destroying/ hording knowledge that would or could be used to help the bearers or improve the lives of the common people in order to maintain their positions... I think it's possible to infer from this that there were others who had figured out what Cid had, but suppressed the knowledge in order to maintain their status quo of power.
 I do agree that it is a bit unbelievable that absolutely nobody without a vested interest would have worked it out, and perhaps they did, but what would be the cost of trying to fight that? You'd basically need it to be someone like Dion to actually act on that knowledge before you got squashed in the other kingdoms. Perhaps if Elwin had lived and Joshua had taken the throne there would have been someone else to speak up against an inconvenient truth.
                    I think what Cid meant by this was that lots of people had figured out that the mothercrystals were the cause of the blight, but they refused to give them up because doing so would destroy a lot of people's power and easy living.

I think it's an allegory for some other inconvenient truth, but what could that be hmm?
        I said this the other day and got downvoted for it. I completely agree. 

I don’t think being Ramuh gave him knowledge about Ultima, but maybe it allowed him to see the flow of aether in the world or something, which helped him piece together that the Mothercrystals were draining the world instead of supplying it with aether.
        Considering he worked for them, it might be something he saw them do.
        Well in this case I feel its more intuitive, he had access to certain history and seeing the cause and effects of certain things/events but nothing solid
        He was the former lord commander to the right hand man of the god who created the mothercrystals. I think he attained some inkling of truth during his time with Barnabas - leading to his desertion. I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima. Another thing: Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis: it is 'heretical' because it is inconvenient to Valisthea's power structure and thus supressed. That simple. He acknowledges that he may not be the first one to have speculated the mothercrystals to be behind the blight, but his insight into the machinations of Barnabas/Ultima must've cemented it as surety.
            The main thing we're discussing here is "why do Clive/Jill and everyone else so readily accept Cid's crazy theory".

> I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima.

Yes, but Cid never mentions any of this to Clive/Jill when he's explaining his theory. He just puts it out there and they go "WHAT??? ... Well ok." It'd be a whole different matter if he explains that he intuited this from his time beside Barnabas, and from seeing Barnabas acting weirdly around the crystals, or something else during his fight near the crystals. I would find that completely convincing. But the game does not do that. Clive and Jill simply take his vaguely plausible theory as fact and set off to destroy a mothercrystal.

>Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis

Again, that's besides the point. Even when Clive and Jill hear the theory, they are flabbergasted. Meaning it is not some inherently obvious thing that everyone has just shut away. A small number of people theorized it before, and for various reasons never spoke out or acted on it. But to the large majority of people, it is 1) entirely blasphemous and 2) there is no evidence for this theory whatsoever.

Put another way, Cid is proposing to completely upset their entire understanding of the world and the crystals. You would expect him to provide some stronger evidence for this, especially since Clive and Jill are still acting on his plan 5 years later when there's still no sign of things getting better.
                I actually do agree that it would have been good for the story to back up Cid's contention a bit more. But really, just look at the map and see that the blight tends to be where the mothercrystals are not, and then ask yourself where all the aether in those crystals come from.
                I feel like you're hyper-focused on Clive & Jill's reaction. People at the hideaway are aware of Cid's plan, and they all actively practice his theory: they survive in the deadlands with no magic. Evidence is hardly a significant factor in popular beliefs, especially in religious societies. I also consider how Clive & Jill have both been lost and aimless for over a decade before Cid - where an opportunity to arise where they can follow a righteous cause, I feel them most inclined to join with less scepticism than the average person. But, seeing as they've seen evidence for themselves, and then Cid's hypothesis (this order is going to cause confusion as we see) - I feel they're justified nonetheless. I agree with the general sentiment - I wish they elaborated on Cid's knowledge of Ultima - but I didn't feel unsatisfied with it in the end.
                    Definitely, it's not a major issue I have with the game.

I just think it's slightly funny how Cid proposes this wild crazy idea, and they just wholly buy into it with no questions asked (after that scene). You can chalk it up to Cid's crazy Charisma stat and the FF theme playing, that ought to be enough to convince anyone!
    I don't believe that's how it went down.
Sure he's probably smarter than the average person but....
I bet you he was told the plan by Barnabas or ultima, including the crystals draining aether, the sealed ultimas, the magic spell, mythos, the promised land, the whole lot.  Probably why he left and started the rebellion.
    Also when you're in Caer Norvent, and then finally face off against Benedikta in the cutscene where Benedikta semi-primed kicks Cid's semi-primed ass, Benedikta is sitting and then says about Greagor that she is a false god. Which maybe means that those from Waloed know something more about Ultima that those in storm don't. The religion Circle of Malius was also more widespread there so probably everyone knows about Ultima in some form. Which is super weird how Tomes didn't know anything about Ultima, maybe none of it got written down and everything got passed along as an oral tradition.
My copium guess is that this could lead to a DLC where we play as Cid fighting Leviathan and Ultima before Ultima absorbs Leviathan closing any potential plot holes of Clive's story.
    This is precisely what I was thinking too, I have a feeling something went down with Cid and Barnabas and maybe Ultima which led to the destroying of the Motes of Water and their Dominant - Leviathan. Maybe it had something to do with Magic or power, Barnabas ordering Cid to kill Leviathan or Cid witnessing Ultima absorb Leviathan. All of which led Cid to eventually abandon the Kingdom of Waloed cause of all the shit Magic was causing and lives being lost because of it.
        Ordering the Lightning guy to kill the Water guy is some top-tier Pokemon logic from the King of Waleod.
            🤣 Hey, people wanted more elemental damage stuff in this game
...Well there ya go! Lol
        I don't think Cid, and likely Barnabas, had anything to do with Leviathan. Joshua comments that even "Leviathan the Lost" is on the mural depicting the various eikons. This certainly indicates that Leviathan has been missing for generations. I'm sure Ultima had something to do with it (maybe the dominant found out Ultima's plot and worked something against it?), but there is no indication whatsoever that Cid or Barnabas killed the dominant of Leviathan.

Cid left Waloed for many reasons, but this is not it.

Edit: typo.
    Isn't it more likely Cid learned of Ultima while being Lord Commander of Waloed? There were statues of him in that giant tower and I doubt Barnabus ever shut up about him haha
    It seems like the versions of Ultima trapped into the Cristals are linked to an element.
What make me say this is that Ultima doesn't use water moves against Clive. So that make me think that it's impossible for him to use them, even if we know that Leviathan existed.

So it might be because while absorbing others versions of them, a part was lacking. The water part I guess. So I think that the water Ultima is either sealed or dead.

But the gigantic "frozen" wave might be the answer. It just might be a Cristal...
        Creating Origin out of the water is a water move

Leviathan doesn't really cast water at people but more indirectly.
            How do you know ?
Have you seen it in action ? Do you know something about about the DLC we don't know ?

Is it cannon that Leviathan throw water more than he use magic ?

That said I'm not sure that Origin is made out of water.
                You can see Leviathan behaving this way in FFXV.  She uses water as a display of power while directly attacking with her physical form.  The only water actually thrown at Noctis is clones of her physical form and we see plenty of clones with Ultima.  It's also questionable if those water attacks were directed at Noctis as their function was to separate him from Prompto for a proper 1v1 duel.

Origin is made of crystal yet the structure is built with rotations suggesting a hurricane formed the design:

Ultima may have to do with Cid leaving and I would bet they were part of it, but we also know that he left the royal army "once and for all" (so presumably he already had some issues with it by then) over the treatment of Bearers, specifically after Otto lost his son.
    That's a good point. I'm pulling at straws here with this thought so feel free to tell me if it's dumb 😅 But was it ever stated where Otto was from? 
His position is a Chief Steward of the ship- and previously he was a Purser on a trade ship, which makes me think wherever he was from dealt with the seas. Maybe he was part of the tribe of the Motes of Water?
What I'm getting at is, Otto mentions to Clive that when his son was born, the "Magic awoke inside him", his son was taken away by the constable - as his family wanted "the monster taken away". 

Is it at all possible that perhaps Otto's son was born the dominant of Leviathan - he'd been taken away hence "lost"? 
Maybe the family didn't know the kid was a dominant and not just a bearer. OR, maybe an Uncontrolled Leviathan awoke and caused chaos leading to his family wanting "the monster taken away"
        That's a very interesting take!! It also makes you wonder if he knew about Joshua!! Cause Joshua is another one that is sorta hunting and protecting Clive from Ultima!! Would be interesting in a DLC to see how Cid learns of Ultima and the possibility that him Joshua have some sort of alliance or if not how closely their stories are in their knowledge of Ultima!!
            Appreciate it bud!😁

So with your point above, while that would be cool, I don't think Cid had much knowledge of Joshua and what he was up to or his intentions. But Cid was definitely the first to figure out that Joshua was alive. 

I say this because in the beginning of the story Clive and Cid were looking for the second Dominant of fire. Gav had reported hearing of a dominant of fire traveling through some of the towns. This was obviously Joshua and Jote sneaking around trying not to be detected. When Cid witnesses Clive turn into Ifrit against Garuda, he realises Clive is "the second dominant of fire". Afterwards when Clive is all emo after realising he is Ifrit, they again get a report of "a dominant of fire" in one of the towns (likely when Benedicta Captured Jote and Joshua). Cid and Clive head out to the location to meet Gav. As they're leaving Clive says there's no point since he is The dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise that if he is the second dominant of fire then it can only mean the one they've been tracking all along was Joshua. He says "THINK about it Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. 

So yeah, I think this was the extent of Cids knowledge of Joshua - just that he was alive. 

Does make me wonder tho as to why Benedicta captured Joshua and Jote in the first place 🤔
                Oh that's right I forgot about that exchange!! I am curious if they do do a DLC about Cid and his knowledge of Ultima if there is some sort of overlap of what Jote and Joshua are doing to stop Ultima and what Cid knows of Ultima and Gav scouting the 2nd dominant of fire!! But what ever they do I'm all for just to have more of this world and story to play!!
                Barnabas wanted to “unite” the Dominants (really capture them and force them to submit)…probably to make it easy for Clive to take all their powers at once.

He failed Ultima in this regard when Benedikta was killed and Joshua escaped.

Figure, he already had Benedikta (wish we knew if she was privy to exact nature of Barnabas plans). Would have had Joshua had he not escaped. In the Battle of Belenus Tor, he probably would have engaged Bahamut more aggressively with the intent to capture him. Kupka was cucked and manipulated, and would have went along with whatever Benedikta wanted. He himself had Jill captive at once point, and would have forced Clive to absorb her Eikon. 

The “unite the Dominant” conversation he had with Benedikta while in bed became a sore subject when she brought up Cid. He would have been the hardest for Barnabas to get considering he knew of the bigger picture, and he managed to keep himself under the radar for years after defecting from Waloed.
        That would be cool, but I sort of think the medicine girl is Leviathan.
            I thought this. From what we see/what is made known to us…..Dominants don’t prime for the first time unless under extreme emotional duress.

-Joshua and Clive at Phoenix Gate

-Jill right before she about to be raped by the Crusaders

-Although not confirmed, it’s possible Barnabas turned into Odin for the first time after his mother was executed.

-Can’t really explain the others since we don’t know enough about them when they were younger.

Kihel (the medicine girl) girl had already suffered from her grandmothers death, and witnessing the events that happened in the Dominion. Any of those things should have but her under enough duress to prime.
            I think the medicine girl is carbuncle. There’s a whole other part of the world. I think there may be dominants that exist that are not on the mural.
One thing needs to be made clear: Barnabas is NOT controlled by Ultima, he fully believes in Ultima's plans and actually worships him. He's making conscious choices in his following Ultima.
    Yup! I should correct that bit. I should rather say he's influenced by Ultima. I feel like somewhere along the way Ultima influenced Barnabas in some way, whether that was by using his mother as collateral or feeding him lies about an afterlife, Barnabas bought into that vision on his own and accepted his "place" in Ultima's plan.
        I believe he's fully aware of Ultima's plan. His family's tribe has also worshipped Ultima for ages and is probably the reason why his mother was killed by nonbelievers. His whole fight with Clive was strictly about whose beliefs, will, and convictions were stronger.
 I like to think that at some point, Barnabas and Cid were on good terms. I also like to think that Ultima’s awakening and subsequent alliance/domination of Barnabas was the thing that drove a wedge between them
    The lore surrounding the Circle of Malius strongly suggests Barnabas was born into the religion and knew his destiny from childhood, or at least since his mother was slain. It's also suggested somewhere Barnabas is Akashic and may have been living far longer than we know. This strongly suggests Barnabas has always known of Ultima, which begs the question, how much did the rest of the Royal Army know? Did Benedikta? Was Cid also complicit? Hard to believe so, unless they didn't know the long term strategy.

Much of Barnabas's early ambitions are shrouded in mystery, like why he had his Royal Intelligencers rounding up the Dominants. It seems counter-intuitive to the overarching plan: Clive being tested and absorbing all their powers.
        Yeah, I also had a feeling that something weird was up with Barnabas. I'm not exactly sure why Ultima chose Barnabas or rather Odin to be under his control yet not the other Dominants. 

After reading your comment it does make alot of sense that Barnabas was aware of Ultima since childhood. I know Vivian had mentioned that Barnabas basically became king by defeating other armies all while he was basically a Child/barely an adult (along those lines). Him being under Ultima's control would explain how he had that kind of power at such a young age. 
 
Also, Barnabas seems to share this weird thing with his mother. 
But after thinking about it, perhaps he seems so attached to the memory of his young mother and acts like a child when he remembers her (placing his head on her lap and stuff) because he was taken from her when he was a child or Ultima killed her and took control of Barnabas. So his only memories of his mother was when He was still in that toddler phase of his life. Pretty sure he has some hectic PTSD
            When Clive kills Barnabas he says something that implies that he was Ahashik all along. Also when Vivian gives you the background on Waloed, she says that Barnabas has been around for a while and basically haven't aged, also implying that he is Alashic. But it doesn't line up with all Akashik being basically thoughtless puppets. I mean, Barnabas still has thoughts and a will even if that will is to submit his will to Ultima... That just doesn't add up for me, but maybe its because Barnabas is a dominant he retained some of his will after turning?

ALSO if Cid knew about Ultima wanting Clive why didn't he have that conversation with him? One could argue that he thought that it would never come to that, but if he knew the extent of Ultima's power, he would have known that he would get to Clive sooner or later. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was also no indication that Cid knew Joshua was alive. He just said something along the lines of "oh so it WAS you" when he saw Clive prime into Ifrit.
                Ahh I forgot about that bit from Vivian. Yeah I was also confused by the whole Akashic thing. But I guess Ultima likely took control of Barnabas the same way he did with Olivier, capturing them at a young age and turning them into this hybrid kind of Akashic. Still not exactly sure why Ultima took control of Olivier though since he wasn't a dominant so he couldn't have had that same will Barnabas did to remain conscious. And Anabella was doing a pretty good job of messing up the Emperors head all by herself lol so Oliviers influence wasn't needed much. 

If I had to guess, Cid probably knew of Ultima before meeting Clive but maybe realised what Clive was too late to make him aware of any danger he was in. 🤷‍♂️

Cid did figure out Joshua was alive after their fight with Garuda. 
When Cid witnessed Clive turn into Ifrit, he realises that Clive is the 2nd dominant of fire they'd been looking for. However, afterwards Gav still reports of this "Second dominant of fire" being sighted near Kingsfall (likely when Benedicta Captured Joshua and Jote). 
Clive is too emo realising he is Ifrit and killed his brother, meanwhile Cid sets up a meeting with Gav to talk about info he has. 
As they leave to meet Gav, Clive says there's no point because He is the 2nd Dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise a very obvious point by saying "Think about Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. But basically here he was trying to make Clive realise that if He is the 2nd Dominant of fire then the one they've been tracking all this time can only be Joshua. So yeah I think Cid definitely figured it out, while Clive didn't entertain that thought because in his mind Joshua was for sure dead.
                    You know, regarding Olivier.... When Clive and Joshua confront Anabella about why she betrayed her country and her family and she goes on about bloodlines and how Joshua was week and blah blah blah she said that she had a child with the emperor to combine his bloodline with hers so that she can have a child "blessed by both Bahamut and the Phoenix". The demo scene with Anabella and Elwin suggested that it is Elwin's ducal line that has Phoenix dominants and that it skipped him and went to Joshua, hence him saying that he's just warming up the seat. But if it's Elwin's line then why would Anabella say that...

OH THANK YOU! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, it sounded like Cid was about to tell Clive that "the other dominant of fire" has to be Joshua, but still interesting that after being interrupted that one time Cid never brought it up again. I just thought that after Cid saw that Clive was Ifrit he would have thought that the "other dominant of fire" Clive was chasing is just a random Bearer that Clive just thought to be a dominant because he was so obsessed with finding his brother's killer. Like no one saw that other guy prime and it was just rumours that he's a Bearer/ possibly dominant a dominant so Cid could have thought Clive was just chasing shadows. But you're right, Cid is smart and he would have known.
                        Haha! No prob, it was such a throwaway line from Cid it could've easily been missed but yeah, Cid was super smart - but to your point I have no idea why Cid never raises this to Clive again, or makes him aware. I'd assume he saw Clive was still on his journey of fighting and accepting his past so maybe he decided to wait for Clive to embrace his past and what he is. Because I think right after Clive "finds the flame" (what a track) It's followed by Cids death. 

So yeah! That part with Annabella confused tf out of me until I realised something very disturbing in the active Time lore which is that Annabella and Elwin are cousins 😬 
So yeah, she's also part of the Phoenix Bloodline. Which is likely why she felt high and mighty hooking up with the empor since now both parents have pure bloodlines for two powerful Eikons. Made if kinda funny tho seeing as Olivier wasn't born a dominant lol.
                            Those are great points about the Rosarian bloodline. As far as the Lesage bloodline…Annabelle implied that Dion was the result of Sylvester having a tryst with a common folk person. Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.

-Kupka was a foot soldier in the Dhalmekian Army
-Benedikta was a slave/common folk villager
-Cid was a sailor who happened to end up in the service of Barnabas
-Barnabas himself was a wanderer/cultist
            I want to add to this that Barnabas was never "under Ultima's control" per se; Clive says as much when he kills Barnabas (IIRC) and to his peers, that Barnabas submitted to Ultima of his own volition; that was his will, and that he is a hypocrite to want to strip humanity of *their* will when it was his own freedom that allowed him to choose Ultima.

Barnabas is a foil to Clive - both are pre-ordained "chosen ones"  so to speak. Barnabas mirrors the Abrahamic Messiah trope in many ways, knowing his destiny and choosing to fulfill it. I think that plays into why Ultima is so baffled by Clive's resistance. Many before him, including his chosen Odin, submitted themselves, so why wouldn't Clive? To Ultima it probably appears humanity has some intrinsic desire to submit themselves before their creator, so when Clive "becomes Logos" he can't wrap his brain around a human "becoming his own god." It's important Barnabas charted that path first, being a prophet and martyr to submit himself first.

Those are my thoughts on it anyway lol.
                Hmmm, that's a really good point. I figured Barnabas was just taken control of the same way Ultima took control of Olivier. So had Barnabas been torn from his mother during childhood - he basically gave in to Ultima because he had nobody else. Kind of like he was forced to submit to Ultima and accepted whatever vision Ultima gave him. Which is why he feels its okay for others to have their will stripped away and submit because that's what he had done - Which in turn is a result of Ultima's influence. And when he has these PTSD-like flashbacks of his mother, it shows a kind of sad side to Barnabas though it's not explained why. I would think Ultima killed his mother and gave Barnabas some kind of false idea that he had "saved" her from this forsaken land, which is why when Barnabas dies he says "At long last, Salvation (Deliverence from harm/ruin)" "I'm coming home, mother". (Atleast that's sort of how I saw it lol) 

But I guess there's alot of ambiguity and grey area with Barnabas' early life to really say for sure exactly what happened there. 

I do think your thoughts could be 100% plausible though. That's the thing with this game man - it's so amazing but alot of the finer details are left to our interpretation 😮‍💨
        Or Barnabas rounding up the Dominants was in an attempt to simplify the process. If Ultima had taken Clive during the first encounter, he would have to go to a single place to absorb the remaining Dominants.

It's possible Cod would have been aware of this plan, and part of why he left.
        According to Vivian and the calendar, Barnabas has been king of Waloed for at least 40-50 years…possibly longer.

The reason that he is not a mindless Akashic is because of his being a Dominant. Being a host for Odin allowed him to keep his mind. 

It is also possible Barnabas was born with a different name. He is the only known Dominant of Odin, meanwhile countless people in a number of bloodlines have served as Dominants to their respective Eikons. It’s very much possible that Barnabas himself is several hundred years old.
            Only a previous Dominant of Phoenix is mentioned as having helped Rosaria repel a Northern Territory invasion decades/centuries prior to the start of the game (presumably they had a Shiva of their own at the time). But it's odd that only some of the Eikons/Dominants are known and followed through generations while others aren't (shown to be) considered. The Valisthean religion/'common knowledge' around Eikons - that there are 8 - is at least centuries if not millennia old. So how come people know of Odin (and Leviathan) but not of their Dominants?

And what if the dominant left Valisthea and went to the other continent? Sure there isn't aether there, but they can still use their internal magic to Prime. 

Wouldn't go so far as to say it's a plot hole, but clearly the writers threw a lot at the wall during worldbuilding and conveniently forgot that it's still there when people start wondering about things.
                I would have liked them to have gone into the history of the Eikons a lot more than they did. It's supposed to be this power struggle that's been playing out for thousands and thousands of years yet it very much feels like the versions we encounter in game are their definitive incarnations. As you say there is a reference to an earlier Phoenix fighting an earlier Shiva but *that's it.*

With the scale of the Eikon fights we see in the game you wonder how this world ever survived even a few years with these things marauding around. Yet we don't hear the details of any famous clashes or the names of any famous Dominants of the past.

At one point in the recent past Waloed had the power of Odin, Ramuh, and Garuda on it's side, how on Earth did it not just sweep over Storm? How has the Iron Kingdom survived this long without a permanent Dominant or any allies? And the lack of any historical conflict between the nations of Storm is just kind of haphazardly waved away by the fact they've all been allied for  like 50 years and anything before that is conveniently left unexplained.

The history and worldbuilding feels pretty lazy to me once you go back earlier than the events depicted in the game. Perhaps they should have hired GRRM to write some backstory like From did with Elden Ring.
        The implication seems to be as you said that Barnabas has been a follower of Ultima his entire generations-long life, which makes it really odd to me that he only really ramps it up publicly during the events of the game. He literally redrew the map of Ash singlehandedly yet never tried to enforce the Circle of Malius as the state religion?

As for why he tried to gather all the Dominant's together I presumed it was just because he knew they were vital to Ultima's plan. It's a lot easier to test Mythos if you literally have all those who need to test him on your side. Presumably this is the same reason he was allied with Hugo yet didn't intervene to help him against Shiva or Bahamut, as he needed them alive too.

But then again, he literally fights against Bahamut and the Phoenix in the game so who knows. Waloed's motivations and schemes throughout the game feel enigmatic for the sake of being enigmatic a lot of the time.
    Cid was Barnabas Lord Commander for years. There are a number of reasons Cid may have defected.

-Barnabas may have been a noble leader, but his first encounter with Ultima caused his descent into madness

-Cid probably helped Barnabas conquer Ash. The Veldermarke Royal Family(mentioned in ATL) were the rulers of Ash till they were overthrown. Maybe in the midst of his descent into madness, Barnabas sacked Stonhyrr, slaughtered everyone, royal family included. This could be another reason.

-Barnabas taking Benediktas as his lover (it would make sense if Cid had a romantic relationship with her)

-this is made up by me…..but Cid has an engineering background. Maybe he was the one who built the Black Galleon. It’s also possible that Cid had the plans for the first prototype of the Mythril Engine at this time. Barnabas may have planed to create an unstoppable fleet with the intent to conquer the Twins….and this didn’t sit well with Cid.
I really want a Jill DLC but you make a great case for why a Cid DLC might be better. I 100% agree with this theory.
Cid also tells Benedicta that he'd seen the world Barnabas wanted to create and he wasn't interested in that vision
I would LOVE a DLC focusing on Cid's story pre meeting him
CID also says to Clive, something along the lines of; “go find the bastard that killed your brother and if you can’t, then kill yourself” and I also think that is a nod to CID knowing more than he lets on.

Edit:Typo
    Lmao!! I actually missed that line but that's hilarious. But I think that was more of a tongue and cheek line for us the viewers because from the Demo/starting of the story, only we as viewers are aware that Clive is infact Ifrit. 

Cid seemed genuinely perplexed and surprised when Clive transformed into Ifrit when facing Garuda. And came to the realisation saying something like "the shadow you've been chasing had been inside you all along" while he sees Clive passed out on the ground.
I think given that cid was Barnabas right hand man. It makes sense that he’d know something about ultima. Especially as we see the circle of malleus is a bigger deal in Waloed
Not only because he was a Waloeder, but also because Ramuh apparently gives its Dominant a lot of knowledge.
I noticed that part.
We need Project Cid
We need a Cid backstory as one of the DLC. God damn I would sell everything I own to buy it.
    But then how would you play it without your Ps5 and the Disk 😏

![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)
        I'd use my ps5/recliner/coffee table/car money to buy a new game and PS5 🤣
            😂😂😂 Perfect. Man's got it all figured out 🫡
I really love cid man he deserved more screen time
Uh yeah as soon as Cid saw ultima it was clear as day that he knew more than everyone at least at that time considering by the endgame he died years ago.
I can't believe I posted this in hopes of DLC only to find out now that 2 Paid DLC's have been announced 😭 Dreams be coming true yall
As much as a like back stories they always pose an issue. One little slip in the story is all it takes to take so much away from what is already there. I don't need to play as Cid. I don't know what they could do with DLC I would much rather see a well developed sequel.
Cid: I ain’t letting you take him! Uiltma: What you gonn-(blasted by lightning)…ouch….
I think Ultima and Barnabas imply that Barnabas he been a puppet of Ultima since before he even traveled to Valisthea.
    Barnabas is an akashic who hasn't aged in 40+ years and is the only known Dominant of Odin. He also doesn't semi-prime the same way as the rest, so clearly some Ultima influence is at hand.
I caught this on a replay too, thinking back he told benedikta he wouldn't ever serve that madman again, I think Cid knew a lot more of barnabas' plan than he let on,  this is corroborated by his idea to destroy the crystals, something even Clive and Jill thought was insane initially. Where better to learn than the mother crystals hold great unknown importance than from ultimas lackey
I very much need a Cid DLC. That would make me extremely happy!
I also just saw this scene on Kastaclysm’s stream… same one? 😅
    Lol! Oh nah, it was on OmegaPro's playthrough. But I've been checking Kataclysm's from time to time 😏.. but she's still a bit early in the game
Other than the detail of Ramuh's dominants being more aware of the World, Cid also came from Waloed, it wouldn't be too far fetched to assume that in his previous position he had a good knowledge of his country's religion including the secrets about Ultima and Mythos.
Well, we know that Cid's main mission was only half correct, the crystals were really draining the land faster but they weren't the main cause of the blight and Ultima actually wanted the other members of his species free.
We don't have enough information, but my guess would be that Ultima was trying to manipulate Cid to destroy the mother crystals, and Cid accidentally learned about Ultima on the way as well.
I mean I think it's pretty clear that Cid's disillusionment for Waloed is related to learning Barnabas was just a pawn of Ultima. I wouldn't be shocked, either, if his plan to destroy the Mothercrystals was directly inspired by the Sins of Dzemekys.

We know that Dominants of Ramuh always have a certain awareness of the bigger picture, though I choose to believe this doesn't mean some kind of genetic memory where they understand everything, so much as a natural intelligence and ability to extrapolate from small details. We see it with his explanation of how the Mothercrystals work.

I'm gonna guess Cid did some digging into Barnabas' past and the origin of Odin, and discovered the truth of the Circle of Malius. Cid likely confronted Barnabas looking for answers and accusing him of being a puppet for a death cult, where the Dominant of Odin explained to him what Ultima is as an attempt to win Cid over, ultimately resulting in Cid fleeing Waloed and beginning his "pet project" to destroy the Mothercrystals.
He certainly knew about Ultima before Clive found out.
He was in Barnabas’ army and barnabas throne sits right on the mothercrystal for ramuh.

He knows because he left and betrayed barnabas army as told by benedikta, who also knows about ultima.
Combining the Dominant of Ramuh's better understanding of the larger picture and the fact that Cid was Barnabas' Lord Commander it made sense to me. I wouldn't be surprised if Barnabas shared little bits of his Master's plan to his own Lord Commander.
I though it was also due to the fact that,  he was a resident and close confidant to Barnabus and Barny was a slave to Ultima.?  It's only natural he would catch on
Cid was the First Knight of Barnabas, probably he has seen how ultima has corrupted Barnabas and that's why he probably left his king
Walood has giant statues of ultima, so good guess when Cid was there he became aware of something
This is exactly why I think there will most definitely be a Cid DLC
I’m just starting my NG+ play through and have got to the part where CId and Clive meet for the first time. 

And this is something I totally missed on my first play through. 

Clive is saved by a huge bunch is lightning bolts - and I assumed that Cid had caused those. 

BUT…a little while later Torgal is introduced and Clive asks: “who’s this …”

Cid replies: “He’s the dog that just saved your life. “

So it wasn’t Cid that killed everyone it was Torgal turning into super-Torgal - as he does at another certain point. 

So Cid knew of Torgal’s powers WAY before anyone else.
This is the answer, and why the ATL is so crucial to understanding the world.
    Other interesting tidbits:  
\- Ramuh has the 'wise intelligent summon' thing going on in a number of FF games (ff14 and ff15 come to mind)

\- Cid in the other FF games is usually not just an engineer, but a defector from the evil empire who makes it his mission to take down that empire. He did this in ff4, ff6, ff14, and probably others in the series that I'm not remembering (I also haven't beaten 5, 8 and 9 yet).
        That is a neat observation! Though we should quality that "makes it his/her mission to take down an empire" encompasses almost every party member (and allies) in each game where there is an evil empire, so it's a slightly less unique trait than one might think :p
            Right-the point I was making is that Cid in a number of games is a defector- having previously worked as an engineer for said empire.
                Sure, I was ribbing that "goes against the empire" is pretty common around these parts.

(I actually couldn't remember what FF7 Cid's position on Shinra (which is a corporate empire) was, but it looks like he was still hoping Shinra would come around and restart the space program?)
                    Looks like ff7 had a defector Cid as well. From the ff wiki:  


"Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra."
                        Eh, I dunno if calling him a shinra employee makes sense though really, at most a contractor for like a few months/years before being ditched by them for years. Less defector, more like another guy that was screwed over by shinra.
                            But the wiki stated shinra former engineer. That's basically meant former employee right? There's no need to dispute.
                                The rocket program had been ended along with Cid's employment for many years before the events of VII, so he had no particular loyalty left with Shinra when he joins you. Which only happens because Shinra came to steal his airplane and wrecked its ability to fly when he refused to give it up.
        Balthier is the son of a non defected cid. Does that count?
            Balthier is kind of a Cid stand-in in that game! And the leading man, no less.
                The true main character in my eyes. Probably my favorite FF character
                He's literally the Mid stand-in. It's his middle name! Well Mied in the English version, but it's just Mid in Japanese.
            Balthier was my dude. Sky pirate with a heart of gold and a hot ass lancer lady at his side.
        Technically this is the case in VII as well, but with shinra instead
        X as well, Cid is an Al Bhed, who are defectors from the ways of Yevon
        In FFIX, Ramuh is also kind of a mentor. I won't spoil it for you. And Cid also helps the team go against the empire. I'm foggy on the details though.
        Wow! So this is my first FF game (I tried 14 but gave up after 3 separate attempts - just wasn't doing it for me) 

But yeah i have no knowledge of what prior character names and themes get carried over. I wanted to know... Who was Ultima in previous games? 
In the video I'd watched when Joshua addressed Ultima the entire chat kept spamming "Holy shit, Ultima!?" "OMG ULTIMA" "ITS Ultima! "
So I got the idea that like the Eikons, Ultima was also in past games. Was he also like..A main boss character in those games?
            Ultima was typically 'Ultima weapon'- essentially a beast that was created to be a weapon. It's also the name of 'the ultimate spell' called Ultima. So Ultima has been around in a number of forms in the various games. I don't recall a main villain being called Ultima before 16.
                Tactics did it, but that Ultima was a woman and a demon.
                    I'm hopeful for a remake as I missed it the first time around somehow. Maybe once I finish the mainline entries I'll emulate if a remake isn't close at hand.
            Ultima, the High Seraph, was present in XII (not the same but the name is related) and was brought back in FFXIV too.
            This might be reading into it more than the devs intended, but I like the idea that Ultima is this FF’s incarnation of the Ultima Weapon. However in this game the Ultima Weapon is so powerful and destructive that Clive outright rejects “wielding” it and ultimately rejects magic altogether.
            Ultima is usually a monster or a spell or a weapon (or all of those!) but is also the final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics. As a monster it's usually called Ultima Weapon and tends to be either a major boss or an optional mega-boss. As a spell it's usually the ultimate destructive magic and in this role it's a part of the storylines of II, IX, and XIV.
        12 and 7 in a way as well.
        8 and 9 Cid have effectively the same role. They are the head of the good kingdom/school and want to see justice brought.
            I mean if you think about ff8 and 9 cids do in fact almost fit the same role. In ff8 Cid is creating a school to fight back against the sorceress his wife will become and her boss. In ff9 Cid starts the whole game by hiring to talons to kidnap garnet to fight back against the plans queen brahn is enacting. In both he isn't a defector but he is working against family and the evils they will be committing
        8 and 9, he's not necessarily the bad guy, but he doesn't do much to rectify much either. 8, he just has child soldiers XD and 9 his whole thing is he cheated on his wife.
        Cid in FF7 also used to work for Shinra's space program.
        Which is exactly why Cid in FF12 is such an interesting twist vs overall FF history.

In that instance Cid worked with the empire and made them stronger with manufactured nethicite. Plus I just liked his voice actor and the general bravado that was brought to his scenes.

... I could go on.  Poor guy usually just wants the best for the world, but tends to either fuck it up and atone or just... build airships and blow things up.
        Such an awesome point you made there. Now that I think about it, it’s similar for FF tactics advance. Cid was a judge for the kingdom of Ivalice, and had a change of heart after the MC (Marche) convinced him
        Cid was the royal mechanic
    Lmao I though the ATL was referencing Atlanta and I spent like 5 minutes wondering what we had to do with Final Fantasy
    Literally had they put this in 15 I would have enjoyed 15 so much better. The ATL is the best thing final fantasy  added to the series.
    Isn’t that lazy though? Like, explain that naturally or in the cutscenes/gameplay.

As soon as that shit with Vivian was introduced I rolled my eyes
        Yea honestly i thought it's kinda lazy (especially vivian's map thing that gets overused) or they overloaded the dialogue with some fluff that couldve been some very crucial information instead.

The demo definitely handled this the best (and honestly it's still pretty good before the second timeskip), because they said and showed exactly what we needed to know, but used the ATL for worldbuilding that isnt necessary to the enjoyment of the story (like metia or jill and torgal's origin)
    As someone who compulsively read all the lore entries as they released there are a number of times I was having to do a double take as to whether or not that had been addressed in the game yet/or at all. There a some times where those entries jump the gun with revealing info early, "Ultima's Thralls" before Ultima is even introduced comes to mind.
I think it's a neat explanation for several things in the plot and it's good that it's in there. But also I feel like it's a little... cheap? Convenient? It's basically the writers saying "Look, Cid/Ramuh just knows things" so there doesn't need to be further justification of how Cid comes to the **certain** conclusion that the crystals are sucking up mana, and why everyone jumps on board to such a heretical idea so quickly.
    I mean they explain throughout the game *why* everyone joined Cid. He didn't just approach them with that, he earned their trust fighting for people who had nothing, i.e. the bearers.

By the time he did tell others, they knew he was a good person and was fighting for the right cause.
        They explain why they join Cid at the hideaway and saving bearers. But his plan to destroy the crystals is pretty new. And Clive and Jill pretty quickly jump on his plan despite having 0 evidence for his theory (and still no evidence for it 5 years later, where they still keep to it).

This makes sense in-universe, because in-universe they know that Ramuh is just supposed to *know things*, so it's totally reasonable for them to trust Cid's crazy plan.
            Not entirely new though. Several people, even outside the hideout, mention Cid told them the truth and implied it was a plan long in the making.

That's why he invented things like the bellows, or initiated the gardening program. They exist because he knew mankind needed to live without crystals. It wasn't random, Cid had this going long before Clive came into the picture.
            Which, by the way, didn't really seem all that problematic for Ultima in the end. So there are limits to Ramuh's gift.
            To this point - I will say that for Final Fantasy 16 specifically where so much of the games story is explained in detail - from an entire encyclopedia to endless bits of dialogue with NPC's, to the Active Time lore.. I'm not disagreeing but I do feel like the explanation of Ramuh just knows things..Doesn't quite fit. Not saying it's wrong, just that in this game that feels like a cheap way to explain something. 

When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient. I overlooked this bit because that's a pretty broad statement, especially when places like Rosaria for instance and Elwin had a different mindset and treated Bearers better. Surely there'd have been enough people to realise this and for the well-being of the land do something about it. Just felt that little bit of reasoning was weak. Like if they were speaking specifically about one of the kingdoms then yeah...But the whole of Valesthia? Cmon now ..
                The whole world knows what carbon emissions are doing to our planet but we can't seem to really do anything about it 🤷🏾‍♂️
                >When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient.

Would you want to believe the very things that are thought to be your salvation are really just pushing you toward your doom?

Add in Ultima being the mastermind behind the scenes and the actual spoilers behind WHAT Ultima is, well, it's not really far fetched that no one would believe the logic Cid points out about the Blight.
                There was an undercurrent in the whole story that people in positions of power had been destroying/ hording knowledge that would or could be used to help the bearers or improve the lives of the common people in order to maintain their positions... I think it's possible to infer from this that there were others who had figured out what Cid had, but suppressed the knowledge in order to maintain their status quo of power.
 I do agree that it is a bit unbelievable that absolutely nobody without a vested interest would have worked it out, and perhaps they did, but what would be the cost of trying to fight that? You'd basically need it to be someone like Dion to actually act on that knowledge before you got squashed in the other kingdoms. Perhaps if Elwin had lived and Joshua had taken the throne there would have been someone else to speak up against an inconvenient truth.
                I think what Cid meant by this was that lots of people had figured out that the mothercrystals were the cause of the blight, but they refused to give them up because doing so would destroy a lot of people's power and easy living.

I think it's an allegory for some other inconvenient truth, but what could that be hmm?
    I said this the other day and got downvoted for it. I completely agree. 

I don’t think being Ramuh gave him knowledge about Ultima, but maybe it allowed him to see the flow of aether in the world or something, which helped him piece together that the Mothercrystals were draining the world instead of supplying it with aether.
    Considering he worked for them, it might be something he saw them do.
    Well in this case I feel its more intuitive, he had access to certain history and seeing the cause and effects of certain things/events but nothing solid
    He was the former lord commander to the right hand man of the god who created the mothercrystals. I think he attained some inkling of truth during his time with Barnabas - leading to his desertion. I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima. Another thing: Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis: it is 'heretical' because it is inconvenient to Valisthea's power structure and thus supressed. That simple. He acknowledges that he may not be the first one to have speculated the mothercrystals to be behind the blight, but his insight into the machinations of Barnabas/Ultima must've cemented it as surety.
        The main thing we're discussing here is "why do Clive/Jill and everyone else so readily accept Cid's crazy theory".

> I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima.

Yes, but Cid never mentions any of this to Clive/Jill when he's explaining his theory. He just puts it out there and they go "WHAT??? ... Well ok." It'd be a whole different matter if he explains that he intuited this from his time beside Barnabas, and from seeing Barnabas acting weirdly around the crystals, or something else during his fight near the crystals. I would find that completely convincing. But the game does not do that. Clive and Jill simply take his vaguely plausible theory as fact and set off to destroy a mothercrystal.

>Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis

Again, that's besides the point. Even when Clive and Jill hear the theory, they are flabbergasted. Meaning it is not some inherently obvious thing that everyone has just shut away. A small number of people theorized it before, and for various reasons never spoke out or acted on it. But to the large majority of people, it is 1) entirely blasphemous and 2) there is no evidence for this theory whatsoever.

Put another way, Cid is proposing to completely upset their entire understanding of the world and the crystals. You would expect him to provide some stronger evidence for this, especially since Clive and Jill are still acting on his plan 5 years later when there's still no sign of things getting better.
            I actually do agree that it would have been good for the story to back up Cid's contention a bit more. But really, just look at the map and see that the blight tends to be where the mothercrystals are not, and then ask yourself where all the aether in those crystals come from.
            I feel like you're hyper-focused on Clive & Jill's reaction. People at the hideaway are aware of Cid's plan, and they all actively practice his theory: they survive in the deadlands with no magic. Evidence is hardly a significant factor in popular beliefs, especially in religious societies. I also consider how Clive & Jill have both been lost and aimless for over a decade before Cid - where an opportunity to arise where they can follow a righteous cause, I feel them most inclined to join with less scepticism than the average person. But, seeing as they've seen evidence for themselves, and then Cid's hypothesis (this order is going to cause confusion as we see) - I feel they're justified nonetheless. I agree with the general sentiment - I wish they elaborated on Cid's knowledge of Ultima - but I didn't feel unsatisfied with it in the end.
                Definitely, it's not a major issue I have with the game.

I just think it's slightly funny how Cid proposes this wild crazy idea, and they just wholly buy into it with no questions asked (after that scene). You can chalk it up to Cid's crazy Charisma stat and the FF theme playing, that ought to be enough to convince anyone!
I don't believe that's how it went down.
Sure he's probably smarter than the average person but....
I bet you he was told the plan by Barnabas or ultima, including the crystals draining aether, the sealed ultimas, the magic spell, mythos, the promised land, the whole lot.  Probably why he left and started the rebellion.
Also when you're in Caer Norvent, and then finally face off against Benedikta in the cutscene where Benedikta semi-primed kicks Cid's semi-primed ass, Benedikta is sitting and then says about Greagor that she is a false god. Which maybe means that those from Waloed know something more about Ultima that those in storm don't. The religion Circle of Malius was also more widespread there so probably everyone knows about Ultima in some form. Which is super weird how Tomes didn't know anything about Ultima, maybe none of it got written down and everything got passed along as an oral tradition.
This is precisely what I was thinking too, I have a feeling something went down with Cid and Barnabas and maybe Ultima which led to the destroying of the Motes of Water and their Dominant - Leviathan. Maybe it had something to do with Magic or power, Barnabas ordering Cid to kill Leviathan or Cid witnessing Ultima absorb Leviathan. All of which led Cid to eventually abandon the Kingdom of Waloed cause of all the shit Magic was causing and lives being lost because of it.
    Ordering the Lightning guy to kill the Water guy is some top-tier Pokemon logic from the King of Waleod.
        🤣 Hey, people wanted more elemental damage stuff in this game
...Well there ya go! Lol
    I don't think Cid, and likely Barnabas, had anything to do with Leviathan. Joshua comments that even "Leviathan the Lost" is on the mural depicting the various eikons. This certainly indicates that Leviathan has been missing for generations. I'm sure Ultima had something to do with it (maybe the dominant found out Ultima's plot and worked something against it?), but there is no indication whatsoever that Cid or Barnabas killed the dominant of Leviathan.

Cid left Waloed for many reasons, but this is not it.

Edit: typo.
Isn't it more likely Cid learned of Ultima while being Lord Commander of Waloed? There were statues of him in that giant tower and I doubt Barnabus ever shut up about him haha
It seems like the versions of Ultima trapped into the Cristals are linked to an element.
What make me say this is that Ultima doesn't use water moves against Clive. So that make me think that it's impossible for him to use them, even if we know that Leviathan existed.

So it might be because while absorbing others versions of them, a part was lacking. The water part I guess. So I think that the water Ultima is either sealed or dead.

But the gigantic "frozen" wave might be the answer. It just might be a Cristal...
    Creating Origin out of the water is a water move

Leviathan doesn't really cast water at people but more indirectly.
        How do you know ?
Have you seen it in action ? Do you know something about about the DLC we don't know ?

Is it cannon that Leviathan throw water more than he use magic ?

That said I'm not sure that Origin is made out of water.
            You can see Leviathan behaving this way in FFXV.  She uses water as a display of power while directly attacking with her physical form.  The only water actually thrown at Noctis is clones of her physical form and we see plenty of clones with Ultima.  It's also questionable if those water attacks were directed at Noctis as their function was to separate him from Prompto for a proper 1v1 duel.

Origin is made of crystal yet the structure is built with rotations suggesting a hurricane formed the design:

That's a good point. I'm pulling at straws here with this thought so feel free to tell me if it's dumb 😅 But was it ever stated where Otto was from? 
His position is a Chief Steward of the ship- and previously he was a Purser on a trade ship, which makes me think wherever he was from dealt with the seas. Maybe he was part of the tribe of the Motes of Water?
What I'm getting at is, Otto mentions to Clive that when his son was born, the "Magic awoke inside him", his son was taken away by the constable - as his family wanted "the monster taken away". 

Is it at all possible that perhaps Otto's son was born the dominant of Leviathan - he'd been taken away hence "lost"? 
Maybe the family didn't know the kid was a dominant and not just a bearer. OR, maybe an Uncontrolled Leviathan awoke and caused chaos leading to his family wanting "the monster taken away"
    That's a very interesting take!! It also makes you wonder if he knew about Joshua!! Cause Joshua is another one that is sorta hunting and protecting Clive from Ultima!! Would be interesting in a DLC to see how Cid learns of Ultima and the possibility that him Joshua have some sort of alliance or if not how closely their stories are in their knowledge of Ultima!!
        Appreciate it bud!😁

So with your point above, while that would be cool, I don't think Cid had much knowledge of Joshua and what he was up to or his intentions. But Cid was definitely the first to figure out that Joshua was alive. 

I say this because in the beginning of the story Clive and Cid were looking for the second Dominant of fire. Gav had reported hearing of a dominant of fire traveling through some of the towns. This was obviously Joshua and Jote sneaking around trying not to be detected. When Cid witnesses Clive turn into Ifrit against Garuda, he realises Clive is "the second dominant of fire". Afterwards when Clive is all emo after realising he is Ifrit, they again get a report of "a dominant of fire" in one of the towns (likely when Benedicta Captured Jote and Joshua). Cid and Clive head out to the location to meet Gav. As they're leaving Clive says there's no point since he is The dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise that if he is the second dominant of fire then it can only mean the one they've been tracking all along was Joshua. He says "THINK about it Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. 

So yeah, I think this was the extent of Cids knowledge of Joshua - just that he was alive. 

Does make me wonder tho as to why Benedicta captured Joshua and Jote in the first place 🤔
            Oh that's right I forgot about that exchange!! I am curious if they do do a DLC about Cid and his knowledge of Ultima if there is some sort of overlap of what Jote and Joshua are doing to stop Ultima and what Cid knows of Ultima and Gav scouting the 2nd dominant of fire!! But what ever they do I'm all for just to have more of this world and story to play!!
            Barnabas wanted to “unite” the Dominants (really capture them and force them to submit)…probably to make it easy for Clive to take all their powers at once.

He failed Ultima in this regard when Benedikta was killed and Joshua escaped.

Figure, he already had Benedikta (wish we knew if she was privy to exact nature of Barnabas plans). Would have had Joshua had he not escaped. In the Battle of Belenus Tor, he probably would have engaged Bahamut more aggressively with the intent to capture him. Kupka was cucked and manipulated, and would have went along with whatever Benedikta wanted. He himself had Jill captive at once point, and would have forced Clive to absorb her Eikon. 

The “unite the Dominant” conversation he had with Benedikta while in bed became a sore subject when she brought up Cid. He would have been the hardest for Barnabas to get considering he knew of the bigger picture, and he managed to keep himself under the radar for years after defecting from Waloed.
    That would be cool, but I sort of think the medicine girl is Leviathan.
        I thought this. From what we see/what is made known to us…..Dominants don’t prime for the first time unless under extreme emotional duress.

-Joshua and Clive at Phoenix Gate

-Jill right before she about to be raped by the Crusaders

-Although not confirmed, it’s possible Barnabas turned into Odin for the first time after his mother was executed.

-Can’t really explain the others since we don’t know enough about them when they were younger.

Kihel (the medicine girl) girl had already suffered from her grandmothers death, and witnessing the events that happened in the Dominion. Any of those things should have but her under enough duress to prime.
        I think the medicine girl is carbuncle. There’s a whole other part of the world. I think there may be dominants that exist that are not on the mural.
Yup! I should correct that bit. I should rather say he's influenced by Ultima. I feel like somewhere along the way Ultima influenced Barnabas in some way, whether that was by using his mother as collateral or feeding him lies about an afterlife, Barnabas bought into that vision on his own and accepted his "place" in Ultima's plan.
    I believe he's fully aware of Ultima's plan. His family's tribe has also worshipped Ultima for ages and is probably the reason why his mother was killed by nonbelievers. His whole fight with Clive was strictly about whose beliefs, will, and convictions were stronger.
The lore surrounding the Circle of Malius strongly suggests Barnabas was born into the religion and knew his destiny from childhood, or at least since his mother was slain. It's also suggested somewhere Barnabas is Akashic and may have been living far longer than we know. This strongly suggests Barnabas has always known of Ultima, which begs the question, how much did the rest of the Royal Army know? Did Benedikta? Was Cid also complicit? Hard to believe so, unless they didn't know the long term strategy.

Much of Barnabas's early ambitions are shrouded in mystery, like why he had his Royal Intelligencers rounding up the Dominants. It seems counter-intuitive to the overarching plan: Clive being tested and absorbing all their powers.
    Yeah, I also had a feeling that something weird was up with Barnabas. I'm not exactly sure why Ultima chose Barnabas or rather Odin to be under his control yet not the other Dominants. 

After reading your comment it does make alot of sense that Barnabas was aware of Ultima since childhood. I know Vivian had mentioned that Barnabas basically became king by defeating other armies all while he was basically a Child/barely an adult (along those lines). Him being under Ultima's control would explain how he had that kind of power at such a young age. 
 
Also, Barnabas seems to share this weird thing with his mother. 
But after thinking about it, perhaps he seems so attached to the memory of his young mother and acts like a child when he remembers her (placing his head on her lap and stuff) because he was taken from her when he was a child or Ultima killed her and took control of Barnabas. So his only memories of his mother was when He was still in that toddler phase of his life. Pretty sure he has some hectic PTSD
        When Clive kills Barnabas he says something that implies that he was Ahashik all along. Also when Vivian gives you the background on Waloed, she says that Barnabas has been around for a while and basically haven't aged, also implying that he is Alashic. But it doesn't line up with all Akashik being basically thoughtless puppets. I mean, Barnabas still has thoughts and a will even if that will is to submit his will to Ultima... That just doesn't add up for me, but maybe its because Barnabas is a dominant he retained some of his will after turning?

ALSO if Cid knew about Ultima wanting Clive why didn't he have that conversation with him? One could argue that he thought that it would never come to that, but if he knew the extent of Ultima's power, he would have known that he would get to Clive sooner or later. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was also no indication that Cid knew Joshua was alive. He just said something along the lines of "oh so it WAS you" when he saw Clive prime into Ifrit.
            Ahh I forgot about that bit from Vivian. Yeah I was also confused by the whole Akashic thing. But I guess Ultima likely took control of Barnabas the same way he did with Olivier, capturing them at a young age and turning them into this hybrid kind of Akashic. Still not exactly sure why Ultima took control of Olivier though since he wasn't a dominant so he couldn't have had that same will Barnabas did to remain conscious. And Anabella was doing a pretty good job of messing up the Emperors head all by herself lol so Oliviers influence wasn't needed much. 

If I had to guess, Cid probably knew of Ultima before meeting Clive but maybe realised what Clive was too late to make him aware of any danger he was in. 🤷‍♂️

Cid did figure out Joshua was alive after their fight with Garuda. 
When Cid witnessed Clive turn into Ifrit, he realises that Clive is the 2nd dominant of fire they'd been looking for. However, afterwards Gav still reports of this "Second dominant of fire" being sighted near Kingsfall (likely when Benedicta Captured Joshua and Jote). 
Clive is too emo realising he is Ifrit and killed his brother, meanwhile Cid sets up a meeting with Gav to talk about info he has. 
As they leave to meet Gav, Clive says there's no point because He is the 2nd Dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise a very obvious point by saying "Think about Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. But basically here he was trying to make Clive realise that if He is the 2nd Dominant of fire then the one they've been tracking all this time can only be Joshua. So yeah I think Cid definitely figured it out, while Clive didn't entertain that thought because in his mind Joshua was for sure dead.
                You know, regarding Olivier.... When Clive and Joshua confront Anabella about why she betrayed her country and her family and she goes on about bloodlines and how Joshua was week and blah blah blah she said that she had a child with the emperor to combine his bloodline with hers so that she can have a child "blessed by both Bahamut and the Phoenix". The demo scene with Anabella and Elwin suggested that it is Elwin's ducal line that has Phoenix dominants and that it skipped him and went to Joshua, hence him saying that he's just warming up the seat. But if it's Elwin's line then why would Anabella say that...

OH THANK YOU! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, it sounded like Cid was about to tell Clive that "the other dominant of fire" has to be Joshua, but still interesting that after being interrupted that one time Cid never brought it up again. I just thought that after Cid saw that Clive was Ifrit he would have thought that the "other dominant of fire" Clive was chasing is just a random Bearer that Clive just thought to be a dominant because he was so obsessed with finding his brother's killer. Like no one saw that other guy prime and it was just rumours that he's a Bearer/ possibly dominant a dominant so Cid could have thought Clive was just chasing shadows. But you're right, Cid is smart and he would have known.
                    Haha! No prob, it was such a throwaway line from Cid it could've easily been missed but yeah, Cid was super smart - but to your point I have no idea why Cid never raises this to Clive again, or makes him aware. I'd assume he saw Clive was still on his journey of fighting and accepting his past so maybe he decided to wait for Clive to embrace his past and what he is. Because I think right after Clive "finds the flame" (what a track) It's followed by Cids death. 

So yeah! That part with Annabella confused tf out of me until I realised something very disturbing in the active Time lore which is that Annabella and Elwin are cousins 😬 
So yeah, she's also part of the Phoenix Bloodline. Which is likely why she felt high and mighty hooking up with the empor since now both parents have pure bloodlines for two powerful Eikons. Made if kinda funny tho seeing as Olivier wasn't born a dominant lol.
                        Those are great points about the Rosarian bloodline. As far as the Lesage bloodline…Annabelle implied that Dion was the result of Sylvester having a tryst with a common folk person. Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.

-Kupka was a foot soldier in the Dhalmekian Army
-Benedikta was a slave/common folk villager
-Cid was a sailor who happened to end up in the service of Barnabas
-Barnabas himself was a wanderer/cultist
        I want to add to this that Barnabas was never "under Ultima's control" per se; Clive says as much when he kills Barnabas (IIRC) and to his peers, that Barnabas submitted to Ultima of his own volition; that was his will, and that he is a hypocrite to want to strip humanity of *their* will when it was his own freedom that allowed him to choose Ultima.

Barnabas is a foil to Clive - both are pre-ordained "chosen ones"  so to speak. Barnabas mirrors the Abrahamic Messiah trope in many ways, knowing his destiny and choosing to fulfill it. I think that plays into why Ultima is so baffled by Clive's resistance. Many before him, including his chosen Odin, submitted themselves, so why wouldn't Clive? To Ultima it probably appears humanity has some intrinsic desire to submit themselves before their creator, so when Clive "becomes Logos" he can't wrap his brain around a human "becoming his own god." It's important Barnabas charted that path first, being a prophet and martyr to submit himself first.

Those are my thoughts on it anyway lol.
            Hmmm, that's a really good point. I figured Barnabas was just taken control of the same way Ultima took control of Olivier. So had Barnabas been torn from his mother during childhood - he basically gave in to Ultima because he had nobody else. Kind of like he was forced to submit to Ultima and accepted whatever vision Ultima gave him. Which is why he feels its okay for others to have their will stripped away and submit because that's what he had done - Which in turn is a result of Ultima's influence. And when he has these PTSD-like flashbacks of his mother, it shows a kind of sad side to Barnabas though it's not explained why. I would think Ultima killed his mother and gave Barnabas some kind of false idea that he had "saved" her from this forsaken land, which is why when Barnabas dies he says "At long last, Salvation (Deliverence from harm/ruin)" "I'm coming home, mother". (Atleast that's sort of how I saw it lol) 

But I guess there's alot of ambiguity and grey area with Barnabas' early life to really say for sure exactly what happened there. 

I do think your thoughts could be 100% plausible though. That's the thing with this game man - it's so amazing but alot of the finer details are left to our interpretation 😮‍💨
    Or Barnabas rounding up the Dominants was in an attempt to simplify the process. If Ultima had taken Clive during the first encounter, he would have to go to a single place to absorb the remaining Dominants.

It's possible Cod would have been aware of this plan, and part of why he left.
    According to Vivian and the calendar, Barnabas has been king of Waloed for at least 40-50 years…possibly longer.

The reason that he is not a mindless Akashic is because of his being a Dominant. Being a host for Odin allowed him to keep his mind. 

It is also possible Barnabas was born with a different name. He is the only known Dominant of Odin, meanwhile countless people in a number of bloodlines have served as Dominants to their respective Eikons. It’s very much possible that Barnabas himself is several hundred years old.
        Only a previous Dominant of Phoenix is mentioned as having helped Rosaria repel a Northern Territory invasion decades/centuries prior to the start of the game (presumably they had a Shiva of their own at the time). But it's odd that only some of the Eikons/Dominants are known and followed through generations while others aren't (shown to be) considered. The Valisthean religion/'common knowledge' around Eikons - that there are 8 - is at least centuries if not millennia old. So how come people know of Odin (and Leviathan) but not of their Dominants?

And what if the dominant left Valisthea and went to the other continent? Sure there isn't aether there, but they can still use their internal magic to Prime. 

Wouldn't go so far as to say it's a plot hole, but clearly the writers threw a lot at the wall during worldbuilding and conveniently forgot that it's still there when people start wondering about things.
            I would have liked them to have gone into the history of the Eikons a lot more than they did. It's supposed to be this power struggle that's been playing out for thousands and thousands of years yet it very much feels like the versions we encounter in game are their definitive incarnations. As you say there is a reference to an earlier Phoenix fighting an earlier Shiva but *that's it.*

With the scale of the Eikon fights we see in the game you wonder how this world ever survived even a few years with these things marauding around. Yet we don't hear the details of any famous clashes or the names of any famous Dominants of the past.

At one point in the recent past Waloed had the power of Odin, Ramuh, and Garuda on it's side, how on Earth did it not just sweep over Storm? How has the Iron Kingdom survived this long without a permanent Dominant or any allies? And the lack of any historical conflict between the nations of Storm is just kind of haphazardly waved away by the fact they've all been allied for  like 50 years and anything before that is conveniently left unexplained.

The history and worldbuilding feels pretty lazy to me once you go back earlier than the events depicted in the game. Perhaps they should have hired GRRM to write some backstory like From did with Elden Ring.
    The implication seems to be as you said that Barnabas has been a follower of Ultima his entire generations-long life, which makes it really odd to me that he only really ramps it up publicly during the events of the game. He literally redrew the map of Ash singlehandedly yet never tried to enforce the Circle of Malius as the state religion?

As for why he tried to gather all the Dominant's together I presumed it was just because he knew they were vital to Ultima's plan. It's a lot easier to test Mythos if you literally have all those who need to test him on your side. Presumably this is the same reason he was allied with Hugo yet didn't intervene to help him against Shiva or Bahamut, as he needed them alive too.

But then again, he literally fights against Bahamut and the Phoenix in the game so who knows. Waloed's motivations and schemes throughout the game feel enigmatic for the sake of being enigmatic a lot of the time.
Cid was Barnabas Lord Commander for years. There are a number of reasons Cid may have defected.

-Barnabas may have been a noble leader, but his first encounter with Ultima caused his descent into madness

-Cid probably helped Barnabas conquer Ash. The Veldermarke Royal Family(mentioned in ATL) were the rulers of Ash till they were overthrown. Maybe in the midst of his descent into madness, Barnabas sacked Stonhyrr, slaughtered everyone, royal family included. This could be another reason.

-Barnabas taking Benediktas as his lover (it would make sense if Cid had a romantic relationship with her)

-this is made up by me…..but Cid has an engineering background. Maybe he was the one who built the Black Galleon. It’s also possible that Cid had the plans for the first prototype of the Mythril Engine at this time. Barnabas may have planed to create an unstoppable fleet with the intent to conquer the Twins….and this didn’t sit well with Cid.
Lmao!! I actually missed that line but that's hilarious. But I think that was more of a tongue and cheek line for us the viewers because from the Demo/starting of the story, only we as viewers are aware that Clive is infact Ifrit. 

Cid seemed genuinely perplexed and surprised when Clive transformed into Ifrit when facing Garuda. And came to the realisation saying something like "the shadow you've been chasing had been inside you all along" while he sees Clive passed out on the ground.
But then how would you play it without your Ps5 and the Disk 😏

![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)
    I'd use my ps5/recliner/coffee table/car money to buy a new game and PS5 🤣
        😂😂😂 Perfect. Man's got it all figured out 🫡
Barnabas is an akashic who hasn't aged in 40+ years and is the only known Dominant of Odin. He also doesn't semi-prime the same way as the rest, so clearly some Ultima influence is at hand.
Lol! Oh nah, it was on OmegaPro's playthrough. But I've been checking Kataclysm's from time to time 😏.. but she's still a bit early in the game
Other interesting tidbits:  
\- Ramuh has the 'wise intelligent summon' thing going on in a number of FF games (ff14 and ff15 come to mind)

\- Cid in the other FF games is usually not just an engineer, but a defector from the evil empire who makes it his mission to take down that empire. He did this in ff4, ff6, ff14, and probably others in the series that I'm not remembering (I also haven't beaten 5, 8 and 9 yet).
    That is a neat observation! Though we should quality that "makes it his/her mission to take down an empire" encompasses almost every party member (and allies) in each game where there is an evil empire, so it's a slightly less unique trait than one might think :p
        Right-the point I was making is that Cid in a number of games is a defector- having previously worked as an engineer for said empire.
            Sure, I was ribbing that "goes against the empire" is pretty common around these parts.

(I actually couldn't remember what FF7 Cid's position on Shinra (which is a corporate empire) was, but it looks like he was still hoping Shinra would come around and restart the space program?)
                Looks like ff7 had a defector Cid as well. From the ff wiki:  


"Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra."
                    Eh, I dunno if calling him a shinra employee makes sense though really, at most a contractor for like a few months/years before being ditched by them for years. Less defector, more like another guy that was screwed over by shinra.
                        But the wiki stated shinra former engineer. That's basically meant former employee right? There's no need to dispute.
                            The rocket program had been ended along with Cid's employment for many years before the events of VII, so he had no particular loyalty left with Shinra when he joins you. Which only happens because Shinra came to steal his airplane and wrecked its ability to fly when he refused to give it up.
    Balthier is the son of a non defected cid. Does that count?
        Balthier is kind of a Cid stand-in in that game! And the leading man, no less.
            The true main character in my eyes. Probably my favorite FF character
            He's literally the Mid stand-in. It's his middle name! Well Mied in the English version, but it's just Mid in Japanese.
        Balthier was my dude. Sky pirate with a heart of gold and a hot ass lancer lady at his side.
    Technically this is the case in VII as well, but with shinra instead
    X as well, Cid is an Al Bhed, who are defectors from the ways of Yevon
    In FFIX, Ramuh is also kind of a mentor. I won't spoil it for you. And Cid also helps the team go against the empire. I'm foggy on the details though.
    Wow! So this is my first FF game (I tried 14 but gave up after 3 separate attempts - just wasn't doing it for me) 

But yeah i have no knowledge of what prior character names and themes get carried over. I wanted to know... Who was Ultima in previous games? 
In the video I'd watched when Joshua addressed Ultima the entire chat kept spamming "Holy shit, Ultima!?" "OMG ULTIMA" "ITS Ultima! "
So I got the idea that like the Eikons, Ultima was also in past games. Was he also like..A main boss character in those games?
        Ultima was typically 'Ultima weapon'- essentially a beast that was created to be a weapon. It's also the name of 'the ultimate spell' called Ultima. So Ultima has been around in a number of forms in the various games. I don't recall a main villain being called Ultima before 16.
            Tactics did it, but that Ultima was a woman and a demon.
                I'm hopeful for a remake as I missed it the first time around somehow. Maybe once I finish the mainline entries I'll emulate if a remake isn't close at hand.
        Ultima, the High Seraph, was present in XII (not the same but the name is related) and was brought back in FFXIV too.
        This might be reading into it more than the devs intended, but I like the idea that Ultima is this FF’s incarnation of the Ultima Weapon. However in this game the Ultima Weapon is so powerful and destructive that Clive outright rejects “wielding” it and ultimately rejects magic altogether.
        Ultima is usually a monster or a spell or a weapon (or all of those!) but is also the final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics. As a monster it's usually called Ultima Weapon and tends to be either a major boss or an optional mega-boss. As a spell it's usually the ultimate destructive magic and in this role it's a part of the storylines of II, IX, and XIV.
    12 and 7 in a way as well.
    8 and 9 Cid have effectively the same role. They are the head of the good kingdom/school and want to see justice brought.
        I mean if you think about ff8 and 9 cids do in fact almost fit the same role. In ff8 Cid is creating a school to fight back against the sorceress his wife will become and her boss. In ff9 Cid starts the whole game by hiring to talons to kidnap garnet to fight back against the plans queen brahn is enacting. In both he isn't a defector but he is working against family and the evils they will be committing
    8 and 9, he's not necessarily the bad guy, but he doesn't do much to rectify much either. 8, he just has child soldiers XD and 9 his whole thing is he cheated on his wife.
    Cid in FF7 also used to work for Shinra's space program.
    Which is exactly why Cid in FF12 is such an interesting twist vs overall FF history.

In that instance Cid worked with the empire and made them stronger with manufactured nethicite. Plus I just liked his voice actor and the general bravado that was brought to his scenes.

    Such an awesome point you made there. Now that I think about it, it’s similar for FF tactics advance. Cid was a judge for the kingdom of Ivalice, and had a change of heart after the MC (Marche) convinced him
    Cid was the royal mechanic
Lmao I though the ATL was referencing Atlanta and I spent like 5 minutes wondering what we had to do with Final Fantasy
Literally had they put this in 15 I would have enjoyed 15 so much better. The ATL is the best thing final fantasy  added to the series.
Isn’t that lazy though? Like, explain that naturally or in the cutscenes/gameplay.

As soon as that shit with Vivian was introduced I rolled my eyes
    Yea honestly i thought it's kinda lazy (especially vivian's map thing that gets overused) or they overloaded the dialogue with some fluff that couldve been some very crucial information instead.

The demo definitely handled this the best (and honestly it's still pretty good before the second timeskip), because they said and showed exactly what we needed to know, but used the ATL for worldbuilding that isnt necessary to the enjoyment of the story (like metia or jill and torgal's origin)
As someone who compulsively read all the lore entries as they released there are a number of times I was having to do a double take as to whether or not that had been addressed in the game yet/or at all. There a some times where those entries jump the gun with revealing info early, "Ultima's Thralls" before Ultima is even introduced comes to mind.
I mean they explain throughout the game *why* everyone joined Cid. He didn't just approach them with that, he earned their trust fighting for people who had nothing, i.e. the bearers.

By the time he did tell others, they knew he was a good person and was fighting for the right cause.
    They explain why they join Cid at the hideaway and saving bearers. But his plan to destroy the crystals is pretty new. And Clive and Jill pretty quickly jump on his plan despite having 0 evidence for his theory (and still no evidence for it 5 years later, where they still keep to it).

This makes sense in-universe, because in-universe they know that Ramuh is just supposed to *know things*, so it's totally reasonable for them to trust Cid's crazy plan.
        Not entirely new though. Several people, even outside the hideout, mention Cid told them the truth and implied it was a plan long in the making.

That's why he invented things like the bellows, or initiated the gardening program. They exist because he knew mankind needed to live without crystals. It wasn't random, Cid had this going long before Clive came into the picture.
        Which, by the way, didn't really seem all that problematic for Ultima in the end. So there are limits to Ramuh's gift.
        To this point - I will say that for Final Fantasy 16 specifically where so much of the games story is explained in detail - from an entire encyclopedia to endless bits of dialogue with NPC's, to the Active Time lore.. I'm not disagreeing but I do feel like the explanation of Ramuh just knows things..Doesn't quite fit. Not saying it's wrong, just that in this game that feels like a cheap way to explain something. 

When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient. I overlooked this bit because that's a pretty broad statement, especially when places like Rosaria for instance and Elwin had a different mindset and treated Bearers better. Surely there'd have been enough people to realise this and for the well-being of the land do something about it. Just felt that little bit of reasoning was weak. Like if they were speaking specifically about one of the kingdoms then yeah...But the whole of Valesthia? Cmon now ..
            The whole world knows what carbon emissions are doing to our planet but we can't seem to really do anything about it 🤷🏾‍♂️
            >When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient.

Would you want to believe the very things that are thought to be your salvation are really just pushing you toward your doom?

Add in Ultima being the mastermind behind the scenes and the actual spoilers behind WHAT Ultima is, well, it's not really far fetched that no one would believe the logic Cid points out about the Blight.
            There was an undercurrent in the whole story that people in positions of power had been destroying/ hording knowledge that would or could be used to help the bearers or improve the lives of the common people in order to maintain their positions... I think it's possible to infer from this that there were others who had figured out what Cid had, but suppressed the knowledge in order to maintain their status quo of power.
 I do agree that it is a bit unbelievable that absolutely nobody without a vested interest would have worked it out, and perhaps they did, but what would be the cost of trying to fight that? You'd basically need it to be someone like Dion to actually act on that knowledge before you got squashed in the other kingdoms. Perhaps if Elwin had lived and Joshua had taken the throne there would have been someone else to speak up against an inconvenient truth.
            I think what Cid meant by this was that lots of people had figured out that the mothercrystals were the cause of the blight, but they refused to give them up because doing so would destroy a lot of people's power and easy living.

I think it's an allegory for some other inconvenient truth, but what could that be hmm?
I said this the other day and got downvoted for it. I completely agree. 

I don’t think being Ramuh gave him knowledge about Ultima, but maybe it allowed him to see the flow of aether in the world or something, which helped him piece together that the Mothercrystals were draining the world instead of supplying it with aether.
Considering he worked for them, it might be something he saw them do.
Well in this case I feel its more intuitive, he had access to certain history and seeing the cause and effects of certain things/events but nothing solid
He was the former lord commander to the right hand man of the god who created the mothercrystals. I think he attained some inkling of truth during his time with Barnabas - leading to his desertion. I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima. Another thing: Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis: it is 'heretical' because it is inconvenient to Valisthea's power structure and thus supressed. That simple. He acknowledges that he may not be the first one to have speculated the mothercrystals to be behind the blight, but his insight into the machinations of Barnabas/Ultima must've cemented it as surety.
    The main thing we're discussing here is "why do Clive/Jill and everyone else so readily accept Cid's crazy theory".

> I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima.

Yes, but Cid never mentions any of this to Clive/Jill when he's explaining his theory. He just puts it out there and they go "WHAT??? ... Well ok." It'd be a whole different matter if he explains that he intuited this from his time beside Barnabas, and from seeing Barnabas acting weirdly around the crystals, or something else during his fight near the crystals. I would find that completely convincing. But the game does not do that. Clive and Jill simply take his vaguely plausible theory as fact and set off to destroy a mothercrystal.

>Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis

Again, that's besides the point. Even when Clive and Jill hear the theory, they are flabbergasted. Meaning it is not some inherently obvious thing that everyone has just shut away. A small number of people theorized it before, and for various reasons never spoke out or acted on it. But to the large majority of people, it is 1) entirely blasphemous and 2) there is no evidence for this theory whatsoever.

Put another way, Cid is proposing to completely upset their entire understanding of the world and the crystals. You would expect him to provide some stronger evidence for this, especially since Clive and Jill are still acting on his plan 5 years later when there's still no sign of things getting better.
        I actually do agree that it would have been good for the story to back up Cid's contention a bit more. But really, just look at the map and see that the blight tends to be where the mothercrystals are not, and then ask yourself where all the aether in those crystals come from.
        I feel like you're hyper-focused on Clive & Jill's reaction. People at the hideaway are aware of Cid's plan, and they all actively practice his theory: they survive in the deadlands with no magic. Evidence is hardly a significant factor in popular beliefs, especially in religious societies. I also consider how Clive & Jill have both been lost and aimless for over a decade before Cid - where an opportunity to arise where they can follow a righteous cause, I feel them most inclined to join with less scepticism than the average person. But, seeing as they've seen evidence for themselves, and then Cid's hypothesis (this order is going to cause confusion as we see) - I feel they're justified nonetheless. I agree with the general sentiment - I wish they elaborated on Cid's knowledge of Ultima - but I didn't feel unsatisfied with it in the end.
            Definitely, it's not a major issue I have with the game.

I just think it's slightly funny how Cid proposes this wild crazy idea, and they just wholly buy into it with no questions asked (after that scene). You can chalk it up to Cid's crazy Charisma stat and the FF theme playing, that ought to be enough to convince anyone!
Ordering the Lightning guy to kill the Water guy is some top-tier Pokemon logic from the King of Waleod.
    🤣 Hey, people wanted more elemental damage stuff in this game
...Well there ya go! Lol
I don't think Cid, and likely Barnabas, had anything to do with Leviathan. Joshua comments that even "Leviathan the Lost" is on the mural depicting the various eikons. This certainly indicates that Leviathan has been missing for generations. I'm sure Ultima had something to do with it (maybe the dominant found out Ultima's plot and worked something against it?), but there is no indication whatsoever that Cid or Barnabas killed the dominant of Leviathan.

Cid left Waloed for many reasons, but this is not it.

Edit: typo.
Creating Origin out of the water is a water move

Leviathan doesn't really cast water at people but more indirectly.
    How do you know ?
Have you seen it in action ? Do you know something about about the DLC we don't know ?

Is it cannon that Leviathan throw water more than he use magic ?

That said I'm not sure that Origin is made out of water.
        You can see Leviathan behaving this way in FFXV.  She uses water as a display of power while directly attacking with her physical form.  The only water actually thrown at Noctis is clones of her physical form and we see plenty of clones with Ultima.  It's also questionable if those water attacks were directed at Noctis as their function was to separate him from Prompto for a proper 1v1 duel.

Origin is made of crystal yet the structure is built with rotations suggesting a hurricane formed the design:

That's a very interesting take!! It also makes you wonder if he knew about Joshua!! Cause Joshua is another one that is sorta hunting and protecting Clive from Ultima!! Would be interesting in a DLC to see how Cid learns of Ultima and the possibility that him Joshua have some sort of alliance or if not how closely their stories are in their knowledge of Ultima!!
    Appreciate it bud!😁

So with your point above, while that would be cool, I don't think Cid had much knowledge of Joshua and what he was up to or his intentions. But Cid was definitely the first to figure out that Joshua was alive. 

I say this because in the beginning of the story Clive and Cid were looking for the second Dominant of fire. Gav had reported hearing of a dominant of fire traveling through some of the towns. This was obviously Joshua and Jote sneaking around trying not to be detected. When Cid witnesses Clive turn into Ifrit against Garuda, he realises Clive is "the second dominant of fire". Afterwards when Clive is all emo after realising he is Ifrit, they again get a report of "a dominant of fire" in one of the towns (likely when Benedicta Captured Jote and Joshua). Cid and Clive head out to the location to meet Gav. As they're leaving Clive says there's no point since he is The dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise that if he is the second dominant of fire then it can only mean the one they've been tracking all along was Joshua. He says "THINK about it Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. 

So yeah, I think this was the extent of Cids knowledge of Joshua - just that he was alive. 

Does make me wonder tho as to why Benedicta captured Joshua and Jote in the first place 🤔
        Oh that's right I forgot about that exchange!! I am curious if they do do a DLC about Cid and his knowledge of Ultima if there is some sort of overlap of what Jote and Joshua are doing to stop Ultima and what Cid knows of Ultima and Gav scouting the 2nd dominant of fire!! But what ever they do I'm all for just to have more of this world and story to play!!
        Barnabas wanted to “unite” the Dominants (really capture them and force them to submit)…probably to make it easy for Clive to take all their powers at once.

He failed Ultima in this regard when Benedikta was killed and Joshua escaped.

Figure, he already had Benedikta (wish we knew if she was privy to exact nature of Barnabas plans). Would have had Joshua had he not escaped. In the Battle of Belenus Tor, he probably would have engaged Bahamut more aggressively with the intent to capture him. Kupka was cucked and manipulated, and would have went along with whatever Benedikta wanted. He himself had Jill captive at once point, and would have forced Clive to absorb her Eikon. 

The “unite the Dominant” conversation he had with Benedikta while in bed became a sore subject when she brought up Cid. He would have been the hardest for Barnabas to get considering he knew of the bigger picture, and he managed to keep himself under the radar for years after defecting from Waloed.
That would be cool, but I sort of think the medicine girl is Leviathan.
    I thought this. From what we see/what is made known to us…..Dominants don’t prime for the first time unless under extreme emotional duress.

-Joshua and Clive at Phoenix Gate

-Jill right before she about to be raped by the Crusaders

-Although not confirmed, it’s possible Barnabas turned into Odin for the first time after his mother was executed.

-Can’t really explain the others since we don’t know enough about them when they were younger.

Kihel (the medicine girl) girl had already suffered from her grandmothers death, and witnessing the events that happened in the Dominion. Any of those things should have but her under enough duress to prime.
    I think the medicine girl is carbuncle. There’s a whole other part of the world. I think there may be dominants that exist that are not on the mural.
I believe he's fully aware of Ultima's plan. His family's tribe has also worshipped Ultima for ages and is probably the reason why his mother was killed by nonbelievers. His whole fight with Clive was strictly about whose beliefs, will, and convictions were stronger.
Yeah, I also had a feeling that something weird was up with Barnabas. I'm not exactly sure why Ultima chose Barnabas or rather Odin to be under his control yet not the other Dominants. 

After reading your comment it does make alot of sense that Barnabas was aware of Ultima since childhood. I know Vivian had mentioned that Barnabas basically became king by defeating other armies all while he was basically a Child/barely an adult (along those lines). Him being under Ultima's control would explain how he had that kind of power at such a young age. 
 
Also, Barnabas seems to share this weird thing with his mother. 
But after thinking about it, perhaps he seems so attached to the memory of his young mother and acts like a child when he remembers her (placing his head on her lap and stuff) because he was taken from her when he was a child or Ultima killed her and took control of Barnabas. So his only memories of his mother was when He was still in that toddler phase of his life. Pretty sure he has some hectic PTSD
    When Clive kills Barnabas he says something that implies that he was Ahashik all along. Also when Vivian gives you the background on Waloed, she says that Barnabas has been around for a while and basically haven't aged, also implying that he is Alashic. But it doesn't line up with all Akashik being basically thoughtless puppets. I mean, Barnabas still has thoughts and a will even if that will is to submit his will to Ultima... That just doesn't add up for me, but maybe its because Barnabas is a dominant he retained some of his will after turning?

ALSO if Cid knew about Ultima wanting Clive why didn't he have that conversation with him? One could argue that he thought that it would never come to that, but if he knew the extent of Ultima's power, he would have known that he would get to Clive sooner or later. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was also no indication that Cid knew Joshua was alive. He just said something along the lines of "oh so it WAS you" when he saw Clive prime into Ifrit.
        Ahh I forgot about that bit from Vivian. Yeah I was also confused by the whole Akashic thing. But I guess Ultima likely took control of Barnabas the same way he did with Olivier, capturing them at a young age and turning them into this hybrid kind of Akashic. Still not exactly sure why Ultima took control of Olivier though since he wasn't a dominant so he couldn't have had that same will Barnabas did to remain conscious. And Anabella was doing a pretty good job of messing up the Emperors head all by herself lol so Oliviers influence wasn't needed much. 

If I had to guess, Cid probably knew of Ultima before meeting Clive but maybe realised what Clive was too late to make him aware of any danger he was in. 🤷‍♂️

Cid did figure out Joshua was alive after their fight with Garuda. 
When Cid witnessed Clive turn into Ifrit, he realises that Clive is the 2nd dominant of fire they'd been looking for. However, afterwards Gav still reports of this "Second dominant of fire" being sighted near Kingsfall (likely when Benedicta Captured Joshua and Jote). 
Clive is too emo realising he is Ifrit and killed his brother, meanwhile Cid sets up a meeting with Gav to talk about info he has. 
As they leave to meet Gav, Clive says there's no point because He is the 2nd Dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise a very obvious point by saying "Think about Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. But basically here he was trying to make Clive realise that if He is the 2nd Dominant of fire then the one they've been tracking all this time can only be Joshua. So yeah I think Cid definitely figured it out, while Clive didn't entertain that thought because in his mind Joshua was for sure dead.
            You know, regarding Olivier.... When Clive and Joshua confront Anabella about why she betrayed her country and her family and she goes on about bloodlines and how Joshua was week and blah blah blah she said that she had a child with the emperor to combine his bloodline with hers so that she can have a child "blessed by both Bahamut and the Phoenix". The demo scene with Anabella and Elwin suggested that it is Elwin's ducal line that has Phoenix dominants and that it skipped him and went to Joshua, hence him saying that he's just warming up the seat. But if it's Elwin's line then why would Anabella say that...

OH THANK YOU! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, it sounded like Cid was about to tell Clive that "the other dominant of fire" has to be Joshua, but still interesting that after being interrupted that one time Cid never brought it up again. I just thought that after Cid saw that Clive was Ifrit he would have thought that the "other dominant of fire" Clive was chasing is just a random Bearer that Clive just thought to be a dominant because he was so obsessed with finding his brother's killer. Like no one saw that other guy prime and it was just rumours that he's a Bearer/ possibly dominant a dominant so Cid could have thought Clive was just chasing shadows. But you're right, Cid is smart and he would have known.
                Haha! No prob, it was such a throwaway line from Cid it could've easily been missed but yeah, Cid was super smart - but to your point I have no idea why Cid never raises this to Clive again, or makes him aware. I'd assume he saw Clive was still on his journey of fighting and accepting his past so maybe he decided to wait for Clive to embrace his past and what he is. Because I think right after Clive "finds the flame" (what a track) It's followed by Cids death. 

So yeah! That part with Annabella confused tf out of me until I realised something very disturbing in the active Time lore which is that Annabella and Elwin are cousins 😬 
So yeah, she's also part of the Phoenix Bloodline. Which is likely why she felt high and mighty hooking up with the empor since now both parents have pure bloodlines for two powerful Eikons. Made if kinda funny tho seeing as Olivier wasn't born a dominant lol.
                    Those are great points about the Rosarian bloodline. As far as the Lesage bloodline…Annabelle implied that Dion was the result of Sylvester having a tryst with a common folk person. Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.

-Kupka was a foot soldier in the Dhalmekian Army
-Benedikta was a slave/common folk villager
-Cid was a sailor who happened to end up in the service of Barnabas
-Barnabas himself was a wanderer/cultist
    I want to add to this that Barnabas was never "under Ultima's control" per se; Clive says as much when he kills Barnabas (IIRC) and to his peers, that Barnabas submitted to Ultima of his own volition; that was his will, and that he is a hypocrite to want to strip humanity of *their* will when it was his own freedom that allowed him to choose Ultima.

Barnabas is a foil to Clive - both are pre-ordained "chosen ones"  so to speak. Barnabas mirrors the Abrahamic Messiah trope in many ways, knowing his destiny and choosing to fulfill it. I think that plays into why Ultima is so baffled by Clive's resistance. Many before him, including his chosen Odin, submitted themselves, so why wouldn't Clive? To Ultima it probably appears humanity has some intrinsic desire to submit themselves before their creator, so when Clive "becomes Logos" he can't wrap his brain around a human "becoming his own god." It's important Barnabas charted that path first, being a prophet and martyr to submit himself first.

Those are my thoughts on it anyway lol.
        Hmmm, that's a really good point. I figured Barnabas was just taken control of the same way Ultima took control of Olivier. So had Barnabas been torn from his mother during childhood - he basically gave in to Ultima because he had nobody else. Kind of like he was forced to submit to Ultima and accepted whatever vision Ultima gave him. Which is why he feels its okay for others to have their will stripped away and submit because that's what he had done - Which in turn is a result of Ultima's influence. And when he has these PTSD-like flashbacks of his mother, it shows a kind of sad side to Barnabas though it's not explained why. I would think Ultima killed his mother and gave Barnabas some kind of false idea that he had "saved" her from this forsaken land, which is why when Barnabas dies he says "At long last, Salvation (Deliverence from harm/ruin)" "I'm coming home, mother". (Atleast that's sort of how I saw it lol) 

But I guess there's alot of ambiguity and grey area with Barnabas' early life to really say for sure exactly what happened there. 

I do think your thoughts could be 100% plausible though. That's the thing with this game man - it's so amazing but alot of the finer details are left to our interpretation 😮‍💨
Or Barnabas rounding up the Dominants was in an attempt to simplify the process. If Ultima had taken Clive during the first encounter, he would have to go to a single place to absorb the remaining Dominants.

It's possible Cod would have been aware of this plan, and part of why he left.
According to Vivian and the calendar, Barnabas has been king of Waloed for at least 40-50 years…possibly longer.

The reason that he is not a mindless Akashic is because of his being a Dominant. Being a host for Odin allowed him to keep his mind. 

It is also possible Barnabas was born with a different name. He is the only known Dominant of Odin, meanwhile countless people in a number of bloodlines have served as Dominants to their respective Eikons. It’s very much possible that Barnabas himself is several hundred years old.
    Only a previous Dominant of Phoenix is mentioned as having helped Rosaria repel a Northern Territory invasion decades/centuries prior to the start of the game (presumably they had a Shiva of their own at the time). But it's odd that only some of the Eikons/Dominants are known and followed through generations while others aren't (shown to be) considered. The Valisthean religion/'common knowledge' around Eikons - that there are 8 - is at least centuries if not millennia old. So how come people know of Odin (and Leviathan) but not of their Dominants?

And what if the dominant left Valisthea and went to the other continent? Sure there isn't aether there, but they can still use their internal magic to Prime. 

Wouldn't go so far as to say it's a plot hole, but clearly the writers threw a lot at the wall during worldbuilding and conveniently forgot that it's still there when people start wondering about things.
        I would have liked them to have gone into the history of the Eikons a lot more than they did. It's supposed to be this power struggle that's been playing out for thousands and thousands of years yet it very much feels like the versions we encounter in game are their definitive incarnations. As you say there is a reference to an earlier Phoenix fighting an earlier Shiva but *that's it.*

With the scale of the Eikon fights we see in the game you wonder how this world ever survived even a few years with these things marauding around. Yet we don't hear the details of any famous clashes or the names of any famous Dominants of the past.

At one point in the recent past Waloed had the power of Odin, Ramuh, and Garuda on it's side, how on Earth did it not just sweep over Storm? How has the Iron Kingdom survived this long without a permanent Dominant or any allies? And the lack of any historical conflict between the nations of Storm is just kind of haphazardly waved away by the fact they've all been allied for  like 50 years and anything before that is conveniently left unexplained.

The history and worldbuilding feels pretty lazy to me once you go back earlier than the events depicted in the game. Perhaps they should have hired GRRM to write some backstory like From did with Elden Ring.
The implication seems to be as you said that Barnabas has been a follower of Ultima his entire generations-long life, which makes it really odd to me that he only really ramps it up publicly during the events of the game. He literally redrew the map of Ash singlehandedly yet never tried to enforce the Circle of Malius as the state religion?

As for why he tried to gather all the Dominant's together I presumed it was just because he knew they were vital to Ultima's plan. It's a lot easier to test Mythos if you literally have all those who need to test him on your side. Presumably this is the same reason he was allied with Hugo yet didn't intervene to help him against Shiva or Bahamut, as he needed them alive too.

But then again, he literally fights against Bahamut and the Phoenix in the game so who knows. Waloed's motivations and schemes throughout the game feel enigmatic for the sake of being enigmatic a lot of the time.
I'd use my ps5/recliner/coffee table/car money to buy a new game and PS5 🤣
    😂😂😂 Perfect. Man's got it all figured out 🫡
That is a neat observation! Though we should quality that "makes it his/her mission to take down an empire" encompasses almost every party member (and allies) in each game where there is an evil empire, so it's a slightly less unique trait than one might think :p
    Right-the point I was making is that Cid in a number of games is a defector- having previously worked as an engineer for said empire.
        Sure, I was ribbing that "goes against the empire" is pretty common around these parts.

(I actually couldn't remember what FF7 Cid's position on Shinra (which is a corporate empire) was, but it looks like he was still hoping Shinra would come around and restart the space program?)
            Looks like ff7 had a defector Cid as well. From the ff wiki:  


"Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra."
                Eh, I dunno if calling him a shinra employee makes sense though really, at most a contractor for like a few months/years before being ditched by them for years. Less defector, more like another guy that was screwed over by shinra.
                    But the wiki stated shinra former engineer. That's basically meant former employee right? There's no need to dispute.
                        The rocket program had been ended along with Cid's employment for many years before the events of VII, so he had no particular loyalty left with Shinra when he joins you. Which only happens because Shinra came to steal his airplane and wrecked its ability to fly when he refused to give it up.
Balthier is the son of a non defected cid. Does that count?
    Balthier is kind of a Cid stand-in in that game! And the leading man, no less.
        The true main character in my eyes. Probably my favorite FF character
        He's literally the Mid stand-in. It's his middle name! Well Mied in the English version, but it's just Mid in Japanese.
    Balthier was my dude. Sky pirate with a heart of gold and a hot ass lancer lady at his side.
Technically this is the case in VII as well, but with shinra instead
X as well, Cid is an Al Bhed, who are defectors from the ways of Yevon
In FFIX, Ramuh is also kind of a mentor. I won't spoil it for you. And Cid also helps the team go against the empire. I'm foggy on the details though.
Wow! So this is my first FF game (I tried 14 but gave up after 3 separate attempts - just wasn't doing it for me) 

But yeah i have no knowledge of what prior character names and themes get carried over. I wanted to know... Who was Ultima in previous games? 
In the video I'd watched when Joshua addressed Ultima the entire chat kept spamming "Holy shit, Ultima!?" "OMG ULTIMA" "ITS Ultima! "
So I got the idea that like the Eikons, Ultima was also in past games. Was he also like..A main boss character in those games?
    Ultima was typically 'Ultima weapon'- essentially a beast that was created to be a weapon. It's also the name of 'the ultimate spell' called Ultima. So Ultima has been around in a number of forms in the various games. I don't recall a main villain being called Ultima before 16.
        Tactics did it, but that Ultima was a woman and a demon.
            I'm hopeful for a remake as I missed it the first time around somehow. Maybe once I finish the mainline entries I'll emulate if a remake isn't close at hand.
    Ultima, the High Seraph, was present in XII (not the same but the name is related) and was brought back in FFXIV too.
    This might be reading into it more than the devs intended, but I like the idea that Ultima is this FF’s incarnation of the Ultima Weapon. However in this game the Ultima Weapon is so powerful and destructive that Clive outright rejects “wielding” it and ultimately rejects magic altogether.
    Ultima is usually a monster or a spell or a weapon (or all of those!) but is also the final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics. As a monster it's usually called Ultima Weapon and tends to be either a major boss or an optional mega-boss. As a spell it's usually the ultimate destructive magic and in this role it's a part of the storylines of II, IX, and XIV.
12 and 7 in a way as well.
8 and 9 Cid have effectively the same role. They are the head of the good kingdom/school and want to see justice brought.
    I mean if you think about ff8 and 9 cids do in fact almost fit the same role. In ff8 Cid is creating a school to fight back against the sorceress his wife will become and her boss. In ff9 Cid starts the whole game by hiring to talons to kidnap garnet to fight back against the plans queen brahn is enacting. In both he isn't a defector but he is working against family and the evils they will be committing
8 and 9, he's not necessarily the bad guy, but he doesn't do much to rectify much either. 8, he just has child soldiers XD and 9 his whole thing is he cheated on his wife.
Cid in FF7 also used to work for Shinra's space program.
Which is exactly why Cid in FF12 is such an interesting twist vs overall FF history.

In that instance Cid worked with the empire and made them stronger with manufactured nethicite. Plus I just liked his voice actor and the general bravado that was brought to his scenes.

... I could go on.  Poor guy usually just wants the best for the world, but tends to either fuck it up and atone or just... build airships and blow things up.
Such an awesome point you made there. Now that I think about it, it’s similar for FF tactics advance. Cid was a judge for the kingdom of Ivalice, and had a change of heart after the MC (Marche) convinced him
Cid was the royal mechanic
Yea honestly i thought it's kinda lazy (especially vivian's map thing that gets overused) or they overloaded the dialogue with some fluff that couldve been some very crucial information instead.

The demo definitely handled this the best (and honestly it's still pretty good before the second timeskip), because they said and showed exactly what we needed to know, but used the ATL for worldbuilding that isnt necessary to the enjoyment of the story (like metia or jill and torgal's origin)
They explain why they join Cid at the hideaway and saving bearers. But his plan to destroy the crystals is pretty new. And Clive and Jill pretty quickly jump on his plan despite having 0 evidence for his theory (and still no evidence for it 5 years later, where they still keep to it).

This makes sense in-universe, because in-universe they know that Ramuh is just supposed to *know things*, so it's totally reasonable for them to trust Cid's crazy plan.
    Not entirely new though. Several people, even outside the hideout, mention Cid told them the truth and implied it was a plan long in the making.

That's why he invented things like the bellows, or initiated the gardening program. They exist because he knew mankind needed to live without crystals. It wasn't random, Cid had this going long before Clive came into the picture.
    Which, by the way, didn't really seem all that problematic for Ultima in the end. So there are limits to Ramuh's gift.
    To this point - I will say that for Final Fantasy 16 specifically where so much of the games story is explained in detail - from an entire encyclopedia to endless bits of dialogue with NPC's, to the Active Time lore.. I'm not disagreeing but I do feel like the explanation of Ramuh just knows things..Doesn't quite fit. Not saying it's wrong, just that in this game that feels like a cheap way to explain something. 

When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient. I overlooked this bit because that's a pretty broad statement, especially when places like Rosaria for instance and Elwin had a different mindset and treated Bearers better. Surely there'd have been enough people to realise this and for the well-being of the land do something about it. Just felt that little bit of reasoning was weak. Like if they were speaking specifically about one of the kingdoms then yeah...But the whole of Valesthia? Cmon now ..
        The whole world knows what carbon emissions are doing to our planet but we can't seem to really do anything about it 🤷🏾‍♂️
        >When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient.

Would you want to believe the very things that are thought to be your salvation are really just pushing you toward your doom?

Add in Ultima being the mastermind behind the scenes and the actual spoilers behind WHAT Ultima is, well, it's not really far fetched that no one would believe the logic Cid points out about the Blight.
        There was an undercurrent in the whole story that people in positions of power had been destroying/ hording knowledge that would or could be used to help the bearers or improve the lives of the common people in order to maintain their positions... I think it's possible to infer from this that there were others who had figured out what Cid had, but suppressed the knowledge in order to maintain their status quo of power.
 I do agree that it is a bit unbelievable that absolutely nobody without a vested interest would have worked it out, and perhaps they did, but what would be the cost of trying to fight that? You'd basically need it to be someone like Dion to actually act on that knowledge before you got squashed in the other kingdoms. Perhaps if Elwin had lived and Joshua had taken the throne there would have been someone else to speak up against an inconvenient truth.
        I think what Cid meant by this was that lots of people had figured out that the mothercrystals were the cause of the blight, but they refused to give them up because doing so would destroy a lot of people's power and easy living.

I think it's an allegory for some other inconvenient truth, but what could that be hmm?
The main thing we're discussing here is "why do Clive/Jill and everyone else so readily accept Cid's crazy theory".

> I feel like these things were fairly easy explanations to his general knowledge of the nature of the mothercrystals and of Ultima.

Yes, but Cid never mentions any of this to Clive/Jill when he's explaining his theory. He just puts it out there and they go "WHAT??? ... Well ok." It'd be a whole different matter if he explains that he intuited this from his time beside Barnabas, and from seeing Barnabas acting weirdly around the crystals, or something else during his fight near the crystals. I would find that completely convincing. But the game does not do that. Clive and Jill simply take his vaguely plausible theory as fact and set off to destroy a mothercrystal.

>Cid explains why people haven't yet enacted on his hypothesis

Again, that's besides the point. Even when Clive and Jill hear the theory, they are flabbergasted. Meaning it is not some inherently obvious thing that everyone has just shut away. A small number of people theorized it before, and for various reasons never spoke out or acted on it. But to the large majority of people, it is 1) entirely blasphemous and 2) there is no evidence for this theory whatsoever.

Put another way, Cid is proposing to completely upset their entire understanding of the world and the crystals. You would expect him to provide some stronger evidence for this, especially since Clive and Jill are still acting on his plan 5 years later when there's still no sign of things getting better.
    I actually do agree that it would have been good for the story to back up Cid's contention a bit more. But really, just look at the map and see that the blight tends to be where the mothercrystals are not, and then ask yourself where all the aether in those crystals come from.
    I feel like you're hyper-focused on Clive & Jill's reaction. People at the hideaway are aware of Cid's plan, and they all actively practice his theory: they survive in the deadlands with no magic. Evidence is hardly a significant factor in popular beliefs, especially in religious societies. I also consider how Clive & Jill have both been lost and aimless for over a decade before Cid - where an opportunity to arise where they can follow a righteous cause, I feel them most inclined to join with less scepticism than the average person. But, seeing as they've seen evidence for themselves, and then Cid's hypothesis (this order is going to cause confusion as we see) - I feel they're justified nonetheless. I agree with the general sentiment - I wish they elaborated on Cid's knowledge of Ultima - but I didn't feel unsatisfied with it in the end.
        Definitely, it's not a major issue I have with the game.

I just think it's slightly funny how Cid proposes this wild crazy idea, and they just wholly buy into it with no questions asked (after that scene). You can chalk it up to Cid's crazy Charisma stat and the FF theme playing, that ought to be enough to convince anyone!
🤣 Hey, people wanted more elemental damage stuff in this game
...Well there ya go! Lol
How do you know ?
Have you seen it in action ? Do you know something about about the DLC we don't know ?

Is it cannon that Leviathan throw water more than he use magic ?

That said I'm not sure that Origin is made out of water.
    You can see Leviathan behaving this way in FFXV.  She uses water as a display of power while directly attacking with her physical form.  The only water actually thrown at Noctis is clones of her physical form and we see plenty of clones with Ultima.  It's also questionable if those water attacks were directed at Noctis as their function was to separate him from Prompto for a proper 1v1 duel.

Origin is made of crystal yet the structure is built with rotations suggesting a hurricane formed the design:

Appreciate it bud!😁

So with your point above, while that would be cool, I don't think Cid had much knowledge of Joshua and what he was up to or his intentions. But Cid was definitely the first to figure out that Joshua was alive. 

I say this because in the beginning of the story Clive and Cid were looking for the second Dominant of fire. Gav had reported hearing of a dominant of fire traveling through some of the towns. This was obviously Joshua and Jote sneaking around trying not to be detected. When Cid witnesses Clive turn into Ifrit against Garuda, he realises Clive is "the second dominant of fire". Afterwards when Clive is all emo after realising he is Ifrit, they again get a report of "a dominant of fire" in one of the towns (likely when Benedicta Captured Jote and Joshua). Cid and Clive head out to the location to meet Gav. As they're leaving Clive says there's no point since he is The dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise that if he is the second dominant of fire then it can only mean the one they've been tracking all along was Joshua. He says "THINK about it Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. 

So yeah, I think this was the extent of Cids knowledge of Joshua - just that he was alive. 

Does make me wonder tho as to why Benedicta captured Joshua and Jote in the first place 🤔
    Oh that's right I forgot about that exchange!! I am curious if they do do a DLC about Cid and his knowledge of Ultima if there is some sort of overlap of what Jote and Joshua are doing to stop Ultima and what Cid knows of Ultima and Gav scouting the 2nd dominant of fire!! But what ever they do I'm all for just to have more of this world and story to play!!
    Barnabas wanted to “unite” the Dominants (really capture them and force them to submit)…probably to make it easy for Clive to take all their powers at once.

He failed Ultima in this regard when Benedikta was killed and Joshua escaped.

Figure, he already had Benedikta (wish we knew if she was privy to exact nature of Barnabas plans). Would have had Joshua had he not escaped. In the Battle of Belenus Tor, he probably would have engaged Bahamut more aggressively with the intent to capture him. Kupka was cucked and manipulated, and would have went along with whatever Benedikta wanted. He himself had Jill captive at once point, and would have forced Clive to absorb her Eikon. 

The “unite the Dominant” conversation he had with Benedikta while in bed became a sore subject when she brought up Cid. He would have been the hardest for Barnabas to get considering he knew of the bigger picture, and he managed to keep himself under the radar for years after defecting from Waloed.
I thought this. From what we see/what is made known to us…..Dominants don’t prime for the first time unless under extreme emotional duress.

-Joshua and Clive at Phoenix Gate

-Jill right before she about to be raped by the Crusaders

-Although not confirmed, it’s possible Barnabas turned into Odin for the first time after his mother was executed.

-Can’t really explain the others since we don’t know enough about them when they were younger.

Kihel (the medicine girl) girl had already suffered from her grandmothers death, and witnessing the events that happened in the Dominion. Any of those things should have but her under enough duress to prime.
I think the medicine girl is carbuncle. There’s a whole other part of the world. I think there may be dominants that exist that are not on the mural.
When Clive kills Barnabas he says something that implies that he was Ahashik all along. Also when Vivian gives you the background on Waloed, she says that Barnabas has been around for a while and basically haven't aged, also implying that he is Alashic. But it doesn't line up with all Akashik being basically thoughtless puppets. I mean, Barnabas still has thoughts and a will even if that will is to submit his will to Ultima... That just doesn't add up for me, but maybe its because Barnabas is a dominant he retained some of his will after turning?

ALSO if Cid knew about Ultima wanting Clive why didn't he have that conversation with him? One could argue that he thought that it would never come to that, but if he knew the extent of Ultima's power, he would have known that he would get to Clive sooner or later. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was also no indication that Cid knew Joshua was alive. He just said something along the lines of "oh so it WAS you" when he saw Clive prime into Ifrit.
    Ahh I forgot about that bit from Vivian. Yeah I was also confused by the whole Akashic thing. But I guess Ultima likely took control of Barnabas the same way he did with Olivier, capturing them at a young age and turning them into this hybrid kind of Akashic. Still not exactly sure why Ultima took control of Olivier though since he wasn't a dominant so he couldn't have had that same will Barnabas did to remain conscious. And Anabella was doing a pretty good job of messing up the Emperors head all by herself lol so Oliviers influence wasn't needed much. 

If I had to guess, Cid probably knew of Ultima before meeting Clive but maybe realised what Clive was too late to make him aware of any danger he was in. 🤷‍♂️

Cid did figure out Joshua was alive after their fight with Garuda. 
When Cid witnessed Clive turn into Ifrit, he realises that Clive is the 2nd dominant of fire they'd been looking for. However, afterwards Gav still reports of this "Second dominant of fire" being sighted near Kingsfall (likely when Benedicta Captured Joshua and Jote). 
Clive is too emo realising he is Ifrit and killed his brother, meanwhile Cid sets up a meeting with Gav to talk about info he has. 
As they leave to meet Gav, Clive says there's no point because He is the 2nd Dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise a very obvious point by saying "Think about Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. But basically here he was trying to make Clive realise that if He is the 2nd Dominant of fire then the one they've been tracking all this time can only be Joshua. So yeah I think Cid definitely figured it out, while Clive didn't entertain that thought because in his mind Joshua was for sure dead.
        You know, regarding Olivier.... When Clive and Joshua confront Anabella about why she betrayed her country and her family and she goes on about bloodlines and how Joshua was week and blah blah blah she said that she had a child with the emperor to combine his bloodline with hers so that she can have a child "blessed by both Bahamut and the Phoenix". The demo scene with Anabella and Elwin suggested that it is Elwin's ducal line that has Phoenix dominants and that it skipped him and went to Joshua, hence him saying that he's just warming up the seat. But if it's Elwin's line then why would Anabella say that...

OH THANK YOU! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, it sounded like Cid was about to tell Clive that "the other dominant of fire" has to be Joshua, but still interesting that after being interrupted that one time Cid never brought it up again. I just thought that after Cid saw that Clive was Ifrit he would have thought that the "other dominant of fire" Clive was chasing is just a random Bearer that Clive just thought to be a dominant because he was so obsessed with finding his brother's killer. Like no one saw that other guy prime and it was just rumours that he's a Bearer/ possibly dominant a dominant so Cid could have thought Clive was just chasing shadows. But you're right, Cid is smart and he would have known.
            Haha! No prob, it was such a throwaway line from Cid it could've easily been missed but yeah, Cid was super smart - but to your point I have no idea why Cid never raises this to Clive again, or makes him aware. I'd assume he saw Clive was still on his journey of fighting and accepting his past so maybe he decided to wait for Clive to embrace his past and what he is. Because I think right after Clive "finds the flame" (what a track) It's followed by Cids death. 

So yeah! That part with Annabella confused tf out of me until I realised something very disturbing in the active Time lore which is that Annabella and Elwin are cousins 😬 
So yeah, she's also part of the Phoenix Bloodline. Which is likely why she felt high and mighty hooking up with the empor since now both parents have pure bloodlines for two powerful Eikons. Made if kinda funny tho seeing as Olivier wasn't born a dominant lol.
                Those are great points about the Rosarian bloodline. As far as the Lesage bloodline…Annabelle implied that Dion was the result of Sylvester having a tryst with a common folk person. Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.

-Kupka was a foot soldier in the Dhalmekian Army
-Benedikta was a slave/common folk villager
-Cid was a sailor who happened to end up in the service of Barnabas
-Barnabas himself was a wanderer/cultist
I want to add to this that Barnabas was never "under Ultima's control" per se; Clive says as much when he kills Barnabas (IIRC) and to his peers, that Barnabas submitted to Ultima of his own volition; that was his will, and that he is a hypocrite to want to strip humanity of *their* will when it was his own freedom that allowed him to choose Ultima.

Barnabas is a foil to Clive - both are pre-ordained "chosen ones"  so to speak. Barnabas mirrors the Abrahamic Messiah trope in many ways, knowing his destiny and choosing to fulfill it. I think that plays into why Ultima is so baffled by Clive's resistance. Many before him, including his chosen Odin, submitted themselves, so why wouldn't Clive? To Ultima it probably appears humanity has some intrinsic desire to submit themselves before their creator, so when Clive "becomes Logos" he can't wrap his brain around a human "becoming his own god." It's important Barnabas charted that path first, being a prophet and martyr to submit himself first.

Those are my thoughts on it anyway lol.
    Hmmm, that's a really good point. I figured Barnabas was just taken control of the same way Ultima took control of Olivier. So had Barnabas been torn from his mother during childhood - he basically gave in to Ultima because he had nobody else. Kind of like he was forced to submit to Ultima and accepted whatever vision Ultima gave him. Which is why he feels its okay for others to have their will stripped away and submit because that's what he had done - Which in turn is a result of Ultima's influence. And when he has these PTSD-like flashbacks of his mother, it shows a kind of sad side to Barnabas though it's not explained why. I would think Ultima killed his mother and gave Barnabas some kind of false idea that he had "saved" her from this forsaken land, which is why when Barnabas dies he says "At long last, Salvation (Deliverence from harm/ruin)" "I'm coming home, mother". (Atleast that's sort of how I saw it lol) 

But I guess there's alot of ambiguity and grey area with Barnabas' early life to really say for sure exactly what happened there. 

I do think your thoughts could be 100% plausible though. That's the thing with this game man - it's so amazing but alot of the finer details are left to our interpretation 😮‍💨
Only a previous Dominant of Phoenix is mentioned as having helped Rosaria repel a Northern Territory invasion decades/centuries prior to the start of the game (presumably they had a Shiva of their own at the time). But it's odd that only some of the Eikons/Dominants are known and followed through generations while others aren't (shown to be) considered. The Valisthean religion/'common knowledge' around Eikons - that there are 8 - is at least centuries if not millennia old. So how come people know of Odin (and Leviathan) but not of their Dominants?

And what if the dominant left Valisthea and went to the other continent? Sure there isn't aether there, but they can still use their internal magic to Prime. 

Wouldn't go so far as to say it's a plot hole, but clearly the writers threw a lot at the wall during worldbuilding and conveniently forgot that it's still there when people start wondering about things.
    I would have liked them to have gone into the history of the Eikons a lot more than they did. It's supposed to be this power struggle that's been playing out for thousands and thousands of years yet it very much feels like the versions we encounter in game are their definitive incarnations. As you say there is a reference to an earlier Phoenix fighting an earlier Shiva but *that's it.*

With the scale of the Eikon fights we see in the game you wonder how this world ever survived even a few years with these things marauding around. Yet we don't hear the details of any famous clashes or the names of any famous Dominants of the past.

At one point in the recent past Waloed had the power of Odin, Ramuh, and Garuda on it's side, how on Earth did it not just sweep over Storm? How has the Iron Kingdom survived this long without a permanent Dominant or any allies? And the lack of any historical conflict between the nations of Storm is just kind of haphazardly waved away by the fact they've all been allied for  like 50 years and anything before that is conveniently left unexplained.

The history and worldbuilding feels pretty lazy to me once you go back earlier than the events depicted in the game. Perhaps they should have hired GRRM to write some backstory like From did with Elden Ring.
😂😂😂 Perfect. Man's got it all figured out 🫡
Right-the point I was making is that Cid in a number of games is a defector- having previously worked as an engineer for said empire.
    Sure, I was ribbing that "goes against the empire" is pretty common around these parts.

(I actually couldn't remember what FF7 Cid's position on Shinra (which is a corporate empire) was, but it looks like he was still hoping Shinra would come around and restart the space program?)
        Looks like ff7 had a defector Cid as well. From the ff wiki:  


"Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra."
            Eh, I dunno if calling him a shinra employee makes sense though really, at most a contractor for like a few months/years before being ditched by them for years. Less defector, more like another guy that was screwed over by shinra.
                But the wiki stated shinra former engineer. That's basically meant former employee right? There's no need to dispute.
                    The rocket program had been ended along with Cid's employment for many years before the events of VII, so he had no particular loyalty left with Shinra when he joins you. Which only happens because Shinra came to steal his airplane and wrecked its ability to fly when he refused to give it up.
Balthier is kind of a Cid stand-in in that game! And the leading man, no less.
    The true main character in my eyes. Probably my favorite FF character
    He's literally the Mid stand-in. It's his middle name! Well Mied in the English version, but it's just Mid in Japanese.
Balthier was my dude. Sky pirate with a heart of gold and a hot ass lancer lady at his side.
Ultima was typically 'Ultima weapon'- essentially a beast that was created to be a weapon. It's also the name of 'the ultimate spell' called Ultima. So Ultima has been around in a number of forms in the various games. I don't recall a main villain being called Ultima before 16.
    Tactics did it, but that Ultima was a woman and a demon.
        I'm hopeful for a remake as I missed it the first time around somehow. Maybe once I finish the mainline entries I'll emulate if a remake isn't close at hand.
Ultima, the High Seraph, was present in XII (not the same but the name is related) and was brought back in FFXIV too.
This might be reading into it more than the devs intended, but I like the idea that Ultima is this FF’s incarnation of the Ultima Weapon. However in this game the Ultima Weapon is so powerful and destructive that Clive outright rejects “wielding” it and ultimately rejects magic altogether.
Ultima is usually a monster or a spell or a weapon (or all of those!) but is also the final boss of Final Fantasy Tactics. As a monster it's usually called Ultima Weapon and tends to be either a major boss or an optional mega-boss. As a spell it's usually the ultimate destructive magic and in this role it's a part of the storylines of II, IX, and XIV.
I mean if you think about ff8 and 9 cids do in fact almost fit the same role. In ff8 Cid is creating a school to fight back against the sorceress his wife will become and her boss. In ff9 Cid starts the whole game by hiring to talons to kidnap garnet to fight back against the plans queen brahn is enacting. In both he isn't a defector but he is working against family and the evils they will be committing
Not entirely new though. Several people, even outside the hideout, mention Cid told them the truth and implied it was a plan long in the making.

That's why he invented things like the bellows, or initiated the gardening program. They exist because he knew mankind needed to live without crystals. It wasn't random, Cid had this going long before Clive came into the picture.
Which, by the way, didn't really seem all that problematic for Ultima in the end. So there are limits to Ramuh's gift.
To this point - I will say that for Final Fantasy 16 specifically where so much of the games story is explained in detail - from an entire encyclopedia to endless bits of dialogue with NPC's, to the Active Time lore.. I'm not disagreeing but I do feel like the explanation of Ramuh just knows things..Doesn't quite fit. Not saying it's wrong, just that in this game that feels like a cheap way to explain something. 

When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient. I overlooked this bit because that's a pretty broad statement, especially when places like Rosaria for instance and Elwin had a different mindset and treated Bearers better. Surely there'd have been enough people to realise this and for the well-being of the land do something about it. Just felt that little bit of reasoning was weak. Like if they were speaking specifically about one of the kingdoms then yeah...But the whole of Valesthia? Cmon now ..
    The whole world knows what carbon emissions are doing to our planet but we can't seem to really do anything about it 🤷🏾‍♂️
    >When Clive asks why nobody else figured out the magic and Aether was causing the blight, Cid says the truth was inconvenient.

Would you want to believe the very things that are thought to be your salvation are really just pushing you toward your doom?

Add in Ultima being the mastermind behind the scenes and the actual spoilers behind WHAT Ultima is, well, it's not really far fetched that no one would believe the logic Cid points out about the Blight.
    There was an undercurrent in the whole story that people in positions of power had been destroying/ hording knowledge that would or could be used to help the bearers or improve the lives of the common people in order to maintain their positions... I think it's possible to infer from this that there were others who had figured out what Cid had, but suppressed the knowledge in order to maintain their status quo of power.
 I do agree that it is a bit unbelievable that absolutely nobody without a vested interest would have worked it out, and perhaps they did, but what would be the cost of trying to fight that? You'd basically need it to be someone like Dion to actually act on that knowledge before you got squashed in the other kingdoms. Perhaps if Elwin had lived and Joshua had taken the throne there would have been someone else to speak up against an inconvenient truth.
    I think what Cid meant by this was that lots of people had figured out that the mothercrystals were the cause of the blight, but they refused to give them up because doing so would destroy a lot of people's power and easy living.

I think it's an allegory for some other inconvenient truth, but what could that be hmm?
I actually do agree that it would have been good for the story to back up Cid's contention a bit more. But really, just look at the map and see that the blight tends to be where the mothercrystals are not, and then ask yourself where all the aether in those crystals come from.
I feel like you're hyper-focused on Clive & Jill's reaction. People at the hideaway are aware of Cid's plan, and they all actively practice his theory: they survive in the deadlands with no magic. Evidence is hardly a significant factor in popular beliefs, especially in religious societies. I also consider how Clive & Jill have both been lost and aimless for over a decade before Cid - where an opportunity to arise where they can follow a righteous cause, I feel them most inclined to join with less scepticism than the average person. But, seeing as they've seen evidence for themselves, and then Cid's hypothesis (this order is going to cause confusion as we see) - I feel they're justified nonetheless. I agree with the general sentiment - I wish they elaborated on Cid's knowledge of Ultima - but I didn't feel unsatisfied with it in the end.
    Definitely, it's not a major issue I have with the game.

I just think it's slightly funny how Cid proposes this wild crazy idea, and they just wholly buy into it with no questions asked (after that scene). You can chalk it up to Cid's crazy Charisma stat and the FF theme playing, that ought to be enough to convince anyone!
You can see Leviathan behaving this way in FFXV.  She uses water as a display of power while directly attacking with her physical form.  The only water actually thrown at Noctis is clones of her physical form and we see plenty of clones with Ultima.  It's also questionable if those water attacks were directed at Noctis as their function was to separate him from Prompto for a proper 1v1 duel.

Origin is made of crystal yet the structure is built with rotations suggesting a hurricane formed the design:

Oh that's right I forgot about that exchange!! I am curious if they do do a DLC about Cid and his knowledge of Ultima if there is some sort of overlap of what Jote and Joshua are doing to stop Ultima and what Cid knows of Ultima and Gav scouting the 2nd dominant of fire!! But what ever they do I'm all for just to have more of this world and story to play!!
Barnabas wanted to “unite” the Dominants (really capture them and force them to submit)…probably to make it easy for Clive to take all their powers at once.

He failed Ultima in this regard when Benedikta was killed and Joshua escaped.

Figure, he already had Benedikta (wish we knew if she was privy to exact nature of Barnabas plans). Would have had Joshua had he not escaped. In the Battle of Belenus Tor, he probably would have engaged Bahamut more aggressively with the intent to capture him. Kupka was cucked and manipulated, and would have went along with whatever Benedikta wanted. He himself had Jill captive at once point, and would have forced Clive to absorb her Eikon. 

The “unite the Dominant” conversation he had with Benedikta while in bed became a sore subject when she brought up Cid. He would have been the hardest for Barnabas to get considering he knew of the bigger picture, and he managed to keep himself under the radar for years after defecting from Waloed.
Ahh I forgot about that bit from Vivian. Yeah I was also confused by the whole Akashic thing. But I guess Ultima likely took control of Barnabas the same way he did with Olivier, capturing them at a young age and turning them into this hybrid kind of Akashic. Still not exactly sure why Ultima took control of Olivier though since he wasn't a dominant so he couldn't have had that same will Barnabas did to remain conscious. And Anabella was doing a pretty good job of messing up the Emperors head all by herself lol so Oliviers influence wasn't needed much. 

If I had to guess, Cid probably knew of Ultima before meeting Clive but maybe realised what Clive was too late to make him aware of any danger he was in. 🤷‍♂️

Cid did figure out Joshua was alive after their fight with Garuda. 
When Cid witnessed Clive turn into Ifrit, he realises that Clive is the 2nd dominant of fire they'd been looking for. However, afterwards Gav still reports of this "Second dominant of fire" being sighted near Kingsfall (likely when Benedicta Captured Joshua and Jote). 
Clive is too emo realising he is Ifrit and killed his brother, meanwhile Cid sets up a meeting with Gav to talk about info he has. 
As they leave to meet Gav, Clive says there's no point because He is the 2nd Dominant of fire they've been looking for. Cid then tries to make him realise a very obvious point by saying "Think about Clive, the rumors all point to..." and he gets interrupted by Guards attacking Gav. But basically here he was trying to make Clive realise that if He is the 2nd Dominant of fire then the one they've been tracking all this time can only be Joshua. So yeah I think Cid definitely figured it out, while Clive didn't entertain that thought because in his mind Joshua was for sure dead.
    You know, regarding Olivier.... When Clive and Joshua confront Anabella about why she betrayed her country and her family and she goes on about bloodlines and how Joshua was week and blah blah blah she said that she had a child with the emperor to combine his bloodline with hers so that she can have a child "blessed by both Bahamut and the Phoenix". The demo scene with Anabella and Elwin suggested that it is Elwin's ducal line that has Phoenix dominants and that it skipped him and went to Joshua, hence him saying that he's just warming up the seat. But if it's Elwin's line then why would Anabella say that...

OH THANK YOU! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, it sounded like Cid was about to tell Clive that "the other dominant of fire" has to be Joshua, but still interesting that after being interrupted that one time Cid never brought it up again. I just thought that after Cid saw that Clive was Ifrit he would have thought that the "other dominant of fire" Clive was chasing is just a random Bearer that Clive just thought to be a dominant because he was so obsessed with finding his brother's killer. Like no one saw that other guy prime and it was just rumours that he's a Bearer/ possibly dominant a dominant so Cid could have thought Clive was just chasing shadows. But you're right, Cid is smart and he would have known.
        Haha! No prob, it was such a throwaway line from Cid it could've easily been missed but yeah, Cid was super smart - but to your point I have no idea why Cid never raises this to Clive again, or makes him aware. I'd assume he saw Clive was still on his journey of fighting and accepting his past so maybe he decided to wait for Clive to embrace his past and what he is. Because I think right after Clive "finds the flame" (what a track) It's followed by Cids death. 

So yeah! That part with Annabella confused tf out of me until I realised something very disturbing in the active Time lore which is that Annabella and Elwin are cousins 😬 
So yeah, she's also part of the Phoenix Bloodline. Which is likely why she felt high and mighty hooking up with the empor since now both parents have pure bloodlines for two powerful Eikons. Made if kinda funny tho seeing as Olivier wasn't born a dominant lol.
            Those are great points about the Rosarian bloodline. As far as the Lesage bloodline…Annabelle implied that Dion was the result of Sylvester having a tryst with a common folk person. Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.

-Kupka was a foot soldier in the Dhalmekian Army
-Benedikta was a slave/common folk villager
-Cid was a sailor who happened to end up in the service of Barnabas
-Barnabas himself was a wanderer/cultist
Hmmm, that's a really good point. I figured Barnabas was just taken control of the same way Ultima took control of Olivier. So had Barnabas been torn from his mother during childhood - he basically gave in to Ultima because he had nobody else. Kind of like he was forced to submit to Ultima and accepted whatever vision Ultima gave him. Which is why he feels its okay for others to have their will stripped away and submit because that's what he had done - Which in turn is a result of Ultima's influence. And when he has these PTSD-like flashbacks of his mother, it shows a kind of sad side to Barnabas though it's not explained why. I would think Ultima killed his mother and gave Barnabas some kind of false idea that he had "saved" her from this forsaken land, which is why when Barnabas dies he says "At long last, Salvation (Deliverence from harm/ruin)" "I'm coming home, mother". (Atleast that's sort of how I saw it lol) 

But I guess there's alot of ambiguity and grey area with Barnabas' early life to really say for sure exactly what happened there. 

I do think your thoughts could be 100% plausible though. That's the thing with this game man - it's so amazing but alot of the finer details are left to our interpretation 😮‍💨
I would have liked them to have gone into the history of the Eikons a lot more than they did. It's supposed to be this power struggle that's been playing out for thousands and thousands of years yet it very much feels like the versions we encounter in game are their definitive incarnations. As you say there is a reference to an earlier Phoenix fighting an earlier Shiva but *that's it.*

With the scale of the Eikon fights we see in the game you wonder how this world ever survived even a few years with these things marauding around. Yet we don't hear the details of any famous clashes or the names of any famous Dominants of the past.

At one point in the recent past Waloed had the power of Odin, Ramuh, and Garuda on it's side, how on Earth did it not just sweep over Storm? How has the Iron Kingdom survived this long without a permanent Dominant or any allies? And the lack of any historical conflict between the nations of Storm is just kind of haphazardly waved away by the fact they've all been allied for  like 50 years and anything before that is conveniently left unexplained.

The history and worldbuilding feels pretty lazy to me once you go back earlier than the events depicted in the game. Perhaps they should have hired GRRM to write some backstory like From did with Elden Ring.

Somewhere else during the story it’s also implied that Sylvester didn’t come into power as Emperor until Dion primed as Bahamut. 

It could be possible that Sylvester ruled on a council with the other dukes, and it was only when Dion became Bahamut he took power as emperor. Sylvester’s own bloodline may not have carried Bahamut after all. It would be fitting and ironic if Dion became Bahamut as a result of his low status birth mother.

Aside from the Rosarian/Phoenix bloodline and Jill’s bloodline as a princess in the Northern Territories , none of the others are royal.
