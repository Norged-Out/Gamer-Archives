[[Barnabas Was Unfortunately Wasted Potential.]]


For me personally, the story started to slip after Ultima casts Primogenesis, however it started to really go downhill with the Barnabas/Waloed act of the story. The ending did manage to salvage my problems with the third act, however, one of the biggest flaws of the story is Barnabas Tharmr. 

This dude had everything going for him, an intimidating design/presence, enigmatic puppeteer in the background, a potential arch nemesis for Clive that can push him to his limits, being a legendary warrior who ascended to King because of his combat prowess, and all that gets reduced to a fanatical weirdo psychopath who spews a bunch of philosophical nonsense. 

It appeared that he was going to be Clive’s biggest adversary, however, he just didn’t do anything except beat Clive two times. Ultima wanted him to sever Clive’s bonds to break his will which hints he might kill an important character but doesn’t do it because he needs Clive to get fully powered up for Ultima. Kind of felt like he was written into a corner and because of that was made not that interesting. 

I thought the story would’ve been much better if Barnabas was the real villain who held a deep grudge for humanity. They could’ve explored more about his mother and why he is the way he is since it’s implied that he’s deeply traumatized by what happened with his mother. They could’ve given him Ultima’s endgame plan to use Clive as a vessel to become a God and remake the world in his image because he believes humanity is a cruel species that needs to be punished after the hanging of his mother. 

Barnabas was incredibly disappointing and I felt that’s because of Ultima.

>Ultima wanted him to sever Clive’s bonds to break his will which hints he might kill an important character but doesn’t do it because he needs Clive to get fully powered up for Ultima.

It's a decent point, so the question then becomes, who would he kill off? Can't kill off Joshua, because he's too important for the finale. Can't kill off Jill because she's the main motivation for Clive and is important for the ending's symbolism and hinting. I guess Dion is a potential candidate, but he is closer to Joshua than he is Clive, so that would make no sense. I guess the best candidate for the sake of drama and for the sake of really pissing Clive off, without the need for major rewrites, would have been Gav or Byron. That said, I'm glad they both survived. Two of my fave characters.
    You forgot Torgal, but that Good Boy has the biggest plot armor. XD
        Yeah prior to the game coming out I was sure Torgal would be killed off. I was pleasantly surprised he wasn’t.
            I was furious when Benedikta 'killed' him screaming "F\*\*\*ing Dog!".  
It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.
                I knew instantly there was no way torgal was dead
                
>It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.

There's a few good moments like this.  The first combat after you unlock the limit break is with the assholes who massacred Eastpool, so I popped it immediately just on principle
            I knew Torgal was safe when he ewas the only one given Gameplay mechanics. I honestly thought Jill would die, and that would lead Clive to becoming heroically suicidal during the final act (IE he's willing to do anything to stop Ultima/Baranabas and the others need to reign him back in)

The story sorta tries to do this anyways, but it comes off as a lil hokey cuz Clive has always been like this... Everyone being like "why you trying to do everything alone?" like bruh Clive has been doing that for five years, you know how he is already, stfu.
        Plot armor, goodest boy has dog armor. If they killed Torgal we would riot as SE head quarters until its patched.
            Too true. The minute torgal was introduced was the moment i whispered under my breath, "if sqex kills off my fluffy puppy, i riot" 

Then i went to cuddle my own dog because the thought made me sad.
                The end when he is howling broke me 😭
                And then you cuddled him some more for the trophy?
                    Trophy wasnt needed. Would have pet doggo anyways lol
        Not just plot armor, game mechanic armor. As soon as I saw you control him in combat with his own menu, I knew he was likely safe.
        Hey, if Torgal died, not only Ultima would be killed, but Square Enix themselves would be in grave peril.
        If they killed torgal the "Clive Wick" memes would be overwhelming and imo ruin the game.
    He was going after Mid, because Cid is Clive’s biggest influence. That’s the whole point of the attack on Kanver
        Which didn’t really work well because from the player’s perspective, we barely know Mid.
            We barely know mid but there was a time skip. Clive probs knows mid pretty well since he is using Cid's name
                We’re told she’s important to Clive, but we don’t feel it, since we didn’t see that bond develop. And all our interactions are just running errands for her lol. Maybe it would have worked better if she had appeared before the skip.
                    Personally i think the skip was pointless noone aged noone got new outfits and clive getting his brand removed should have been an important story telling piece aswell as meeting mid. 

.. could have had a arch where we was fleeing from kupka and found the hideaway and watched it grow as we completed side quests.
                        Its Also just weird how in 5 years we got NOTHING done but then break all remaining crystals in like a few months at most?
                            Cuz rebuilding a place for runaway bearers takes a long ass time and took priority. They skipped us ahead to a point in time where the hideaway was rebuilt enough for us to be able to focus on the mothercrystals again.

EDIT: Not to mention we didn't go after the second crystal until it made sense from a military perspective (Sanbreque and Dhalmekia were fighting over the Crystalline Dominion so went after the crystal away from all the action) and the third crystal we never intended on going after when we did. Our objective was Kupka and only Kupka. It just so happened that we had to take out that mothercrystal to take out Kupka.
                            Haha that too !
                        Not a NEW outfit, but Clive’s is visibly more weathered after the skip. Not a big change but I found it to be a nice touch when I noticed it.
                            My eye sight didnt see that haha
                                His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
                                    He’s also slightly more muscular too.
                        I wouldn't say it was pointless, but it didn't need to be five years. Might have actually been more interesting if it was just a couple years, and Clive was still a little uncertain in his role as Cid.
                    I think one single heartfelt scene with Mid would have helped too. Like, let her join in visiting Cids grade, or give her a scene with Clive telling him why she can't go there. Just one genuine moment of comradship between them would have gone a long way.
                        It was Hidden behind sidequests. However i think a scene with mid and Clive at Cid's grave would have been good
                        It was so weird how they talked about visiting the grave and then she just bailed. It could definitely have helped.
                    DLC
                    This was exactly how I felt about Vivian, just some random new person that I’m supposed to care about but who also isn’t as charismatic or enjoyable as Mid was
                        Vivian is just an exposition dump with a pretty face, barely a character. For better or worse, they never even tried to make her important to the story so it's whatever.
                            Nope not a single bit
                Idk how I feel about using cids name. Otto says he suggested it but doesn't feel natural at all. Most side characters just don't feel connected and that 5 year time skip really didn't help
                    It doesn't. Kupka would have still been pissed if they said it was clive who killed him. The objective would have still been cids. Clive the outlaw would have worked.
            The player doesn't really know Mid, but doesn't she call him God Father at some point?  Not sure how Clive would have been assigned that role with Cid not appearing to have done it and with Cid being dead, but that would also make Mid incredibly important to Clive and vice versa.  

Most likely it is implied that Mid was around the hideout the whole time considering she built lots of the gadgets you see around it and Clive must've seen her a lot at the original hideout before they destroyed the 1st mother crystal.  There's also the 5 year gap where Clive could very well have acted much more as a father figure for her.  

Yes we as the player don't know her very well so it doesn't work to randomly have Barnabas kill her or something to get at Clive, but if that were to happen, we'd obviously have gotten more character development for her beforehand so that it'd be more impactful when she gets killed.
                There is one side quest in the original hideout where you give Cid a letter from Mid and it is mentioned there that she is away at school, so I don't think Clive meets her until after the fall of the old hideout.
        Now that I think about it, the boat part is kinda odd, right? I think he was fighting Joshua to go after her, but I’m not really sure why he didn’t do anything. Maybe fighting Clive was the priority?
            It actually came down to Barnabas realizing Ultima was wrong in his order. He makes note that the more they are threatened, the tighter Clive holds on to them.
                Yea killing Joshua or Jill won't break his will but bring him into path of revenge
    Except he did try to kill off Jill by forcing Clive to watch her drown. But because he beat her so easily in her Eikon form, he underestimated her resourcefulness to survive. His sheer arrogance, built up over 4 decades of survival on the battlefield and in internal challenges to his rule, is part of his character. People think he was dumb and underutilized, but his whole point is that the empowerment that Ultima offered did not empower him at all. It gave him steroids and immunity to the curse; but his enthrallment impaired his thinking as a result - the one thing that made him such a deadly and unpredictable scourge as he darted in and out of conflicts across all of Storm.

EDIT: He was the 'living' symbol of a man consumed by religious dogma. He played the part of the cultist right down to the t, displaying the writers' personal familiarity with how cultism can change a person to the core. Thats what makes him a great character - and fated to be misunderstood by people who don't have experience on this topic.

That's a pretty good analysis, though I'd also add that Barnabas comes off as a man that is essentially ***broken*** to his core. In the midst of his breakdown, besides being disturbing (cringe depending on who you ask), he gives off this sense of just being so done with the world. Part of it is misanthropy but it also seems to be out of boredom as he states he hasn't had a challenge in decades. Having likely known nothing but fighting his whole life, and likely having seen many horrible things from it, he probably felt like he had nothing to look forward or or enjoy in life. It mirrors how real life cultist might have became who they are via influencing after feeling depressed or detached from the world.
    I think not killing anyone close to Clive was smart. Being defeated and beaten up while looking your friends in the face was purposeful. He was trying to break his will. Not motivate him to greater heights. Wear them down. Regardless of what any of them do it's futile.
        "Break his will" Could not have chosen a better statement.
    Should have gone full GoT and killed off Clive.


Oh wait.
    Tbh i feel joshua relationship was the biggest motivator in the game for Clive. But jill is legit on Joshua heels my assumption.
    His dog
        Torgal has that padded armour of being a core combat mechanic for combos. They would never bump off the dog.
            I'm just picturing Joshua taking Torgal's place if he was killed off, and Clive still using the same dialogue to command him.
                Sic em, Joshua
                My wounds boy
                    Hey works for Kratos
    Well, tbf, they did try to kill all of Storm with the Akashiks and stuff. We just happened to save every single one of our mates. But yeah, it was clumsily executed, they had the potential to add so much more drama, it's kind of a shame.
        >!Not quite all of them. Poor Theo... Also, the Bearers of Lostwing were a tragic loss, although they weighed more heavily on Quinten.!<
            Oh yeah, I forgot our sweet boy Theo, how could I !?

Well yes and not for Quintin, if he had not pushed his vengeance to the end they most likely would've all died during the flood.

But anyway, all these events are important moments where Ultima and Barnabas's did try to sever Clive's connections, but it's entirely absent from your original com.
                Yeah, I was just trying to come up with who might be the most impactful for Clive to lose without needing a major rewrite.
    How bout that Mid af side character
    Just kill jill, would have made her an actual good character ngl.
        Jill is one of the best characters in the game, and arguably the series.
            No.
    I mean mgave. He could have killed gav or mid. I'm glad he didn't tho. I say the real problem for his character is the scene with Ultima in bed. I get that he follows whatever Ultima says but that scene really paints him as submissive rather than a warrior following his god.
        I found that scene weird, but oddly, it worked for me. It shows that Barnabas is sick in the head, his mind twisted and disturbed. This is shown even further by the fact he thinks he is the hero of the story. He's been Akashic this whole time, and whilst he has been able to preserve his age, his looks, and even some of his rationality and emotions such as lust (all likely through the influence of Ultima), it's slowly chipped away at his sanity. Even so, the dude still has more mommy issues than a one-winged angel. 

As for him being submissive, the whole thing with the religion/cult following Ultima is that they believe surrendering their will to Ultima's is ultimate salvation. Ironically, despite doing Ultima's bidding, and as Clive points out to him, Barnabas's will was never truly forfeit, as it was Barnabas's own will that drove him to pursue Clive and the others, and to see his master's vessel be perfected.

That all said, without the tomes and ATL, it isn't portrayed in the best manner, and tha pacing is a bit off. I couldn't use the tomes or ATL on my first run either, thanks to some overlooked spoilers. I learned a lot of this stuff on my NG+ run.
    I think, instead of Ultima killing Cid it would have been better for Barnabas killing Cid. That way Clive would have met Barnabas earlier. And we would have a fight with Clive in rage vs Barnabas. And barnabas just owns Clive. This way we would have our main advasery instead of Ultima. They could still put Ultima as the last bossfight but then maybe Barnabass would become ultima or Ultima could still come. But this way Barnabass would really be like the Ardyn or Sephiroth
        Have Ultima pulling the strings behind the scenes Zeromus style.
            Yes something like that. Ultima could still be the last boss but at least Barnabass would have been much more interesting.
    I mean, on one hand you're right. On the other, all of Clive's friends were out there by the writers. They could have written in a character who was supposed to die at this point if they wanted to
All of Waloed in general felt underdeveloped. It’s like a whole other continent equal the size of Storm, it would’ve been nice to see several different nations and maybe more than just one mother crystal. Instead you get there and everyone is akashic and the fights getting to Barnabas felt like filler.
    Well, Ash originally hosted 2 crystals. One was deep in the southern dead lands.
    Several nations ? I believe there was but odin/barny took ash many years ago. 

I liked the map for ash though, But that whole defending the towns & kanver ship building and ash/akashic arc felt a bit of a slog, obviously except the horny scene that was fine  lol. 

I feel like sailing to ash quietly and blending in with the locals to break into the castle then confronting odin and seeing everyone turn akashic and managing to rescue more than edda would have been good.
He literally cannot kill Jill, because Clive has yet to take Shiva from her. They attacked Kanver to get to Mid, but they failed to do that. Barnabas destroyed an entire city for 1 girl. Barnabas also orchestrated the confrontation with Clive and Hugo Kupka by sending Kupka Benidikta's head in a box.

Ultimately Barnabas, who believed that serving Ultim was his only reason for existence, fell pretty to his own emotions, which he described as wicked. He found joy in battle, and would not relinquish the feeling it gave him.
    Wait, when did they say Barnabas did the head in a box? I just have missed that dialog 🤔
        It's not outright stated but heavily implied.
We all know cid wouldn't do that, he loved benedikta.
The only ones cruel enough to do that would be Baranabas and Sleipnir.
            Yeah, I thought it would be weird if Cid or Clive did it but since they never said I wasn’t entirely sure. But Sleipnir’s statement after the Titan fight made me think it was maybe one of them.
            Anabella definitely was capable of doing that
                She was, but the fact that Sleipnir specifically mentioned that Kupka died for a woman's head in a box implies he was aware of it.

Granted Kupka could have told him after the fact, but I imagine they had Sleipnir mention it for a reason story telling wise.
                    Oh I wasn’t saying she did it I was just saying she was also cruel enough to do so. She also mentioned that Kupka was so easy to manipulate when her and Olivier met with him. She said something along the lines of “all over some common born wh*re”
    Honestly I thought someone or maybe Cid just incinerated her off screen to send her ashes to Hugo. Then again that wouldn't make much sense.
I agree, Barnabas should have been the main focus Villain of the game while Ultima taking the backseat. He also should have appeared way sooner to Clive and toyed with him  because by the time he properly appears, its already very late to the story and as a result his nemesis relationship with Clive isn’t developed that well at all.
I don't feel as disappointed as you but it didn't sit right with me how little was at stake after rescuing Jill. Since he only wanted Clive to beat him it was only a matter of getting there and doing it. What I mean is that one could foresee the story up to a certain point forward (and the Ultima's "true plan" reveal was also a tad lackluster), so that portion of the game's story was really still. Enjoyed the fight a lot tho, even if the game is easy. His mother definitely needed some screentime to add weight to his motivations (as he is somewhat a Clive which came in contact with the Circle of Malius/Savior's Myth instead of Cid for answers).
    That’s my problem with Barny, he is pretty much pigeonholed into not killing Jill and Joshua because he still needs Clive to be at full power for Mr. Mewthos I mean Ultima. Barny and Waloed should’ve been implemented better for the story. 

I will say this, his boss fight kinda redeemed him a little because it was my favorite human boss fight by far as it was a one on one duel and he was giggling with excitement like a madman. That’s the stuff I wanted to see, a bloodthirsty warrior who lives for the fight. However, it was too little too late.
        To sum up barnabas “what is a king to a God”
            And Clive is “what is a God to a nonbeliever”?
        That boss fight desperately needed an all-out eikon fight at the end though. After the phenomenal spectactle which Bahamut delivered (and Titan before him) it was kind of a let down.
He was underutilized story wise and the fight itself made no sense tbh.
He absolutely massacred clive (those fights werent like anywhere near close lol) and then clive gets shiva and suddenly just 1v1s him lol

Definitely the most wasted character. I was kind of hoping for a "i follow ultima up until i betray him for my own plan"-type of thing but in the end nothing came out of it.
            I don't think it necessarily needed an eikon fight. The fight idea and design is overall pretty cool imo it just felt a bit short, especially the last bit. Could have just used a little bit more distinction between phases and could have done the last phase/spectacle at higher than like 10% hp so you actually have to fight his "final form" for a bit.
                It could've been interesting to see the two characters fight to the point of pure exhaustion, then have the final phase be the two of them going at each other without any powers.
            I sorta felt like Odin casting and keeping that barrier up was weakening him a bit, it's shown throughout the game how much of a toll those powers can take on someone after a while. It's also noted that Barnabas was king for an unnaturally long time. Along with the mention that Clive was special for his eikon powers not having negative effects on him. Either way, I did feel the whole ultimate plan reveal was missing something but I enjoyed it all nonetheless.
            That did seem odd to me. The spectacle of the game caps out between Titan and Bahamut and goes downward from there. I like the ending but did wish it had something as big as those fights.
                To be fair, the final fight was pretty damn cool too, it just feels a bit less epic than it actually is because we've done the Ifrit Risen thing already at that point. It would've needed another gimmick I think. Like, say, combining the powers of all the eikons into a final "true" form.
                    I thought Ultima was going to have Leviathan so I was hoping for another giant against something giant and cool. I was disappointed in the design but the story part was fine.
                        Yeah.
But when you think about it, there were originally likely 16 mothercrystals (since every crytsal had an instance of Ultima at its heart, and there are 16 instances of Ultima). 8 of them were on the twins, and 8 eikons were originally known there. Since the eikons definitely have some sort of tie to the mothercrystals (although we don't know what that is, sadly), it stands to reason there were originally two eikons of every element (it's also never really explained why there are both Phoenix and Ifrit, beyond the vague allusion to their combined form being the original physical form of Ultima. But which Ultima? The crumbling bodies in the center chamber of Origin all seem to look different in some way).

While that sounds incredibly cool in concept, imagine having to implement 16 playstyles that feel distinct from one another.
                Tbh the last fight was definitely up there but Bahamut was just like watching a DBZ "best of" MAD reel, it was just insanity.
                I think they wanted to make it more of a duel style fight. Think Dante vs Vergil in DMC or Bayonetta vs Jeanne in Bayonetta.
        Him turning into a glowing, cackling fidget spinner version of Zenos was definitely hilarious, I'll say that.
    To be honest, I just wished we had more of his "unhinged" persona. When he started to giggle with glee at the prospect of having a worthy opponent, I felt like we got a glimpse of the Warrior King before he... you know.

Like having this guy that gave up his emotions regain some from fighting Clive, just having fun clashing his power vs someone he deemed worthy, sounds like a really cool story beat. With how the entire message of the story goes and all. Like how humans can't really live jusy being empty husk that follow the words of a "God". Cool that we saw that in the heroes side, would had been cooler to see it on the villains side too.
    Barnabas should have taken Jill to Waloed (while still having the scene where he cuts the ocean). Granted that we don't get the Jill scene on beach at that moment.

Then Clive has more reason to trek to Waloed. 

They would actually find Jill on the way in a fort and that is when the Jill scene can happen as she wants Clive to be powerful enough to beat Barnabas at that point. 

Barnabas just giving her up in the ocean didn't sit right with me, after all he went through to get her.

But if he forced Jill to give her power (and Clive to take it) out of desperation, then his plan will work. 

Remember the scene where Barnabas creates a barrier. Now imagine the only way to escape that barrier is for Clive to get Jill's powers and that forces their hand (assuming at that point Jill is too weak to fight since she was captive). 

Now Barnabas fight could have had before he reaches the last crystal (in those plains). That would have been large enough place for a Eikon battle too.
        Yes sir.
Exploring the entire Kingdom of Waloed gives me the impression that lot of content was cut there. By the time we get to the place, the most interesting part of it has already gone away - the entire systematic genocide of the population by its own ruler. Instead we just get the country of Waloed, population 7 (Barnabas, Edda and the villagers behind the door). 

The sidequest where Clive found the citizens willingly becoming Akashic and the even worse brutalisation of bearers was actually very scary and intriguing. I wish they put that into the story quest and explore more about it - for example, that Barnabas becoming a god-like existence to his people to the point where they would gladly embrace the Aether because Barnabas told them that is a great state to be in.
It's not the case of wasted potential. The writers created him to be a mere puppet for the big bad. But the badass design, the badass cutscenes, the badass personality, made him more than what he was created for. An example of the execution being better than the idea.
    I know it seems like it (Barnabas just being Ultima's puppet) but Barnabas' character is to show some still choose to follow and believe in Ultima without being actual puppets, Olivier was a true puppet, Barnabas was just faithful to Ultima and believed in him, choosing to serve him
        Actually, they say Barnabas had been Akashic for years. He'd given up his will long before the start of the game, and maybe managed to capture a grasp of it during his last fight, but he was a puppet from the start.
            We should have experienced his will break, in order to understand his motivations and perspective — like literally every other main boss villian. Instead we get manic monologues that make sense, but nobody cares about. Just another “crazy”. Even though literally all other villians also went crazy, but it hits way harder because we deeply understand their descent into madness

Not experiencing the collapse of the population was also weak. Could we not have expanded on that one survivor, into like one last stronghold town that resisted, with a couple main line quests that explores the events that took place rallying the orcs and turning everything akashic? Here’s a thought - made mid’s shit questline a side quest and replace it with this. Or even have the Enterprise run into a fleet of ships fleeing Waloed on the way there, initially thinking theyre enemies (ex Waloean pirates?) but then get more context that way. Have us actually able to walk around the Enterprise joined with another ship as a quest hub. The sidequests would take you into exploring Waloed other than just beelining through the unnecessarily large maps with crappy item pickups.

Dont even get me started on Masamune… the one freaking treasure chest with a weapon, and a cool one at that — has way worse stats that what you probably have equipped. Like why?


Could have also cut out the entire Wade resistance army side arc and replaced it with this tbh. Completely unnecessary. Martha runs the show anyway and can do that on her own, we all know that. 

Then have that stronghold taken over or invaded by orcs, and end it with that dying soldier? 

Like cmon. They didnt even try to have us resonate with the entirety of Ash. Probably my biggest gripe with the game tbh. 

Hope we get more polish after DLC like XV.
                I didn't find masamune until after I had crafted the gotterdammerung. I was so excited and then immediately disappointed.
            No he is not Akashic, Clive compares him to being the same as being Akashic, the difference being Barnabas chose giving up his will and not forced. His people and obviously his mother are the ones that stayed believing in Ultima out of choice and so he kept following their belief
    Barney is so weird, I spent most of the game really wanting to know him but when he finally got screen time and I saw his uh, mom thing, my reaction was just “yeah now I wish you stayed mysterious”

Lowkey I kinda liked Sleipnir more, I liked his smug manipulations with Hugo
        Sleipnir was weird too cuz when I saw him knock out Hugo and lift his big ol body over his shoulder with zero effort I thought oh shit who the hell is this? Is he a dominant? But which one? Maybe a secret villain or something. But he just ends up being some kinda clone thing
    He succeeded. He ensured Mythos was created. He believed in the teachings of circle of malius.
        But story wise Clive missed still the eight element.
            Well it was known as The Lost for a reason. But I'm like where is the 8th? I kinda don't want them to add dlc now that I finished the story, but at the same time I would love a sequel of the world.
                Yeah but eventually the eight Mothercrystal also belongs to one Ultima, they can easily implement two dlcs that have to happen before origin.

One would be the cut content (probably leviathan or the northern territories. one of them was cut from the main game probably as it wouldn’t fit on one disc altogether
                    > wouldn't fit on one disc

You people really need to stop talking about technical stuff when you don't understand how it works.
                        Then may you explain it further? I just referred to one comment from an interview.

From my understanding after compression the size extended the maximum which could be loaded on one disc, so at least for installing reasons they would have to add a second one. 

I asked another commenter about this, because even though I cannot imagine it (especially knowing the prices for a disc) to be the main reason that they cut content because of not fitting everything in one disc, it was the purpose which was mentioned.
                            PS5 discs can hold up to 100GB, but install themselves onto your drive anyways. They are not playing from the disc itself, they are glorified DRM installers. This has been true since PS3 ages, Blu Ray is a slow reading format  you think you'd get barely no loading times otherwise?

Since it's just an installers, this gives devs the potential to compress their data, should they want to. It will make unpacking and install slightly longer, but it's a one time thing. To begin with, devs are being extremely lazy with compression and file sizes and don't optimize their games at all these days, cause they know players can just buy more space.

Has CBU3 really tried FFXVI's size could be cut by half and compressed further, and then decompressed upon install. FF7R is 94GB, and the Intergrade DLC ON IT'S OWN is 81GB. Those are ridiculous sizes relative to the actual content.

SQUEENIX has many ways to tackle this issue, one being learning how to fucking compress, but nah let's just use more discs.
                                Ok but that’s what I meant, after compression it was too big, so they cut content instead of compressing further.

FfVIIR Intergrade has 94.88GB, the Remake 90,81 so Intergrade itself has 4,08GB
            I believe the last crystal sunk into the ocean. However, it is quite possible that it is still active, but then how would primogenesis be cast by Ultima? That's why I love the ending.
                I think Ultima had no other choice than taking Clive as a 7/8 the vessel because of the loss. For me it is the explanation why Clive was not able to wirdhstand ultimata powers after all, he even commented it after absorbing Ultima that his body is too weak
        Not that mythos was created but to not attack other nations, collude with others to ensure Clive destroyed all of the crystals.
Ya they totally shit the bed with that whole arc. Which seems strange to me. Everything felt rushed with Waloed. Even the design of the tower you have to climb to get to Barnabas; just the same 3-4 rooms repeating. And we had the phoenix gate fallen level which had much better design somehow.

Waloed too just being a few big empty locations that have the exact same design is also strange.

My personal thoughts was something happened mid production that forced them to either pivot the arc or wrap it up. It’s clear the final act was planned well, along with the first half of the game which leads me to believe that was the last one. 

A shame because they could have done so much with it like you said. 

I’m also not that happy about Primogenesis washing out the entire world map for the remainder of the game either.
    Waloed is just too late.

If feels like it's been forgotten and Dev were like "ono we have one last continent to show". Every other country show their cities or villages, Waloed has... 1 and it's nearly empty.

It's a big area you cross one and don't bother with it except the side quests.
    This might be a hot take but I personally feel XVI’s story could’ve been split into two parts. The game has so many characters and 4 kingdoms at conflict with each other and an existential threat that they are ignorant of due to all the political squabbling like Game of Thrones that it kinda crumbles under its own weight. 

I hate the Primogenesis shit so much in terms of art direction. I get it, it’s supposed to be the World of Ruin for XVI, however it gets rid of the nice aesthetics of all the different biomes and makes everything all pink and gloomy. I hope a patch comes out to where it goes away after you beat the game.
        I was telling my friend this should have been FF XVI and FF XVI-2. First one should end with CID death and Joshua saving Clive. Expand on Jill country, let us spend more time in Clive early years or as a wyvern. All of this Just went to fast. The 2nd game could make waloed so much better.
            If It were to end with cids death they shouldve at least let us brea 1 or 2 more crystals before the whole última things show Up tbh

Otherwise It wouldve been waay too short imo
        I'm hoping that'll be the DLC, world post ruins
        It's funny the world of ruin is when I started playing in HDR (Got a new monitor) and boy did I think my screen was borked with how pink everything was. Took me longer than I care to admit to realize it wasn't.
        I don't know about splitting two games I personally don't like that shtick, but definitely XVI's later part was markedly worse, the whole Zombie apocalypse vibe was a cool gimmick for a few hours... And then it wasn't when the Zombi--uhh Akashics were literally all that was left to do and deal with in this Pink medieval post apocalypse until the very end of the game which was Atleast a dozen hours away.


It just kinda uglified the game for the past 30-40% of it when that should realistically been the last 15%, preferably post Waloed and felling the final Crystal, it would've made much more sense thematically and also in line with the story itself, as Ultima literally wanted Clive and Co to fell all the crystals and release his different incarnations, the advent of Origin should've brought on Primogenesis by its own. It didn't need to happen with Bahamut. Thematically too the darkness released by slaying Odin (which was also the most lackluster of them all and should've been a far more engrossing - - Dark Souls Four Kings - ike feeling boss battle imho - - could've been a good excuse for Primogenesis being cast.

Idk, I feel like XVI is a very good and well written game for the most of it but it has clear shortcomings near the end. I'm also kinda peeved we didn't get to explore even ONE City and spend 95% of the game in between ruins, greenlands, sands and hamlets. Doesn't need to give us the entire damn City but if XII and XIV managed it I'm sure CBU3 could've found a way.
    It did make for quite an atmospheric part, though. Super melancholic
        Yeah, for a time it’s great. But it hurts post-game experience.
    Agreed. It's funny that I saw mainstream discussions mocking the game for being too Game of Thrones prior to release, but it actually gets weaker when it goes back into Final Fantasy mode dealing with powerful beings trying to destroy the world. 

I thought the motivation was highest when it was Clive vs Hugo. Even thought the world was ending with Ultima, Hugo felt more important since it was so personal. Where "zomg we need to save the world" just felt more generic and done before.
NGL, I think the antagonists were probably the weakest part of the story including Barnabas. Would’ve been cool if Barnabas ended up betraying Ultima in the end and he ends up being the final boss. Through his interactions with Clive, he actually realizes that humanity would be better off with a strong-willed ruler like him.
    I thought I read a spoiler somewhere that >!Annabelle fuses with Ultima for POWEEEEERrRrRrR!<. I was lowkey kind of disappointed that wasn't the case.
I understand where you’re coming from, and I do kinda agree, he was a bit underwhelming considering his legendary reputation, but that mainly comes from the actual fight, barnabas/Odin fight wasn’t as cinematic as the last few ones, mechanically it was pretty good tho.
Story wise tho, I think it’s acceptable, his mother’s death was mentioned in active time lore, she was a believer of the circle of malius, so considering how religion works, barnabas obviously grew up a believer as well. The way I see it, as Clive mentioned, is that he was someone who really wanted to save humanity, a king who cared about the people who was corrupted by ultima. So truthfully the way he is currently, is just an example of how ultima’s corruption can even affect the greatest of men, which makes Clive’s victory in the end that much greater. So I wouldn’t say he’s wasted potential yet, cuz I do think they can explore more into his character in a future dlc, especially his conquest of ash days, show how he was before ultima.
I mean I totally understand how you feel, but I think what you want from Barnabas is just a completely different character than what Maehiro wrote. 

Barnabas IS intimidating, mysterious, dark, and all powerful, a king with total control over his people and whose country treats its lower class in unthinkable ways. But the ironic point of Barnabas is despite being the “alpha” dominant, he’s actually the most submissive and spineless of them all. 

Thematically the realization that he’s a tamed, wounded animal is, I would argue, pretty central to the game’s message. He’s pathetic. Still super cool and powerful, but existentially he’s a loser, which Clive makes painfully aware to him before he kills him.

I agree that Ultima is kind of weak as a villain. I get the Demiurge angle and you could argue he’s like a better executed version of Barthandalus but he’s still dull. Maybe Barney would’ve been better, who knows, but that wasn’t his point in the story. 

IMO FFXVI’s weakest story element is probably its antagonists; they’re largely just arc villains.
    >Barnabas IS intimidating, mysterious, dark, and all powerful, a king with total control over his people and whose country treats its lower class in unthinkable ways. But the ironic point of Barnabas is despite being the “alpha” dominant, he’s actually the most submissive and spineless of them all. 

Perfectly said. Not sure if it's an unpopular opinion but I actually liked that they made Barnabas differ from what our expectations were. Beforehand we all thought he would be this take shit from nobody kind of guy who is completely in control, which is true in his outer persona, but on the inside he's actually a completely submissive lunatic like you said. It adds a whole different layer to his character. I think one of the great things this game does is take your perceptions of who you think these dominants are and show you that they're actually much more than that (Hugo being a love drunk simp, benedicktas conflict over what she knows is right and wrong, etc). That said I do agree to an extent that Barnabas was somewhat underutilized/could have been expanded on more
    Absolute agree. For lack of a better way of putting it, Barnabas being a let down I think is intentional and perfect because as you said, the whole time he’s kinda just a mindless puppet for Ultima of sorts.
Tbh Barnabas being a zealot in a country like Waloed makes sense. Could they have done to communicate that? Absolutely, but for a game set in a medieval setting, besides himself the only other faction to even really touch on their faith in some meaningful way was the Iron Kingdom.  


As for his relationship with Clive, he unfortunately is in the same place Ultima was: not grasping how human connection has evolved. Realistically, Barnabas was a hollow man with a faith that was the only thing that kept him going. Humanity in that land saw becoming Akashic as salvation.   


And the plan to cut Clive's bonds was already a hard sell, when that's basically all that motivates him. To not just forge bonds, but to strengthen and protect them. Is it cliche? Yes. But this is a guy whose life is suffering. His mother viewed him as a failure, he watched his brother die multiple times. lost and fought other people he wanted to protect, etc. And he was always willing to throw hands over it.  


Barnabas is literally a guy who embodies being enslaved to Ultima as are his people and land. He's powerful, but the most that he and Clive were ever going to trade in the form of 'ideals' is akin to Clive trying to explain his actions against Benie to Kupka. I'm more concerned Ultima's plan really hitched on a vessel that wouldn't connect with humans is something though.
    His fight kinda was not remarkable , not sure why this waned .
Yeah, the whole time on the continent of Ash had me like, "Are we seriously doing the dead empire from FFXV again?!"
highly agreed. i think the point u make about barnabas overtaking ultima to be the true villain would've been perfect???? i really just sat back and imagined and holy shit + plus the thing with his mother and the lost mothercrystal and the other continent they came from, he could've been the perfect victim of religious trauma that snaps when ultima tells him to sacrifice himself. imagine clive preparing to fight ultima only to find out barnabas has killed his god instead???? 

you shouldve been in that writer's room OP.
It’s unfortunate that I agree with this, he was the Dominant I was by far the most excited to learn about in game.
My least favourite arc and Eikon battle as well. It also felt weird how much of a better fighter he was against Clive and all of a sudden, with no reason for an increase in skill, Clive beats him.
    I might be forgetting some stuff, but Clive did at least gain Shiva’s power between the bottom of the sea and top of the tower fights?
    Clive gets shivas power….
        Ah yes Shiva, the weakest most underutilized Eikon that gets slapped by Titan right at the start of the game? That one?

Let's just acknowledge it for what it really was - anime plot armor, which FF never really shyed away from, complete with the whole God slaying in the end. If we are going to do power level measuring Clive should've died several times already to enemies much earlier. Ifrit was his plot armor and when it stopped working they just gave him Ifrit Risen plot armor. It's just typical Shonen stuff.
            We have no idea how the shiva vs titan fight ended, could’ve been a draw, a win, whatever.

In that same fight that you early misunderstood you can see how fast shiva is, this is a perfect counter to odins quick slashes.

As mythos, each eikon also strengthens him as a vessel regardless of the eikons individual power, likely increasing his strength.

I don’t think you know what plot armor is my guy.
                We do know it ends with Jill dragged on the floor too beaten and tired to be able to prime again. It's pretty clear Titan had the upper hand throughout. 

She's not nearly that fast and you made up a weird headcannon about how she's a good counter to Odin when Odin literally wiped the floor with her and she ended up captive. She has, in a quite literal sense, ice glass level of defensive ability.

If each Eikon strengthens him, then again, you are fighting against Odin at that point with the power of Ifrit, Phoenix, Titan, Ramuh, and Bahamut combined.
5  Eikons against one and Clive still gets the floor wiped with him. Add Shiva, which has so far proved no exceptional prowess against any other Eikon and suddenly the scales are tipped completely to Clive? Not even a struggle? From getting cut down in one hit and almost dying, had Barny willed it, to completely overpowering him?

Oh I know what plot armor is. You, however, need to do some reading.
                    You clearly have no literacy at all, nothing you said proves Titan had any upper hand, we never see kupka, we never see what Jill’s condition was before the fight, we never see the actual conclusion.

“She’s not nearly that fast” someone skipped the prologue, play again and watch the background…

If Odin wiped the floor with Clive, the fuck you think Jill is going to be able to do? Jill using shivas power ≠ Clive using shivas power.

Here’s a very clear and hard to miss power up of Clive during the barnabas fights.

1. Completely loses

2. Fights back with some experience getting a little further and not getting completely cut down

3. Gains shiva and even more experience and eventually wins. 

I don’t know where the fuck your got the no struggle thing from. Might have to replay this too.
                    something to keep in mind is that obviously Jill was being mistreated, her health and energy for sure wasn't at her peak at that fight, Hugo didn't have that disadvantage, he's obviously well fed and in good shape.
                        So was Phoenix, arguably in a worse state, it was still able to handle Odin better, and Jill was already healthy at this point. Bahamut too was able to match up to Odin and pushed Waloed back from Storm.

Why do you feel the need to excuse the fact the power scaling in this game is Shonen anime level and only serves to push along the plot? There is no logical power scaling here, it's all spectacle, it's when it gets too egregious like Odin's battle that I feel it has to be pointed out.
        Ahhh... I can't believe I forgot that was after the second defeat and before the final battle. Everything just felt like it happened in such a short period of time.
I found Sleipnir more compelling than Barnabas. It's a shame, because I'd watched an interview with some of the voice actors and I thought Barnabas was going to be pretty awesome, but in the end he felt like an anticlimax and the horse twink was more fun.
    Sleipnir is a character I don't even understand and is totally unnecesary in my opinion.
        Thats the Guy that was created by barnabas right? Yeah i was excited to fight him but he truned out to litteraly be nobody lol
I agree that he was wasted potential. The twist that he was akashic could have been played up  more, but was little beyond a throwaway line.

I wish they did more with Sleipnir and what he was, too.
Hugo had more of a real beef with Clive than Barnabas ever would. 

Most of the antagonists feel wasted. 

Benedikta is gone too soon.

Hugo is the only one who fulfills his story role but sadly doesn’t get to do much other than be mad and horny. We are told he’s some 5head megamind, but he’s a standard brute in game 

We don’t get much with the emperor. Annabella is more a problem for dion after the time skip. Oliver doesn’t do anything until right before the bahamut fight

The iron guys were more for Jill and honestly we don’t get much out of them.

The Barnabas side kick guy is just an Odin projection 

Barnabas doesn’t even do much and his masters goal is literally not to kill Clive

Ultima is so generic he alone makes this a final fantasy game by being as typical JRPG god as possible

Most of the political stuff falls flat like half way through the game when the story just stops caring in exchange for generic JRPG god time
TBH as dark as it would be I kinda wish he had straight up killed Jill not her being captured AGAIN. But make it epic like she almost gets him but then he semiprimes and destroys her Clive can absorb the powers there as they have their tearful goodbye and Barnabas will just leave because he severed  one of Clive's ties. Then the whole next part is Clive in beast mode destroying everything in his path to get to Barnabas and when he does barny kicks his ass and laughs because he has become just like Hugo a fool. Then you get to ash and Joshua and gav eventually bring Clive back to reason and that focus and clarity of purpose bring barny down. Or something

Waiting for the downvotes from the Jill fans but I'm sorry after this point her only purpose was a sexy scene and to give powers to Clive. And I guess that was Barnabas' only purpose too lol
    I feel like the "killing off the girl" trope is a bit overplayed, especially because they just did that with XV.
    I don’t consider that scene to be “sexy” but one of the most beautiful emotional expressions of love i have seen in media recently. Other female characters were just “sexy” but Jill is way deeper than that.
        No you are correct. It is incredibly beautiful and powerful and I love it but I just take issue with that scene because of Jill looking completely normal. So I say "sexy" because the devs decided to completely ignore the curse for this scene. Jill spent years in the service of the Ironblood. Implied she was made to prime in multiple battles became such a threat the empire planned her assassination. Then after Cid dies and Clive still can't fully prime it's again implied she is carrying his burden aka priming since he can't. We are constantly being told how the curse works and that Jill needs rest and yada yada then we get to that scene and she is just perfect and sexy. If parts of her were maybe showing signs of the curse it would have hit harder and not just been here is the girl you wanted to see naked the whole game. Uwu
            not only that, 13 years she was under the ironbloods and not even a single small scar could be seen...
                Clive barely has any either
                    Yes during the final fight it's implied that the curse does infect Clive because either he is the "perfect" vessel or because of Ultima's influence didn't really make it clear.
                        We’re talking about scars lol
                            Right right mb
        the only problem was there was no trace of the curse on her body.  unless i missed something, it would've been more impactful to me if there were signs of wear and tear of abuse for 5 years
    Nah mate, i agree. If he had killed Jill you’d feel something deep towards Barnabas. A true villain, a true challenge, a true problem.

That’s why Sephiroth and Cloud are so iconic, there’s true investment there. But here, after I saw Jill survive and heard the whole ultima spiel I knew that was it for me.
    this could've been interesting actually. i love love love jill but this way better than how she ended up sidelined by the end anyways
    Fr its not like jill was important to the story after getting Shiva, shes just reduced to love interest (and its not like we get a Happy pay off from It)

Imo if anything we shouldve Gotten the Ash part as the 5 year timeskip instead of after cids death to at least explain how we can beat barnabas, would make more sense than explaining It the way we can rn which is "we got Shiva" Who litteraly didnt get a single win on her own and was Next to useless in her own Big fight
Yeah, I agree, I was a little disappointed he turned out to be a zealot. He was so mysterious I was expecting him to be like a tactical genius but he was just...a religious madman who drank the Kool-aid 

More disappointed in his fight that we didn't get an Ifrit vs Odin+Sleipnir battle. We got that in cutscenes during his final fight, but we didn't actually get to control Ifrit. 

To be clear, I think his fight was GREAT, but it would have been AMAZING if it was followed up with an Eikon v Eikon battle too
    I think instead of being followed up by it I wish they had expanded these cutscenes into actual gameplay sequences. It would had made for quite an interesting take on an eikon fight
        Agreed!
Yeah I really hated the map being washed out for the rest of the game, really made me sleepy while playing lol
I understand your point, but I feel the potential would have been wasted if we fought a Barnabas who had not yet succumbed to Ultima and given up his will.

The way I see it, Barnabas himself was long gone by the time we actually fought him, existing as nothing but a puppet for Ultima. He willingly let go of his humanity and will to become Akashic.

The only reason I see for having defeated him so easily is because he had basically no will of his own left, just a husk for Ultima to control.
The fact that bro was batshit insane and manipulated is hilarious,I can imagine Cid hearing that crazy talk and slowly backing away while Barnabas is just rambling about Ultima and his mothers milk

![gif](giphy|iF7CxHFcKXcMfEIWGN|downsized)
I agree with you. His philosophical rants reminded me of Genesis, which soured my opinion of him
    I really was just saying "i dont even know what youre talking about so shut Up already please"
        I love his VA but the fact that he used like 8 sentences to say 1 thing got tiring really quickly.

Other characters (and in XIV) have this issue but Barny was the worst offender (with Ultima being a close second).
I fully agree with everything you said and I actually feel similar about Hugo Kupka. He had such an intimidating aura with the menacing Titan as his Eikon and he was reduced to being a simp for Benedikta. I would have liked a different story for him, maybe going evil and attacking other countries in an attempt to secure the safety of his homeland. The thought of Titan marching on a castle AoT Rumbling style would have been really cool but instead I was really let down with his character even if the fight was cool. The honest truth is that Benedikta and him probably didn’t even see each other or interact that much given that she was still at Barnabas’ side for him to have felt such strong feelings.
I agree, unfortunately as a huge Odin fan of every game I was looking forward to him the most, huge disappointment. Rest of the game was amazing tho
    At least Odín himself had nice tits ig

We really got nothing else from him lol
Barnabas is one of my favorite characters in the game, but I get what you mean. Much of his depth comes from subtext tbh

Obviously one side of me would had liked for him to take over Ultima but it wouldn’t be as thematically fitting. 

It would play well into his whole power complex, but I think the direction they took him makes sense, with him serving the one being that’s stronger than him
I just wish there was an Ifrit vs Odin section in the middle of that fight - big spectacle shit - and then finish the fight back on foot again. That was what was missing.
I don't actually have a problem with Barnabas' character, but I do think that he should have been more evenly spread through the game as opposed to only really stepping onto the stage in the third act.

At first Barnabas is this intimidating and mysterious figure, but when Clive meets him he starts going on about the same consciousness and will stuff that Ultima is going on about, but because we only have a notion of what this stuff is about at the time, it just makes Barnabas sound like he's spewing nonsense. He's not saying anything that already hasn't been said to us by Ultima.

Barnabas is a religious zealot who genuinely believes that Ultima is God, and that his plans will lead to humanity's salvation, and I feel is was a sort of misstep that they kept the information about Ultima's influence on the world so close to the chest as they did. Trying to make Ash seem like it was this big and mysterious unknown didn't make much sense to me, making it seem like it was impossible to learn anything about it unless you go there yourself, when you actually have encounters with characters that have been there. There's that one Cursbreaker, Harpocrates' penpal, Cid himself, there are clearly characters with connections to Ash, and how Ultima and Barnabas have influenced it, but it never comes up until it needs to.

Barnabas, his ideology and religion, Ultima's influence on Ash (but keeping reasonable doubt that it was him specifically), I feel like those are things that should have been more gradually fed to us over the course of the game so that when Barnabas did make his proper introduction to Clive, it was more easy to digest.
I have the same feeling that Barnabas had so much wasted potential.

But this stems from how I really don't like his character being a huge Ultima simp-- you don't present a character looking this cool and badass only for him to be staggeringly one-dimensional.
    His personality very clearly changed in that final fight
I'm too lazy to dig up my old comments on this but I really think that the last third of the story got significantly revised. 

I'm really into Barnabas, his whole archetype, and the dark ideology he represents. But I also agree that this final version of the story doesn't fully capitalize on what was set up for him w/r/t promotional material. 

A have a few theories about how things might've originally shaken out. But the main thing is that  Barnabas was supposed to be a dark mirror of Clive's revenge-driven designs. He was supposed to represent what happens when a quiet man with a deep well of inner rage and near limitless power puts his mind to ruthlessly redressing a wrong. 

In terms of backstories, they really have a frightening amount in common wrt losing loved ones to cruel/suspicious circumstances. In Barney's case it turned him into a cynical and fatalistic man. Whereas I think the diff in Clive's case would've been having Cid there to ground him and Jill (+Hideaway crew) to remind him that there's actually some good left in humanity. 

I think the religiosity element was always there. But based on initial presentation, I feel like Barnabas originally saw the eikons themselves as godlike beings and the Dominants as demi-gods who should rise above the trappings of their humanity and fully manifest their own divinity. With him as the measured, arbiter-king at the center of it. That's essentially the story he sold to Benedikta and Cid (and I suspect was trying to sell to Hugo through Bene) and I would've liked *that* part of his presence elaborated on. 

I think the nature of Clive and Barnabas's conflict wouldn't have been too different between the above and what we got. Barnabas still would've seen something of a kindred spirit in Clive and wanted to push him to realizing his max potential. Except in this version, Barnabas would be free to be an absolutely merciless af menace and really wreak some havoc. I always reference Hannibal Lector because it's pretty much the same "I want to break you and remake you....and you will be immaculate!" sort of energy. 

Instead, it's exactly like you say. Enter the Ultima rejoining plot and the Mythos-must-catch-them-all conceit and suddenly Barnabas can't really hone Clive in any significant way. His hands are tied because Clive now needs the external powers of Josh and Jill thus granting them immunity by proxy.

I guess that's a whole lot of words to say, I largely agree. I still really like the character we got but I def think I would've loved him more if some things had (or rather, hadn't) been tweaked.
But he has ALL the best anime tropes!!

- Weird incest

- Defeats everyone while intentionally making it look effortless 

- Random maniacal laughter

- Eventually loses to protagonist because they... Tried extra hard this time/ had IDEALS!

I appreciate your critical analysis! Always fun to read what the smart kids think.
    >Eventually loses to protagonist because they... Tried extra hard this time/ had IDEALS!

Well, Clive received Shiva's essence in the meantime, not sure how much of a difference it was making but there is that
    Press L3+R3 to talk-no-jutsu
Honestly i only liked barnabas when he was fighting and not talking, same for ultima after hearing : 


-Mythos why do you sill want to be human ? Humans are useless and stupid ! 

-Mythos show me your strength 

-Mythos why do you keep fighting it's pointless 

-Mythos play your role ! 



for like 35364747484848 times i was so done with both of them lol.
We all got catfished by Barnabus 😫
I agree. He reminded me of Madara Uchiha from Naruto, going down the route of evil to achieve his ‘dream world’ but his subservience to Ultima really deflated him as a character. It could have been more interesting if they showed him having his own secret motivations, and Ultima killing him at the end. That would have also hyped up Ultima - someone who effortlessly kills the strongest dominant.
I think Barnabes biggest problem was the fact that he kept repeating Ultimas ideas and plans non stop. Like we get it Clive is a vessel and you worship Ultima .. don't need to say it a million times.
I kind of feel like Ultima ruined a lot more than Barnabas. FFXVI was really at its strongest when telling a human story about revenge, warring nations, subjugation, and self actualization. I think Barnabas was emblematic of this issue. I guess it’s still a JRPG in the end. They had to roll out the ol’ “use the power of friendship to kill God” routine eventually.
His fight was so disappointing I'm starting to think it was meant to be "pathetic" on purpose.
I feel like a lot of story stuff should've been done differently. A good few characters feel like wasted potential to me. 

I think we should've seen more of benedikta and Cids history and see them interact with each other more. Maybe even get back on friendly terms. 

Hugo being crazy for benedikta could've made for an interesting conflict triangle between him, her and Cid. She could eventually tell him she never really loved him, only cid. And he could get jealous, try to kill cid, Cid puts up a good fight but since he seems to be the most weakened from using his eikon he's at a disadvantage. Bene fights to protect him, causing Hugo to get even more jealous and emotional and _then_ he transforms into titan lost. Her, Cid and clive jump and smoke him and while he's crumbling into dust bene has a guilty look on her face for toying with his heart or something. This may sound corny but I don't care. I would've liked this scenario to happen

Sleipnir seemed all cool and mysterious at first. He shows up during clive and Hugo's fight, effortlessly knock Hugo out and picks him up like a toddler and leaves. Had me thinking he was a dominant or something which wouldve been cool but he just ends up being some kind of thing barny made. I mean if anything he could've been leviathan who is only teased like once. 

I think Gav should've became the next cid. It felt weird to me that the player character became cid when he's usually a separate character. I think it wouldve been more fitting. Especially with how close gav and cid became. 

And the Barnabas stuff OP mentioned. He went from cool af to meh. He should've been the main antagonist with ultima showing up in a sequel or dlc episode. The story just always seemed to do things in a weird way to me
Most characters in this game were wasted potential
>Ultima wanted him to sever Clive’s bonds to break his will which hints he might kill an important character but doesn’t do it because he needs Clive to get fully powered up for Ultima.

It's deeper than this. Ultima *couldn't* have deliberately killed off anyone. Not for storytelling purposes, but because it would have had the opposite effect of what he wanted.

Killing those he loved was never going to work. People seem to be missing this.

Clive loved Joshua so much that he literally created a villain out of thin air in order to get revenge. Ultima even comments on the fact that Clive ran off nothing but vengeance his whole life from Phoenix Gate to the start of the game. Without that, he probably wouldn't have had the strength to survive as long as he did.

Ultima killed Cid, and then what happened? Clive and Jill both got stronger for it.

Ultima killed Joshua at the end, and then what happened? Clive beat his ass and killed him.

Killing Jill would have had the same effect -- Ultima NEVER would have been able to take him because Clive would have become singularly consumed with killing him out of spite.

The whole point is that the suffering they endured is what gave them the strength of will (consciousness) to continue. 

Suffering is the heart of consciousness. Adding more would only fuel the fire.
I didn’t really feel that way until after the final boss fight and realized that ultima had no personality at all
Yes, all of this.  
Ultima should have been a weird side boss, and not the shallow eyed 4 armed thing god he was.  Or a spell, like when we got Tri-Disaster from Phoenix - Ifrit - Bahamut merging their ultimates, maybe Ultima could have been a big spell from the combined powers of all eikons, a magic so powerful it could destroy a final boss.  


And Barnabas would have been a much better final villain.  
He could have been driven mad by Odin's blade.  Gaining power over life and death.  Being immortal himself, but capable of felling armies with a swing of his sword.  His dark power could have been the cause of the blight spreading, the crystals could have been his vessels bleeding the world for his own gain of ultimate power.    


I think it could even explain Leviathan the Lost- maybe this could be the second time an eikon's dominant goes mad with power and immortality, ascending into god-status, and that big crater was from the battle where Leviathan was defeated by a similar vessel to Clive- someone who brings balance and sets things right.   


There were a hundred ways they could have written a better villain and ending to the game.  But we got what we got.
So here's the issue with Ultima, and it's because YoshiP's Team is very self-conscious of certain critiques Final Fantasy has had in the past. Ultima is the typical final act FF villain. Your Zeromus, Ultimecia, Nekron(?), Orphan. The main critique is that these villains are not fleshed out, and just appear out of nowhere to take over the plot. 

So what does CBU3 do? They introduce the dark god behind everything at the end of the first act. They don't want people to complain that Ultima came out of nowhere and took over the plot. Here is where the issue comes up...it wasn't just that those characters came out of nowhere that made them bad villains. AND ULTIMA STILL HAS THE PROBLEMS THOSE VILLAINS HAD.

He still comes outta nowhere and steals the plot....he just does it MUCH earlier and makes all other villains into crazy people with no agency. Kupka is driven insane by Benna thirst (induced by Ultima). Annabella was manipulating the world for a child that DIDN'T EVEN EXIST. The Emperor wasn't really evil...even tho he's been conquering his neighbors for nearly a decade. Barnabas wasn't a charismatic warrior king who overthrew the old order...he was a evangelical mommy's boy.

Every other villain is diminished by Ultima's presence, and then we have to deal with Ultima just being a bad villain. He is all powerful/all knowing but can't even quarantine Clive to get what he wants. Like if you want Clive to do what you want just threaten the Hideaway or something. Like I understand they are trying to personify Ultima as a Demiurge that is too prideful to admit he needs to bargain...but they also personify Ultima as an alien driven by Reason who DOES LIE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT SOMETIMES. Why wouldn't he lie to Clive and be like "alright if you do this for me I'll spare the remaining humans, and put them on an island somewhere".

Even as Ultima is dying on the ground before Clive he's still talking shit, and there still isn't a good explanation for why he made the choices. Just a "you didn't win bitch enjoy your lifeless world"...and then Clive saves the world anyways. 

Get fucked Ultima.
all the human antagonists were let down by what i affectionately think of as the final fantasy bs. 

i also think barnabas should've showed up sooner in the story, somewhere before titan perhaps, so clive losing to him the first time would have happened early on so there was a sense of progression and clive getting stronger, with the second time still culminating in jill deciding to give him her eikon.
Agreed. He really should have been his own man. It’s what I loved about Annabella, she got to be bad on her own. 

My main expansion DLC hope is us playing as a younger Cid during Barnabas’ rise. Have him be more of his own man, and showcase who he is on his own terms. 

He can still “follow” Ultima, but have it be his plan to bring Ultima back, not something Ultima told him to do.
I think if Ultima wasn’t the villain, Barnabas would’ve been fleshed out more. From the trailers, I believed he was to be either a neutral antagonist or the main villain due to him being Odin, but also uniting dominants and controlling Ash.
I would have liked if he had been your full on rival, with goals that go against yours (trying to save the crystals) and make you think "he's not entirely wrong", maybe even doubt your path.

Then give him a final duel with you over the fate of the last crystal as the final boss of the game and leave ultima out of it completely (or have ultima be revealed last minute).
I've got a conspiracy theory about this: there was a story re-write somewhere in development when they realized they were running out of time and Barnabas was one of the sacrifices of this rewrite.

&nbsp;

The story can basically be divided into three phases with clear motivations: phase 1 is the worldbuilding and revenge portion when Clive is trying to avenge Joshua's death. During this time, the worldbuilding goes HARD on explaining the state of affairs and seems to setup Barnabas as the ultimate baddie of the story (endless victories resulting in a whole-continent take-over while other factions are fighting over the other continent + some islands). This phase ends with part two, where the reveal that Clive killed Joshua comes to be and Cid motivates Clive to follow a greater purpose: to destroy the Mothercrystals which will hopefully solve the blight, and also end the politicking of the nations, including helping the status of the bearers, the main point of Cid's organization. Phase 2 is compatible with the whole political-struggle-Barnabas-as-major-baddie - I think there was interesting potential here too with Benedikta as a potential double agent (IE. If she was real and not an illusion of Ultima that got into the good graces of Barnabas while still being in love/support of Hugo). Then Phase 3 happens: Ultima is revealed while Clive takes on Cid's mantle and continues to go around plotting the destruction of the Mothercrystals.

&nbsp;

Phase 3 is where all the human-intrigue and Barnabas being the big baddie is thrown out the window and I find lots of evidence in this last section that Ultima was an afterthought of needing to patch together a coherent story before launch: Waloed feels like the most underdeveloped zone from a game development perspective. Story holes start to appear: if Cid knew who Typhon/Ultima was, why would he not say anything about it until it was too late/he dies? If Barnabas was 100% Ultima's puppet, why did he not sacrifice himself to Clive as soon as possible? Alternately, if he is genuinely, trying to kill Clive, why was he so easily able to best him and then 180-lose after Clive absorbs Shiva? If Clive steals Eikon power through his absorption power and dominants are only-able to transform through getting Aether drunk (Benedikta/Hugo) after the fact, why does Jill not do this for the final battle yet Dion appears to be able to transform into Bahamut at will? It seems like the easiest way that they were able to tie all this story together was to create an omniscient god to defeat, which is exactly what they did, but it seemed to leave lots of holes.

&nbsp;

For me, I also found Barnabas disappointing and wish they had leaned into the human-political-intrigue part of the story rather than pivoting into the kill-a-god trope. I think there were ways to do it, even if they ran out of time.
I thought when Ultima told Banabas to break Clive and sever his conciousness, that Barnabas would turn him and Joshua against each other or murder Byron. Instead he just beats him up a couple times then loses because Clive's willpower is too strong. I was hoping Clive would pull some tricks or outsmarts him if not trains or the slightly less obvious part of Joshua and Clive teaming up on him and Sleipnir. Barnabas and Waleod as a whole also lost a ton of points in their armies being reduced to mindless husks whereas units like Benedikta's had a ton of personality and coolness to their "no witnesses" approach to intelligence gathering.
To add to this, if you’re gonna give Barnabas eyeliner, give him black nail polish too.

If you’re going to climb the tower, ring the bell. 

Just one man’s opinion.
I would have loved Barnabas killing Ultima and absorbing his powers, with a plan all along.

Barnabas had everything to become a top tier villain.
He felt like another genesis but instead of loveless it was mythos
totally agree with this, the whole last act of the game seems to have gone in a predictable direction and i feel like they could have done more. and making the world purple wouldn’t have bothered me so much if they hadn’t reduced the soundtrack down to 2 songs that are annoying and make you want to fall asleep. personally i was hoping for a bit more of a sci-fi ending. ultima to me seemed like a remnant of the fallen, like an android or artificial life. him turning out to be an actual god is fine but it’s predictable. i thought it would have been better if barnabas killed ultima to become the new god.
I feel like you liked barnabas a lot. Which is fine, but he was a servant to ultima and had no will of his own. Served his purpose. Was cool to fight
I straight up hard agree with everything you said here. When I saw him in the trailers I thought “this is a dark knight, he’s gonna make Clive’s existence miserable”

Nope, he doesn’t do shit. He’s not even like a good rival character. He just appears in the last act and is a bloody servant of all things. Just a minion. I don’t get why he didn’t just give Clive his power to be done with it. He had literally no reason to fight. “To prepare the vessel” - yeah right.

Honestly that’s the one part, along with Jill being so … weak, that makes me disappointed. I do still love the game. But I think my expectations betrayed me. I was expecting a big showdown between Jill and Barnabas, where tragedy unfolds. Or maybe Jill would be the only swordstress able to tackle him, something like that.

Unfortunately they were just eclipsed by Clive. It really is Clive’s story.

I wish Barnabas had been a Rival, like Vergil to Dante. A true struggle, and a true epitome of a Final Fantasy dark knight.
Totally agree. Ultima makes the conflict between the parties/kingdoms seem pointless, too. It all came down to fighting the heartless supergod that exceeds all. I would’ve wished for more antagonists having their own will and power, trying to outplay each other.
    I feel like Ultima nor a God figure wasn’t really needed for this kind of story. I felt the first half clearly demonstrated that the problem with Valisthea is the cruel rulers and their lust for control and power. Then Ultima comes in and starts pulling a Littlefinger behind the scenes by pitting the kingdoms against each other and Clive. Just like Game of Thrones, I massively prefer the human conflict between all the kingdoms rather than the inhuman existential threat that wants to wipe out humanity because we suck to them.
        This is due to Japanese cultural differences to the west when it comes to what gods are and what they represent, you notice in almost every JRPG, in FFXVI's case Ultima literally represents the aspect of Valisthea's Sociery Cid and later Clive fought, that some people are just considered born beneath others and have to serve those above them
        Ultima was definitely needed especially when the game is about trying to escape fate and how hard it is whether it be an institution or choices and circumstance.
        Exactly, you worded it better than I did. The first hours teased everything being like game of thrones, but in the end it wasn’t like that. And that’s the point, the human conflict is what is interesting not the conflict between innocent individuals and some supernatural threat, even in a fantasy world.
I was just a bit disappointed in how you don’t really prime up with him that much aside from in a scripted cutscene. I was waiting for a fight to top Titan’s but I didn’t really get that.
Agree with most of the comments here about the antagonist being a weak part of the game. But you gotta admit, that first time when we destroyed the crystal in Oriflamme and Typhon appeared, that was DOPE!
Ultima and Barnabas were the biggest disappointments of the game for me, more so than any design gripe, or issues I have with the side-quests and lack of RPG elements. I was so much more emotionally invested with Benedikta, Kupka, and the whole Sanbreque Royal Family as antagonists than what felt like a rushed big bad that Ultima was.  


Barnabas seemed so interesting at first but the whole being a puppet to Ultima thing made him much less compelling than I was hoping he would be, and it doesn't help that Ultima, while I do enjoy the lore and idea behind him, was poorly executed in my opinion as a character. While I do understand that the lack of humanity is part of the whole idea behind Ultima, for a deity that's as disconnected to humanity as he was portrayed as, it just didn't feel as if I was being faced with such insurmountable and overwhelming odds that I felt I should have as the story went on. I feel as though it could have been executed better if they didn't conclude Clive's whole arc around the demons within him around mid-game, and carried it with much more emphasis up until towards the end and having Ultima play around with that.

It just felt so underwhelming and anime-like, similar to ARR's ending, I expected more from the 'mature' story and narrative that they were selling me the entire game, the bitter-sweet nature of the ending didn't even hit as hard as XV did.
I agree. The only reason I know his name is because his design was cool. The ocean thing was dope too but I found myself falling asleep when Barnabas would talk.
Personally, ifeel that Ultima was just not used properly in this game. It'll have a greater impact if all the dominants actually found out the true reason of their being, including Barnabus.

The way I'll rewrite the story is that in Origin, the aether is so dense that the eikon essence within Clive manifests themselves as their dominants. Within Origin, each dominant explained they watched everything unfold through Clive.

Some discussions and bickering ensues, Barnabus questioned his loyalty towards Ultime, Hugo apologized, Benedikta apologized to Cid, Dion just being Dion. And ironically, it's Ultima that united all the dominants, and through their will they managed to defeat their creator.

During the final clash, each dominant lends Clive their strength, so it's the dominant and their respective Eikon that allows them to power through Ultima's power, maybe add in like 1 liners to add some FF cheese.


Plus what's with Square Enix with their hard on for "Supposedly advanced kingdom, but fallen into ruins when the party arrives" trope?

Have they learned nothing from XV's Niflheim?
The story felt resolved for me when Bahamut was defeated and Clive confronted his mother. That was the narrative arc that I was invested in, the arc that had the best emotional hook for the player, and the arc that concluded in the most satisfying way.

But then the game kept going...and going...and going.

I honestly think that FFXVI could have skipped the god killing this time around. Have clive fight the eikons, re-win his family's throne, and take down the empire. Make it a more personal story about familial betrayal, intolerance, and taking back that which is rightfully yours.

I think they wanted to tell a really personal story this time, but were too afraid to ditch the "Go and Kill God" trope of Final Fantasy and stick to what they were good at.


While I'm at it, another take:

The bearer storyline was dumb and unnecessary. It did not subtract from Clive's personal journey, but it wasnt needed either. Clive's mother hated him because he wasnt chosen by the phoenix. That was enough without the bearer subplot. It would have made more sense if the story used traditional medieval prejudices of serfdom and/or class.
The entire story of this game is the writers writing themselves into a corner for the sake of making stuff happen on screen that they thought would look cool, and the only way they ever get out of each corner they write themselves into is going “well it’s probably not that important anyway let’s just move on to the next setpiece – but first, three hours of tedium and inconsequential dialog from uninteresting and unimportant characters!”. Throwaway hideout npc’s get more interactions and screen time than any character that is actually of consequence to the story. It’s surprisingly atrocious writing almost all the way through. I truly feel sorry for anyone who thinks this game has good writing, characters, plot or dialogue. There are some decent moments, but they are rare and fleeting.
The barnabas arc was the worse for me. I found his fight meh as well. They really built him up to seem like a mastermind but he was just a “religious freak”. However the ending of the game was amazing for me so still and 10 out of 10 experience.
So many bullshit posts.

The internet is the worst.
Barnabas is like the Golbez (FF4) of this game, though unlike Golbez, we are introduced to real villain (Ultima) way before we do him (technically, Barnabas appears in the very beggining of the game with Hugo and Benedikta, but I believe his first dialogue that we hear in the present of the stort is after Hugo's death, which is at least 5 to 7 hours after we see Ultima in Oriflamme).

Even when I think Ultima was the perfect villain for the kind of story the game was telling (even when Ultima itself is nowhere near among the best villains of the series) I would have liked for the game to at least make me believe that Barmabas was the villain at some point, even if it was just a bait.
Literally, Waloed reminded me of Niflheim in Final Fantasy 15. Set up to be the big bad guys the whole game, have been a threat the main character and his friends/family, finally getting to their nation and it’s completely abandoned, with the whole nation turned to mindless Daemons by the Scarscourge….

Like, I didn’t even realize we were fighting/killed the Emperor of Nifelheim as a Daemon until it was said in after-combat dialogue. Didn’t even get a cutscene of his death, just light banter from Ardyn. Was so disappointed at the wasted potential, because the only other time we had seen the Emperor was a single other cutscene at the beginning of the game. And the movie, if you saw Kingsglaive. 

Barnabas isn’t that bad, but he comes pretty close. And fighting the Akashic through the country was cool and all, but it became repetitive and depressing toward the end. Once I got through the giant gate, I just sprinted toward the end
Barnabas and Ultima definitely should be the same person with only 1 fight. Their goals are exactly the same.

Plus we can cut the length of the third act by half, since it should be half the length.

It’s unfortunately that the most entertaining plot points were resolved at the end of the second act (clive&joshua reunion, dion and the crown).
The longer this game is out the more disappointing it gets.

Dragons Dogma has the same exact story premise but it’s so much more meaningful and interesting..and that came out 10 years ago.
It is time for him to exit and Clive is the door.
Yeah. Kinda wish they had Kupka be the one that was Ultima’s right hand man. That way his hatred for Clive and their rivalry would have been even more bitter and satisfying to see play out. Maybe Kupka could be jealous of Clive being the vessel instead of himself (which Ultima would used to manipulate him sketcher further). And can you imagine the Titan lost fight being the last big boss we gave before the Ultima battle? It’d have been crazy.
The thing I wanted to know more of was how things were in Waloed when Cid and Benedikta were serving Barnabus. How long was Ultima in charge for and how much did Cid and Benedikta know if anything.
I agree that wish he did more in the story and show more of his people than the Akashic and  wish he had more stuff than being Ultima slaves and lore about his childhood and what's the obsession with his Mum, However his motivation is still there as he is giving his country to Ultima and we can see what will happen to other region if they do
i liked the barnabas boss fight,but they could have done more with it imo.
Barnabus was great for what he actually was my only wish was just some more screen time of him cause his theme is great.
>Ultima wanted him to sever Clive’s bonds to break his will which hints he might kill an important character but doesn’t do it because he needs Clive to get fully powered up for Ultima. Kind of felt like he was written into a corner and because of that was made not that interesting. 

I actually think his potential was wasted exactly because of the "sever his connections" sentence. When they said that, I actually expected him to try to do something related to that, to try reaching that goal. 

Human connections are a weird thing, you can connect to those who aren't alive and sometimes some connections can even get stronger exactly because they died. 

So, how do you cut connections? You make them go against each other. You manipulate, you create conflict, and you lie just enough to make them stand against each other. When you turn a connection into conflict and out of that conflict, you manage to get hate out of it. That's when you get closer to sever a connection. 

So I actually expected Barnabas to, for some reason, try to *join* the Hideaway to become their ally, somehow. Maybe an ally that would try to "help" them fight against Dhalmekian forces,  or even The Iron Kingdom. And then use that to turn Clive against the others.

This could have also helped in establishing Clive's connection to Barnabas to justify their rivalry later in the game at the very least.

I think he was a very wasted potential because this story could have gone to so many different directions and not even necessarilythe one i described, and Barnabas could have been handled in so many different ways as an antagonist. 


So, I agree that Barnabas was disappointing since he was just another take on "evil religious man is evil using religion to justify his means, and now you have to kill him to progress the story". That's doubling disappointing because that type of story/character was already done before in this game and was done better. One with the Iron Kingdom and the personal connection they had with Jill, being a very traumatic enemy to one of the protagonists, and the other was the Emperor, trying to use Greagor's religion and the divine as a way to justify expanding the Empire. Barnabas just felt like a mad religious dude talking nonsense and then a sword fight and not much more than that. 

Hopefully, at the very least, they release an "Extreme Bosses" dlc where they remix their patterns, add mechanics, and just have a harder version of bosses. Because even that fight felt a bit disappointing to me.it didn't escalate as well as the others and I think it could have used more mechanics where you can't iframe through a move, forcing us to physically get out of the way of the attack. And when I say escalate, I don't mean it needed to be crazy like Titan or Bahamut fight, but we could have had a section controlling Ifrit against fully primed Odin. 

But yeah, my disappointment about Barnabas/Odin soured a bit in the last section of the game. I still love the game, and currently I am playing NG+, hoping that his fight in FF Mode is a lot more challenging.
Say what you want but at least he succeeded. He got Clive to absorb all of the eikons and become the vessel ultima needed him to be, of course they didn’t see Clive bitch slapping ultima coming but this what it is lol
Barnabas was an emo, a crybaby, he couldn't handle the pressure, so he gave up. He's the eikon of darkness. Opposite to the eikon of light. He was consumed by negative emotions and he saw the only way to save the world was to turn everyone akashic.

The fight was decent although I would've loved to see him eat some aetherroids.

I kinda knew Barnabas hate was coming here. The situation reminds me of a crybaby weak anime MC that the big bad brave uncles from the comment section have to continuously hate on.
Yeah it’s such a shame, he’s only really a focal point of the game for a short while and he’s killed off way too easily for a character shown to be beyond anything we’d faced before, how easily he defeats Clive in the first two encounters going straight to him being dispatched of easier than Kupka. 

It’s especially a shame because of the potential of such a misguided character that was left kinda one dimensional. His design and voice acting was honestly perfect too, especially during the final fight with him (which I personally didn’t find as disappointing as people say, I think that fight was awesome, easy top 3 gameplaywise.)
Yeah I was positive he was going to do more to inflict pain on Clive, like kill off a character, so when he was just a fanatic it was a bit flat.
They should have kept Hugo alive longer and given him some sick cyborg arms or something. Let him go full Revengeance on his nemesis
Worth it though for him turning into a cackling fidget spinner
For sure. 

I always thought Barnabas had a plan, and knew what was going on with Ultima... but he didn't.  Him betraying ultima to become the real final boss would have been more interesting.
Unfortunately, i totally agree. The game was one of my best experiences in gaming up to that point. Well, besides the other problems like boring side quests, gearing, crafting etc. But if you look at just the msq, Yeah.
I 100% agree. I’m about to go into the last part of the game and I am surprised how ineffective and meaningless Barnabas has been.

I got super excited when >!Ultima told him he could cut anything with his sword and hinted at getting rid of the ties that bind him to his will - and nothing of the sort happened at all!<

I’m loving the game but there are just soo many missed opportunities. What’s the deal with Barnabas’s mom? I hope they make use of fallen dominants more in this last segment.

The game even looks worse from a lighting perspective after primogenesis.
Barnabas is my favorite villan of the game, and especially when he explains his religious motivations.

>and all that gets reduced to a fanatical weirdo psychopath who spews a bunch of philosophical nonsense.   
 
WDYM, that's the best part of him.
I was actually fine with him being a thrall to Ultima, especially since he did it by choice after giving up the ideals that Clive now holds. I was fully on board with the fallen king/fanatic narrative. The issue is we see none of that development, none of the Waloed politics, none of Barnabas and his mother, etc. We also don't see him go after Clive's bonds, at least not in a meaningful way. It's just shoved in front of the player with no real context or depth. It would have been so much better to see his victory over Ash, his descent into madness, and maybe him killing off some characters.

I feel like there was supposed to be *way* more to Waloed and Barnabas, but Covid/development restraints forced them to cut things out.
“He didn’t do anything except beat Clive twice” no other Eikon did that btw, not even Ultima was able to defeat Clive 1 vs 1, but Odin did
I think his motivations could have been, that he wanted to be últimas body, but was mad that Clive is the choosen one, despite his adoration for the última, and his quest to be the strongest.
So he could be this guy that abolishes Clive because he wanted to be the sacrificial lamb, but Clive refuses to.
And we could have had a whole backstory of how his mom was a bearer slave, contrary to Clive's upbringing in nobility, and he fought to be a king because he wanted to be this sacrificial lamb that resets the world, because of the scars from his past, and he sees Clive as selfish entitled that doesn't understand the essence of the gods.
He could have been written as a more deep character but an antithesis to Clive.
I found the Barnabas arc to be one of my favorites. It was set up well that he could have killed Clive at any moment but because he is a religious fanatic he commits to serving his purpose of sacrificing his power to Clive. 

Clive never overcomes Barnabas. Barnabas even laughs in Clives face at the fact that he has to lose to the likes of him. 

As for all of Barnabas' back story I don't think a huge exposition dump would have served the story at this point. Enough is implied through dialog for our imagination to fill it in.
Yeah I completely agree
totally agree with the last part

would have loved to seen more about the story about what happened to his mother

and also would have been nice Barnabas was developed into the final villain rather than Ultima.
Here I was mainly disappointed because I felt the boss fight was anti climactic at first. I agree on this too, I definitely was waiting for some important character to get killed off at several moments by Barnabas, only for it to never happen or find out said character is alive and well.
Seeing everyone say barnabas was wasted when I thought he was the best villain or atleast up there in the game is crazy ngl. He was the one I could understand the most and I thought he was the most tragic out of all the dominants because he truly thought he was saving everyone.
Yes but people will write essays telling you his fight was actually great (it wasn't) and he was a good character (lol). I've been saying he should have been the big bad. Ultima was a clown show and didn't need to exist.
I thought more could have been done with Barnabas, but his entire arc from title-less wanderer to king is a story that could be explored in a spin off game or DLC. 

While I enjoyed the story, I wouldn’t have minded a twist….where Barnabas realizes Ultima is full of it, offs him and his race…..then decides he himself will become god like and attempt to recreate the world Ultima sought…but to feel as though he could do it himself and do it better than Ultima.
Hate him!!!! He speak too much!!!? Just shoyting evry time!
It’s not Barnabas being the issue it was Ultima. Instead of doing some god antagonist it would have been better if they did a manipulative war lord that persuaded Barnabas to kill Clive. A antagonist like Kuja would have been perfect. That way Barnabas would have a real motion to kill Clive and not hold back. Plus the whole god antagonist point hasn’t been ever successful either except for Ciaus but that was because he was somewhat relatable and the English voice actor too. Seriously tell me this. Imagine if it was a warlord who was a super strong bearer but no one knew he was because of his title. He manipulated Anabella to kill her husband to gain Joshua. Failed. Clive still decided to go with Cid. Secretly the Antagonist helps Cid since he’s a bearer. Clive destroys the first mother crystal but the Antagonist gets stronger. The story wouldn’t have changed too much likable Antagonist and Barnabas also would’ve a better role in the plot.
When Ultima said the line about severing Clive's bonds, I expected the story to get real dark. Barnabas attacks Kanver to get to mid, kidnaps Jill, owns Phoenix in a fight.... and then nothing. I really expected characters to start dying at his hands. But he just kills off his own people. That is the weakest part of the story for me. They set Barnabas up to be this big bad, and it's just a little boy with a mommy complex and a cool sword.
I was so worried when they were saying to sever Clive bond, I genuinely thought Jill is gone, and the last moment before she died, gives her power to Clive. Luckily it wasn't like that phew 

But I think overall Barnabas was preparing him and training him to beat himself as a means to prepare the vessel. 

Ultima did kill Joshua but that just strengthens Clive will to end it all instead of breaking his will, becoming logos.

I was hoping a DLC we play as Barnabas and how his kingdom was corrupted by ultima
I really feel like Barnabas was meant to have a larger role in the story. A lot of people say the game declines in the last third and I agree, and I think it's because it just feels rushed. Ash just feels empty. I suspect a lot more was meant to happen there. They build Baranabas up as more than just an enemy or a pawn--he's got that cool, mysterious backstory about wandering into the Kingdom, seemingly out of nowhere, to conquer the whole thing. And the odd little Mother scene? 

There's gotta be more to this guy's role in the story and it got cut for whatever reason.
I thought he was gonna kill Jill so I’m glad that didn’t happen
Him and Benedikta for sure
Ultima and Barnabas are the least interesting part of the game. Their monologues are the most eye rolling bad guy plot exposition. Game was at its peak when it was centered around the warring nations dealing with each other because of the blight.
He was more of a puppet than I think you give him credit for. He did nothing without the approval of Ultima and I think that he definitely would've beaten Clive if Ultima didn't take over in their fight.
The way I saw it is that Barnabas was driven mad by Ultima. Everything makes more sense of you consider that this man who’d ruled his kingdom for well over 40 years and was given all the gifts of ceasing his aging and, apparently, immunity to the crystal curse was just…. Really good at hiding how batshit he was by being a surly, iron-fisted warrior king who people in his immediate circle were probably mostly terrified of — or so powerful that it didn’t really matter **who** knew he was an utter loon.

The only person we ever see be tender with him (or, to be fair, interact with him at all aside from Ultima or Clive) is Benedikta, but since she seems to be playing **everyone**, it’s unclear to me that she wasn’t just manipulating him because she knew how unstable and not really with the program he was. Cid, at least, knew who Ultima was and I can only imagine it’s because Barnabas told his Lord Commander — who promptly abandoned him because, I imagine, he saw how absolutely insane the man was and went “yeah fuck this shit, I’m out”. And to do all the other CID things, but that’s neither here nor there as far as Barney’s concerned. That cutscene where Cid encounters Ultima made it sound like he was a bit shocked as, in hindsight, he may not have truly believed Ultima actually existed or in the Mythos until shortly before then when Clive absorbed Garuda (that’s how it felt to me, anyways), and Benedikta was trying to use his hallucinations to aid her own ends.

My takeaway from Barnabas’ awesome bossfight but really lackluster critical reasoning skills was that…. It was intentional. He’s not a fearsome, strategic powerhouse. He’s an extraordinarily gifted warrior who chose Will and Charisma as his dump stats and had Ultima’s hands so far up his ass the deity worked him like a puppet. It’s kind of a running theme of Dominants — Benedikta with Barnabas, Hugo with Benedikta, Dion with Annabelle (or whatever tf her name is), and Jill with the Ironblood cult. They’re the world’s most powerful weapons who are ultimately stripped of their humanity to be a tool, and are used as such unless they’re able to break free of that cycle of manipulation
I do think the lack of high stakes felt pretty apparent. There was so much loss and death leading up to these moments. if Barnabas wanted to crush Clive’s willpower; why didn’t he just execute Jill? Surely that would’ve driven him mad with rage. Is it because that would’ve given Barny the upper hand in their final battle which is against Ultima’s plan?
i feel like ultima pushed him out of the spotlight, had odin been the final boss im sure they wouldve given him justice
I do not agree. We could have gotten more of him like practically every other character, but the story at the end is what it is and it's a game, so managing all these characters who are not even with you and give time to each is very much impossible.

But as for what he is, he is the perfect villain for that moment in the story before Ultima.

Like things are not written to be cool, they follow a thematic thread, and fighting before Ultima a guy that represents the opposite of what Clive strives for and the message he carries is what  has to be done without a single question, anything else is the failure of someone that is just writing random things.
We knew barnabas wanted clive to absorb odin so he couldnt hurt clive. He also needed to absorb shiva and phoenix so barnabas couldnt hurt them either.

This is why it was boring imo. No matter how strong he was, he never actually felt like a threat. His dialogue didnt help either.
All the villains could’ve been better developed and fleshed out. The same could be said for most FF villains though.
Barnabas was the worst part of the game, all Waloed country needed a little bit more lore in the main story
The side quest right after Barnabas was far more interesting. The dying soldier you meet who wanted to take his ring to his parents' graves.
Killing an ally to sever Clive bonds? Did you not see how attached Clive got to Cid after Ultima killed him? Dude even took his name….
FF final bosses have been super mid for a long time:
FF6 Kefka- Great
FF7 Sephiroth - Great
FF8 Artemesia - Meh
FF9 Necron - Dumb
FF10 Sin - Meh
FF12 Vayne - Decent
FF13 - Dumb, I don’t even remember the name
FF15 - Ardyn - Meh
Yeah in his dialogue he basically see how hard it is to "sever" consciousness that blends with mythos. 

His original intention in early game was to "unite" the dominant so the realm wouldnt be at war, but then the curse, bearer, and crystal would continue. Its after a while that barnabas encountered ultima and becomes his subject due to his past (he was indoctrined by his mother which he loved very much about the circle of malius).

I do was hoping barnabas as a bigger villain or at least a major villain aside of ultima
I would've really liked if Ultima was disguised as Typhon for most of the game and then have Barnabas take center stage as the villian. Barnabas would still be a huge simp for Ultima but when Ultima finally reveals himself, Barnabas would find out that Ultima is a giant uncaring asshole who only sees him as a tool the same way Barnabas treats his underlings. Would be a great twist 😂.
Not reading all of that but I agree his fight was lack luster compared to the last 2 boss fights. And in my head it was so laid back because it was meant to feel like Clive defeating him without the use of his eikon to carry him.
The cutscenes in this game made me start skipping thru the game
I felt like Barnabas was...fine. Not great, not terrible.

But I get what you're saying. I think he was hyped to be THE bad guy outside of Ultima, but ended up being overshadowed by Benny, Hugo, and Ultima all around him as far as memorability and impact. He was blatantly just a means to an end and he flat-out tells us that he's going to lose, because that's the whole point. That alone kinda takes some of the gravitas away from the conflict, knowing that he's just increasingly poking us and fucking with us until we finally kill him.

Again, he's *fine*, but he definitely could've been utilized better for all the hype and conflict around him.
Yeah I didn't really like how he was cackling like a mad man during his final fight. I didn't take him for the insane type thought it was a weird choice
The entire game was wasted potential after act 1.
I 100 percent agree
Didnt Barnabas spare Jill because he was like “i know my boss told me to kill your friends and sever your will, but it seems theres a longer way but effective way to get him to absorb Eikons”… cue returning Jill to him after the fight under the sea because it was his bonds that actually got him more powers
I feel like a lot of people have said this. Now i also feel like people loved Odin, like a lot, so naturally people want to see more of him. 

I agree but i dont really think its another characters fault. Thats a weird way to talk about writing. Imo

Personally i think that entire chunk of the game was just rushed. It had probably taken too much development time to get there in the first place and they wanted to push things along.
L
You forgot Torgal, but that Good Boy has the biggest plot armor. XD
    Yeah prior to the game coming out I was sure Torgal would be killed off. I was pleasantly surprised he wasn’t.
        I was furious when Benedikta 'killed' him screaming "F\*\*\*ing Dog!".  
It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.
            I knew instantly there was no way torgal was dead
            
>It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.

There's a few good moments like this.  The first combat after you unlock the limit break is with the assholes who massacred Eastpool, so I popped it immediately just on principle
        I knew Torgal was safe when he ewas the only one given Gameplay mechanics. I honestly thought Jill would die, and that would lead Clive to becoming heroically suicidal during the final act (IE he's willing to do anything to stop Ultima/Baranabas and the others need to reign him back in)

The story sorta tries to do this anyways, but it comes off as a lil hokey cuz Clive has always been like this... Everyone being like "why you trying to do everything alone?" like bruh Clive has been doing that for five years, you know how he is already, stfu.
    Plot armor, goodest boy has dog armor. If they killed Torgal we would riot as SE head quarters until its patched.
        Too true. The minute torgal was introduced was the moment i whispered under my breath, "if sqex kills off my fluffy puppy, i riot" 

Then i went to cuddle my own dog because the thought made me sad.
            The end when he is howling broke me 😭
            And then you cuddled him some more for the trophy?
                Trophy wasnt needed. Would have pet doggo anyways lol
    Not just plot armor, game mechanic armor. As soon as I saw you control him in combat with his own menu, I knew he was likely safe.
    Hey, if Torgal died, not only Ultima would be killed, but Square Enix themselves would be in grave peril.
    If they killed torgal the "Clive Wick" memes would be overwhelming and imo ruin the game.
He was going after Mid, because Cid is Clive’s biggest influence. That’s the whole point of the attack on Kanver
    Which didn’t really work well because from the player’s perspective, we barely know Mid.
        We barely know mid but there was a time skip. Clive probs knows mid pretty well since he is using Cid's name
            We’re told she’s important to Clive, but we don’t feel it, since we didn’t see that bond develop. And all our interactions are just running errands for her lol. Maybe it would have worked better if she had appeared before the skip.
                Personally i think the skip was pointless noone aged noone got new outfits and clive getting his brand removed should have been an important story telling piece aswell as meeting mid. 

.. could have had a arch where we was fleeing from kupka and found the hideaway and watched it grow as we completed side quests.
                    Its Also just weird how in 5 years we got NOTHING done but then break all remaining crystals in like a few months at most?
                        Cuz rebuilding a place for runaway bearers takes a long ass time and took priority. They skipped us ahead to a point in time where the hideaway was rebuilt enough for us to be able to focus on the mothercrystals again.

EDIT: Not to mention we didn't go after the second crystal until it made sense from a military perspective (Sanbreque and Dhalmekia were fighting over the Crystalline Dominion so went after the crystal away from all the action) and the third crystal we never intended on going after when we did. Our objective was Kupka and only Kupka. It just so happened that we had to take out that mothercrystal to take out Kupka.
                        Haha that too !
                    Not a NEW outfit, but Clive’s is visibly more weathered after the skip. Not a big change but I found it to be a nice touch when I noticed it.
                        My eye sight didnt see that haha
                            His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
                                He’s also slightly more muscular too.
                    I wouldn't say it was pointless, but it didn't need to be five years. Might have actually been more interesting if it was just a couple years, and Clive was still a little uncertain in his role as Cid.
                I think one single heartfelt scene with Mid would have helped too. Like, let her join in visiting Cids grade, or give her a scene with Clive telling him why she can't go there. Just one genuine moment of comradship between them would have gone a long way.
                    It was Hidden behind sidequests. However i think a scene with mid and Clive at Cid's grave would have been good
                    It was so weird how they talked about visiting the grave and then she just bailed. It could definitely have helped.
                DLC
                This was exactly how I felt about Vivian, just some random new person that I’m supposed to care about but who also isn’t as charismatic or enjoyable as Mid was
                    Vivian is just an exposition dump with a pretty face, barely a character. For better or worse, they never even tried to make her important to the story so it's whatever.
                        Nope not a single bit
            Idk how I feel about using cids name. Otto says he suggested it but doesn't feel natural at all. Most side characters just don't feel connected and that 5 year time skip really didn't help
                It doesn't. Kupka would have still been pissed if they said it was clive who killed him. The objective would have still been cids. Clive the outlaw would have worked.
        The player doesn't really know Mid, but doesn't she call him God Father at some point?  Not sure how Clive would have been assigned that role with Cid not appearing to have done it and with Cid being dead, but that would also make Mid incredibly important to Clive and vice versa.  

Most likely it is implied that Mid was around the hideout the whole time considering she built lots of the gadgets you see around it and Clive must've seen her a lot at the original hideout before they destroyed the 1st mother crystal.  There's also the 5 year gap where Clive could very well have acted much more as a father figure for her.  

Yes we as the player don't know her very well so it doesn't work to randomly have Barnabas kill her or something to get at Clive, but if that were to happen, we'd obviously have gotten more character development for her beforehand so that it'd be more impactful when she gets killed.
            There is one side quest in the original hideout where you give Cid a letter from Mid and it is mentioned there that she is away at school, so I don't think Clive meets her until after the fall of the old hideout.
    Now that I think about it, the boat part is kinda odd, right? I think he was fighting Joshua to go after her, but I’m not really sure why he didn’t do anything. Maybe fighting Clive was the priority?
        It actually came down to Barnabas realizing Ultima was wrong in his order. He makes note that the more they are threatened, the tighter Clive holds on to them.
            Yea killing Joshua or Jill won't break his will but bring him into path of revenge
Except he did try to kill off Jill by forcing Clive to watch her drown. But because he beat her so easily in her Eikon form, he underestimated her resourcefulness to survive. His sheer arrogance, built up over 4 decades of survival on the battlefield and in internal challenges to his rule, is part of his character. People think he was dumb and underutilized, but his whole point is that the empowerment that Ultima offered did not empower him at all. It gave him steroids and immunity to the curse; but his enthrallment impaired his thinking as a result - the one thing that made him such a deadly and unpredictable scourge as he darted in and out of conflicts across all of Storm.

EDIT: He was the 'living' symbol of a man consumed by religious dogma. He played the part of the cultist right down to the t, displaying the writers' personal familiarity with how cultism can change a person to the core. Thats what makes him a great character - and fated to be misunderstood by people who don't have experience on this topic.

That's a pretty good analysis, though I'd also add that Barnabas comes off as a man that is essentially ***broken*** to his core. In the midst of his breakdown, besides being disturbing (cringe depending on who you ask), he gives off this sense of just being so done with the world. Part of it is misanthropy but it also seems to be out of boredom as he states he hasn't had a challenge in decades. Having likely known nothing but fighting his whole life, and likely having seen many horrible things from it, he probably felt like he had nothing to look forward or or enjoy in life. It mirrors how real life cultist might have became who they are via influencing after feeling depressed or detached from the world.
I think not killing anyone close to Clive was smart. Being defeated and beaten up while looking your friends in the face was purposeful. He was trying to break his will. Not motivate him to greater heights. Wear them down. Regardless of what any of them do it's futile.
    "Break his will" Could not have chosen a better statement.
Should have gone full GoT and killed off Clive.


Oh wait.
Tbh i feel joshua relationship was the biggest motivator in the game for Clive. But jill is legit on Joshua heels my assumption.
His dog
    Torgal has that padded armour of being a core combat mechanic for combos. They would never bump off the dog.
        I'm just picturing Joshua taking Torgal's place if he was killed off, and Clive still using the same dialogue to command him.
            Sic em, Joshua
            My wounds boy
                Hey works for Kratos
Well, tbf, they did try to kill all of Storm with the Akashiks and stuff. We just happened to save every single one of our mates. But yeah, it was clumsily executed, they had the potential to add so much more drama, it's kind of a shame.
    >!Not quite all of them. Poor Theo... Also, the Bearers of Lostwing were a tragic loss, although they weighed more heavily on Quinten.!<
        Oh yeah, I forgot our sweet boy Theo, how could I !?

Well yes and not for Quintin, if he had not pushed his vengeance to the end they most likely would've all died during the flood.

But anyway, all these events are important moments where Ultima and Barnabas's did try to sever Clive's connections, but it's entirely absent from your original com.
            Yeah, I was just trying to come up with who might be the most impactful for Clive to lose without needing a major rewrite.
How bout that Mid af side character
Just kill jill, would have made her an actual good character ngl.
    Jill is one of the best characters in the game, and arguably the series.
        No.
I mean mgave. He could have killed gav or mid. I'm glad he didn't tho. I say the real problem for his character is the scene with Ultima in bed. I get that he follows whatever Ultima says but that scene really paints him as submissive rather than a warrior following his god.
    I found that scene weird, but oddly, it worked for me. It shows that Barnabas is sick in the head, his mind twisted and disturbed. This is shown even further by the fact he thinks he is the hero of the story. He's been Akashic this whole time, and whilst he has been able to preserve his age, his looks, and even some of his rationality and emotions such as lust (all likely through the influence of Ultima), it's slowly chipped away at his sanity. Even so, the dude still has more mommy issues than a one-winged angel. 

As for him being submissive, the whole thing with the religion/cult following Ultima is that they believe surrendering their will to Ultima's is ultimate salvation. Ironically, despite doing Ultima's bidding, and as Clive points out to him, Barnabas's will was never truly forfeit, as it was Barnabas's own will that drove him to pursue Clive and the others, and to see his master's vessel be perfected.

That all said, without the tomes and ATL, it isn't portrayed in the best manner, and tha pacing is a bit off. I couldn't use the tomes or ATL on my first run either, thanks to some overlooked spoilers. I learned a lot of this stuff on my NG+ run.
I think, instead of Ultima killing Cid it would have been better for Barnabas killing Cid. That way Clive would have met Barnabas earlier. And we would have a fight with Clive in rage vs Barnabas. And barnabas just owns Clive. This way we would have our main advasery instead of Ultima. They could still put Ultima as the last bossfight but then maybe Barnabass would become ultima or Ultima could still come. But this way Barnabass would really be like the Ardyn or Sephiroth
    Have Ultima pulling the strings behind the scenes Zeromus style.
        Yes something like that. Ultima could still be the last boss but at least Barnabass would have been much more interesting.
I mean, on one hand you're right. On the other, all of Clive's friends were out there by the writers. They could have written in a character who was supposed to die at this point if they wanted to
Well, Ash originally hosted 2 crystals. One was deep in the southern dead lands.
Several nations ? I believe there was but odin/barny took ash many years ago. 

I liked the map for ash though, But that whole defending the towns & kanver ship building and ash/akashic arc felt a bit of a slog, obviously except the horny scene that was fine  lol. 

I feel like sailing to ash quietly and blending in with the locals to break into the castle then confronting odin and seeing everyone turn akashic and managing to rescue more than edda would have been good.
Wait, when did they say Barnabas did the head in a box? I just have missed that dialog 🤔
    It's not outright stated but heavily implied.
We all know cid wouldn't do that, he loved benedikta.
The only ones cruel enough to do that would be Baranabas and Sleipnir.
        Yeah, I thought it would be weird if Cid or Clive did it but since they never said I wasn’t entirely sure. But Sleipnir’s statement after the Titan fight made me think it was maybe one of them.
        Anabella definitely was capable of doing that
            She was, but the fact that Sleipnir specifically mentioned that Kupka died for a woman's head in a box implies he was aware of it.

Granted Kupka could have told him after the fact, but I imagine they had Sleipnir mention it for a reason story telling wise.
                Oh I wasn’t saying she did it I was just saying she was also cruel enough to do so. She also mentioned that Kupka was so easy to manipulate when her and Olivier met with him. She said something along the lines of “all over some common born wh*re”
Honestly I thought someone or maybe Cid just incinerated her off screen to send her ashes to Hugo. Then again that wouldn't make much sense.
That’s my problem with Barny, he is pretty much pigeonholed into not killing Jill and Joshua because he still needs Clive to be at full power for Mr. Mewthos I mean Ultima. Barny and Waloed should’ve been implemented better for the story. 

I will say this, his boss fight kinda redeemed him a little because it was my favorite human boss fight by far as it was a one on one duel and he was giggling with excitement like a madman. That’s the stuff I wanted to see, a bloodthirsty warrior who lives for the fight. However, it was too little too late.
    To sum up barnabas “what is a king to a God”
        And Clive is “what is a God to a nonbeliever”?
    That boss fight desperately needed an all-out eikon fight at the end though. After the phenomenal spectactle which Bahamut delivered (and Titan before him) it was kind of a let down.
He was underutilized story wise and the fight itself made no sense tbh.
He absolutely massacred clive (those fights werent like anywhere near close lol) and then clive gets shiva and suddenly just 1v1s him lol

Definitely the most wasted character. I was kind of hoping for a "i follow ultima up until i betray him for my own plan"-type of thing but in the end nothing came out of it.
        I don't think it necessarily needed an eikon fight. The fight idea and design is overall pretty cool imo it just felt a bit short, especially the last bit. Could have just used a little bit more distinction between phases and could have done the last phase/spectacle at higher than like 10% hp so you actually have to fight his "final form" for a bit.
            It could've been interesting to see the two characters fight to the point of pure exhaustion, then have the final phase be the two of them going at each other without any powers.
        I sorta felt like Odin casting and keeping that barrier up was weakening him a bit, it's shown throughout the game how much of a toll those powers can take on someone after a while. It's also noted that Barnabas was king for an unnaturally long time. Along with the mention that Clive was special for his eikon powers not having negative effects on him. Either way, I did feel the whole ultimate plan reveal was missing something but I enjoyed it all nonetheless.
        That did seem odd to me. The spectacle of the game caps out between Titan and Bahamut and goes downward from there. I like the ending but did wish it had something as big as those fights.
            To be fair, the final fight was pretty damn cool too, it just feels a bit less epic than it actually is because we've done the Ifrit Risen thing already at that point. It would've needed another gimmick I think. Like, say, combining the powers of all the eikons into a final "true" form.
                I thought Ultima was going to have Leviathan so I was hoping for another giant against something giant and cool. I was disappointed in the design but the story part was fine.
                    Yeah.
But when you think about it, there were originally likely 16 mothercrystals (since every crytsal had an instance of Ultima at its heart, and there are 16 instances of Ultima). 8 of them were on the twins, and 8 eikons were originally known there. Since the eikons definitely have some sort of tie to the mothercrystals (although we don't know what that is, sadly), it stands to reason there were originally two eikons of every element (it's also never really explained why there are both Phoenix and Ifrit, beyond the vague allusion to their combined form being the original physical form of Ultima. But which Ultima? The crumbling bodies in the center chamber of Origin all seem to look different in some way).

While that sounds incredibly cool in concept, imagine having to implement 16 playstyles that feel distinct from one another.
            Tbh the last fight was definitely up there but Bahamut was just like watching a DBZ "best of" MAD reel, it was just insanity.
            I think they wanted to make it more of a duel style fight. Think Dante vs Vergil in DMC or Bayonetta vs Jeanne in Bayonetta.
    Him turning into a glowing, cackling fidget spinner version of Zenos was definitely hilarious, I'll say that.
To be honest, I just wished we had more of his "unhinged" persona. When he started to giggle with glee at the prospect of having a worthy opponent, I felt like we got a glimpse of the Warrior King before he... you know.

Like having this guy that gave up his emotions regain some from fighting Clive, just having fun clashing his power vs someone he deemed worthy, sounds like a really cool story beat. With how the entire message of the story goes and all. Like how humans can't really live jusy being empty husk that follow the words of a "God". Cool that we saw that in the heroes side, would had been cooler to see it on the villains side too.
Barnabas should have taken Jill to Waloed (while still having the scene where he cuts the ocean). Granted that we don't get the Jill scene on beach at that moment.

Then Clive has more reason to trek to Waloed. 

They would actually find Jill on the way in a fort and that is when the Jill scene can happen as she wants Clive to be powerful enough to beat Barnabas at that point. 

Barnabas just giving her up in the ocean didn't sit right with me, after all he went through to get her.

But if he forced Jill to give her power (and Clive to take it) out of desperation, then his plan will work. 

Remember the scene where Barnabas creates a barrier. Now imagine the only way to escape that barrier is for Clive to get Jill's powers and that forces their hand (assuming at that point Jill is too weak to fight since she was captive). 

Now Barnabas fight could have had before he reaches the last crystal (in those plains). That would have been large enough place for a Eikon battle too.
    Yes sir.
I know it seems like it (Barnabas just being Ultima's puppet) but Barnabas' character is to show some still choose to follow and believe in Ultima without being actual puppets, Olivier was a true puppet, Barnabas was just faithful to Ultima and believed in him, choosing to serve him
    Actually, they say Barnabas had been Akashic for years. He'd given up his will long before the start of the game, and maybe managed to capture a grasp of it during his last fight, but he was a puppet from the start.
        We should have experienced his will break, in order to understand his motivations and perspective — like literally every other main boss villian. Instead we get manic monologues that make sense, but nobody cares about. Just another “crazy”. Even though literally all other villians also went crazy, but it hits way harder because we deeply understand their descent into madness

Not experiencing the collapse of the population was also weak. Could we not have expanded on that one survivor, into like one last stronghold town that resisted, with a couple main line quests that explores the events that took place rallying the orcs and turning everything akashic? Here’s a thought - made mid’s shit questline a side quest and replace it with this. Or even have the Enterprise run into a fleet of ships fleeing Waloed on the way there, initially thinking theyre enemies (ex Waloean pirates?) but then get more context that way. Have us actually able to walk around the Enterprise joined with another ship as a quest hub. The sidequests would take you into exploring Waloed other than just beelining through the unnecessarily large maps with crappy item pickups.

Dont even get me started on Masamune… the one freaking treasure chest with a weapon, and a cool one at that — has way worse stats that what you probably have equipped. Like why?


Could have also cut out the entire Wade resistance army side arc and replaced it with this tbh. Completely unnecessary. Martha runs the show anyway and can do that on her own, we all know that. 

Then have that stronghold taken over or invaded by orcs, and end it with that dying soldier? 

Like cmon. They didnt even try to have us resonate with the entirety of Ash. Probably my biggest gripe with the game tbh. 

Hope we get more polish after DLC like XV.
            I didn't find masamune until after I had crafted the gotterdammerung. I was so excited and then immediately disappointed.
        No he is not Akashic, Clive compares him to being the same as being Akashic, the difference being Barnabas chose giving up his will and not forced. His people and obviously his mother are the ones that stayed believing in Ultima out of choice and so he kept following their belief
Barney is so weird, I spent most of the game really wanting to know him but when he finally got screen time and I saw his uh, mom thing, my reaction was just “yeah now I wish you stayed mysterious”

Lowkey I kinda liked Sleipnir more, I liked his smug manipulations with Hugo
    Sleipnir was weird too cuz when I saw him knock out Hugo and lift his big ol body over his shoulder with zero effort I thought oh shit who the hell is this? Is he a dominant? But which one? Maybe a secret villain or something. But he just ends up being some kinda clone thing
He succeeded. He ensured Mythos was created. He believed in the teachings of circle of malius.
    But story wise Clive missed still the eight element.
        Well it was known as The Lost for a reason. But I'm like where is the 8th? I kinda don't want them to add dlc now that I finished the story, but at the same time I would love a sequel of the world.
            Yeah but eventually the eight Mothercrystal also belongs to one Ultima, they can easily implement two dlcs that have to happen before origin.

One would be the cut content (probably leviathan or the northern territories. one of them was cut from the main game probably as it wouldn’t fit on one disc altogether
                > wouldn't fit on one disc

You people really need to stop talking about technical stuff when you don't understand how it works.
                    Then may you explain it further? I just referred to one comment from an interview.

From my understanding after compression the size extended the maximum which could be loaded on one disc, so at least for installing reasons they would have to add a second one. 

I asked another commenter about this, because even though I cannot imagine it (especially knowing the prices for a disc) to be the main reason that they cut content because of not fitting everything in one disc, it was the purpose which was mentioned.
                        PS5 discs can hold up to 100GB, but install themselves onto your drive anyways. They are not playing from the disc itself, they are glorified DRM installers. This has been true since PS3 ages, Blu Ray is a slow reading format  you think you'd get barely no loading times otherwise?

Since it's just an installers, this gives devs the potential to compress their data, should they want to. It will make unpacking and install slightly longer, but it's a one time thing. To begin with, devs are being extremely lazy with compression and file sizes and don't optimize their games at all these days, cause they know players can just buy more space.

Has CBU3 really tried FFXVI's size could be cut by half and compressed further, and then decompressed upon install. FF7R is 94GB, and the Intergrade DLC ON IT'S OWN is 81GB. Those are ridiculous sizes relative to the actual content.

SQUEENIX has many ways to tackle this issue, one being learning how to fucking compress, but nah let's just use more discs.
                            Ok but that’s what I meant, after compression it was too big, so they cut content instead of compressing further.

FfVIIR Intergrade has 94.88GB, the Remake 90,81 so Intergrade itself has 4,08GB
        I believe the last crystal sunk into the ocean. However, it is quite possible that it is still active, but then how would primogenesis be cast by Ultima? That's why I love the ending.
            I think Ultima had no other choice than taking Clive as a 7/8 the vessel because of the loss. For me it is the explanation why Clive was not able to wirdhstand ultimata powers after all, he even commented it after absorbing Ultima that his body is too weak
    Not that mythos was created but to not attack other nations, collude with others to ensure Clive destroyed all of the crystals.
Waloed is just too late.

If feels like it's been forgotten and Dev were like "ono we have one last continent to show". Every other country show their cities or villages, Waloed has... 1 and it's nearly empty.

It's a big area you cross one and don't bother with it except the side quests.
This might be a hot take but I personally feel XVI’s story could’ve been split into two parts. The game has so many characters and 4 kingdoms at conflict with each other and an existential threat that they are ignorant of due to all the political squabbling like Game of Thrones that it kinda crumbles under its own weight. 

I hate the Primogenesis shit so much in terms of art direction. I get it, it’s supposed to be the World of Ruin for XVI, however it gets rid of the nice aesthetics of all the different biomes and makes everything all pink and gloomy. I hope a patch comes out to where it goes away after you beat the game.
    I was telling my friend this should have been FF XVI and FF XVI-2. First one should end with CID death and Joshua saving Clive. Expand on Jill country, let us spend more time in Clive early years or as a wyvern. All of this Just went to fast. The 2nd game could make waloed so much better.
        If It were to end with cids death they shouldve at least let us brea 1 or 2 more crystals before the whole última things show Up tbh

Otherwise It wouldve been waay too short imo
    I'm hoping that'll be the DLC, world post ruins
    It's funny the world of ruin is when I started playing in HDR (Got a new monitor) and boy did I think my screen was borked with how pink everything was. Took me longer than I care to admit to realize it wasn't.
    I don't know about splitting two games I personally don't like that shtick, but definitely XVI's later part was markedly worse, the whole Zombie apocalypse vibe was a cool gimmick for a few hours... And then it wasn't when the Zombi--uhh Akashics were literally all that was left to do and deal with in this Pink medieval post apocalypse until the very end of the game which was Atleast a dozen hours away.


It just kinda uglified the game for the past 30-40% of it when that should realistically been the last 15%, preferably post Waloed and felling the final Crystal, it would've made much more sense thematically and also in line with the story itself, as Ultima literally wanted Clive and Co to fell all the crystals and release his different incarnations, the advent of Origin should've brought on Primogenesis by its own. It didn't need to happen with Bahamut. Thematically too the darkness released by slaying Odin (which was also the most lackluster of them all and should've been a far more engrossing - - Dark Souls Four Kings - ike feeling boss battle imho - - could've been a good excuse for Primogenesis being cast.

Idk, I feel like XVI is a very good and well written game for the most of it but it has clear shortcomings near the end. I'm also kinda peeved we didn't get to explore even ONE City and spend 95% of the game in between ruins, greenlands, sands and hamlets. Doesn't need to give us the entire damn City but if XII and XIV managed it I'm sure CBU3 could've found a way.
It did make for quite an atmospheric part, though. Super melancholic
    Yeah, for a time it’s great. But it hurts post-game experience.
Agreed. It's funny that I saw mainstream discussions mocking the game for being too Game of Thrones prior to release, but it actually gets weaker when it goes back into Final Fantasy mode dealing with powerful beings trying to destroy the world. 

I thought the motivation was highest when it was Clive vs Hugo. Even thought the world was ending with Ultima, Hugo felt more important since it was so personal. Where "zomg we need to save the world" just felt more generic and done before.
I thought I read a spoiler somewhere that >!Annabelle fuses with Ultima for POWEEEEERrRrRrR!<. I was lowkey kind of disappointed that wasn't the case.
>Barnabas IS intimidating, mysterious, dark, and all powerful, a king with total control over his people and whose country treats its lower class in unthinkable ways. But the ironic point of Barnabas is despite being the “alpha” dominant, he’s actually the most submissive and spineless of them all. 

Perfectly said. Not sure if it's an unpopular opinion but I actually liked that they made Barnabas differ from what our expectations were. Beforehand we all thought he would be this take shit from nobody kind of guy who is completely in control, which is true in his outer persona, but on the inside he's actually a completely submissive lunatic like you said. It adds a whole different layer to his character. I think one of the great things this game does is take your perceptions of who you think these dominants are and show you that they're actually much more than that (Hugo being a love drunk simp, benedicktas conflict over what she knows is right and wrong, etc). That said I do agree to an extent that Barnabas was somewhat underutilized/could have been expanded on more
Absolute agree. For lack of a better way of putting it, Barnabas being a let down I think is intentional and perfect because as you said, the whole time he’s kinda just a mindless puppet for Ultima of sorts.
His fight kinda was not remarkable , not sure why this waned .
I might be forgetting some stuff, but Clive did at least gain Shiva’s power between the bottom of the sea and top of the tower fights?
Clive gets shivas power….
    Ah yes Shiva, the weakest most underutilized Eikon that gets slapped by Titan right at the start of the game? That one?

Let's just acknowledge it for what it really was - anime plot armor, which FF never really shyed away from, complete with the whole God slaying in the end. If we are going to do power level measuring Clive should've died several times already to enemies much earlier. Ifrit was his plot armor and when it stopped working they just gave him Ifrit Risen plot armor. It's just typical Shonen stuff.
        We have no idea how the shiva vs titan fight ended, could’ve been a draw, a win, whatever.

In that same fight that you early misunderstood you can see how fast shiva is, this is a perfect counter to odins quick slashes.

As mythos, each eikon also strengthens him as a vessel regardless of the eikons individual power, likely increasing his strength.

I don’t think you know what plot armor is my guy.
            We do know it ends with Jill dragged on the floor too beaten and tired to be able to prime again. It's pretty clear Titan had the upper hand throughout. 

She's not nearly that fast and you made up a weird headcannon about how she's a good counter to Odin when Odin literally wiped the floor with her and she ended up captive. She has, in a quite literal sense, ice glass level of defensive ability.

If each Eikon strengthens him, then again, you are fighting against Odin at that point with the power of Ifrit, Phoenix, Titan, Ramuh, and Bahamut combined.
5  Eikons against one and Clive still gets the floor wiped with him. Add Shiva, which has so far proved no exceptional prowess against any other Eikon and suddenly the scales are tipped completely to Clive? Not even a struggle? From getting cut down in one hit and almost dying, had Barny willed it, to completely overpowering him?

Oh I know what plot armor is. You, however, need to do some reading.
                You clearly have no literacy at all, nothing you said proves Titan had any upper hand, we never see kupka, we never see what Jill’s condition was before the fight, we never see the actual conclusion.

“She’s not nearly that fast” someone skipped the prologue, play again and watch the background…

If Odin wiped the floor with Clive, the fuck you think Jill is going to be able to do? Jill using shivas power ≠ Clive using shivas power.

Here’s a very clear and hard to miss power up of Clive during the barnabas fights.

1. Completely loses

2. Fights back with some experience getting a little further and not getting completely cut down

3. Gains shiva and even more experience and eventually wins. 

I don’t know where the fuck your got the no struggle thing from. Might have to replay this too.
                something to keep in mind is that obviously Jill was being mistreated, her health and energy for sure wasn't at her peak at that fight, Hugo didn't have that disadvantage, he's obviously well fed and in good shape.
                    So was Phoenix, arguably in a worse state, it was still able to handle Odin better, and Jill was already healthy at this point. Bahamut too was able to match up to Odin and pushed Waloed back from Storm.

Why do you feel the need to excuse the fact the power scaling in this game is Shonen anime level and only serves to push along the plot? There is no logical power scaling here, it's all spectacle, it's when it gets too egregious like Odin's battle that I feel it has to be pointed out.
    Ahhh... I can't believe I forgot that was after the second defeat and before the final battle. Everything just felt like it happened in such a short period of time.
Sleipnir is a character I don't even understand and is totally unnecesary in my opinion.
    Thats the Guy that was created by barnabas right? Yeah i was excited to fight him but he truned out to litteraly be nobody lol
I feel like the "killing off the girl" trope is a bit overplayed, especially because they just did that with XV.
I don’t consider that scene to be “sexy” but one of the most beautiful emotional expressions of love i have seen in media recently. Other female characters were just “sexy” but Jill is way deeper than that.
    No you are correct. It is incredibly beautiful and powerful and I love it but I just take issue with that scene because of Jill looking completely normal. So I say "sexy" because the devs decided to completely ignore the curse for this scene. Jill spent years in the service of the Ironblood. Implied she was made to prime in multiple battles became such a threat the empire planned her assassination. Then after Cid dies and Clive still can't fully prime it's again implied she is carrying his burden aka priming since he can't. We are constantly being told how the curse works and that Jill needs rest and yada yada then we get to that scene and she is just perfect and sexy. If parts of her were maybe showing signs of the curse it would have hit harder and not just been here is the girl you wanted to see naked the whole game. Uwu
        not only that, 13 years she was under the ironbloods and not even a single small scar could be seen...
            Clive barely has any either
                Yes during the final fight it's implied that the curse does infect Clive because either he is the "perfect" vessel or because of Ultima's influence didn't really make it clear.
                    We’re talking about scars lol
                        Right right mb
    the only problem was there was no trace of the curse on her body.  unless i missed something, it would've been more impactful to me if there were signs of wear and tear of abuse for 5 years
Nah mate, i agree. If he had killed Jill you’d feel something deep towards Barnabas. A true villain, a true challenge, a true problem.

That’s why Sephiroth and Cloud are so iconic, there’s true investment there. But here, after I saw Jill survive and heard the whole ultima spiel I knew that was it for me.
this could've been interesting actually. i love love love jill but this way better than how she ended up sidelined by the end anyways
Fr its not like jill was important to the story after getting Shiva, shes just reduced to love interest (and its not like we get a Happy pay off from It)

Imo if anything we shouldve Gotten the Ash part as the 5 year timeskip instead of after cids death to at least explain how we can beat barnabas, would make more sense than explaining It the way we can rn which is "we got Shiva" Who litteraly didnt get a single win on her own and was Next to useless in her own Big fight
I think instead of being followed up by it I wish they had expanded these cutscenes into actual gameplay sequences. It would had made for quite an interesting take on an eikon fight
    Agreed!
I really was just saying "i dont even know what youre talking about so shut Up already please"
    I love his VA but the fact that he used like 8 sentences to say 1 thing got tiring really quickly.

Other characters (and in XIV) have this issue but Barny was the worst offender (with Ultima being a close second).
At least Odín himself had nice tits ig

We really got nothing else from him lol
His personality very clearly changed in that final fight
>Eventually loses to protagonist because they... Tried extra hard this time/ had IDEALS!

Well, Clive received Shiva's essence in the meantime, not sure how much of a difference it was making but there is that
Press L3+R3 to talk-no-jutsu
I feel like Ultima nor a God figure wasn’t really needed for this kind of story. I felt the first half clearly demonstrated that the problem with Valisthea is the cruel rulers and their lust for control and power. Then Ultima comes in and starts pulling a Littlefinger behind the scenes by pitting the kingdoms against each other and Clive. Just like Game of Thrones, I massively prefer the human conflict between all the kingdoms rather than the inhuman existential threat that wants to wipe out humanity because we suck to them.
    This is due to Japanese cultural differences to the west when it comes to what gods are and what they represent, you notice in almost every JRPG, in FFXVI's case Ultima literally represents the aspect of Valisthea's Sociery Cid and later Clive fought, that some people are just considered born beneath others and have to serve those above them
    Ultima was definitely needed especially when the game is about trying to escape fate and how hard it is whether it be an institution or choices and circumstance.
    Exactly, you worded it better than I did. The first hours teased everything being like game of thrones, but in the end it wasn’t like that. And that’s the point, the human conflict is what is interesting not the conflict between innocent individuals and some supernatural threat, even in a fantasy world.
Yeah prior to the game coming out I was sure Torgal would be killed off. I was pleasantly surprised he wasn’t.
    I was furious when Benedikta 'killed' him screaming "F\*\*\*ing Dog!".  
It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.
        I knew instantly there was no way torgal was dead
        
>It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.

There's a few good moments like this.  The first combat after you unlock the limit break is with the assholes who massacred Eastpool, so I popped it immediately just on principle
    I knew Torgal was safe when he ewas the only one given Gameplay mechanics. I honestly thought Jill would die, and that would lead Clive to becoming heroically suicidal during the final act (IE he's willing to do anything to stop Ultima/Baranabas and the others need to reign him back in)

The story sorta tries to do this anyways, but it comes off as a lil hokey cuz Clive has always been like this... Everyone being like "why you trying to do everything alone?" like bruh Clive has been doing that for five years, you know how he is already, stfu.
Plot armor, goodest boy has dog armor. If they killed Torgal we would riot as SE head quarters until its patched.
    Too true. The minute torgal was introduced was the moment i whispered under my breath, "if sqex kills off my fluffy puppy, i riot" 

Then i went to cuddle my own dog because the thought made me sad.
        The end when he is howling broke me 😭
        And then you cuddled him some more for the trophy?
            Trophy wasnt needed. Would have pet doggo anyways lol
Not just plot armor, game mechanic armor. As soon as I saw you control him in combat with his own menu, I knew he was likely safe.
Hey, if Torgal died, not only Ultima would be killed, but Square Enix themselves would be in grave peril.
If they killed torgal the "Clive Wick" memes would be overwhelming and imo ruin the game.
Which didn’t really work well because from the player’s perspective, we barely know Mid.
    We barely know mid but there was a time skip. Clive probs knows mid pretty well since he is using Cid's name
        We’re told she’s important to Clive, but we don’t feel it, since we didn’t see that bond develop. And all our interactions are just running errands for her lol. Maybe it would have worked better if she had appeared before the skip.
            Personally i think the skip was pointless noone aged noone got new outfits and clive getting his brand removed should have been an important story telling piece aswell as meeting mid. 

.. could have had a arch where we was fleeing from kupka and found the hideaway and watched it grow as we completed side quests.
                Its Also just weird how in 5 years we got NOTHING done but then break all remaining crystals in like a few months at most?
                    Cuz rebuilding a place for runaway bearers takes a long ass time and took priority. They skipped us ahead to a point in time where the hideaway was rebuilt enough for us to be able to focus on the mothercrystals again.

EDIT: Not to mention we didn't go after the second crystal until it made sense from a military perspective (Sanbreque and Dhalmekia were fighting over the Crystalline Dominion so went after the crystal away from all the action) and the third crystal we never intended on going after when we did. Our objective was Kupka and only Kupka. It just so happened that we had to take out that mothercrystal to take out Kupka.
                    Haha that too !
                Not a NEW outfit, but Clive’s is visibly more weathered after the skip. Not a big change but I found it to be a nice touch when I noticed it.
                    My eye sight didnt see that haha
                        His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
                            He’s also slightly more muscular too.
                I wouldn't say it was pointless, but it didn't need to be five years. Might have actually been more interesting if it was just a couple years, and Clive was still a little uncertain in his role as Cid.
            I think one single heartfelt scene with Mid would have helped too. Like, let her join in visiting Cids grade, or give her a scene with Clive telling him why she can't go there. Just one genuine moment of comradship between them would have gone a long way.
                It was Hidden behind sidequests. However i think a scene with mid and Clive at Cid's grave would have been good
                It was so weird how they talked about visiting the grave and then she just bailed. It could definitely have helped.
            DLC
            This was exactly how I felt about Vivian, just some random new person that I’m supposed to care about but who also isn’t as charismatic or enjoyable as Mid was
                Vivian is just an exposition dump with a pretty face, barely a character. For better or worse, they never even tried to make her important to the story so it's whatever.
                    Nope not a single bit
        Idk how I feel about using cids name. Otto says he suggested it but doesn't feel natural at all. Most side characters just don't feel connected and that 5 year time skip really didn't help
            It doesn't. Kupka would have still been pissed if they said it was clive who killed him. The objective would have still been cids. Clive the outlaw would have worked.
    The player doesn't really know Mid, but doesn't she call him God Father at some point?  Not sure how Clive would have been assigned that role with Cid not appearing to have done it and with Cid being dead, but that would also make Mid incredibly important to Clive and vice versa.  

Most likely it is implied that Mid was around the hideout the whole time considering she built lots of the gadgets you see around it and Clive must've seen her a lot at the original hideout before they destroyed the 1st mother crystal.  There's also the 5 year gap where Clive could very well have acted much more as a father figure for her.  

Yes we as the player don't know her very well so it doesn't work to randomly have Barnabas kill her or something to get at Clive, but if that were to happen, we'd obviously have gotten more character development for her beforehand so that it'd be more impactful when she gets killed.
        There is one side quest in the original hideout where you give Cid a letter from Mid and it is mentioned there that she is away at school, so I don't think Clive meets her until after the fall of the old hideout.
Now that I think about it, the boat part is kinda odd, right? I think he was fighting Joshua to go after her, but I’m not really sure why he didn’t do anything. Maybe fighting Clive was the priority?
    It actually came down to Barnabas realizing Ultima was wrong in his order. He makes note that the more they are threatened, the tighter Clive holds on to them.
        Yea killing Joshua or Jill won't break his will but bring him into path of revenge
>EDIT: He was the 'living' symbol of a man consumed by religious dogma. He played the part of the cultist right down to the t, displaying the writers' personal familiarity with how cultism can change a person to the core. Thats what makes him a great character - and fated to be misunderstood by people who don't have experience on this topic.

That's a pretty good analysis, though I'd also add that Barnabas comes off as a man that is essentially ***broken*** to his core. In the midst of his breakdown, besides being disturbing (cringe depending on who you ask), he gives off this sense of just being so done with the world. Part of it is misanthropy but it also seems to be out of boredom as he states he hasn't had a challenge in decades. Having likely known nothing but fighting his whole life, and likely having seen many horrible things from it, he probably felt like he had nothing to look forward or or enjoy in life. It mirrors how real life cultist might have became who they are via influencing after feeling depressed or detached from the world.
"Break his will" Could not have chosen a better statement.
Torgal has that padded armour of being a core combat mechanic for combos. They would never bump off the dog.
    I'm just picturing Joshua taking Torgal's place if he was killed off, and Clive still using the same dialogue to command him.
        Sic em, Joshua
        My wounds boy
            Hey works for Kratos
>!Not quite all of them. Poor Theo... Also, the Bearers of Lostwing were a tragic loss, although they weighed more heavily on Quinten.!<
    Oh yeah, I forgot our sweet boy Theo, how could I !?

Well yes and not for Quintin, if he had not pushed his vengeance to the end they most likely would've all died during the flood.

But anyway, all these events are important moments where Ultima and Barnabas's did try to sever Clive's connections, but it's entirely absent from your original com.
        Yeah, I was just trying to come up with who might be the most impactful for Clive to lose without needing a major rewrite.
Jill is one of the best characters in the game, and arguably the series.
    No.
I found that scene weird, but oddly, it worked for me. It shows that Barnabas is sick in the head, his mind twisted and disturbed. This is shown even further by the fact he thinks he is the hero of the story. He's been Akashic this whole time, and whilst he has been able to preserve his age, his looks, and even some of his rationality and emotions such as lust (all likely through the influence of Ultima), it's slowly chipped away at his sanity. Even so, the dude still has more mommy issues than a one-winged angel. 

As for him being submissive, the whole thing with the religion/cult following Ultima is that they believe surrendering their will to Ultima's is ultimate salvation. Ironically, despite doing Ultima's bidding, and as Clive points out to him, Barnabas's will was never truly forfeit, as it was Barnabas's own will that drove him to pursue Clive and the others, and to see his master's vessel be perfected.

That all said, without the tomes and ATL, it isn't portrayed in the best manner, and tha pacing is a bit off. I couldn't use the tomes or ATL on my first run either, thanks to some overlooked spoilers. I learned a lot of this stuff on my NG+ run.
Have Ultima pulling the strings behind the scenes Zeromus style.
    Yes something like that. Ultima could still be the last boss but at least Barnabass would have been much more interesting.
It's not outright stated but heavily implied.
We all know cid wouldn't do that, he loved benedikta.
The only ones cruel enough to do that would be Baranabas and Sleipnir.
    Yeah, I thought it would be weird if Cid or Clive did it but since they never said I wasn’t entirely sure. But Sleipnir’s statement after the Titan fight made me think it was maybe one of them.
    Anabella definitely was capable of doing that
        She was, but the fact that Sleipnir specifically mentioned that Kupka died for a woman's head in a box implies he was aware of it.

Granted Kupka could have told him after the fact, but I imagine they had Sleipnir mention it for a reason story telling wise.
            Oh I wasn’t saying she did it I was just saying she was also cruel enough to do so. She also mentioned that Kupka was so easy to manipulate when her and Olivier met with him. She said something along the lines of “all over some common born wh*re”
To sum up barnabas “what is a king to a God”
    And Clive is “what is a God to a nonbeliever”?
That boss fight desperately needed an all-out eikon fight at the end though. After the phenomenal spectactle which Bahamut delivered (and Titan before him) it was kind of a let down.
He was underutilized story wise and the fight itself made no sense tbh.
He absolutely massacred clive (those fights werent like anywhere near close lol) and then clive gets shiva and suddenly just 1v1s him lol

Definitely the most wasted character. I was kind of hoping for a "i follow ultima up until i betray him for my own plan"-type of thing but in the end nothing came out of it.
    I don't think it necessarily needed an eikon fight. The fight idea and design is overall pretty cool imo it just felt a bit short, especially the last bit. Could have just used a little bit more distinction between phases and could have done the last phase/spectacle at higher than like 10% hp so you actually have to fight his "final form" for a bit.
        It could've been interesting to see the two characters fight to the point of pure exhaustion, then have the final phase be the two of them going at each other without any powers.
    I sorta felt like Odin casting and keeping that barrier up was weakening him a bit, it's shown throughout the game how much of a toll those powers can take on someone after a while. It's also noted that Barnabas was king for an unnaturally long time. Along with the mention that Clive was special for his eikon powers not having negative effects on him. Either way, I did feel the whole ultimate plan reveal was missing something but I enjoyed it all nonetheless.
    That did seem odd to me. The spectacle of the game caps out between Titan and Bahamut and goes downward from there. I like the ending but did wish it had something as big as those fights.
        To be fair, the final fight was pretty damn cool too, it just feels a bit less epic than it actually is because we've done the Ifrit Risen thing already at that point. It would've needed another gimmick I think. Like, say, combining the powers of all the eikons into a final "true" form.
            I thought Ultima was going to have Leviathan so I was hoping for another giant against something giant and cool. I was disappointed in the design but the story part was fine.
                Yeah.
But when you think about it, there were originally likely 16 mothercrystals (since every crytsal had an instance of Ultima at its heart, and there are 16 instances of Ultima). 8 of them were on the twins, and 8 eikons were originally known there. Since the eikons definitely have some sort of tie to the mothercrystals (although we don't know what that is, sadly), it stands to reason there were originally two eikons of every element (it's also never really explained why there are both Phoenix and Ifrit, beyond the vague allusion to their combined form being the original physical form of Ultima. But which Ultima? The crumbling bodies in the center chamber of Origin all seem to look different in some way).

While that sounds incredibly cool in concept, imagine having to implement 16 playstyles that feel distinct from one another.
        Tbh the last fight was definitely up there but Bahamut was just like watching a DBZ "best of" MAD reel, it was just insanity.
        I think they wanted to make it more of a duel style fight. Think Dante vs Vergil in DMC or Bayonetta vs Jeanne in Bayonetta.
Him turning into a glowing, cackling fidget spinner version of Zenos was definitely hilarious, I'll say that.
Yes sir.
Actually, they say Barnabas had been Akashic for years. He'd given up his will long before the start of the game, and maybe managed to capture a grasp of it during his last fight, but he was a puppet from the start.
    We should have experienced his will break, in order to understand his motivations and perspective — like literally every other main boss villian. Instead we get manic monologues that make sense, but nobody cares about. Just another “crazy”. Even though literally all other villians also went crazy, but it hits way harder because we deeply understand their descent into madness

Not experiencing the collapse of the population was also weak. Could we not have expanded on that one survivor, into like one last stronghold town that resisted, with a couple main line quests that explores the events that took place rallying the orcs and turning everything akashic? Here’s a thought - made mid’s shit questline a side quest and replace it with this. Or even have the Enterprise run into a fleet of ships fleeing Waloed on the way there, initially thinking theyre enemies (ex Waloean pirates?) but then get more context that way. Have us actually able to walk around the Enterprise joined with another ship as a quest hub. The sidequests would take you into exploring Waloed other than just beelining through the unnecessarily large maps with crappy item pickups.

Dont even get me started on Masamune… the one freaking treasure chest with a weapon, and a cool one at that — has way worse stats that what you probably have equipped. Like why?


Could have also cut out the entire Wade resistance army side arc and replaced it with this tbh. Completely unnecessary. Martha runs the show anyway and can do that on her own, we all know that. 

Then have that stronghold taken over or invaded by orcs, and end it with that dying soldier? 

Like cmon. They didnt even try to have us resonate with the entirety of Ash. Probably my biggest gripe with the game tbh. 

Hope we get more polish after DLC like XV.
        I didn't find masamune until after I had crafted the gotterdammerung. I was so excited and then immediately disappointed.
    No he is not Akashic, Clive compares him to being the same as being Akashic, the difference being Barnabas chose giving up his will and not forced. His people and obviously his mother are the ones that stayed believing in Ultima out of choice and so he kept following their belief
Sleipnir was weird too cuz when I saw him knock out Hugo and lift his big ol body over his shoulder with zero effort I thought oh shit who the hell is this? Is he a dominant? But which one? Maybe a secret villain or something. But he just ends up being some kinda clone thing
But story wise Clive missed still the eight element.
    Well it was known as The Lost for a reason. But I'm like where is the 8th? I kinda don't want them to add dlc now that I finished the story, but at the same time I would love a sequel of the world.
        Yeah but eventually the eight Mothercrystal also belongs to one Ultima, they can easily implement two dlcs that have to happen before origin.

One would be the cut content (probably leviathan or the northern territories. one of them was cut from the main game probably as it wouldn’t fit on one disc altogether
            > wouldn't fit on one disc

You people really need to stop talking about technical stuff when you don't understand how it works.
                Then may you explain it further? I just referred to one comment from an interview.

From my understanding after compression the size extended the maximum which could be loaded on one disc, so at least for installing reasons they would have to add a second one. 

I asked another commenter about this, because even though I cannot imagine it (especially knowing the prices for a disc) to be the main reason that they cut content because of not fitting everything in one disc, it was the purpose which was mentioned.
                    PS5 discs can hold up to 100GB, but install themselves onto your drive anyways. They are not playing from the disc itself, they are glorified DRM installers. This has been true since PS3 ages, Blu Ray is a slow reading format  you think you'd get barely no loading times otherwise?

Since it's just an installers, this gives devs the potential to compress their data, should they want to. It will make unpacking and install slightly longer, but it's a one time thing. To begin with, devs are being extremely lazy with compression and file sizes and don't optimize their games at all these days, cause they know players can just buy more space.

Has CBU3 really tried FFXVI's size could be cut by half and compressed further, and then decompressed upon install. FF7R is 94GB, and the Intergrade DLC ON IT'S OWN is 81GB. Those are ridiculous sizes relative to the actual content.

SQUEENIX has many ways to tackle this issue, one being learning how to fucking compress, but nah let's just use more discs.
                        Ok but that’s what I meant, after compression it was too big, so they cut content instead of compressing further.

FfVIIR Intergrade has 94.88GB, the Remake 90,81 so Intergrade itself has 4,08GB
    I believe the last crystal sunk into the ocean. However, it is quite possible that it is still active, but then how would primogenesis be cast by Ultima? That's why I love the ending.
        I think Ultima had no other choice than taking Clive as a 7/8 the vessel because of the loss. For me it is the explanation why Clive was not able to wirdhstand ultimata powers after all, he even commented it after absorbing Ultima that his body is too weak
Not that mythos was created but to not attack other nations, collude with others to ensure Clive destroyed all of the crystals.
I was telling my friend this should have been FF XVI and FF XVI-2. First one should end with CID death and Joshua saving Clive. Expand on Jill country, let us spend more time in Clive early years or as a wyvern. All of this Just went to fast. The 2nd game could make waloed so much better.
    If It were to end with cids death they shouldve at least let us brea 1 or 2 more crystals before the whole última things show Up tbh

Otherwise It wouldve been waay too short imo
I'm hoping that'll be the DLC, world post ruins
It's funny the world of ruin is when I started playing in HDR (Got a new monitor) and boy did I think my screen was borked with how pink everything was. Took me longer than I care to admit to realize it wasn't.
I don't know about splitting two games I personally don't like that shtick, but definitely XVI's later part was markedly worse, the whole Zombie apocalypse vibe was a cool gimmick for a few hours... And then it wasn't when the Zombi--uhh Akashics were literally all that was left to do and deal with in this Pink medieval post apocalypse until the very end of the game which was Atleast a dozen hours away.


It just kinda uglified the game for the past 30-40% of it when that should realistically been the last 15%, preferably post Waloed and felling the final Crystal, it would've made much more sense thematically and also in line with the story itself, as Ultima literally wanted Clive and Co to fell all the crystals and release his different incarnations, the advent of Origin should've brought on Primogenesis by its own. It didn't need to happen with Bahamut. Thematically too the darkness released by slaying Odin (which was also the most lackluster of them all and should've been a far more engrossing - - Dark Souls Four Kings - ike feeling boss battle imho - - could've been a good excuse for Primogenesis being cast.

Idk, I feel like XVI is a very good and well written game for the most of it but it has clear shortcomings near the end. I'm also kinda peeved we didn't get to explore even ONE City and spend 95% of the game in between ruins, greenlands, sands and hamlets. Doesn't need to give us the entire damn City but if XII and XIV managed it I'm sure CBU3 could've found a way.
Yeah, for a time it’s great. But it hurts post-game experience.
Ah yes Shiva, the weakest most underutilized Eikon that gets slapped by Titan right at the start of the game? That one?

Let's just acknowledge it for what it really was - anime plot armor, which FF never really shyed away from, complete with the whole God slaying in the end. If we are going to do power level measuring Clive should've died several times already to enemies much earlier. Ifrit was his plot armor and when it stopped working they just gave him Ifrit Risen plot armor. It's just typical Shonen stuff.
    We have no idea how the shiva vs titan fight ended, could’ve been a draw, a win, whatever.

In that same fight that you early misunderstood you can see how fast shiva is, this is a perfect counter to odins quick slashes.

As mythos, each eikon also strengthens him as a vessel regardless of the eikons individual power, likely increasing his strength.

I don’t think you know what plot armor is my guy.
        We do know it ends with Jill dragged on the floor too beaten and tired to be able to prime again. It's pretty clear Titan had the upper hand throughout. 

She's not nearly that fast and you made up a weird headcannon about how she's a good counter to Odin when Odin literally wiped the floor with her and she ended up captive. She has, in a quite literal sense, ice glass level of defensive ability.

If each Eikon strengthens him, then again, you are fighting against Odin at that point with the power of Ifrit, Phoenix, Titan, Ramuh, and Bahamut combined.
5  Eikons against one and Clive still gets the floor wiped with him. Add Shiva, which has so far proved no exceptional prowess against any other Eikon and suddenly the scales are tipped completely to Clive? Not even a struggle? From getting cut down in one hit and almost dying, had Barny willed it, to completely overpowering him?

Oh I know what plot armor is. You, however, need to do some reading.
            You clearly have no literacy at all, nothing you said proves Titan had any upper hand, we never see kupka, we never see what Jill’s condition was before the fight, we never see the actual conclusion.

“She’s not nearly that fast” someone skipped the prologue, play again and watch the background…

If Odin wiped the floor with Clive, the fuck you think Jill is going to be able to do? Jill using shivas power ≠ Clive using shivas power.

Here’s a very clear and hard to miss power up of Clive during the barnabas fights.

1. Completely loses

2. Fights back with some experience getting a little further and not getting completely cut down

3. Gains shiva and even more experience and eventually wins. 

I don’t know where the fuck your got the no struggle thing from. Might have to replay this too.
            something to keep in mind is that obviously Jill was being mistreated, her health and energy for sure wasn't at her peak at that fight, Hugo didn't have that disadvantage, he's obviously well fed and in good shape.
                So was Phoenix, arguably in a worse state, it was still able to handle Odin better, and Jill was already healthy at this point. Bahamut too was able to match up to Odin and pushed Waloed back from Storm.

Why do you feel the need to excuse the fact the power scaling in this game is Shonen anime level and only serves to push along the plot? There is no logical power scaling here, it's all spectacle, it's when it gets too egregious like Odin's battle that I feel it has to be pointed out.
Ahhh... I can't believe I forgot that was after the second defeat and before the final battle. Everything just felt like it happened in such a short period of time.
Thats the Guy that was created by barnabas right? Yeah i was excited to fight him but he truned out to litteraly be nobody lol
No you are correct. It is incredibly beautiful and powerful and I love it but I just take issue with that scene because of Jill looking completely normal. So I say "sexy" because the devs decided to completely ignore the curse for this scene. Jill spent years in the service of the Ironblood. Implied she was made to prime in multiple battles became such a threat the empire planned her assassination. Then after Cid dies and Clive still can't fully prime it's again implied she is carrying his burden aka priming since he can't. We are constantly being told how the curse works and that Jill needs rest and yada yada then we get to that scene and she is just perfect and sexy. If parts of her were maybe showing signs of the curse it would have hit harder and not just been here is the girl you wanted to see naked the whole game. Uwu
    not only that, 13 years she was under the ironbloods and not even a single small scar could be seen...
        Clive barely has any either
            Yes during the final fight it's implied that the curse does infect Clive because either he is the "perfect" vessel or because of Ultima's influence didn't really make it clear.
                We’re talking about scars lol
                    Right right mb
the only problem was there was no trace of the curse on her body.  unless i missed something, it would've been more impactful to me if there were signs of wear and tear of abuse for 5 years
Agreed!
I love his VA but the fact that he used like 8 sentences to say 1 thing got tiring really quickly.

Other characters (and in XIV) have this issue but Barny was the worst offender (with Ultima being a close second).
This is due to Japanese cultural differences to the west when it comes to what gods are and what they represent, you notice in almost every JRPG, in FFXVI's case Ultima literally represents the aspect of Valisthea's Sociery Cid and later Clive fought, that some people are just considered born beneath others and have to serve those above them
Ultima was definitely needed especially when the game is about trying to escape fate and how hard it is whether it be an institution or choices and circumstance.
Exactly, you worded it better than I did. The first hours teased everything being like game of thrones, but in the end it wasn’t like that. And that’s the point, the human conflict is what is interesting not the conflict between innocent individuals and some supernatural threat, even in a fantasy world.
I was furious when Benedikta 'killed' him screaming "F\*\*\*ing Dog!".  
It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.
    I knew instantly there was no way torgal was dead
    
>It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.

There's a few good moments like this.  The first combat after you unlock the limit break is with the assholes who massacred Eastpool, so I popped it immediately just on principle
I knew Torgal was safe when he ewas the only one given Gameplay mechanics. I honestly thought Jill would die, and that would lead Clive to becoming heroically suicidal during the final act (IE he's willing to do anything to stop Ultima/Baranabas and the others need to reign him back in)

The story sorta tries to do this anyways, but it comes off as a lil hokey cuz Clive has always been like this... Everyone being like "why you trying to do everything alone?" like bruh Clive has been doing that for five years, you know how he is already, stfu.
Too true. The minute torgal was introduced was the moment i whispered under my breath, "if sqex kills off my fluffy puppy, i riot" 

Then i went to cuddle my own dog because the thought made me sad.
    The end when he is howling broke me 😭
    And then you cuddled him some more for the trophy?
        Trophy wasnt needed. Would have pet doggo anyways lol
We barely know mid but there was a time skip. Clive probs knows mid pretty well since he is using Cid's name
    We’re told she’s important to Clive, but we don’t feel it, since we didn’t see that bond develop. And all our interactions are just running errands for her lol. Maybe it would have worked better if she had appeared before the skip.
        Personally i think the skip was pointless noone aged noone got new outfits and clive getting his brand removed should have been an important story telling piece aswell as meeting mid. 

.. could have had a arch where we was fleeing from kupka and found the hideaway and watched it grow as we completed side quests.
            Its Also just weird how in 5 years we got NOTHING done but then break all remaining crystals in like a few months at most?
                Cuz rebuilding a place for runaway bearers takes a long ass time and took priority. They skipped us ahead to a point in time where the hideaway was rebuilt enough for us to be able to focus on the mothercrystals again.

EDIT: Not to mention we didn't go after the second crystal until it made sense from a military perspective (Sanbreque and Dhalmekia were fighting over the Crystalline Dominion so went after the crystal away from all the action) and the third crystal we never intended on going after when we did. Our objective was Kupka and only Kupka. It just so happened that we had to take out that mothercrystal to take out Kupka.
                Haha that too !
            Not a NEW outfit, but Clive’s is visibly more weathered after the skip. Not a big change but I found it to be a nice touch when I noticed it.
                My eye sight didnt see that haha
                    His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
                        He’s also slightly more muscular too.
            I wouldn't say it was pointless, but it didn't need to be five years. Might have actually been more interesting if it was just a couple years, and Clive was still a little uncertain in his role as Cid.
        I think one single heartfelt scene with Mid would have helped too. Like, let her join in visiting Cids grade, or give her a scene with Clive telling him why she can't go there. Just one genuine moment of comradship between them would have gone a long way.
            It was Hidden behind sidequests. However i think a scene with mid and Clive at Cid's grave would have been good
            It was so weird how they talked about visiting the grave and then she just bailed. It could definitely have helped.
        DLC
        This was exactly how I felt about Vivian, just some random new person that I’m supposed to care about but who also isn’t as charismatic or enjoyable as Mid was
            Vivian is just an exposition dump with a pretty face, barely a character. For better or worse, they never even tried to make her important to the story so it's whatever.
                Nope not a single bit
    Idk how I feel about using cids name. Otto says he suggested it but doesn't feel natural at all. Most side characters just don't feel connected and that 5 year time skip really didn't help
        It doesn't. Kupka would have still been pissed if they said it was clive who killed him. The objective would have still been cids. Clive the outlaw would have worked.
The player doesn't really know Mid, but doesn't she call him God Father at some point?  Not sure how Clive would have been assigned that role with Cid not appearing to have done it and with Cid being dead, but that would also make Mid incredibly important to Clive and vice versa.  

Most likely it is implied that Mid was around the hideout the whole time considering she built lots of the gadgets you see around it and Clive must've seen her a lot at the original hideout before they destroyed the 1st mother crystal.  There's also the 5 year gap where Clive could very well have acted much more as a father figure for her.  

Yes we as the player don't know her very well so it doesn't work to randomly have Barnabas kill her or something to get at Clive, but if that were to happen, we'd obviously have gotten more character development for her beforehand so that it'd be more impactful when she gets killed.
    There is one side quest in the original hideout where you give Cid a letter from Mid and it is mentioned there that she is away at school, so I don't think Clive meets her until after the fall of the old hideout.
It actually came down to Barnabas realizing Ultima was wrong in his order. He makes note that the more they are threatened, the tighter Clive holds on to them.
    Yea killing Joshua or Jill won't break his will but bring him into path of revenge
I'm just picturing Joshua taking Torgal's place if he was killed off, and Clive still using the same dialogue to command him.
    Sic em, Joshua
    My wounds boy
        Hey works for Kratos
Oh yeah, I forgot our sweet boy Theo, how could I !?

Well yes and not for Quintin, if he had not pushed his vengeance to the end they most likely would've all died during the flood.

But anyway, all these events are important moments where Ultima and Barnabas's did try to sever Clive's connections, but it's entirely absent from your original com.
    Yeah, I was just trying to come up with who might be the most impactful for Clive to lose without needing a major rewrite.
No.
Yes something like that. Ultima could still be the last boss but at least Barnabass would have been much more interesting.
Yeah, I thought it would be weird if Cid or Clive did it but since they never said I wasn’t entirely sure. But Sleipnir’s statement after the Titan fight made me think it was maybe one of them.
Anabella definitely was capable of doing that
    She was, but the fact that Sleipnir specifically mentioned that Kupka died for a woman's head in a box implies he was aware of it.

Granted Kupka could have told him after the fact, but I imagine they had Sleipnir mention it for a reason story telling wise.
        Oh I wasn’t saying she did it I was just saying she was also cruel enough to do so. She also mentioned that Kupka was so easy to manipulate when her and Olivier met with him. She said something along the lines of “all over some common born wh*re”
And Clive is “what is a God to a nonbeliever”?
I don't think it necessarily needed an eikon fight. The fight idea and design is overall pretty cool imo it just felt a bit short, especially the last bit. Could have just used a little bit more distinction between phases and could have done the last phase/spectacle at higher than like 10% hp so you actually have to fight his "final form" for a bit.
    It could've been interesting to see the two characters fight to the point of pure exhaustion, then have the final phase be the two of them going at each other without any powers.
I sorta felt like Odin casting and keeping that barrier up was weakening him a bit, it's shown throughout the game how much of a toll those powers can take on someone after a while. It's also noted that Barnabas was king for an unnaturally long time. Along with the mention that Clive was special for his eikon powers not having negative effects on him. Either way, I did feel the whole ultimate plan reveal was missing something but I enjoyed it all nonetheless.
That did seem odd to me. The spectacle of the game caps out between Titan and Bahamut and goes downward from there. I like the ending but did wish it had something as big as those fights.
    To be fair, the final fight was pretty damn cool too, it just feels a bit less epic than it actually is because we've done the Ifrit Risen thing already at that point. It would've needed another gimmick I think. Like, say, combining the powers of all the eikons into a final "true" form.
        I thought Ultima was going to have Leviathan so I was hoping for another giant against something giant and cool. I was disappointed in the design but the story part was fine.
            Yeah.

But which Ultima? The crumbling bodies in the center chamber of Origin all seem to look different in some way).

While that sounds incredibly cool in concept, imagine having to implement 16 playstyles that feel distinct from one another.
    Tbh the last fight was definitely up there but Bahamut was just like watching a DBZ "best of" MAD reel, it was just insanity.
    I think they wanted to make it more of a duel style fight. Think Dante vs Vergil in DMC or Bayonetta vs Jeanne in Bayonetta.
We should have experienced his will break, in order to understand his motivations and perspective — like literally every other main boss villian. Instead we get manic monologues that make sense, but nobody cares about. Just another “crazy”. Even though literally all other villians also went crazy, but it hits way harder because we deeply understand their descent into madness

Not experiencing the collapse of the population was also weak. Could we not have expanded on that one survivor, into like one last stronghold town that resisted, with a couple main line quests that explores the events that took place rallying the orcs and turning everything akashic? Here’s a thought - made mid’s shit questline a side quest and replace it with this. Or even have the Enterprise run into a fleet of ships fleeing Waloed on the way there, initially thinking theyre enemies (ex Waloean pirates?) but then get more context that way. Have us actually able to walk around the Enterprise joined with another ship as a quest hub. The sidequests would take you into exploring Waloed other than just beelining through the unnecessarily large maps with crappy item pickups.

Dont even get me started on Masamune… the one freaking treasure chest with a weapon, and a cool one at that — has way worse stats that what you probably have equipped. Like why?


Could have also cut out the entire Wade resistance army side arc and replaced it with this tbh. Completely unnecessary. Martha runs the show anyway and can do that on her own, we all know that. 

Then have that stronghold taken over or invaded by orcs, and end it with that dying soldier? 

Like cmon. They didnt even try to have us resonate with the entirety of Ash. Probably my biggest gripe with the game tbh. 

Hope we get more polish after DLC like XV.
    I didn't find masamune until after I had crafted the gotterdammerung. I was so excited and then immediately disappointed.
No he is not Akashic, Clive compares him to being the same as being Akashic, the difference being Barnabas chose giving up his will and not forced. His people and obviously his mother are the ones that stayed believing in Ultima out of choice and so he kept following their belief
Well it was known as The Lost for a reason. But I'm like where is the 8th? I kinda don't want them to add dlc now that I finished the story, but at the same time I would love a sequel of the world.
    Yeah but eventually the eight Mothercrystal also belongs to one Ultima, they can easily implement two dlcs that have to happen before origin.

One would be the cut content (probably leviathan or the northern territories. one of them was cut from the main game probably as it wouldn’t fit on one disc altogether
        > wouldn't fit on one disc

You people really need to stop talking about technical stuff when you don't understand how it works.
            Then may you explain it further? I just referred to one comment from an interview.

From my understanding after compression the size extended the maximum which could be loaded on one disc, so at least for installing reasons they would have to add a second one. 

I asked another commenter about this, because even though I cannot imagine it (especially knowing the prices for a disc) to be the main reason that they cut content because of not fitting everything in one disc, it was the purpose which was mentioned.
                PS5 discs can hold up to 100GB, but install themselves onto your drive anyways. They are not playing from the disc itself, they are glorified DRM installers. This has been true since PS3 ages, Blu Ray is a slow reading format  you think you'd get barely no loading times otherwise?

Since it's just an installers, this gives devs the potential to compress their data, should they want to. It will make unpacking and install slightly longer, but it's a one time thing. To begin with, devs are being extremely lazy with compression and file sizes and don't optimize their games at all these days, cause they know players can just buy more space.

Has CBU3 really tried FFXVI's size could be cut by half and compressed further, and then decompressed upon install. FF7R is 94GB, and the Intergrade DLC ON IT'S OWN is 81GB. Those are ridiculous sizes relative to the actual content.

SQUEENIX has many ways to tackle this issue, one being learning how to fucking compress, but nah let's just use more discs.
                    Ok but that’s what I meant, after compression it was too big, so they cut content instead of compressing further.

FfVIIR Intergrade has 94.88GB, the Remake 90,81 so Intergrade itself has 4,08GB
I believe the last crystal sunk into the ocean. However, it is quite possible that it is still active, but then how would primogenesis be cast by Ultima? That's why I love the ending.
    I think Ultima had no other choice than taking Clive as a 7/8 the vessel because of the loss. For me it is the explanation why Clive was not able to wirdhstand ultimata powers after all, he even commented it after absorbing Ultima that his body is too weak
If It were to end with cids death they shouldve at least let us brea 1 or 2 more crystals before the whole última things show Up tbh

Otherwise It wouldve been waay too short imo
We have no idea how the shiva vs titan fight ended, could’ve been a draw, a win, whatever.

In that same fight that you early misunderstood you can see how fast shiva is, this is a perfect counter to odins quick slashes.

As mythos, each eikon also strengthens him as a vessel regardless of the eikons individual power, likely increasing his strength.

I don’t think you know what plot armor is my guy.
    We do know it ends with Jill dragged on the floor too beaten and tired to be able to prime again. It's pretty clear Titan had the upper hand throughout. 

She's not nearly that fast and you made up a weird headcannon about how she's a good counter to Odin when Odin literally wiped the floor with her and she ended up captive. She has, in a quite literal sense, ice glass level of defensive ability.

If each Eikon strengthens him, then again, you are fighting against Odin at that point with the power of Ifrit, Phoenix, Titan, Ramuh, and Bahamut combined.
5  Eikons against one and Clive still gets the floor wiped with him. Add Shiva, which has so far proved no exceptional prowess against any other Eikon and suddenly the scales are tipped completely to Clive? Not even a struggle? From getting cut down in one hit and almost dying, had Barny willed it, to completely overpowering him?

Oh I know what plot armor is. You, however, need to do some reading.
        You clearly have no literacy at all, nothing you said proves Titan had any upper hand, we never see kupka, we never see what Jill’s condition was before the fight, we never see the actual conclusion.

“She’s not nearly that fast” someone skipped the prologue, play again and watch the background…

If Odin wiped the floor with Clive, the fuck you think Jill is going to be able to do? Jill using shivas power ≠ Clive using shivas power.

Here’s a very clear and hard to miss power up of Clive during the barnabas fights.

1. Completely loses

2. Fights back with some experience getting a little further and not getting completely cut down

3. Gains shiva and even more experience and eventually wins. 

I don’t know where the fuck your got the no struggle thing from. Might have to replay this too.
        something to keep in mind is that obviously Jill was being mistreated, her health and energy for sure wasn't at her peak at that fight, Hugo didn't have that disadvantage, he's obviously well fed and in good shape.
            So was Phoenix, arguably in a worse state, it was still able to handle Odin better, and Jill was already healthy at this point. Bahamut too was able to match up to Odin and pushed Waloed back from Storm.

Why do you feel the need to excuse the fact the power scaling in this game is Shonen anime level and only serves to push along the plot? There is no logical power scaling here, it's all spectacle, it's when it gets too egregious like Odin's battle that I feel it has to be pointed out.
not only that, 13 years she was under the ironbloods and not even a single small scar could be seen...
    Clive barely has any either
        Yes during the final fight it's implied that the curse does infect Clive because either he is the "perfect" vessel or because of Ultima's influence didn't really make it clear.
            We’re talking about scars lol
                Right right mb
I knew instantly there was no way torgal was dead

>It went from 'let me play this fight out calculated and safe-' to and enraged state of furiously lunging at her and swinging like a berserker.

There's a few good moments like this.  The first combat after you unlock the limit break is with the assholes who massacred Eastpool, so I popped it immediately just on principle
The end when he is howling broke me 😭
And then you cuddled him some more for the trophy?
    Trophy wasnt needed. Would have pet doggo anyways lol
We’re told she’s important to Clive, but we don’t feel it, since we didn’t see that bond develop. And all our interactions are just running errands for her lol. Maybe it would have worked better if she had appeared before the skip.
    Personally i think the skip was pointless noone aged noone got new outfits and clive getting his brand removed should have been an important story telling piece aswell as meeting mid. 

.. could have had a arch where we was fleeing from kupka and found the hideaway and watched it grow as we completed side quests.
        Its Also just weird how in 5 years we got NOTHING done but then break all remaining crystals in like a few months at most?
            Cuz rebuilding a place for runaway bearers takes a long ass time and took priority. They skipped us ahead to a point in time where the hideaway was rebuilt enough for us to be able to focus on the mothercrystals again.

EDIT: Not to mention we didn't go after the second crystal until it made sense from a military perspective (Sanbreque and Dhalmekia were fighting over the Crystalline Dominion so went after the crystal away from all the action) and the third crystal we never intended on going after when we did. Our objective was Kupka and only Kupka. It just so happened that we had to take out that mothercrystal to take out Kupka.
            Haha that too !
        Not a NEW outfit, but Clive’s is visibly more weathered after the skip. Not a big change but I found it to be a nice touch when I noticed it.
            My eye sight didnt see that haha
                His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
                    He’s also slightly more muscular too.
        I wouldn't say it was pointless, but it didn't need to be five years. Might have actually been more interesting if it was just a couple years, and Clive was still a little uncertain in his role as Cid.
    I think one single heartfelt scene with Mid would have helped too. Like, let her join in visiting Cids grade, or give her a scene with Clive telling him why she can't go there. Just one genuine moment of comradship between them would have gone a long way.
        It was Hidden behind sidequests. However i think a scene with mid and Clive at Cid's grave would have been good
        It was so weird how they talked about visiting the grave and then she just bailed. It could definitely have helped.
    DLC
    This was exactly how I felt about Vivian, just some random new person that I’m supposed to care about but who also isn’t as charismatic or enjoyable as Mid was
        Vivian is just an exposition dump with a pretty face, barely a character. For better or worse, they never even tried to make her important to the story so it's whatever.
            Nope not a single bit
Idk how I feel about using cids name. Otto says he suggested it but doesn't feel natural at all. Most side characters just don't feel connected and that 5 year time skip really didn't help
    It doesn't. Kupka would have still been pissed if they said it was clive who killed him. The objective would have still been cids. Clive the outlaw would have worked.
There is one side quest in the original hideout where you give Cid a letter from Mid and it is mentioned there that she is away at school, so I don't think Clive meets her until after the fall of the old hideout.
Yea killing Joshua or Jill won't break his will but bring him into path of revenge
Sic em, Joshua
My wounds boy
    Hey works for Kratos
Yeah, I was just trying to come up with who might be the most impactful for Clive to lose without needing a major rewrite.
She was, but the fact that Sleipnir specifically mentioned that Kupka died for a woman's head in a box implies he was aware of it.

Granted Kupka could have told him after the fact, but I imagine they had Sleipnir mention it for a reason story telling wise.
    Oh I wasn’t saying she did it I was just saying she was also cruel enough to do so. She also mentioned that Kupka was so easy to manipulate when her and Olivier met with him. She said something along the lines of “all over some common born wh*re”
It could've been interesting to see the two characters fight to the point of pure exhaustion, then have the final phase be the two of them going at each other without any powers.
To be fair, the final fight was pretty damn cool too, it just feels a bit less epic than it actually is because we've done the Ifrit Risen thing already at that point. It would've needed another gimmick I think. Like, say, combining the powers of all the eikons into a final "true" form.
    I thought Ultima was going to have Leviathan so I was hoping for another giant against something giant and cool. I was disappointed in the design but the story part was fine.
        Yeah.
But when you think about it, there were originally likely 16 mothercrystals (since every crytsal had an instance of Ultima at its heart, and there are 16 instances of Ultima). 8 of them were on the twins, and 8 eikons were originally known there. Since the eikons definitely have some sort of tie to the mothercrystals (although we don't know what that is, sadly), it stands to reason there were originally two eikons of every element (it's also never really explained why there are both Phoenix and Ifrit, beyond the vague allusion to their combined form being the original physical form of Ultima. But which Ultima? The crumbling bodies in the center chamber of Origin all seem to look different in some way).

While that sounds incredibly cool in concept, imagine having to implement 16 playstyles that feel distinct from one another.
Tbh the last fight was definitely up there but Bahamut was just like watching a DBZ "best of" MAD reel, it was just insanity.
I think they wanted to make it more of a duel style fight. Think Dante vs Vergil in DMC or Bayonetta vs Jeanne in Bayonetta.
I didn't find masamune until after I had crafted the gotterdammerung. I was so excited and then immediately disappointed.
Yeah but eventually the eight Mothercrystal also belongs to one Ultima, they can easily implement two dlcs that have to happen before origin.

To begin with, devs are being extremely lazy with compression and file sizes and don't optimize their games at all these days, cause they know players can just buy more space.

Has CBU3 really tried FFXVI's size could be cut by half and compressed further, and then decompressed upon install. FF7R is 94GB, and the Intergrade DLC ON IT'S OWN is 81GB. Those are ridiculous sizes relative to the actual content.

SQUEENIX has many ways to tackle this issue, one being learning how to fucking compress, but nah let's just use more discs.
    Ok but that’s what I meant, after compression it was too big, so they cut content instead of compressing further.

FfVIIR Intergrade has 94.88GB, the Remake 90,81 so Intergrade itself has 4,08GB
Right right mb
His hair is shaggier and his facial hair plus brand scar give him a more rugged appearance overall. He looks like he's aged, though not by much.
    He’s also slightly more muscular too.
