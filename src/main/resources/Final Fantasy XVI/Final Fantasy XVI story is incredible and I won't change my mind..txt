[[Final Fantasy XVI story is incredible and I won't change my mind.]]


## SPOILERS ##

It has been a few months since FFXVI launched and, of course, the game has its flaws (especially the side content), but the main story is one of the greatest in the series. A fantastic allegory to the Dark Ages until the Enlightment. Humanity evolving beyond the needs of mythological gods in the form of Ultima and Clive as "Mythos", into an age of enlightment forged by key members of society, represented by the Hideaway and Clive's evolution until achieving "Logos". The Dark Ages is known for the knowledge lost during that period and that is perfectly demonstrated by the lost history of the Fallen and a poorly documented past. The post credit scene shows a book where history is documented, and even though it was considered a tale by the mother, after possibly hundreds of years and the world being rebuilt since the fall of the Mothercrystals, the story was preserved.

FFXVI is one of the greatest Final Fantasy entries, and I'll never understand the hate it gets.


I think most people agree that the story, as in the overall plot as it would be written as a synopsis, is at least good. I think its phenomenal. The main criticism is how the game gets in its own way while trying to tell that story. For example, I would have traded every side quest in the game for more time with Dion, Jill, Gav, and well......everyone really. Sure, you don't have to play the side quests, but time and money as a resource on a development team are real things. And those resources, in my opinion, would have been better allocated in making a deeper cast and better pacing.
    It's good, but it does end up feeling like pretty weak Game of Thrones fanfic and then drops all its plot threads for generic anime god plotline. The opening sets up Clive in a really interesting and tragic way with Joshua, and then just tosses it out the window 1/3 of the way through.
        That's interesting. I never watched game of thrones and almost never watch anime, so those tropes might have been lost on me. I think part of the reason I was fine with the "and now you fight god!" twist is that, as someone who has played Final Fantasy since 2000, I've just come to expect it lol
            It just took some superficial stuff from GoT honestly. Like there's definitely influence in the setting design but the story of the game veers off in a different direction from GoT's political maneuvering fairly quickly. And really doesn't ever match GoT's habit of nihilism and sudden gory death. It is more brutal than the usual FF game but probably not even the most bleak and violent game in the series.

Anyway good bet on not watching Game of Thrones. One of the few cases of the ending actually ruining the whole series.
            Exactly! Some abstract force or emotional hurdle in physical form is always at the end of Final Fantasy. Plus it's a Japanese RPG, it's going to have anime elements. I really want to play 16, but playing the old ones on my Switch until I get the new PlayStation.
    I get your point but there's a counterargument: the point of the sidequests is for you to get to know the world beyond the main characters and the struggles of everyday folks. An issue I have with most FF games is that it always seems like no one beyond the main party matters and that the world exists solely as a background for the heroes. Given how one of the themes of the story is about resistance and grassroots revolution, it would be a huge miss if the sidequests didn't develop on this.

Also the cast is already deep. All the characters you mentioned have clearly defined personalities, backstories, development arcs... Dion in particular gets more to do in the story than many party members of old games. And they all get at least one sidequest entirely focused on them (and Jill gets two). But in the end sidequests are meant to use as little resources as possible, that's why they are made on reused assets and with few cinematics. I hardly believe there is much more they could have done with that money, specially after having to develop a whole new engine from scratch.

That's what always happens anyway, the discourse in half this sub right now is "New FF bad" and so every single thing about it is twisted under the worst optic possible. Y Just like when everyone complained that FFXV was just a boy band game and that it lacked the epic feeling of other games, and now everyone gushes about how the bonds and development of the party was actually the best thing about it. And folks will shift their discourse because they won't want to be left out. That's the whole problem about this series, people choose discourses like they would sides in a football match, instead of slowing down and trying to think of the reasons behind a particular creative decision. You can tell by how every single post about FFXVI is about which side of the fandom gets hold of the comments first (specially if OP dares to commit the unforgivable sin of actually enjoying the game).
        >You can tell by how every single post about FFXVI is about which side of the fandom gets hold of the comments first (specially if OP dares to commit the unforgivable sin of actually enjoying the game).

And when the game first came out everyone was saying how incredible, amazing etc it was and there was nothing bad about the game.

The sub went from one extreme to another, and now it's a fairly balanced (maybe a tad towards favourable) than it's been. This is what happens in every release.
        I think people forget that every mainline game is divisive since probably 10. 12 got more than it's fair share of hate and even though I still didn't enjoy it a lot it was a good game objectively. 13 was HATED and now people are warming up to it. 15 got all sorts of shit and rightly so, I still liked it well enough. Each game is mechanically different and points to the series for going out of their way to make it that way. 
        I don't think "new FF bad" at all. I think 16 is overall a good time, but also pretty flawed in certain areas. And unfortunately this is where things get a bit subjective. I hear your counterpoint about the side quests, and I did most of them,  and to be honest I felt like they really didn't add much. But there really isn't anywhere to go past that. Some people love them, other's don't. I hate apple pie, others gobble it down. Neither of us are right. I think the issue is that often people talk about their preferences in video games as if there is an objectively right answer rather than using those varied opinions to better understand the broader community. Essentially my goal was to show op,who "won't change their mind" that there are criticisms out there that, even though they may not agree, have some logic to them.
    And that's why the side quests are the worst part of the game, when I played the final fantasy mode I ignored the side content, and without them the pacing felt so much better, and thankfully the DLCs should spend more time with the main characters, I'm waiting for rising tide to play them. But I absolutely agree with you
    Give this MAN/WOMAN a raise !
    Idt there’s a single compelling thing about the story and never thought about it after completion
You're talking about setting, which I think most people agree is pretty neat. But it doesn't fix the pacing, gameplay, and how the characters and their stories play out.

Same could be said for XV.
"THIS IS MY OPINION AND I WONT CHANGE MY MIND!"

Okay
    Agree why did OP bother posting this what a nonsense post
        Because XVI is great do sumn
            Not the point.  You can say you think nazis are great OR terrible, but if you day you won't change your mind, you're not trying to have a conversation, you're just soapboxing.

And that's fine and all, but it means you deserve to be called out for essentially having on online temper tantrum.

And for the record,  yes I did enjoy XVI and nazis are terrible.
                That's just not true though.  You can have a conversation to share your own opinion and try to understand dissenting opinions (and even opinions that have the same conclusion but different reasoning), even if you're not going to change your mind.

I think Tom Brady is the best football player ever.  There is literally nothing anyone can say that will change that.  That doesn't mean I can't listen to why you think it's somebody else.
                    No one in all of time will ever be greater than Tom Brady?  No more football ever, we've peaked!
                        Sorry, didn't realize you were eight.
                             And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
                        Saying "Tom Brady is the best football player ever" is very different to "There will never be a player as good as Tom Brady".
It's good for the demo part of the game. But the time skips hand-wave massive chunks of character backstories, political intrigue, and world building so everything ends up flat and underdeveloped. The sheer amount of story they left on the table by rushing to get it over with instead of delving into anyone or anything is just maddening.

The pacing is straight wtf and Ultima is generic as all get out with no personality, charm, or personal connection with anyone to cover up how bland he is. Same with Barnabas, at first a mysterious warrior king but oh he's just a mindless zealot nothing to see here despite the hints at his awesome backstory the game dropped. XVI is definitely on the lower end of the series for me.
    That demo was legit phenomenal.
        Yeah, the demo made this game an insta buy for me, the rest felt like a hazy dream. Where the only highlights were* the boss battles. This game was like Cid's daughter, Mid.
        Phenomenal & misleading. I enjoyed the game but the demo really presents a false narrative. Take Anabella, she goes from "Selfish, evil woman with a Games of Thrones level of manipulation" to "generic evil step-mother who >!conveniently kills herself so our hero doesn't have to kill her or worse yet, help her survive.!<"
        I think it was the best demo I've ever played. Sadly everything afterwards was mid at best.
    At least they could have explained during the demo/prologue who is Jill and why is she there, but she is just there, lol. 

In the prologue there is already the seed of cuestionable bad writing choices but also the hope for great things that make most of the people forget them for not being too critical with a game that at least seems interesting and very promising in that part of the game.
        Yeah, during the demo I figured more would be explained and fleshed out afterwards so it wasn't an issue for me. Other FF titles and good JRPGs in general take the time later to fill in the gaps, not immediately skip 13 years and not look back.
I'm glad you liked it but you said nothing about the characters or the events of the game and I think those matter more than an allegory. I struggle to call it a good story when it's so hyper-focused on Clive that Joshua and Jill don't even have a relationship.
    this \^
    This is my thoughts exactly.  The basis of all good story telling is characters.  That provides emotional connection to the plot.  A simple or even bad story can be salvaged with great characters (this is where FF games normally shine) but a great story with bad characters does not work as well.

And I think FF16 has terrible characters.  They are mostly all under developed, under utilized, or are Clive, and even he is not a good character IMO.  He is a Mary Sue.  He doesn’t have any real character flaws.  He starts off like he might have an interesting character arc, but then he clears all that up in the first few hours of the game and stagnates as this awesome, brooding, noble, patient, selfless, heroic badass.  It’s garbage. 
        Clive was frustrating. For all the talk about how much better it was to finally have a "mature" hero I found him less complex than teenagers like Tidus.

I thought it was pretty generic. Evil deity wants to destroy everything. Hero has special abilities others don’t have, etc. Would not consider it to be the strongest FF story
    I think my issue is that it sets up an amazing political story and then just drops it all for mustache twirling bad guy vs. the power of friendship.
        The entire second half of the game I was just writing fanfiction in my head for how much better everyrhing would be without the villain.

Actual politics! Dealing with the bearer’s curse! A rebellion! Everyone actually using their connections and power to change the world! Anyone besides Clive being relevant for the last 10% of the game!
            It's still insane to me that the solution to discrimination was to just...take away magic. As if the bearers wouldn't still be marked and their offspring oppressed for generations upon generations simply on the basis that their bloodline was once able to use magic. What on earth is this story.

Imagine if there was a story that solved racism by removing all melanin from the world LMAO
                God, I know!!! I picked up on the fact that it might happen a little bit before the final battle and was like “please, god, not this, you don’t have to do this” and then it happened and I was soooo mad. 

Like what was the point! The Ultima plotline would’ve functioned exactly the same without a slavery plotline. It feels like the bearer’s thing only existed to say “Choose your own fate!!” but using SLAVES and oppressed people for that plotline is… inappropriate at best. 

Truly fumbled that. Which sucks because it had the potential to be interesting. 

Should’ve expected very little when Jill kinda just… glossed over being a ward/political slave and then a violated hostage, with almost zero narrative consequence, but everyone rly hyped up the politics (this is when reviewers had mostly only experienced the early game and I refused to see any spoilers after that) and well… oof
                    I'm one of those people who was SUPER invested in this game before it came out. I  pored over and memorized every detail that came out and was so into the political setup of these myriad nations and dominants and well we all know how that went. I honestly think I would have come away with a better opinion of the game had I NOT been involved in any prerelease material or cared about the game.

I've seen some people say that it's unfair of critics to basically write a story in their heads and then be mad when it doesn't come to fruition and i can see where they're coming from! But at the same time I also feel like I've only based my expectations on what the devs and narrative were initially setting up and it failed to deliver on its own merits :/
                        I feel like if the game spends 20+ hours setting up political intrigue and a rebellion/liberation plotline and then pivots to “this alien god is actually the only thing that matters,” that is on the game and not the gamer. Like narratively it just sucks, objectively.
                            Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
                        No, I’m with you. I was so invested in Clive’s journey and dealing with loss, but then they reveal Joshua is alive and Clive doesn’t have to come to terms with anything he’s done as a result of his grief. Now he’s fighting to protect a boat load of NPCs I didn’t feel a connection to.

I was heavily invested in Benedikta, how she was a villain but also showed vulnerability, how she had a romantic history with Cid, there was so much missed potential there when her battle ended in her brutal death. 

Please don’t get my wrong, I loved Gav, but that role should have been given to Sir Wade. He had the motivation to be a scout for Cid. He’d put his life on the line for Clive, too. Their conversations could have revealed a lot of what happened while Clive was enslaved.

Many people were speculating that Torgal was Fenrir so that wasn’t a surprise. What did surprise me was how little development he got. He’s a non verbal main character. I would trade every Lubor interaction in the game for a few more minutes of Torgal story time.

And really, you could sum up a lot of the story’s issues as having an amazing cast that we don’t get enough of. Even Barnabus got the short end of the stick. He seemed destined for more than just being the big bad’s henchman.

And Ultima? I don’t know man. Cool design and voice, but his backstory didn’t move me. He is pretty much just an Ascian before Shadowbringers made Ascians so interesting.

I know the story was written well before CBU3 penned the masterpieces that were Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but I expected better. They excel at character driven narratives now. This felt like a step back. 

I enjoyed my time XVI but it also disappointed me because it could have been so much more. I will still give them the benefit of the doubt because they put a really solid game engine together and the groundwork for a fantastic action combat experience.
                        It's funny, I feel like I could have written your comment but about FFXIV Endwalker. I haven't played XVI, but I suppose Naoki Yoshida... finds a way. A way to make me feel like I shouldn't have been invested.
                It also felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole? Like as if the devs themselves were saying "we actually hate FF and we want it to die" 

Destroying the crystals and killing magic?! Like it felt so weird, like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much and I couldn't put my finger on it.
    It doesn't even do that particularly well.
    Strongly agree. The game was trying so hard to be Game of Thrones that people seem to have been duped into thinking its story had depth. Everything is miserable and violent and everyone has a frowny face but this approach doesn't mean shit unless you can write characters and world build like George RR Martin. And ASOIAF actually has more humour and wit than this game.

The exposition is as dry as the Sahara, the characters lack depth, the political commentary feels like it was written by a teenage edgelord and the side quests are like a glass of warm milk. I did enjoy the combat for a while, but it all boils down to killing time until you meet the next big boss, so you can turn into Kaiju and beat the living hell out of each other.
    The worst sin for me is that not only is cliche and already seen in a thousand of other media, but it is also boring. Barnabas and Ultima are the most boring villains in the franchise. Exdeath and The Emperor arent the most complex villains but at least they are fun.
    But that's all Final Fantasys, though, except the ivalice collection and 10
        I feel like there weren’t any big twists or swerves. It was a very by the book storyline with a forgettable villain. Compare it to FF7R, which has a complete mind screw story, charismatic villain, interesting characters and world. Maybe I am just older and FF stories don’t amaze me anymore
            It is probably because it's extremely close to game of thrones in terms of world and character design
    Imagine an FF game having an FF story lol Basically all main FF start by fighting some imperium/evil guy and end up killing a (half/ascending) god.
I’m glad you liked it, but coming to the internet to tell everyone and ask for responses while saying “you can’t change my mind”, is immature. 

Now as for the game, it has some great points, but objectively it has bad pacing, unbalanced shallow characters, a plot that jumps around, and falls into that FF troupe of “the real bad guy is the one controlling the first bad guy 🙄”. FF8 did it, and did it better.
    Not well enough, IMO. FF8 couldn't hold my attention and felt like a corny YA novel. I couldn't make it past the first disc.
Just beat the game tonight. The story was amazing for the first half, maybe more but the remainder of the game wasn't very good. I enjoyed the various characters and regions of the game but then it threw that all away for a very generic villain.  I didn't like the ending either.
I think the main plot is decent to good for the first half (though, I feel uncomfortable with some of how the slavery plot is handled) but the Ultima stuff ruins it and it lacks a large component of the human/societal element it had spent so much time culminating early on.
    Yep, the game falls off hard.
        I’m still bitter because I was studying the worldbuilding like I had a test coming up—taking notes of which nation state was doing what, who was trying to take over who, creating a lil google doc of the history to be more concise than the summaries given to us—and then suddenly it was just wholly irrelevant.
 
Like not even taking the backseat just… gone from the plot.
            Yeah. The little history and current events talks were amazing and it really seemed like it was going somewhere. Then suddenly nothing..
                Wrong, the war fucking ended. Odin won. Where else do you take it? That plot ended.
            To be fair nothing matters when you discover a God is cultivating your species for a single person and plans to wipe everyone else out when they have what they want.
    It’s that “the real bad guy is behind the first bad guy” troupe Final Fantasy has done before.
Such posts are childish. Why start a discussion by saying you don’t care about other opinions?
    Karma farming. Should be against the rules IMHO too as it seeks karma while also clarifying no discussion is wanted.
    Because saying the game is bad is false. There's nothing objectively bad about the game. Even it's worst parts.
good? yes

incredible? nah
Who is asking you to change your mind?
I think the writing was incredible. I will admit that the side quests seemed like a chore but many of them were tied to major events in the story so I forgave them for making me take a break from the major plot points. What I REALLY liked about the game was how it felt like Game of Thrones with a bit of Prometheus thrown in. Regardless of how people perceive Ultima he always felt alien to me and THAT is cool especially given the Medieval setting of the game. Call it corny but the way they worked "Final" and "Fantasy" into that last bit of dialogue between Clive and Ultima was so satisfying. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending but it was serviceable. I'm hoping the DLC makes the ending a bit more satisfying. I'd love another title or DLC that shows the story of the Fallen in greater detail.
    It depends on what you mean by "writing." The English version had its own script, which offered a different and somewhat superior experience compared to other scripts.
        Isn't that how localization works? And yes, that is the version I played. The writing was top notch.
            In the case of FF16, it's like having one game with two different personalities. I think we need a new term for this, something other than "localization."
Even if it was (it’s not) your explanation isn’t doing it any favors. This has to be the least convincing pro XVI post I’ve seen in a while lol.
I don’t _hate_ the story, but I did feel a bit misled by the vertical slice demo.

Clive’s monologue after Joshua’s death had me really invested in his character. I thought finally, a dark, complex main FF character.

Then I played the full game, and nope. Clive is the goodest of boys. Didn’t feel like his character developed much at all — things just happen to him.
    I get where you are coming from
Maehiro is an expert at handpicking the most overused and redundant tropes in the subgenre he's working in and stuffing his stories absolutely full of them without building on them in any meaningful or interesting way. The problem with this game is that he didn't have any better writers to absolutely knock it out of the park and make his boring mishmash of tropes retroactively interesting so it just fizzles out in the most uninspired action game final boss I've ever seen where I was able to guess every single line before it was said.
    "he didn't have any better writers to absolutely knock it out of the park and make his boring mishmash of tropes retroactively interesting" you can say Ishikawa, it's fine 😉
    Doubt it
The story was ok. It was the only reason I finished it, though I disliked a lot of elements. The mother’s motivation for being so shitty was really shallow. She wanted super offspring? Ok… I felt like her reasoning needed more depth like she was groomed to think that way or believed she had a destiny because of some experience. Nope. Just a sad little woman. The gameplay was too focused on being flashy. It was the easiest game I’ve played in a long time. I think I died twice the whole game, once because I was bored and not paying attention, the second time I got cocky because everything was so easy and went to a bounty monster way too early. I’m usually that person who plays the whole game on normal and still dies a lot, so this was really weird. As a day 1 Final Fantasy player, I’d rank it somewhere around 6th or 7th of the non online mainline games. I’m not sure what the makers of Final Fantasy are even trying to do anymore. Are they trying to give the fans what they want or trying to be cutting edge?
    > Are they trying to give the fans what they want or trying to be cutting edge?

Whatever it is, they're failing at both.
        As much as I hate to say it, I agree.
    That mother backstory is in the game. So you didn't really read anything or pay attention. Then you either skip content or play on easy if you arent dying more than twice.
The story was great. My only grievances and the reason i don’t want to play it again is the ff14 arr questing lows between the big stuff, and that the combat was too easy. It’s too bad because I really really enjoyed the combat system in general 
    Try Final Fantasy Mode. Unfortunately the devs should have realized that this mode needed to be playable from the beginning.
        Waiting for both DLCs to land before I pick the game up again. Question tho, does FF Mode actually make the combat harder or does it just buff the already quite damage spongy enemies with more sponginess?
            I haven't finished it but it seems harder to me. From what I've read, not only do they change the enemy parties and placement but they also make them more aggressive and use more buff/heal spells than in the normal mode. In terms of HP I'm not sure though.
The allegorical story is enjoyable, but it has several issues. Portraying it as overly profound or incredible is an exaggeration; the authors essentially guide us through the allegory instead of leaving room for interpretation, which is my first issue.

Another issue lies in the weak character development due to insufficient story time for each. The abundance of characters exacerbates this problem.

A third issue pertains to numerous flaws in the writing. For instance, when Jill was abducted, Clive calmly asserted that she was fine because he could sense when other Domini die. This didn't make any sense, as he lacks the ability to feel whether they are being tortured. Additionally, Joshua and Clive's decision to go together to Ultima, mere seconds after thinking that Ultima needed both of them, highlight the narrative incoherence.

Edit: I have an additional issue, which may or may not be relevant to the story – the pacing. The narrative felt less engaging, particularly after playing Final Fantasy 7 Remake right after. It seemed that the primary focus wasn't on presenting the story but rather on conveying the underlying idea.
I think the overall story carries the game quite immensely. It's well written and well performed by the VAs. It's a shame that it came out in a year with Baldur's Gate 3 because it could have won some awards otherwise. In terms of converting story into gameplay, I question the pacing - *The world is in imminent danger from Ultima? Well hold on let me get some flowers for the hideaway and find out why my blacksmiths depressed.*

The big moments in the game are epic; the fights, the atmosphere, the intensity, the context is really compelling but its followed up with silly side quests, or main quests which feel like side quests. I understand they need to fill the story with more content to give it more substance but I feel this is rather weak.

If people dislike the combat, I can kinda understand why. It's obviously quite different from the Turn based JRPGs previously in the series, but I think everything after FF12 has slowly moved away from turned base combat. FFXVI has turned into a wombo-combo Devil May Cry like game than something similar to FFXV. I personally would have liked to play other characters (in proper combat, sorry Young Joshua) and choose how they function in the party but nope, just Clive and Torgal only. It sucks but not a game killer.

I think the people who played it and disliked it either expected something else for a FF game or didn't bother to understand what was going on.
>FFXVI is one of the greatest Final Fantasy entries

Why does this read like an advertisement for XVI? It's one of the weakest games in the series dude. They removed lots of the RPG traits and the characters are quite weak.
I mean, you have clearly made up your mind so why would anyone try to change it? I'm lost
The story is okay, not incredible. 

FFXVI is not one of the greatest Final Fantasy entries. Consensually, it can't compete with Square's golden era titles FF4-10. Fact.
    IMO people always say this about new FF titles unless they're a remake of a title they liked. Nobody liked FF8 as much as 7. Same for 9. People hated X until some time passed and now it's among one of the more popular titles. Folks also hated FFXIII and now it's talked about like it's some hidden gem.
        It's not just primacy-bias here. These games are objectively different and no where near as well made as they used to be. People loved 9 when it came out, but it wasn't immediately received as well because it wasn't a Nomura FF that was popularized by 7 and 8. But it was an incredible, consistent, and very fun/deep Final Fantasy. No one ever contested that. 

15 and 16 are them using what they have left in development, but the old teams who made FF have left; so they're trying to create a new gen of FF experiences, but they just aren't landing like they used to. It's sad. 

I've accepted that the FF I love, is no longer something that can be made again.
            It must be subjective because XV ended up selling something like 10 million globally which, for a niche genre, is excellent. According to VG Chartz that is just behind all FFVII sales and more than the PS1 sales for FFVII. They're doing just fine. A loud minority of fans does not negate the continued success of the franchise.
                FFs always sell strong, especially on release day because people trust the established franchise. But I think after 16 and 15 being extremely mixed divisive; FF consumers are burned and won't be going hard on 17 on release day as much as they used to.  

Again sales do not equate enjoyment. SE has pushed their games to be more accessible for a broader audience as RPGs are more of a niche audience. Which is why the game sold better, also multiple platforms like PC sales helped too. 

Therefore, what I said still stands for me. "FF as I'm used to it; the reason I love and became a fan of the franchise, is no longer something I can expect to get anew again"
                    Well at least you'll have your FF7 Rebirth and whatever the last in the trilogy will be. Those seem like they will be more along the lines of what you want even if they are action based rather than turn based.
                        I am very hopeful for Rebirth. 🙏
    This objectively false lmao
Story was honestly abysmal. 

Remember when Kupka wanted to kill Jill in front of Clive to make him suffer but then for some reason he didn't just to have a cool rescue scene with a nonsensical power up for someone that led to nothing. Or how about the absolute mess that was Annabellas writing? Or what about Clives obsession with his little brother who when there was hope he acted like it was no big deal. 

This games writing is an absolute joke. It would be passable back in the Nes/snes days but is embarrassingly bad by today's standards
    Kupka is such an under utilised character. I was getting really hyped when we killed his girlfriend and he vowed revenge. Then it turned out to be a nothing burger.
        >Then it turned out to be a nothing burger.

Which felt like a lot of things with XVI
The last 15% or so was terrible, to the point that it soured the rest of the story for me. Pointlessly ambiguous ending (inb4 "it wasn't ambiguous at all! Listen to my headcanon on what happened!") and a whole lot of terrible poetic monologuing. 

The story started with real stakes and human emotion and ended in a super cliche "kill the bad guy who has matching powers" anime fight.
>FFXVI is one of the greatest Final Fantasy entries, and I'll never understand the --hate-- criticisms* it gets.

I got'chu OP.
Don’t agree, never av. You get hit with cliches right out the box lol. Your brother doesn’t die, he’s actually alive. Your mentor is killed off. You become the boss of the secret group but they still send you out to collect trinkets for side quests. Even considering the history and lore of the world, there is still one mega evil bad guy. 

Story tells itself, it was pretty safe.
It’s story dropped off a cliff half way through
It’s crap. Change your mind.
I thought it started really strong, but it completely falls apart after the Dhalmekia arc, in fact I'd go as far as to say Ultima is one of the worst written antagonists in the series and the antagonist is arguably the most important character in a story.
    Hard disagree 
It’s a great game, way better than XV
Incredible? Nah. Well executed yes.
Because FF16 is a good game. Just not a good Final Fantasy game.
    For me, the opposite is true; I thought it was a good FF with some solid concepts. However, as a game, it was completely bad.
    That's funny I could have sworn it has Final Fantasy in the title and was developed by the exact same company that has created all of the other Final Fantasy games.
        And yet it has almost nothing in common in the spirit of those games. Just same assets.
            According to whom?
                Have you not played the previous Final Fantasies??? No Ra and Ga Spells? No Elemental weaknesses? No Limit breaks? (F16 is closer to DMC Devil trigger than actual Limit break). Party members that are actually part of the gameplay?  


No meaningful explorations? Secret bosses? Secret Dungeons? No comprehensive progression system? FF7 had materia, FF10, had the sphere system, FF8 had the GF system.....  


Combat system is just pressing square button and the occasional dodge parry and popping of CDs. Christ, FF15 did this exact same thing except its exponentially better.  


How about story? gratuitous and senseless violence? Music is very underwhelming, even the Octopath Series had better music.  


I can name some more but I have made my point.
                    I've played all other mainline titles and completed nearly all of them. Many of your qualms are subjective.


This game's main shtick was the focus on the Eikons and destroying, rather than saving, crystals. Enemies made use of -ra and -ga spells. Your magic was essentially the same thing depending on which Eikon you equiped. A magic blast is essentially the base spell and holding the magic button and releasing makes it more powerful like a -ra spell. The strong elemental abilities from Eikons replace the -ga spells and to me this is much better because not only did you get a strong elemental spell but they all had different AoE and supplemental effects. So many folks get caught up on the lack of a traditional attack/magic system which doesn't really work for more action oriented games. If you want that FF7R uses it with pretty decent success though I dislike how it interrupts the action of the battle.


Many of the maps had places to explore outside of your destination and rewarded you with chests for exploring. There weren't any secret bosses but the trials offered what I would consider to be an acceptable replacement for those looking for challenges. Many of the hunt bosses were fairly challenging too.


Is the ability board not a progression system? I had to be strategic about what I spent my ability points on as soon as I realized that only 3 Eikons could be equipped so some abilities I ended up having to master so I could equip them on different Eikons.


The writing was top notch and much more realistic for a medieval setting than many of the older games. The game won the Best Music and Score award at TGA 2023.


I think it's time some of y'all admit that your criticism is really just preference.
                        It is subjective. That is why I was referring to the "sprit" of being a Final Fantasy. And if you enjoy it, that's fine also.  


You have good good points on being an action game - except the problem is FF15 did this also and its infinitely and objectively better. The state of FF16 is simply unacceptable when there is a solid foundation from  all 15 previous games (and more for the ones that did get a sequel) and this is the best YoshiP has come with?  


Currency has no meaning in this game, and soon you will find that hidden chests and even experience points soon become meaningless. I dont want more of something I don't need. At 1 point in the game I have 100k Gil and the games keeps giving me more? For what? I would get a Legendary or Purple weapon only later to find out I can get a stronger weapon from a Vendor? Really????  


Sidequests are more of a chore rather than something compelling. Hell there is absolutely no incentive for me to explore - not particularly thrilled to go to a shiny object only to pick up 20 gil (thanks YoshiP).  


The first boss fight actually sums up this entire game - fighting the marlboro was utterly meaningless because there was no status abnormalities in this game. The malboro was supposed to be the something very fearful in a Final Fantasy game and it was somehow reduced to an oversize punching bag in this game? I rest my case.
                            I honestly never noticed there weren't any status conditions and I didn't miss them. They would be incredibly annoying in an action game especially when there isn't a spell to heal them and you only have 3 item slots to use mid-battle. Perhaps if there was some way to use Esuna via Eikon magic it would have made sense to include them.
                It doesn't even have classic FF enemies. It has one Moogle which was shoehorned into the game as a hunting board assistant.
                    What are you talking about? It has Dragons, Chocobos, Tonberries (in the upcoming DLC), Marlboros, Goblins, Coeurls, Behemoths, Adamantoises, Bombs, Flans, Ahriman, Iron Giants, and an Evil Interdimensional God.
                According to the series itself which established what it's known for and what you come to expect. 16 is just calling itself an FF and wearing "FF clothing", but it's experience when playing the game is NOTHING like an FF.
                    If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game. Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.
                        > If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game.

I'm not asking for the same game over and over again.  You're assuming I'm asking for exact carbon copies. I'm not. Folks want something new, but they still want what has brought them back to FF over and over again. Amazing battle/leveling systems with DEPTH, and an amazing cast of characters that you can play and experience alongside with. 

> Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.

- 16 did not have elements. There was no elemental affinity with your attacks which was shocking. The fact I could hit a bomb with Ifrit and Phoenix and it didn't heal it shocked me. 

- Crystals were there, but you destroy them? That felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole to me. Like as if the devs themselves were saying *"we actually hate FF and we want it to die"* Felt like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much. 

- Deicide is a thing that happens a lot, but it's not really what the games are about. 

- There is 0 inventory managment in 16.

- Ability management is so bare bones, I can't even call it a system. Especially at the end of the day it's really just "pick which ability you think looks the coolest" since damage doesn't matter since you have no abilities, elements, status effects, debuffs, knockups, etc, anything (except Garuda's pull down) that matters. Even as a DMC game I am left wanting more depth. FF games have always had SO MUCH DEPTH in their systems! I only expect that because that is the standard they set. and no, I don't want the same thing, I wanted to something new again; like each subsequent Final Fantasy in previous years always did. 

A theme which I feel like each FF has done, to match the first FF ever made is the "Warriors of Light" theme. 

"*A party of unlikely individuals are brought together by the fate and guidance of the crystals to defeat evil and save the kingdom or the world.*" You see this theme reused, and retooled in extremely creative ways with each game. But 16 throws that out the window with giving us just 1 character. 

Even 15, the closest comparison of a FF (from a gameplay standpoint), had a party system. 

Each Final Fantasy felt different and new from its predecessor especially when we started hitting the Sony era. 

What I miss looking forward to is:

- Discovering the new cast of characters and what each character will uniquely bring to battle and the story.

- The new take on their amazing established battle system, or leveling mechanics. Materia, Junction, Abilities, Sphere Grid, Licenses, etc. 

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST. 

> "FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management."

Again I called 16 a game in "FF Clothing" because it had the things you listed, yes; but just having them there doesn't mean that the experience that the series is known for was utilized here. At best their inclusion here is like hanging a poster on a wall of a castle with a crystal in the image and saying "Crystals are in FF16". That's the level of FF inclusion this game had. FF is not what it used to be, and I don't think it ever will be again. It's definitely not an RPG, and it's a far FAR cry from what established Final Fantasy as a leading, industry defining, RPG franchise.  16 felt like a fan made game, with the visuals of a AAA dev.
ok, and?
the setting is fine, the characters, pacing, gameplay, writting and most of the songs are not (I love the composer but this songs aren't memorable or they repeat too much, he is has better songs in ff14).
>  I'll never understand the hate it gets.  

Wait .... what?  I'm hella confused right now.  Are you sure you're talking about the right game?  You're talking about Final Fantasy 16 .. right?  Because that game got like OVERWHELMINGLY Positive reviews.  I actually dont think I've ever .. not even one single time .. heard anyone say a single bad thing about the game.  

Are you maybe thinking of Final Fantasy 8, 11, 12, or 13?  They got some bad press.
    I mean I will say plenty of bad things about it. From the extremely boring sidequests that are disjointed from the story to the fact that the RPG aspect is nothing more than a small pretense. You just progress linearly, equipment upgrades are always just plain better than the previous one without ever any trade-off and might as well be automated. The combat system is incredibly boring and requires nothing more than mashing the same sequence of attacks as you wait for cooldowns. Mechanically it's one of the weakest FF games ever.  


The kaiju battles are pretty cool but feel like nothing more than interactive movies.
        Sounds like somebody couldn't master the combos and/or couldn't find an ability setup that worked well for them
            No see, that's the problem, it takes so little to find a set of abilities that have similar cooldowns and just let you spam them in an endless repetitive circle. That's literally the entire depth of the combat system.
                Maybe on the regular mode. You can't do that in Final Fantasy mode.
                    Ah yes because we should judge the depth of a combat system based on the additional difficulty that is only unlocked after beating the game once.

Get real the vast majority of people are never going to touch new game plus and even then, the combat doesn't get actually deeper you just need to be good at dodging.
                        You have to prioritize which enemies to kill first because they're more aggressive and use more buff/heal abilities. I will agree that FF mode should have been available from the start.
    Its gotten a good amount of criticism from fans and reviewers since release. You can see a bunch [here](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=final%20fantasy%20xvi%20is%20disappointing) and [here](https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-xvi/).
    Leave your bubble.
    It got "bad" reviews in the fantasy world where r/FinalFantasy and r/JRPG live just because it isn't turn based and combat is "ShAlLow" and too "EaSy" while using the rings for help.
    Yeah but we are talking about the Final Fantasy, where every single new game must be considered terrible no matter what. And I've never heard of XII bad press, only development hell, I still have to play it, but most people I know consider one of the best in the series.
Fuck everyone else this is my favourite FF
    100%, it’s the best final fantasy game
    Factssss
when did it get "HATE", it received great reviews and sold really well for a FF game. the issue is people AND MEDIA\* thought it would "patch up" the hole made by those Marvel games and Forspoken that both bombed... unfortunately, it takes more than 1 game selling well to do that, maybe if they released a new expansion for FF14 it would help a ton more, but JUST FF16 cant save the company even if it was perfect. Even FF7 Rebirth wont hold the numbers they are hoping for.   


PS. i loved Forspoken, it was a solid game, and FF16 is one of my favorites now.
    >when did it get "HATE"

Search here and you'll find it. LOTS & LOTS
        I guess that's where I'm at, I don't go looking for hate lmao probably why I don't see it...
Hell no! In terms of presentation it’s great doe but how could anyone enjoy the last 1/3 when the focus shifted to ultima’s cookie cutter villain plan? Everything pre Bahamut was great doe but the last 1/3rd ruined the game for me.
The story was strong in the first part and the death of annabella was thought-provoking. But the plot took a nosedive at from the odin portion onwards where the characters' motovation is just not as strong compared to what came before (passing of torch between cids, titan's lust for revenge, dion's rage, fall and redemption).

I saw in comments that you skipped some of the side content which is understandable but a slight shame as Dorys' and Chadwick's story is so reminiscent to ff7cc and could be a spin off game of its own in my opinion.
Yes. Anyone that says otherwise is cappin
1/2 to 2/3 of the story is excellent
From what I've seen, it gets hated on from both fans and Western Media Outlets Alike.


Very strange people...
How? It's got great worldbuilding, sure, but the characters beyond Clive barely get any development. And the main villain is generic and uninspired. Don't really see how the story beats any of FF's top entires (6, 7, 9, 10, etc.) in story.
I strongly agree. The story is phenomenal. Its in my mind the best fantasy story in a video game.
Best story in the series besides maybe 10 and tactics.
If you’re game to try out other games with a really good story, I’d recommend The Last of Us and 2018’s God of War.
Great story, but Ultima is kinda whack
Also, I'm not sure Ultima is mythology, as he's real
    ??
I absolutely agree.  I just hated about everything else from the game.  The story though, top notch and it's what kept me around long enough to beat and stream it. Once it ended I was happy as fk.  I will not be playing the dlcs far as I'm concerned that's the story
Everyone has their own opinion, so just enjoy. While I am your counterpart i.e never understand how people can like this game, but if you do, great for you !!
I think the English localization is what carries it for English audiences, however, I don’t believe the story was great at all, especially in the second half.
Not enough time with any of the characters. Clyde gets so much screen time and he wastes it with brooding. 

The whole brother died but oh wait nevermind is when I gave up on the story. Kingdom Hearts all over again.
IMO FFXVI has a really solid story.

But I've been thinking. Instead of having all these fillers bits to fill in the gaps between the big events, they should've weaved the 10(?) or so important optional quests at the end into the main story and it would've been bloody brilliant.
eh, I loved it upon release and played twice immediately which never happens these days.  since then though, it's faded from memory very quickly.  I don't even remember any of the soundtrack.  solid 7/10 but it has very little longevity comparatively.
They kinda did a Game of Thrones. Great story but bad pacing at some point and (kinda) badly executed last part.

I liked the game overall, but the side quests and the way to process them (by having most of the time to walk the hub uselessly to get, give back the quest) really got on my nerves, again, bad pacing.
I haven't played it, but starting off with "I won't change my mind" isn't a great way to show that you're flexible and willing to listen to opposing viewpoints.
I felt the story was good overall. I think there was a fair bit of inspiration drawn from humanities current situation with global warming and climate change. The Cid quote that really hit it home is when he described that even if you destroy the crystals things will likely get a lot worse before they get any better, but you have to do it anyways. Combat was okay-ish, but by the end you just use the same rotations and murder pretty much anything.
Most people love the game. But it's a little bit mixed. 
Cool.

Most people didn't have huge problems with the story itself. More with the lack of focus on supporting characters and the somewhat shallow and repetitive gameplay.
I thought it said XIV and was like ''No, no it's fucking n... oh XVI, yeah, I should really learn to read. 

&#x200B;

Not that I can judge cause they haven't ported it to Pc yet and I will not get a Ps5 just to play FF16 earlier.
Imo,the story is ok but it has a great delivery and Clives VA did an amazing job.


Kill me now,but I 15s story was way better,but very poorly delivered.
It's good, but it does end up feeling like pretty weak Game of Thrones fanfic and then drops all its plot threads for generic anime god plotline. The opening sets up Clive in a really interesting and tragic way with Joshua, and then just tosses it out the window 1/3 of the way through.
    That's interesting. I never watched game of thrones and almost never watch anime, so those tropes might have been lost on me. I think part of the reason I was fine with the "and now you fight god!" twist is that, as someone who has played Final Fantasy since 2000, I've just come to expect it lol
        It just took some superficial stuff from GoT honestly. Like there's definitely influence in the setting design but the story of the game veers off in a different direction from GoT's political maneuvering fairly quickly. And really doesn't ever match GoT's habit of nihilism and sudden gory death. It is more brutal than the usual FF game but probably not even the most bleak and violent game in the series.

Anyway good bet on not watching Game of Thrones. One of the few cases of the ending actually ruining the whole series.
        Exactly! Some abstract force or emotional hurdle in physical form is always at the end of Final Fantasy. Plus it's a Japanese RPG, it's going to have anime elements. I really want to play 16, but playing the old ones on my Switch until I get the new PlayStation.
I get your point but there's a counterargument: the point of the sidequests is for you to get to know the world beyond the main characters and the struggles of everyday folks. An issue I have with most FF games is that it always seems like no one beyond the main party matters and that the world exists solely as a background for the heroes. Given how one of the themes of the story is about resistance and grassroots revolution, it would be a huge miss if the sidequests didn't develop on this.

Also the cast is already deep. All the characters you mentioned have clearly defined personalities, backstories, development arcs... Dion in particular gets more to do in the story than many party members of old games. And they all get at least one sidequest entirely focused on them (and Jill gets two). But in the end sidequests are meant to use as little resources as possible, that's why they are made on reused assets and with few cinematics. I hardly believe there is much more they could have done with that money, specially after having to develop a whole new engine from scratch.

That's what always happens anyway, the discourse in half this sub right now is "New FF bad" and so every single thing about it is twisted under the worst optic possible. Y Just like when everyone complained that FFXV was just a boy band game and that it lacked the epic feeling of other games, and now everyone gushes about how the bonds and development of the party was actually the best thing about it. And folks will shift their discourse because they won't want to be left out. That's the whole problem about this series, people choose discourses like they would sides in a football match, instead of slowing down and trying to think of the reasons behind a particular creative decision. You can tell by how every single post about FFXVI is about which side of the fandom gets hold of the comments first (specially if OP dares to commit the unforgivable sin of actually enjoying the game).
    >You can tell by how every single post about FFXVI is about which side of the fandom gets hold of the comments first (specially if OP dares to commit the unforgivable sin of actually enjoying the game).

And when the game first came out everyone was saying how incredible, amazing etc it was and there was nothing bad about the game.

The sub went from one extreme to another, and now it's a fairly balanced (maybe a tad towards favourable) than it's been. This is what happens in every release.
    I think people forget that every mainline game is divisive since probably 10. 12 got more than it's fair share of hate and even though I still didn't enjoy it a lot it was a good game objectively. 13 was HATED and now people are warming up to it. 15 got all sorts of shit and rightly so, I still liked it well enough. Each game is mechanically different and points to the series for going out of their way to make it that way. 
    I don't think "new FF bad" at all. I think 16 is overall a good time, but also pretty flawed in certain areas. And unfortunately this is where things get a bit subjective. I hear your counterpoint about the side quests, and I did most of them,  and to be honest I felt like they really didn't add much. But there really isn't anywhere to go past that. Some people love them, other's don't. I hate apple pie, others gobble it down. Neither of us are right. I think the issue is that often people talk about their preferences in video games as if there is an objectively right answer rather than using those varied opinions to better understand the broader community. Essentially my goal was to show op,who "won't change their mind" that there are criticisms out there that, even though they may not agree, have some logic to them.
And that's why the side quests are the worst part of the game, when I played the final fantasy mode I ignored the side content, and without them the pacing felt so much better, and thankfully the DLCs should spend more time with the main characters, I'm waiting for rising tide to play them. But I absolutely agree with you
Give this MAN/WOMAN a raise !
Idt there’s a single compelling thing about the story and never thought about it after completion
Agree why did OP bother posting this what a nonsense post
    Because XVI is great do sumn
        Not the point.  You can say you think nazis are great OR terrible, but if you day you won't change your mind, you're not trying to have a conversation, you're just soapboxing.

And that's fine and all, but it means you deserve to be called out for essentially having on online temper tantrum.

And for the record,  yes I did enjoy XVI and nazis are terrible.
            That's just not true though.  You can have a conversation to share your own opinion and try to understand dissenting opinions (and even opinions that have the same conclusion but different reasoning), even if you're not going to change your mind.

I think Tom Brady is the best football player ever.  There is literally nothing anyone can say that will change that.  That doesn't mean I can't listen to why you think it's somebody else.
                No one in all of time will ever be greater than Tom Brady?  No more football ever, we've peaked!
                    Sorry, didn't realize you were eight.
                         And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
                    Saying "Tom Brady is the best football player ever" is very different to "There will never be a player as good as Tom Brady".
That demo was legit phenomenal.
    Yeah, the demo made this game an insta buy for me, the rest felt like a hazy dream. Where the only highlights were* the boss battles. This game was like Cid's daughter, Mid.
    Phenomenal & misleading. I enjoyed the game but the demo really presents a false narrative. Take Anabella, she goes from "Selfish, evil woman with a Games of Thrones level of manipulation" to "generic evil step-mother who >!conveniently kills herself so our hero doesn't have to kill her or worse yet, help her survive.!<"
    I think it was the best demo I've ever played. Sadly everything afterwards was mid at best.
At least they could have explained during the demo/prologue who is Jill and why is she there, but she is just there, lol. 

In the prologue there is already the seed of cuestionable bad writing choices but also the hope for great things that make most of the people forget them for not being too critical with a game that at least seems interesting and very promising in that part of the game.
    Yeah, during the demo I figured more would be explained and fleshed out afterwards so it wasn't an issue for me. Other FF titles and good JRPGs in general take the time later to fill in the gaps, not immediately skip 13 years and not look back.
this \^
This is my thoughts exactly.  The basis of all good story telling is characters.  That provides emotional connection to the plot.  A simple or even bad story can be salvaged with great characters (this is where FF games normally shine) but a great story with bad characters does not work as well.

And I think FF16 has terrible characters.  They are mostly all under developed, under utilized, or are Clive, and even he is not a good character IMO.  He is a Mary Sue.  He doesn’t have any real character flaws.  He starts off like he might have an interesting character arc, but then he clears all that up in the first few hours of the game and stagnates as this awesome, brooding, noble, patient, selfless, heroic badass.  It’s garbage. 
    Clive was frustrating. For all the talk about how much better it was to finally have a "mature" hero I found him less complex than teenagers like Tidus.

I think my issue is that it sets up an amazing political story and then just drops it all for mustache twirling bad guy vs. the power of friendship.
    The entire second half of the game I was just writing fanfiction in my head for how much better everyrhing would be without the villain.

Actual politics! Dealing with the bearer’s curse! A rebellion! Everyone actually using their connections and power to change the world! Anyone besides Clive being relevant for the last 10% of the game!
        It's still insane to me that the solution to discrimination was to just...take away magic. As if the bearers wouldn't still be marked and their offspring oppressed for generations upon generations simply on the basis that their bloodline was once able to use magic. What on earth is this story.

Imagine if there was a story that solved racism by removing all melanin from the world LMAO
            God, I know!!! I picked up on the fact that it might happen a little bit before the final battle and was like “please, god, not this, you don’t have to do this” and then it happened and I was soooo mad. 

Like what was the point! The Ultima plotline would’ve functioned exactly the same without a slavery plotline. It feels like the bearer’s thing only existed to say “Choose your own fate!!” but using SLAVES and oppressed people for that plotline is… inappropriate at best. 

Truly fumbled that. Which sucks because it had the potential to be interesting. 

Should’ve expected very little when Jill kinda just… glossed over being a ward/political slave and then a violated hostage, with almost zero narrative consequence, but everyone rly hyped up the politics (this is when reviewers had mostly only experienced the early game and I refused to see any spoilers after that) and well… oof
                I'm one of those people who was SUPER invested in this game before it came out. I  pored over and memorized every detail that came out and was so into the political setup of these myriad nations and dominants and well we all know how that went. I honestly think I would have come away with a better opinion of the game had I NOT been involved in any prerelease material or cared about the game.

I've seen some people say that it's unfair of critics to basically write a story in their heads and then be mad when it doesn't come to fruition and i can see where they're coming from! But at the same time I also feel like I've only based my expectations on what the devs and narrative were initially setting up and it failed to deliver on its own merits :/
                    I feel like if the game spends 20+ hours setting up political intrigue and a rebellion/liberation plotline and then pivots to “this alien god is actually the only thing that matters,” that is on the game and not the gamer. Like narratively it just sucks, objectively.
                        Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
                    No, I’m with you. I was so invested in Clive’s journey and dealing with loss, but then they reveal Joshua is alive and Clive doesn’t have to come to terms with anything he’s done as a result of his grief. Now he’s fighting to protect a boat load of NPCs I didn’t feel a connection to.

I was heavily invested in Benedikta, how she was a villain but also showed vulnerability, how she had a romantic history with Cid, there was so much missed potential there when her battle ended in her brutal death. 

Please don’t get my wrong, I loved Gav, but that role should have been given to Sir Wade. He had the motivation to be a scout for Cid. He’d put his life on the line for Clive, too. Their conversations could have revealed a lot of what happened while Clive was enslaved.

Many people were speculating that Torgal was Fenrir so that wasn’t a surprise. What did surprise me was how little development he got. He’s a non verbal main character. I would trade every Lubor interaction in the game for a few more minutes of Torgal story time.

And really, you could sum up a lot of the story’s issues as having an amazing cast that we don’t get enough of. Even Barnabus got the short end of the stick. He seemed destined for more than just being the big bad’s henchman.

And Ultima? I don’t know man. Cool design and voice, but his backstory didn’t move me. He is pretty much just an Ascian before Shadowbringers made Ascians so interesting.

I know the story was written well before CBU3 penned the masterpieces that were Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but I expected better. They excel at character driven narratives now. This felt like a step back. 

I enjoyed my time XVI but it also disappointed me because it could have been so much more. I will still give them the benefit of the doubt because they put a really solid game engine together and the groundwork for a fantastic action combat experience.
                    It's funny, I feel like I could have written your comment but about FFXIV Endwalker. I haven't played XVI, but I suppose Naoki Yoshida... finds a way. A way to make me feel like I shouldn't have been invested.
            It also felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole? Like as if the devs themselves were saying "we actually hate FF and we want it to die" 

Destroying the crystals and killing magic?! Like it felt so weird, like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much and I couldn't put my finger on it.
It doesn't even do that particularly well.
Strongly agree. The game was trying so hard to be Game of Thrones that people seem to have been duped into thinking its story had depth. Everything is miserable and violent and everyone has a frowny face but this approach doesn't mean shit unless you can write characters and world build like George RR Martin. And ASOIAF actually has more humour and wit than this game.

The exposition is as dry as the Sahara, the characters lack depth, the political commentary feels like it was written by a teenage edgelord and the side quests are like a glass of warm milk. I did enjoy the combat for a while, but it all boils down to killing time until you meet the next big boss, so you can turn into Kaiju and beat the living hell out of each other.
The worst sin for me is that not only is cliche and already seen in a thousand of other media, but it is also boring. Barnabas and Ultima are the most boring villains in the franchise. Exdeath and The Emperor arent the most complex villains but at least they are fun.
But that's all Final Fantasys, though, except the ivalice collection and 10
    I feel like there weren’t any big twists or swerves. It was a very by the book storyline with a forgettable villain. Compare it to FF7R, which has a complete mind screw story, charismatic villain, interesting characters and world. Maybe I am just older and FF stories don’t amaze me anymore
        It is probably because it's extremely close to game of thrones in terms of world and character design
Imagine an FF game having an FF story lol Basically all main FF start by fighting some imperium/evil guy and end up killing a (half/ascending) god.
Not well enough, IMO. FF8 couldn't hold my attention and felt like a corny YA novel. I couldn't make it past the first disc.
Yep, the game falls off hard.
    I’m still bitter because I was studying the worldbuilding like I had a test coming up—taking notes of which nation state was doing what, who was trying to take over who, creating a lil google doc of the history to be more concise than the summaries given to us—and then suddenly it was just wholly irrelevant.
 
Like not even taking the backseat just… gone from the plot.
        Yeah. The little history and current events talks were amazing and it really seemed like it was going somewhere. Then suddenly nothing..
            Wrong, the war fucking ended. Odin won. Where else do you take it? That plot ended.
        To be fair nothing matters when you discover a God is cultivating your species for a single person and plans to wipe everyone else out when they have what they want.
It’s that “the real bad guy is behind the first bad guy” troupe Final Fantasy has done before.
Karma farming. Should be against the rules IMHO too as it seeks karma while also clarifying no discussion is wanted.
Because saying the game is bad is false. There's nothing objectively bad about the game. Even it's worst parts.
It depends on what you mean by "writing." The English version had its own script, which offered a different and somewhat superior experience compared to other scripts.
    Isn't that how localization works? And yes, that is the version I played. The writing was top notch.
        In the case of FF16, it's like having one game with two different personalities. I think we need a new term for this, something other than "localization."
I get where you are coming from
"he didn't have any better writers to absolutely knock it out of the park and make his boring mishmash of tropes retroactively interesting" you can say Ishikawa, it's fine 😉
Doubt it
> Are they trying to give the fans what they want or trying to be cutting edge?

Whatever it is, they're failing at both.
    As much as I hate to say it, I agree.
That mother backstory is in the game. So you didn't really read anything or pay attention. Then you either skip content or play on easy if you arent dying more than twice.
Try Final Fantasy Mode. Unfortunately the devs should have realized that this mode needed to be playable from the beginning.
    Waiting for both DLCs to land before I pick the game up again. Question tho, does FF Mode actually make the combat harder or does it just buff the already quite damage spongy enemies with more sponginess?
        I haven't finished it but it seems harder to me. From what I've read, not only do they change the enemy parties and placement but they also make them more aggressive and use more buff/heal spells than in the normal mode. In terms of HP I'm not sure though.
IMO people always say this about new FF titles unless they're a remake of a title they liked. Nobody liked FF8 as much as 7. Same for 9. People hated X until some time passed and now it's among one of the more popular titles. Folks also hated FFXIII and now it's talked about like it's some hidden gem.
    It's not just primacy-bias here. These games are objectively different and no where near as well made as they used to be. People loved 9 when it came out, but it wasn't immediately received as well because it wasn't a Nomura FF that was popularized by 7 and 8. But it was an incredible, consistent, and very fun/deep Final Fantasy. No one ever contested that. 

15 and 16 are them using what they have left in development, but the old teams who made FF have left; so they're trying to create a new gen of FF experiences, but they just aren't landing like they used to. It's sad. 

I've accepted that the FF I love, is no longer something that can be made again.
        It must be subjective because XV ended up selling something like 10 million globally which, for a niche genre, is excellent. According to VG Chartz that is just behind all FFVII sales and more than the PS1 sales for FFVII. They're doing just fine. A loud minority of fans does not negate the continued success of the franchise.
            FFs always sell strong, especially on release day because people trust the established franchise. But I think after 16 and 15 being extremely mixed divisive; FF consumers are burned and won't be going hard on 17 on release day as much as they used to.  

Again sales do not equate enjoyment. SE has pushed their games to be more accessible for a broader audience as RPGs are more of a niche audience. Which is why the game sold better, also multiple platforms like PC sales helped too. 

Therefore, what I said still stands for me. "FF as I'm used to it; the reason I love and became a fan of the franchise, is no longer something I can expect to get anew again"
                Well at least you'll have your FF7 Rebirth and whatever the last in the trilogy will be. Those seem like they will be more along the lines of what you want even if they are action based rather than turn based.
                    I am very hopeful for Rebirth. 🙏
This objectively false lmao
Kupka is such an under utilised character. I was getting really hyped when we killed his girlfriend and he vowed revenge. Then it turned out to be a nothing burger.
    >Then it turned out to be a nothing burger.

Which felt like a lot of things with XVI
Hard disagree 
For me, the opposite is true; I thought it was a good FF with some solid concepts. However, as a game, it was completely bad.
That's funny I could have sworn it has Final Fantasy in the title and was developed by the exact same company that has created all of the other Final Fantasy games.
    And yet it has almost nothing in common in the spirit of those games. Just same assets.
        According to whom?
            Have you not played the previous Final Fantasies??? No Ra and Ga Spells? No Elemental weaknesses? No Limit breaks? (F16 is closer to DMC Devil trigger than actual Limit break). Party members that are actually part of the gameplay?  


No meaningful explorations? Secret bosses? Secret Dungeons? No comprehensive progression system? FF7 had materia, FF10, had the sphere system, FF8 had the GF system.....  


Combat system is just pressing square button and the occasional dodge parry and popping of CDs. Christ, FF15 did this exact same thing except its exponentially better.  


How about story? gratuitous and senseless violence? Music is very underwhelming, even the Octopath Series had better music.  


I can name some more but I have made my point.
                I've played all other mainline titles and completed nearly all of them. Many of your qualms are subjective.


This game's main shtick was the focus on the Eikons and destroying, rather than saving, crystals. Enemies made use of -ra and -ga spells. Your magic was essentially the same thing depending on which Eikon you equiped. A magic blast is essentially the base spell and holding the magic button and releasing makes it more powerful like a -ra spell. The strong elemental abilities from Eikons replace the -ga spells and to me this is much better because not only did you get a strong elemental spell but they all had different AoE and supplemental effects. So many folks get caught up on the lack of a traditional attack/magic system which doesn't really work for more action oriented games. If you want that FF7R uses it with pretty decent success though I dislike how it interrupts the action of the battle.


Many of the maps had places to explore outside of your destination and rewarded you with chests for exploring. There weren't any secret bosses but the trials offered what I would consider to be an acceptable replacement for those looking for challenges. Many of the hunt bosses were fairly challenging too.


Is the ability board not a progression system? I had to be strategic about what I spent my ability points on as soon as I realized that only 3 Eikons could be equipped so some abilities I ended up having to master so I could equip them on different Eikons.


The writing was top notch and much more realistic for a medieval setting than many of the older games. The game won the Best Music and Score award at TGA 2023.


I think it's time some of y'all admit that your criticism is really just preference.
                    It is subjective. That is why I was referring to the "sprit" of being a Final Fantasy. And if you enjoy it, that's fine also.  


You have good good points on being an action game - except the problem is FF15 did this also and its infinitely and objectively better. The state of FF16 is simply unacceptable when there is a solid foundation from  all 15 previous games (and more for the ones that did get a sequel) and this is the best YoshiP has come with?  


Currency has no meaning in this game, and soon you will find that hidden chests and even experience points soon become meaningless. I dont want more of something I don't need. At 1 point in the game I have 100k Gil and the games keeps giving me more? For what? I would get a Legendary or Purple weapon only later to find out I can get a stronger weapon from a Vendor? Really????  


Sidequests are more of a chore rather than something compelling. Hell there is absolutely no incentive for me to explore - not particularly thrilled to go to a shiny object only to pick up 20 gil (thanks YoshiP).  


The first boss fight actually sums up this entire game - fighting the marlboro was utterly meaningless because there was no status abnormalities in this game. The malboro was supposed to be the something very fearful in a Final Fantasy game and it was somehow reduced to an oversize punching bag in this game? I rest my case.
                        I honestly never noticed there weren't any status conditions and I didn't miss them. They would be incredibly annoying in an action game especially when there isn't a spell to heal them and you only have 3 item slots to use mid-battle. Perhaps if there was some way to use Esuna via Eikon magic it would have made sense to include them.
            It doesn't even have classic FF enemies. It has one Moogle which was shoehorned into the game as a hunting board assistant.
                What are you talking about? It has Dragons, Chocobos, Tonberries (in the upcoming DLC), Marlboros, Goblins, Coeurls, Behemoths, Adamantoises, Bombs, Flans, Ahriman, Iron Giants, and an Evil Interdimensional God.
            According to the series itself which established what it's known for and what you come to expect. 16 is just calling itself an FF and wearing "FF clothing", but it's experience when playing the game is NOTHING like an FF.
                If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game. Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.
                    > If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game.

I'm not asking for the same game over and over again.  You're assuming I'm asking for exact carbon copies. I'm not. Folks want something new, but they still want what has brought them back to FF over and over again. Amazing battle/leveling systems with DEPTH, and an amazing cast of characters that you can play and experience alongside with. 

> Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.

- 16 did not have elements. There was no elemental affinity with your attacks which was shocking. The fact I could hit a bomb with Ifrit and Phoenix and it didn't heal it shocked me. 

- Crystals were there, but you destroy them? That felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole to me. Like as if the devs themselves were saying *"we actually hate FF and we want it to die"* Felt like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much. 

- Deicide is a thing that happens a lot, but it's not really what the games are about. 

- There is 0 inventory managment in 16.

- Ability management is so bare bones, I can't even call it a system. Especially at the end of the day it's really just "pick which ability you think looks the coolest" since damage doesn't matter since you have no abilities, elements, status effects, debuffs, knockups, etc, anything (except Garuda's pull down) that matters. Even as a DMC game I am left wanting more depth. FF games have always had SO MUCH DEPTH in their systems! I only expect that because that is the standard they set. and no, I don't want the same thing, I wanted to something new again; like each subsequent Final Fantasy in previous years always did. 

A theme which I feel like each FF has done, to match the first FF ever made is the "Warriors of Light" theme. 

"*A party of unlikely individuals are brought together by the fate and guidance of the crystals to defeat evil and save the kingdom or the world.*" You see this theme reused, and retooled in extremely creative ways with each game. But 16 throws that out the window with giving us just 1 character. 

Even 15, the closest comparison of a FF (from a gameplay standpoint), had a party system. 

Each Final Fantasy felt different and new from its predecessor especially when we started hitting the Sony era. 

What I miss looking forward to is:

- Discovering the new cast of characters and what each character will uniquely bring to battle and the story.

- The new take on their amazing established battle system, or leveling mechanics. Materia, Junction, Abilities, Sphere Grid, Licenses, etc. 

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST. 

> "FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management."

Again I called 16 a game in "FF Clothing" because it had the things you listed, yes; but just having them there doesn't mean that the experience that the series is known for was utilized here. At best their inclusion here is like hanging a poster on a wall of a castle with a crystal in the image and saying "Crystals are in FF16". That's the level of FF inclusion this game had. FF is not what it used to be, and I don't think it ever will be again. It's definitely not an RPG, and it's a far FAR cry from what established Final Fantasy as a leading, industry defining, RPG franchise.  16 felt like a fan made game, with the visuals of a AAA dev.
I mean I will say plenty of bad things about it. From the extremely boring sidequests that are disjointed from the story to the fact that the RPG aspect is nothing more than a small pretense. You just progress linearly, equipment upgrades are always just plain better than the previous one without ever any trade-off and might as well be automated. The combat system is incredibly boring and requires nothing more than mashing the same sequence of attacks as you wait for cooldowns. Mechanically it's one of the weakest FF games ever.  


The kaiju battles are pretty cool but feel like nothing more than interactive movies.
    Sounds like somebody couldn't master the combos and/or couldn't find an ability setup that worked well for them
        No see, that's the problem, it takes so little to find a set of abilities that have similar cooldowns and just let you spam them in an endless repetitive circle. That's literally the entire depth of the combat system.
            Maybe on the regular mode. You can't do that in Final Fantasy mode.
                Ah yes because we should judge the depth of a combat system based on the additional difficulty that is only unlocked after beating the game once.

Get real the vast majority of people are never going to touch new game plus and even then, the combat doesn't get actually deeper you just need to be good at dodging.
                    You have to prioritize which enemies to kill first because they're more aggressive and use more buff/heal abilities. I will agree that FF mode should have been available from the start.
Its gotten a good amount of criticism from fans and reviewers since release. You can see a bunch [here](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=final%20fantasy%20xvi%20is%20disappointing) and [here](https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-xvi/).
Leave your bubble.
It got "bad" reviews in the fantasy world where r/FinalFantasy and r/JRPG live just because it isn't turn based and combat is "ShAlLow" and too "EaSy" while using the rings for help.
Yeah but we are talking about the Final Fantasy, where every single new game must be considered terrible no matter what. And I've never heard of XII bad press, only development hell, I still have to play it, but most people I know consider one of the best in the series.
100%, it’s the best final fantasy game
Factssss
>when did it get "HATE"

Search here and you'll find it. LOTS & LOTS
    I guess that's where I'm at, I don't go looking for hate lmao probably why I don't see it...
??
That's interesting. I never watched game of thrones and almost never watch anime, so those tropes might have been lost on me. I think part of the reason I was fine with the "and now you fight god!" twist is that, as someone who has played Final Fantasy since 2000, I've just come to expect it lol
    It just took some superficial stuff from GoT honestly. Like there's definitely influence in the setting design but the story of the game veers off in a different direction from GoT's political maneuvering fairly quickly. And really doesn't ever match GoT's habit of nihilism and sudden gory death. It is more brutal than the usual FF game but probably not even the most bleak and violent game in the series.

Anyway good bet on not watching Game of Thrones. One of the few cases of the ending actually ruining the whole series.
    Exactly! Some abstract force or emotional hurdle in physical form is always at the end of Final Fantasy. Plus it's a Japanese RPG, it's going to have anime elements. I really want to play 16, but playing the old ones on my Switch until I get the new PlayStation.
>You can tell by how every single post about FFXVI is about which side of the fandom gets hold of the comments first (specially if OP dares to commit the unforgivable sin of actually enjoying the game).

And when the game first came out everyone was saying how incredible, amazing etc it was and there was nothing bad about the game.

The sub went from one extreme to another, and now it's a fairly balanced (maybe a tad towards favourable) than it's been. This is what happens in every release.
I think people forget that every mainline game is divisive since probably 10. 12 got more than it's fair share of hate and even though I still didn't enjoy it a lot it was a good game objectively. 13 was HATED and now people are warming up to it. 15 got all sorts of shit and rightly so, I still liked it well enough. Each game is mechanically different and points to the series for going out of their way to make it that way. 
I don't think "new FF bad" at all. I think 16 is overall a good time, but also pretty flawed in certain areas. And unfortunately this is where things get a bit subjective. I hear your counterpoint about the side quests, and I did most of them,  and to be honest I felt like they really didn't add much. But there really isn't anywhere to go past that. Some people love them, other's don't. I hate apple pie, others gobble it down. Neither of us are right. I think the issue is that often people talk about their preferences in video games as if there is an objectively right answer rather than using those varied opinions to better understand the broader community. Essentially my goal was to show op,who "won't change their mind" that there are criticisms out there that, even though they may not agree, have some logic to them.
Because XVI is great do sumn
    Not the point.  You can say you think nazis are great OR terrible, but if you day you won't change your mind, you're not trying to have a conversation, you're just soapboxing.

And that's fine and all, but it means you deserve to be called out for essentially having on online temper tantrum.

And for the record,  yes I did enjoy XVI and nazis are terrible.
        That's just not true though.  You can have a conversation to share your own opinion and try to understand dissenting opinions (and even opinions that have the same conclusion but different reasoning), even if you're not going to change your mind.

I think Tom Brady is the best football player ever.  There is literally nothing anyone can say that will change that.  That doesn't mean I can't listen to why you think it's somebody else.
            No one in all of time will ever be greater than Tom Brady?  No more football ever, we've peaked!
                Sorry, didn't realize you were eight.
                     And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
                Saying "Tom Brady is the best football player ever" is very different to "There will never be a player as good as Tom Brady".
Yeah, the demo made this game an insta buy for me, the rest felt like a hazy dream. Where the only highlights were* the boss battles. This game was like Cid's daughter, Mid.
Phenomenal & misleading. I enjoyed the game but the demo really presents a false narrative. Take Anabella, she goes from "Selfish, evil woman with a Games of Thrones level of manipulation" to "generic evil step-mother who >!conveniently kills herself so our hero doesn't have to kill her or worse yet, help her survive.!<"
I think it was the best demo I've ever played. Sadly everything afterwards was mid at best.
Yeah, during the demo I figured more would be explained and fleshed out afterwards so it wasn't an issue for me. Other FF titles and good JRPGs in general take the time later to fill in the gaps, not immediately skip 13 years and not look back.
Clive was frustrating. For all the talk about how much better it was to finally have a "mature" hero I found him less complex than teenagers like Tidus.

The entire second half of the game I was just writing fanfiction in my head for how much better everyrhing would be without the villain.

Actual politics! Dealing with the bearer’s curse! A rebellion! Everyone actually using their connections and power to change the world! Anyone besides Clive being relevant for the last 10% of the game!
    It's still insane to me that the solution to discrimination was to just...take away magic. As if the bearers wouldn't still be marked and their offspring oppressed for generations upon generations simply on the basis that their bloodline was once able to use magic. What on earth is this story.

Imagine if there was a story that solved racism by removing all melanin from the world LMAO
        God, I know!!! I picked up on the fact that it might happen a little bit before the final battle and was like “please, god, not this, you don’t have to do this” and then it happened and I was soooo mad. 

Like what was the point! The Ultima plotline would’ve functioned exactly the same without a slavery plotline. It feels like the bearer’s thing only existed to say “Choose your own fate!!” but using SLAVES and oppressed people for that plotline is… inappropriate at best. 

Truly fumbled that. Which sucks because it had the potential to be interesting. 

Should’ve expected very little when Jill kinda just… glossed over being a ward/political slave and then a violated hostage, with almost zero narrative consequence, but everyone rly hyped up the politics (this is when reviewers had mostly only experienced the early game and I refused to see any spoilers after that) and well… oof
            I'm one of those people who was SUPER invested in this game before it came out. I  pored over and memorized every detail that came out and was so into the political setup of these myriad nations and dominants and well we all know how that went. I honestly think I would have come away with a better opinion of the game had I NOT been involved in any prerelease material or cared about the game.

I've seen some people say that it's unfair of critics to basically write a story in their heads and then be mad when it doesn't come to fruition and i can see where they're coming from! But at the same time I also feel like I've only based my expectations on what the devs and narrative were initially setting up and it failed to deliver on its own merits :/
                I feel like if the game spends 20+ hours setting up political intrigue and a rebellion/liberation plotline and then pivots to “this alien god is actually the only thing that matters,” that is on the game and not the gamer. Like narratively it just sucks, objectively.
                    Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
                No, I’m with you.

I enjoyed my time XVI but it also disappointed me because it could have been so much more. I will still give them the benefit of the doubt because they put a really solid game engine together and the groundwork for a fantastic action combat experience.
                It's funny, I feel like I could have written your comment but about FFXIV Endwalker. I haven't played XVI, but I suppose Naoki Yoshida... finds a way. A way to make me feel like I shouldn't have been invested.
        It also felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole? Like as if the devs themselves were saying "we actually hate FF and we want it to die" 

Destroying the crystals and killing magic?! Like it felt so weird, like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much and I couldn't put my finger on it.
I feel like there weren’t any big twists or swerves. It was a very by the book storyline with a forgettable villain. Compare it to FF7R, which has a complete mind screw story, charismatic villain, interesting characters and world. Maybe I am just older and FF stories don’t amaze me anymore
    It is probably because it's extremely close to game of thrones in terms of world and character design
I’m still bitter because I was studying the worldbuilding like I had a test coming up—taking notes of which nation state was doing what, who was trying to take over who, creating a lil google doc of the history to be more concise than the summaries given to us—and then suddenly it was just wholly irrelevant.
 
Like not even taking the backseat just… gone from the plot.
    Yeah. The little history and current events talks were amazing and it really seemed like it was going somewhere. Then suddenly nothing..
        Wrong, the war fucking ended. Odin won. Where else do you take it? That plot ended.
    To be fair nothing matters when you discover a God is cultivating your species for a single person and plans to wipe everyone else out when they have what they want.
Isn't that how localization works? And yes, that is the version I played. The writing was top notch.
    In the case of FF16, it's like having one game with two different personalities. I think we need a new term for this, something other than "localization."
As much as I hate to say it, I agree.
Waiting for both DLCs to land before I pick the game up again. Question tho, does FF Mode actually make the combat harder or does it just buff the already quite damage spongy enemies with more sponginess?
    I haven't finished it but it seems harder to me. From what I've read, not only do they change the enemy parties and placement but they also make them more aggressive and use more buff/heal spells than in the normal mode. In terms of HP I'm not sure though.
It's not just primacy-bias here. These games are objectively different and no where near as well made as they used to be. People loved 9 when it came out, but it wasn't immediately received as well because it wasn't a Nomura FF that was popularized by 7 and 8. But it was an incredible, consistent, and very fun/deep Final Fantasy. No one ever contested that. 

15 and 16 are them using what they have left in development, but the old teams who made FF have left; so they're trying to create a new gen of FF experiences, but they just aren't landing like they used to. It's sad. 

I've accepted that the FF I love, is no longer something that can be made again.
    It must be subjective because XV ended up selling something like 10 million globally which, for a niche genre, is excellent. According to VG Chartz that is just behind all FFVII sales and more than the PS1 sales for FFVII. They're doing just fine. A loud minority of fans does not negate the continued success of the franchise.
        FFs always sell strong, especially on release day because people trust the established franchise. But I think after 16 and 15 being extremely mixed divisive; FF consumers are burned and won't be going hard on 17 on release day as much as they used to.  

Again sales do not equate enjoyment. SE has pushed their games to be more accessible for a broader audience as RPGs are more of a niche audience. Which is why the game sold better, also multiple platforms like PC sales helped too. 

Therefore, what I said still stands for me. "FF as I'm used to it; the reason I love and became a fan of the franchise, is no longer something I can expect to get anew again"
            Well at least you'll have your FF7 Rebirth and whatever the last in the trilogy will be. Those seem like they will be more along the lines of what you want even if they are action based rather than turn based.
                I am very hopeful for Rebirth. 🙏
>Then it turned out to be a nothing burger.

Which felt like a lot of things with XVI
And yet it has almost nothing in common in the spirit of those games. Just same assets.
    According to whom?
        Have you not played the previous Final Fantasies??? No Ra and Ga Spells? No Elemental weaknesses? No Limit breaks? (F16 is closer to DMC Devil trigger than actual Limit break). Party members that are actually part of the gameplay?  


No meaningful explorations? Secret bosses? Secret Dungeons? No comprehensive progression system? FF7 had materia, FF10, had the sphere system, FF8 had the GF system.....  


Combat system is just pressing square button and the occasional dodge parry and popping of CDs. Christ, FF15 did this exact same thing except its exponentially better.  


How about story? gratuitous and senseless violence? Music is very underwhelming, even the Octopath Series had better music.  


I can name some more but I have made my point.
            I've played all other mainline titles and completed nearly all of them. Many of your qualms are subjective.


This game's main shtick was the focus on the Eikons and destroying, rather than saving, crystals. Enemies made use of -ra and -ga spells. Your magic was essentially the same thing depending on which Eikon you equiped. A magic blast is essentially the base spell and holding the magic button and releasing makes it more powerful like a -ra spell. The strong elemental abilities from Eikons replace the -ga spells and to me this is much better because not only did you get a strong elemental spell but they all had different AoE and supplemental effects. So many folks get caught up on the lack of a traditional attack/magic system which doesn't really work for more action oriented games. If you want that FF7R uses it with pretty decent success though I dislike how it interrupts the action of the battle.


Many of the maps had places to explore outside of your destination and rewarded you with chests for exploring. There weren't any secret bosses but the trials offered what I would consider to be an acceptable replacement for those looking for challenges. Many of the hunt bosses were fairly challenging too.


Is the ability board not a progression system? I had to be strategic about what I spent my ability points on as soon as I realized that only 3 Eikons could be equipped so some abilities I ended up having to master so I could equip them on different Eikons.


The writing was top notch and much more realistic for a medieval setting than many of the older games. The game won the Best Music and Score award at TGA 2023.


I think it's time some of y'all admit that your criticism is really just preference.
                It is subjective. That is why I was referring to the "sprit" of being a Final Fantasy. And if you enjoy it, that's fine also.  


You have good good points on being an action game - except the problem is FF15 did this also and its infinitely and objectively better. The state of FF16 is simply unacceptable when there is a solid foundation from  all 15 previous games (and more for the ones that did get a sequel) and this is the best YoshiP has come with?  


Currency has no meaning in this game, and soon you will find that hidden chests and even experience points soon become meaningless. I dont want more of something I don't need. At 1 point in the game I have 100k Gil and the games keeps giving me more? For what? I would get a Legendary or Purple weapon only later to find out I can get a stronger weapon from a Vendor? Really????  


Sidequests are more of a chore rather than something compelling. Hell there is absolutely no incentive for me to explore - not particularly thrilled to go to a shiny object only to pick up 20 gil (thanks YoshiP).  


The first boss fight actually sums up this entire game - fighting the marlboro was utterly meaningless because there was no status abnormalities in this game. The malboro was supposed to be the something very fearful in a Final Fantasy game and it was somehow reduced to an oversize punching bag in this game? I rest my case.
                    I honestly never noticed there weren't any status conditions and I didn't miss them. They would be incredibly annoying in an action game especially when there isn't a spell to heal them and you only have 3 item slots to use mid-battle. Perhaps if there was some way to use Esuna via Eikon magic it would have made sense to include them.
        It doesn't even have classic FF enemies. It has one Moogle which was shoehorned into the game as a hunting board assistant.
            What are you talking about? It has Dragons, Chocobos, Tonberries (in the upcoming DLC), Marlboros, Goblins, Coeurls, Behemoths, Adamantoises, Bombs, Flans, Ahriman, Iron Giants, and an Evil Interdimensional God.
        According to the series itself which established what it's known for and what you come to expect. 16 is just calling itself an FF and wearing "FF clothing", but it's experience when playing the game is NOTHING like an FF.
            If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game. Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.
                > If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game.

I'm not asking for the same game over and over again.  You're assuming I'm asking for exact carbon copies. I'm not. Folks want something new, but they still want what has brought them back to FF over and over again. Amazing battle/leveling systems with DEPTH, and an amazing cast of characters that you can play and experience alongside with. 

> Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.

- 16 did not have elements. There was no elemental affinity with your attacks which was shocking. The fact I could hit a bomb with Ifrit and Phoenix and it didn't heal it shocked me. 

- Crystals were there, but you destroy them? That felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole to me. Like as if the devs themselves were saying *"we actually hate FF and we want it to die"* Felt like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much. 

- Deicide is a thing that happens a lot, but it's not really what the games are about. 

- There is 0 inventory managment in 16.

- Ability management is so bare bones, I can't even call it a system. Especially at the end of the day it's really just "pick which ability you think looks the coolest" since damage doesn't matter since you have no abilities, elements, status effects, debuffs, knockups, etc, anything (except Garuda's pull down) that matters. Even as a DMC game I am left wanting more depth. FF games have always had SO MUCH DEPTH in their systems! I only expect that because that is the standard they set. and no, I don't want the same thing, I wanted to something new again; like each subsequent Final Fantasy in previous years always did. 

A theme which I feel like each FF has done, to match the first FF ever made is the "Warriors of Light" theme. 

"*A party of unlikely individuals are brought together by the fate and guidance of the crystals to defeat evil and save the kingdom or the world.*" You see this theme reused, and retooled in extremely creative ways with each game. But 16 throws that out the window with giving us just 1 character. 

Even 15, the closest comparison of a FF (from a gameplay standpoint), had a party system. 

Each Final Fantasy felt different and new from its predecessor especially when we started hitting the Sony era. 

What I miss looking forward to is:

- Discovering the new cast of characters and what each character will uniquely bring to battle and the story.

- The new take on their amazing established battle system, or leveling mechanics. Materia, Junction, Abilities, Sphere Grid, Licenses, etc. 

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST. 

> "FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management."

Again I called 16 a game in "FF Clothing" because it had the things you listed, yes; but just having them there doesn't mean that the experience that the series is known for was utilized here. At best their inclusion here is like hanging a poster on a wall of a castle with a crystal in the image and saying "Crystals are in FF16". That's the level of FF inclusion this game had. FF is not what it used to be, and I don't think it ever will be again. It's definitely not an RPG, and it's a far FAR cry from what established Final Fantasy as a leading, industry defining, RPG franchise.  16 felt like a fan made game, with the visuals of a AAA dev.
Sounds like somebody couldn't master the combos and/or couldn't find an ability setup that worked well for them
    No see, that's the problem, it takes so little to find a set of abilities that have similar cooldowns and just let you spam them in an endless repetitive circle. That's literally the entire depth of the combat system.
        Maybe on the regular mode. You can't do that in Final Fantasy mode.
            Ah yes because we should judge the depth of a combat system based on the additional difficulty that is only unlocked after beating the game once.

Get real the vast majority of people are never going to touch new game plus and even then, the combat doesn't get actually deeper you just need to be good at dodging.
                You have to prioritize which enemies to kill first because they're more aggressive and use more buff/heal abilities. I will agree that FF mode should have been available from the start.
I guess that's where I'm at, I don't go looking for hate lmao probably why I don't see it...
It just took some superficial stuff from GoT honestly. Like there's definitely influence in the setting design but the story of the game veers off in a different direction from GoT's political maneuvering fairly quickly. And really doesn't ever match GoT's habit of nihilism and sudden gory death. It is more brutal than the usual FF game but probably not even the most bleak and violent game in the series.

Anyway good bet on not watching Game of Thrones. One of the few cases of the ending actually ruining the whole series.
Exactly! Some abstract force or emotional hurdle in physical form is always at the end of Final Fantasy. Plus it's a Japanese RPG, it's going to have anime elements. I really want to play 16, but playing the old ones on my Switch until I get the new PlayStation.
Not the point.  You can say you think nazis are great OR terrible, but if you day you won't change your mind, you're not trying to have a conversation, you're just soapboxing.

And that's fine and all, but it means you deserve to be called out for essentially having on online temper tantrum.

And for the record,  yes I did enjoy XVI and nazis are terrible.
    That's just not true though.  You can have a conversation to share your own opinion and try to understand dissenting opinions (and even opinions that have the same conclusion but different reasoning), even if you're not going to change your mind.

I think Tom Brady is the best football player ever.  There is literally nothing anyone can say that will change that.  That doesn't mean I can't listen to why you think it's somebody else.
        No one in all of time will ever be greater than Tom Brady?  No more football ever, we've peaked!
            Sorry, didn't realize you were eight.
                 And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
            Saying "Tom Brady is the best football player ever" is very different to "There will never be a player as good as Tom Brady".

It's still insane to me that the solution to discrimination was to just...take away magic. As if the bearers wouldn't still be marked and their offspring oppressed for generations upon generations simply on the basis that their bloodline was once able to use magic. What on earth is this story.

Imagine if there was a story that solved racism by removing all melanin from the world LMAO
    God, I know!!! I picked up on the fact that it might happen a little bit before the final battle and was like “please, god, not this, you don’t have to do this” and then it happened and I was soooo mad. 

Like what was the point! The Ultima plotline would’ve functioned exactly the same without a slavery plotline. It feels like the bearer’s thing only existed to say “Choose your own fate!!” but using SLAVES and oppressed people for that plotline is… inappropriate at best. 

Truly fumbled that. Which sucks because it had the potential to be interesting. 

Should’ve expected very little when Jill kinda just… glossed over being a ward/political slave and then a violated hostage, with almost zero narrative consequence, but everyone rly hyped up the politics (this is when reviewers had mostly only experienced the early game and I refused to see any spoilers after that) and well… oof
        I'm one of those people who was SUPER invested in this game before it came out. I  pored over and memorized every detail that came out and was so into the political setup of these myriad nations and dominants and well we all know how that went. I honestly think I would have come away with a better opinion of the game had I NOT been involved in any prerelease material or cared about the game.

I've seen some people say that it's unfair of critics to basically write a story in their heads and then be mad when it doesn't come to fruition and i can see where they're coming from! But at the same time I also feel like I've only based my expectations on what the devs and narrative were initially setting up and it failed to deliver on its own merits :/
            I feel like if the game spends 20+ hours setting up political intrigue and a rebellion/liberation plotline and then pivots to “this alien god is actually the only thing that matters,” that is on the game and not the gamer. Like narratively it just sucks, objectively.
                Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
            No, I’m with you. I was so invested in Clive’s journey and dealing with loss, but then they reveal Joshua is alive and Clive doesn’t have to come to terms with anything he’s done as a result of his grief. Now he’s fighting to protect a boat load of NPCs I didn’t feel a connection to.

I was heavily invested in Benedikta, how she was a villain but also showed vulnerability, how she had a romantic history with Cid, there was so much missed potential there when her battle ended in her brutal death. 

Please don’t get my wrong, I loved Gav, but that role should have been given to Sir Wade. He had the motivation to be a scout for Cid. He’d put his life on the line for Clive, too. Their conversations could have revealed a lot of what happened while Clive was enslaved.

Many people were speculating that Torgal was Fenrir so that wasn’t a surprise. What did surprise me was how little development he got. He’s a non verbal main character. I would trade every Lubor interaction in the game for a few more minutes of Torgal story time.

And really, you could sum up a lot of the story’s issues as having an amazing cast that we don’t get enough of. Even Barnabus got the short end of the stick. He seemed destined for more than just being the big bad’s henchman.

And Ultima? I don’t know man. Cool design and voice, but his backstory didn’t move me. He is pretty much just an Ascian before Shadowbringers made Ascians so interesting.

I know the story was written well before CBU3 penned the masterpieces that were Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but I expected better. They excel at character driven narratives now. This felt like a step back.

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST. 

> "FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management."

Again I called 16 a game in "FF Clothing" because it had the things you listed, yes; but just having them there doesn't mean that the experience that the series is known for was utilized here. At best their inclusion here is like hanging a poster on a wall of a castle with a crystal in the image and saying "Crystals are in FF16". That's the level of FF inclusion this game had. FF is not what it used to be, and I don't think it ever will be again. It's definitely not an RPG, and it's a far FAR cry from what established Final Fantasy as a leading, industry defining, RPG franchise.  16 felt like a fan made game, with the visuals of a AAA dev.
No see, that's the problem, it takes so little to find a set of abilities that have similar cooldowns and just let you spam them in an endless repetitive circle. That's literally the entire depth of the combat system.
    Maybe on the regular mode. You can't do that in Final Fantasy mode.
        Ah yes because we should judge the depth of a combat system based on the additional difficulty that is only unlocked after beating the game once.

Get real the vast majority of people are never going to touch new game plus and even then, the combat doesn't get actually deeper you just need to be good at dodging.
            You have to prioritize which enemies to kill first because they're more aggressive and use more buff/heal abilities. I will agree that FF mode should have been available from the start.
That's just not true though.  You can have a conversation to share your own opinion and try to understand dissenting opinions (and even opinions that have the same conclusion but different reasoning), even if you're not going to change your mind.

I think Tom Brady is the best football player ever.  There is literally nothing anyone can say that will change that.  That doesn't mean I can't listen to why you think it's somebody else.
    No one in all of time will ever be greater than Tom Brady?  No more football ever, we've peaked!
        Sorry, didn't realize you were eight.
             And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
        Saying "Tom Brady is the best football player ever" is very different to "There will never be a player as good as Tom Brady".
God, I know!!! I picked up on the fact that it might happen a little bit before the final battle and was like “please, god, not this, you don’t have to do this” and then it happened and I was soooo mad. 

Like what was the point! The Ultima plotline would’ve functioned exactly the same without a slavery plotline. It feels like the bearer’s thing only existed to say “Choose your own fate!!” but using SLAVES and oppressed people for that plotline is… inappropriate at best. 

Truly fumbled that. Which sucks because it had the potential to be interesting. 

Should’ve expected very little when Jill kinda just… glossed over being a ward/political slave and then a violated hostage, with almost zero narrative consequence, but everyone rly hyped up the politics (this is when reviewers had mostly only experienced the early game and I refused to see any spoilers after that) and well… oof
    I'm one of those people who was SUPER invested in this game before it came out. I  pored over and memorized every detail that came out and was so into the political setup of these myriad nations and dominants and well we all know how that went. I honestly think I would have come away with a better opinion of the game had I NOT been involved in any prerelease material or cared about the game.

I've seen some people say that it's unfair of critics to basically write a story in their heads and then be mad when it doesn't come to fruition and i can see where they're coming from! But at the same time I also feel like I've only based my expectations on what the devs and narrative were initially setting up and it failed to deliver on its own merits :/
        I feel like if the game spends 20+ hours setting up political intrigue and a rebellion/liberation plotline and then pivots to “this alien god is actually the only thing that matters,” that is on the game and not the gamer. Like narratively it just sucks, objectively.
            Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
        No, I’m with you. I was so invested in Clive’s journey and dealing with loss, but then they reveal Joshua is alive and Clive doesn’t have to come to terms with anything he’s done as a result of his grief. Now he’s fighting to protect a boat load of NPCs I didn’t feel a connection to.

I was heavily invested in Benedikta, how she was a villain but also showed vulnerability, how she had a romantic history with Cid, there was so much missed potential there when her battle ended in her brutal death. 

Please don’t get my wrong, I loved Gav, but that role should have been given to Sir Wade. He had the motivation to be a scout for Cid. He’d put his life on the line for Clive, too. Their conversations could have revealed a lot of what happened while Clive was enslaved.

Many people were speculating that Torgal was Fenrir so that wasn’t a surprise. What did surprise me was how little development he got. He’s a non verbal main character. I would trade every Lubor interaction in the game for a few more minutes of Torgal story time.

And really, you could sum up a lot of the story’s issues as having an amazing cast that we don’t get enough of. Even Barnabus got the short end of the stick. He seemed destined for more than just being the big bad’s henchman.

And Ultima? I don’t know man. Cool design and voice, but his backstory didn’t move me. He is pretty much just an Ascian before Shadowbringers made Ascians so interesting.

I know the story was written well before CBU3 penned the masterpieces that were Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but I expected better. They excel at character driven narratives now. This felt like a step back. 

I enjoyed my time XVI but it also disappointed me because it could have been so much more. I will still give them the benefit of the doubt because they put a really solid game engine together and the groundwork for a fantastic action combat experience.
        It's funny, I feel like I could have written your comment but about FFXIV Endwalker. I haven't played XVI, but I suppose Naoki Yoshida... finds a way. A way to make me feel like I shouldn't have been invested.
It also felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole? Like as if the devs themselves were saying "we actually hate FF and we want it to die" 

Destroying the crystals and killing magic?! Like it felt so weird, like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much and I couldn't put my finger on it.
Wrong, the war fucking ended. Odin won. Where else do you take it? That plot ended.
FFs always sell strong, especially on release day because people trust the established franchise. But I think after 16 and 15 being extremely mixed divisive; FF consumers are burned and won't be going hard on 17 on release day as much as they used to.  

Again sales do not equate enjoyment. SE has pushed their games to be more accessible for a broader audience as RPGs are more of a niche audience. Which is why the game sold better, also multiple platforms like PC sales helped too. 

Therefore, what I said still stands for me. "FF as I'm used to it; the reason I love and became a fan of the franchise, is no longer something I can expect to get anew again"
    Well at least you'll have your FF7 Rebirth and whatever the last in the trilogy will be. Those seem like they will be more along the lines of what you want even if they are action based rather than turn based.
        I am very hopeful for Rebirth. 🙏
Have you not played the previous Final Fantasies??? No Ra and Ga Spells? No Elemental weaknesses? No Limit breaks? (F16 is closer to DMC Devil trigger than actual Limit break). Party members that are actually part of the gameplay?  


No meaningful explorations? Secret bosses? Secret Dungeons? No comprehensive progression system? FF7 had materia, FF10, had the sphere system, FF8 had the GF system.....  


Combat system is just pressing square button and the occasional dodge parry and popping of CDs. Christ, FF15 did this exact same thing except its exponentially better.  


How about story? gratuitous and senseless violence? Music is very underwhelming, even the Octopath Series had better music.  


I can name some more but I have made my point.
    I've played all other mainline titles and completed nearly all of them. Many of your qualms are subjective.


This game's main shtick was the focus on the Eikons and destroying, rather than saving, crystals. Enemies made use of -ra and -ga spells. Your magic was essentially the same thing depending on which Eikon you equiped. A magic blast is essentially the base spell and holding the magic button and releasing makes it more powerful like a -ra spell. The strong elemental abilities from Eikons replace the -ga spells and to me this is much better because not only did you get a strong elemental spell but they all had different AoE and supplemental effects. So many folks get caught up on the lack of a traditional attack/magic system which doesn't really work for more action oriented games. If you want that FF7R uses it with pretty decent success though I dislike how it interrupts the action of the battle.


Many of the maps had places to explore outside of your destination and rewarded you with chests for exploring. There weren't any secret bosses but the trials offered what I would consider to be an acceptable replacement for those looking for challenges. Many of the hunt bosses were fairly challenging too.


Is the ability board not a progression system? I had to be strategic about what I spent my ability points on as soon as I realized that only 3 Eikons could be equipped so some abilities I ended up having to master so I could equip them on different Eikons.


The writing was top notch and much more realistic for a medieval setting than many of the older games. The game won the Best Music and Score award at TGA 2023.


I think it's time some of y'all admit that your criticism is really just preference.
        It is subjective. That is why I was referring to the "sprit" of being a Final Fantasy. And if you enjoy it, that's fine also.  


You have good good points on being an action game - except the problem is FF15 did this also and its infinitely and objectively better. The state of FF16 is simply unacceptable when there is a solid foundation from  all 15 previous games (and more for the ones that did get a sequel) and this is the best YoshiP has come with?  


Currency has no meaning in this game, and soon you will find that hidden chests and even experience points soon become meaningless. I dont want more of something I don't need. At 1 point in the game I have 100k Gil and the games keeps giving me more? For what? I would get a Legendary or Purple weapon only later to find out I can get a stronger weapon from a Vendor? Really????  


Sidequests are more of a chore rather than something compelling. Hell there is absolutely no incentive for me to explore - not particularly thrilled to go to a shiny object only to pick up 20 gil (thanks YoshiP).  


The first boss fight actually sums up this entire game - fighting the marlboro was utterly meaningless because there was no status abnormalities in this game. The malboro was supposed to be the something very fearful in a Final Fantasy game and it was somehow reduced to an oversize punching bag in this game? I rest my case.
            I honestly never noticed there weren't any status conditions and I didn't miss them. They would be incredibly annoying in an action game especially when there isn't a spell to heal them and you only have 3 item slots to use mid-battle. Perhaps if there was some way to use Esuna via Eikon magic it would have made sense to include them.
It doesn't even have classic FF enemies. It has one Moogle which was shoehorned into the game as a hunting board assistant.
    What are you talking about? It has Dragons, Chocobos, Tonberries (in the upcoming DLC), Marlboros, Goblins, Coeurls, Behemoths, Adamantoises, Bombs, Flans, Ahriman, Iron Giants, and an Evil Interdimensional God.
According to the series itself which established what it's known for and what you come to expect. 16 is just calling itself an FF and wearing "FF clothing", but it's experience when playing the game is NOTHING like an FF.
    If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game. Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.
        > If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game.

I'm not asking for the same game over and over again.  You're assuming I'm asking for exact carbon copies. I'm not. Folks want something new, but they still want what has brought them back to FF over and over again. Amazing battle/leveling systems with DEPTH, and an amazing cast of characters that you can play and experience alongside with. 

> Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.

- 16 did not have elements. There was no elemental affinity with your attacks which was shocking. The fact I could hit a bomb with Ifrit and Phoenix and it didn't heal it shocked me. 

- Crystals were there, but you destroy them? That felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole to me. Like as if the devs themselves were saying *"we actually hate FF and we want it to die"* Felt like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much. 

- Deicide is a thing that happens a lot, but it's not really what the games are about. 

- There is 0 inventory managment in 16.

- Ability management is so bare bones, I can't even call it a system. Especially at the end of the day it's really just "pick which ability you think looks the coolest" since damage doesn't matter since you have no abilities, elements, status effects, debuffs, knockups, etc, anything (except Garuda's pull down) that matters. Even as a DMC game I am left wanting more depth. FF games have always had SO MUCH DEPTH in their systems! I only expect that because that is the standard they set. and no, I don't want the same thing, I wanted to something new again; like each subsequent Final Fantasy in previous years always did. 

A theme which I feel like each FF has done, to match the first FF ever made is the "Warriors of Light" theme. 

"*A party of unlikely individuals are brought together by the fate and guidance of the crystals to defeat evil and save the kingdom or the world.*" You see this theme reused, and retooled in extremely creative ways with each game. But 16 throws that out the window with giving us just 1 character. 

Even 15, the closest comparison of a FF (from a gameplay standpoint), had a party system. 

Each Final Fantasy felt different and new from its predecessor especially when we started hitting the Sony era. 

What I miss looking forward to is:

- Discovering the new cast of characters and what each character will uniquely bring to battle and the story.

- The new take on their amazing established battle system, or leveling mechanics. Materia, Junction, Abilities, Sphere Grid, Licenses, etc. 

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST.

At 1 point in the game I have 100k Gil and the games keeps giving me more? For what? I would get a Legendary or Purple weapon only later to find out I can get a stronger weapon from a Vendor? Really????  


Sidequests are more of a chore rather than something compelling. Hell there is absolutely no incentive for me to explore - not particularly thrilled to go to a shiny object only to pick up 20 gil (thanks YoshiP).  


The first boss fight actually sums up this entire game - fighting the marlboro was utterly meaningless because there was no status abnormalities in this game. The malboro was supposed to be the something very fearful in a Final Fantasy game and it was somehow reduced to an oversize punching bag in this game? I rest my case.
    I honestly never noticed there weren't any status conditions and I didn't miss them. They would be incredibly annoying in an action game especially when there isn't a spell to heal them and you only have 3 item slots to use mid-battle. Perhaps if there was some way to use Esuna via Eikon magic it would have made sense to include them.
> If creating the same game over and over again were a viable option they would continue doing that. It isn't. Folks want something new. Just because it doesn't have the exact same mechanics as the original FF games does not mean it isn't a FF game.

I'm not asking for the same game over and over again.  You're assuming I'm asking for exact carbon copies. I'm not. Folks want something new, but they still want what has brought them back to FF over and over again. Amazing battle/leveling systems with DEPTH, and an amazing cast of characters that you can play and experience alongside with. 

> Many of the FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management.

- 16 did not have elements. There was no elemental affinity with your attacks which was shocking. The fact I could hit a bomb with Ifrit and Phoenix and it didn't heal it shocked me. 

- Crystals were there, but you destroy them? That felt like it was spitting in the face of theme of Final Fantasy as a whole to me. Like as if the devs themselves were saying *"we actually hate FF and we want it to die"* Felt like being betrayed by someone you trust. I think that's part of why it irks me so much. 

- Deicide is a thing that happens a lot, but it's not really what the games are about. 

- There is 0 inventory managment in 16.

- Ability management is so bare bones, I can't even call it a system. Especially at the end of the day it's really just "pick which ability you think looks the coolest" since damage doesn't matter since you have no abilities, elements, status effects, debuffs, knockups, etc, anything (except Garuda's pull down) that matters. Even as a DMC game I am left wanting more depth. FF games have always had SO MUCH DEPTH in their systems! I only expect that because that is the standard they set. and no, I don't want the same thing, I wanted to something new again; like each subsequent Final Fantasy in previous years always did. 

A theme which I feel like each FF has done, to match the first FF ever made is the "Warriors of Light" theme. 

"*A party of unlikely individuals are brought together by the fate and guidance of the crystals to defeat evil and save the kingdom or the world.*" You see this theme reused, and retooled in extremely creative ways with each game. But 16 throws that out the window with giving us just 1 character. 

Even 15, the closest comparison of a FF (from a gameplay standpoint), had a party system. 

Each Final Fantasy felt different and new from its predecessor especially when we started hitting the Sony era. 

What I miss looking forward to is:

- Discovering the new cast of characters and what each character will uniquely bring to battle and the story.

- The new take on their amazing established battle system, or leveling mechanics. Materia, Junction, Abilities, Sphere Grid, Licenses, etc. 

- Exploring the world and finding secret hidden lore, or caves, or hidden Espers/Eikons, and then discovering side quests that both gave backstory or amazing boons to the characters or party as a whole. I mean there were secret characters in some FFs that you could miss! That's A SIDE QUEST. 

> "FF elements are there: elements, crystals, deicide, inventory and ability management."

Again I called 16 a game in "FF Clothing" because it had the things you listed, yes; but just having them there doesn't mean that the experience that the series is known for was utilized here. At best their inclusion here is like hanging a poster on a wall of a castle with a crystal in the image and saying "Crystals are in FF16". That's the level of FF inclusion this game had. FF is not what it used to be, and I don't think it ever will be again. It's definitely not an RPG, and it's a far FAR cry from what established Final Fantasy as a leading, industry defining, RPG franchise.  16 felt like a fan made game, with the visuals of a AAA dev.
You have to prioritize which enemies to kill first because they're more aggressive and use more buff/heal abilities. I will agree that FF mode should have been available from the start.
 And defaulting into insults doesn't make you a child? How very 'mature' of you.
Not that I disagree with you but Ultima wasn't an alien nor a god.
