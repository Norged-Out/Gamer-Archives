[[Is Black and White 2 worth playing]]


So since leaving the series since I finished Pearl I've recently come back to playing Pokemon again. I've managed to complete atleast 1 game from each generation apart from Gen 7 (Really can't get into sun)

I've played Black and quite liked it, is it worth trying out Black 2? Is it much better? Am I missing much by not playing the remake? What are your thought on the game?

The prices on Black and White 2 are crazy so feel I should get lots of opinons before purchasing a copy.

Thank you!

EDIT: Wow, guys I love the response to this and a big thank you to each and everyone of you. I've read all your comments and have put a bid down on a copy I've found on eBay. I'm in the UK, if any of you have a copy for sale feel free to send me a message! Also a big thank you to the award, that's my first ever award üòÅ‚ù§


Black 2 and White 2 are sequels, not remakes.

And yes they are very good games and are worth playing.
    BW2 and platinum are my fave pokemon games. I think BW2 has the most content (both variety and volume) out of all pokemon games
        Battle tower on black 2 was absolutely fantastic.
            Best place to ev train. The PWT is the test of battles against nostalgia trainers, reminds me of the Battle Frontier.
                I absolutely loved black 2. Hell I‚Äôm replaying it right now, trying to do a challenge (not sure if it has a name) where I can only use pokemon on the route directly before the gym. Hasn‚Äôt been too hard yet, except for Elesa, but honestly is there anything that can make her easy?
                    > there anything that can make her easy?

Besides grinding those caught Pokemon? Doubt it since all her Pokemon has Volt Switch.

But me too, I'm also playing Black 2 literally right now, grinding Pokemon in the Tower for a future project I plan on uploading at a later date.
                        I usually use gen 5 and lower to farm levels because I can transfer them to black 2 for tower farming lol, and you can set it on hard to make all trainers like 10 levels higher. Gen 5 is a godsend
                        I had to train up a sandshrew just beat her in my last play through. I had an Espeon, Vaporeon, Lilligant, and Golbat. Gave me a new respect for Joltik
                    She gave me problems in a challenge mode run I did a few months ago.
            That place is low-key disturbing on its higher levels.
    Even if they were remakes. They're still worth playing.
        If they were remakes they would be completely different games so we don't know if it would be worth playing
            However if they were hg/ss style remakes i would literally chase nintendo down to throw my money at them.

Hg/ss were remakes perfected... it only went downhill after that (BD/SP isnt out yet so idk what quality of remakes they will be but they look great).
                Johto is paced very badly, way too grind-heavy, and the gem 2 pokemon are too rare.
                Sure buddy... Heart gold and Soul Silver improved a lot from gen 2 but they are still trash games. Hear me out. Grinding? Sucks. Gym leaders? Suck. (Except Clair her kingdra can dish out ohko's upon ohko's with sniper crits. And no Whitney is fricking easy) They way the handled non-linearty? Sucks. The dex before johto? Full of kanto. Kanto post-game? Literally THE worst type of post-game. There was barely any fun involved. Except for fighting weak kanto gym leaders except blue and except for fighting red, the post-game was non existent. I agree that the music was good and the games look beautiful, but the flaws of johto were still mostly there. Also following Pokemon don't make up for this pile of issues.

And then people choose to hate sword and shield for being underwhelming. This game had wayy more potential, but people are blinded by following Pokemon and nostalgia.
                    The worst thing is the grinding. Makes the game just not fun imo
                        True. I remember spending days upon days grinding for Morty on the route below ecrutic (idk the spelling, sorry). It took literally more than 10 hours to go from 19 to 25 on like 8-9 mons. I hated the experience
                    >thinking sw/sh is better than hg/ss
Opinion disregarded
    I‚Äôve heard that BW are more different than each other than any other gen, even having completely different regions to explore. In that case, should I switch to White 2 from Black to get a ‚Äúfull‚Äù Unova experience?
        They change the way you move through the region in BW2 compared to BW and change the last gym leader. Basically, it‚Äôs meant to 2 years after the events of BW so they update character models and they had a larger regional dex (as opposed to the gen5 only one from before). There are a lot of references and a bit of world building done in BW that will enhance your experience of BW2. Worth a shot to put your play through on pause and give the first games a try :)
        If you have played Black, then play Black 2 and if you have played White, then play White 2.
If you have your original B/W playthrough you can connect it to B/W2 and get special cutscenes about your character. 

Black 2/White 2 are everything I loved about Unova and so much more. 5th gen is my fav gen anyway though...so I'm pretty bias. 

10/10 would recommend
    I just started playing black 2 a few days ago after beating black. I didn't know you could connect the two.. do you know how I would go about doing this?! Any help would be appreciated!
        You need 2 DSs and on the main screen for black 2, scroll down to unova link and then memory link and choose the link via ds wireless communications. On the other ds with black, go on ds download play and choose black 2. I think the game explains it if I missed anything
            Ahhh, the old convoluted way to access a good feature presented by Nintendo/GF. Just like the difficulty options. Such awful implementation.
                The difficulty selectors suck. They should be available right from the beginning.
                    This is a joke right? There‚Äôs no difficulty selector right?
                        After you beat either black or white 2 you get access to easy or challenge mode.
                            Black 2 gives you challenge, White 2 gives easy. Just so its clear. And then you can give the 'key' to unlock the difficulty to another game.
                the difficultys suck and are bad but this is basically the only way to do something like this on a system with no internal memory storage unless gamefreak decided to go full on sonic and knuckles
                To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down.
        It‚Äôs called unova link and it‚Äôs on the starting screen of bw2. All you need is two ds‚Äôs. It‚Äôs infrared connection so you use unova link on bw2 while using download play on the ds with bw1 in it
            > owning two gaming devices to access a feature in one game
                Save data was stored on the game card back then, so there wasn‚Äôt a much better way to link your old file
                    You used to be able to do it over the Global Link too.
                To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World, no need for 2DSes. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down. Specifically it's a workaround for the original DS and DS lite, which were the main systems at the time and had little accessible internal memory.
                This was standard from gen 5 and back. In fact, it started to be a thing with Gold/Silver when you could transfer your Red/Blue team to it. It only stopped being a thing momentarily with Gen 3 to 4 and the Pal Park, and permanently with PokeTransfer/Bank/Home until Gen 5 to 6
        I think the connecting thingy (was it called Dream Link?) is possible anymore as support servers were taken down, but its probs possible if you emulate it.
    Wait how do you connect because I have both of the games just sitting rn
        Someone posted down below

2 DS s
Black 2 select memory connect
Black 1 D's download play
    In addition to extra cutscenes and dialgoue referencing your player character from B/W1, the link also allows you to catch nearly all of the Pokemon N used and released (they have a unique battle entry animation similar to shiny Pokemon and have IVs of 30 across the board, the animation was not kept in later games if you transfer up).  You can also challenge Bianca and Cheron to post-game battles where they will use the final teams they had as well, along with their original rival battle themes.
    Dang, I completely forgot about this feature even though I just completed Black 2 and White 2 (defeated E4). Does this works with emulators or R4?
B2W2 is absolutely worth playing! It's by far the most different "special version", it's basically a sequel. You get a ton of new places to see, lots of new pretty exciting gameplay, a better Pokedex and even better visuals. It's, in my humble opinion, the best main line game! There is so much love put into this game and so much damn content! Definitely check it out!
    >B2W2 is absolutely worth playing! It's by far the most different "special version", it's basically a sequel.

I mean, it's *literally* a sequel.
        Black 3 and White 3 come in a special trilogy set as you are suppose to play all three games one after another.
            I wish
            You tease
            Please I need more N
        True \^\^.
        Yeah, but it‚Äôs a lot more similar to the first version than most game sequels are. I think ‚Äúbasically a sequel‚Äù is correct, because in many ways, it‚Äôs also just a third version
            It‚Äôs not though, because it‚Äôs literally a sequel. Calling USUM a third version is fair - though the events are somewhat different it‚Äôs the same basic story (boy becomes first champion of Alola). 

B2W2 outright references shit that happened in BW constantly. It‚Äôs not a third version.
            The mechanics are the same and they have the same general selection of pokemon. That‚Äôs it.

It has new main characters and a new story that literally takes place after the previous one. Kind of the definition of a sequel.
                They actually have a much broader selection of Pok√©mon in B2W2. In the original, you can only catch the gen 5 ones before defeating the elite 4, but in the second game you could catch pokemon from different regions immediately.
                You also traverse to basically the same areas and routes. Most sequels have completely new level design, which IMO is a bigger portion of the games "content" than the plot.
            That's like saying Trails in the Sky SC isn't a sequel to FC because it's in the same region.
                No one knows what any of that means
                    For some reason I thought this was /r/JRPG.

Anyways, those two games use the exact same region, map, locations etc, but they're direct sequels.
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a sequel‚Äù
It is a sequel, it expands on the previous story, different main character, different rival, returning characters that have changed since we last seen them, new gym leaders + champion.
        > It is a sequel

It is funny how confusing this is.  

I obviously understand why: Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum all set the precedent for this kind of GOTY style "remake"

But at the same time, the game is literally called "Black 2 / White 2", as in, "The sequel to Black / White"
            I'm late to reply, but they're called version 2. Slight difference imo.
                That's because the full titles for Black and White are "Pokemon Black Version" and "Pokemon White Version." All the mainline games had the word version in the title until X and Y.
        Yeah, you are absolutely correct!
    
>There is so much love put into this game

I think that's the thing that makes BW and its sequel so good. You can just tell the amount of passion that went into it. The game has so much detail in it's world, the sprite animations in battles, the camera angles as you travel through certain areas, the 4 seasons that change the look of all the zones. The game feels so alive. 

They went absolutely wild with the presentation of that game and I wish we got a few more games in that style of 2D blended with subtle 3D. It's what Gamefreak does best imo. I think it's clear that they're still struggling with 3D to this day. It would be nice if they was allowed a year or two off so the developers can figure things out and create a proper groundwork for their 3D games.
        Absolutely agree, doing a nuzlocke of BW2 right now and every detail, no matter how small, is just so amazing. Gyms having their own personalized ‚Äòtwists‚Äô of the main overworld gym theme, the music in caves getting pitch lowered as u go down floors, Marshal blocking you from twist mountain, how every town has so many NPCs that give you great items, encouraging you to check out every building. 

Dont get me started on the caves and routes, which also highly encourage and reward thoroughly exploring every area and how useful tms involve quite a journey to obtain (IE: Toxic, rock slide). Compared to the games that came after BW2, you can tell they really put their all into this one. Can feel the passion they put into everything.
            The exploration part is so underrated. Having useful items like TMs at the end of dungeon areas really encourages players to search everywhere for extra bits. And there's a lot of extra things to do in that game (Yancy mission is insane).
            Dude, I love nuzlocking, and I have consistently found b/w2 by far the most challenging! Maybe it's my lack of game knowledge, as I didn't play the game when it came out. But I think it's a really rich and rewarding experience - I assumed the game would be nothing special and I was blown away when I picked it up
        And it has [the single best piece of music in all of Pokemon](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pF1n0GflZMg)
            Both Team Plasma grunt themes from gen 5 are some of my all time favourite game music. Neo Team Plasma's theme sounds like a boss theme.

They really went all out in the music for this generation and I love it
Yes. There are new cool locations, new features like the PWT and you can use pokemon from previous gens. They're the best mainline games, if you ask me.
    [removed]
        And with the PWT final theme is probably the most underrated battle theme since a lot of people hasn‚Äôt played the PWT
The quality of life changes, the new forms, story, changes to the landscape and new characters are all worth it, even better than the first games imo. I've poured over 350 hours into White Version 2, it's my favourite game in the series
    Same I got white 2 on the day it came out and am still playing it to this day.
        your insane
    Well, new forms is a bit exageration, you're getting keldeo's resolute form and therian formes, but as those games are old you won't get keldeo from a distribution unless traded and forces of nature are dream radar only.

Don't get me wrong, I just finished the main story of White 2 (it is indeed quite long) and I admit, this game does its job well (although it is definitely not perfect and few things stings even today). This continuation is a bit better approach than revisited alola in sun/ultra sun, although you're losing some context if you didn't play BW games.

I'm a bit saddened that few features are not accessible at all at this moment (getting black city or challenge mode is close to impossible with scarcity of games available). You'd say those are mostly cosmetic, but i.e. beating black city fights gives you special EVs + speed, while beating white treehollow gives you HP/AT/DEF EVs. Small thing, technically irrelevant, but stings (especially when reshiram/white kyurem is a special attacker).

Without PGL this game loses a lot of its value.

IMHO it all depends on the price of the game at this moment though.
        Most are playing on 3DS so Dream Radar is readily accessible. I've managed to get event Pok√©mon such as Keldeo through a Youtube video explaining how to get them from connecting to a specific server. While you can argue if it is legit or not, you can still get them.

"I'm a bit saddened that few features are not accessible at all at this moment (getting black city or challenge mode is close to impossible with scarcity of games available)."

While true, we are talking about the sequels after all so getting those through international trading/befriending is irrelevant because the system is different and they are accessible once you complete the story. Both Black Tower and White tree-hollow offer a shiny Pok√©mon if you make it to the end so along with the EV training it is a neat edition to the game.
Definitely worth playing. Don‚Äôt feel bad emulating it because 1. Getting the game 2nd hand is expensive as shit and 2. Nintendo isn‚Äôt selling the game anymore for some reason

Edit: oh and if you're worried about trading to your actual cartridges, theres always an option to have a homebrewed 3DS/2DS so that you can load and play it on an SD card and it will work just as good.
    I second this. You‚Äôre not taking money from Nintendo or game freak because it is no longer being produced. I haven‚Äôt downloaded switch emulators and played the new games yet for this reason, I can‚Äôt afford it but I don‚Äôt want to steal.
    If a product ain't for sale, it's abandonware as far as I'm concerned.
    I have a homebrewed 3ds but I don‚Äôt know how/where to get b2 or w2
        google "roms github" and it's the first link
My favorites in the whole series. Definitely!
B2W2 was gamefreaks last hurrah with 2d before moving to 3D with the 3DS and you can tell they put so much effort into it. All the Pok√©mon are animated, all the trainers are animated, they put so much love and care into these games there‚Äôs a reason a lot of people call them the best mainline games.
Best Pokemon game on DS alongside HGSS. You won't regret it.
    Both platinum and the original black and white are better than HGSS
        Fuck no
Honestly I think Black/White2 is much better than the first one so it's definitely worth it!
It's better than black and white 1 by basically every metric. Best post game in the franchise imo as well, if you're into that kind of thing
    Personally I find the story and the characters of BW to be *leagues* better than B2W2, to the point that BW remain my favorite. In terms of just gameplay features though, the sequels certainly improve on the original.
        Agreed on characters. The B/W 1 gym leaders being involved in the overarching story and having so much individual personality was dope. I‚Äôm actually in the B/W 2 post game right now and it‚Äôs great too but it feels like your main character is kinda doing his/her own thing.
        Eh sure. I find neither to be particularly good so it doesn't really factor in for me.
I mean, download a rom if you must, but 

#YES
It's a return to formula compared to B/W1, but it's good. I love how it expands on Unova and all the new areas you can go to.

It's best if you've played B/W1 already, as you'll meet a lot of characters you used to know and see how they are doing now.
Black/White 2 is the best games in the series, for me. Best music, good selection of Pok√©mon, reasonable level curve and difficulty, best story after BW1, and LOTS of postgame content. My only real gripes with the game are that Pok√©Star Studios can fuck off and it's quite linear with lots of roadblocks. BW2 is Game Freak's magnum opus, if only it had gotten the love it deserved at the time. The last great Pok√©mon game.
top 3 pokemon game for me. has a compelling story, more exploration/a larger world than usual, one of the best regional dexes of any game, and on top of that, being genuinely challenging. please play it if you like pokemon (but play black or white first)
    The route trainers in the post game have INSANE teams! I went to go get the Magma Stone on Route 18 and couldn‚Äôt believe how powerful the teams these complete randoms have! It‚Äôs fun and challenging.
        Preschoolers with Pok√©mon higher level than my whole team
It's not a remake. It's quite literally a sequel that's why theres a "2" in the title. And they're the  best games in the franchise
Totally, they're arguably the best games in the series. They're proper sequels to B/W, set a few years later, and they're really, really fun, with a great plot, greater music, and the PWT, which is the greatest.

And there's pokestar studios as well, that may be a glorified minigane where it's just "pick the correct move" but it's funny and cool and the movies all come out like animated comics and half the time during "shooting" you're fighting props or mocap suit guys like one great big affectionate prod at movie making itself and I love it
    The little details like this are so funny.
        I‚Äôm actually in the post game right now of my first ever play through of Black 2. And I just got to N‚Äôs Castle again and this game is WILD AF
Black 2 and White 2 are extremely different from the prequels, that it‚Äôs best to consider them completely different. (It‚Äôs not like other advanced versions with just some enhancements, the general story is very different). 

You‚Äôre missing a lot by not playing b2 or w2.
b2w2 is a direct sequel with an entirely new story than bw, so i'd say it's worth it.
I thought this was talking about the old PC game Black & White 2 and was about to give you an ecstatic rundown on why you should... but then I saw what sub this was in... B2W2 is dope but if anyone reads this, check out Black & White 2 if you get a chance. It's a game about being a god and amassing followers and using their prayers to become more powerful and using a ~~pokemon~~ anthropomorphic animal monster to fight other ~~pokemon~~ anthropomorphic animal monsters.
Completely worth it. I think it's one of if not the most complete game in the series.
One of the best Pokemon mainline games ever made. Very underrated compared to the other versions. Definitely a must play if you're a Pokemon fan.
I mean, if it's > $100, I wouldn't paying for it, even though I did enjoy it a bunch. 

I say try to find a friend that has a copy or something and either buy it, rent it, or borrow it, depending on how comfortable you are with them. 

Of course, it all matters on how much you're willing to spend on the game. And also if you know someone with a copy.
I would recommend playing Black/White first since BW2 are the sequel to those games, but they are very good games. So yes, I would recommend that you play those games.
Currently playing Black 2 right after a Black 1 run! It‚Äôs much better than the first one and holds up well today.
Personally I think yes they are! BUT-buying copies is a mug's game. Nintendo DS cards that old tend to not work right.

I think your best bet is to use an emulator on your computer or phone. It's free, and a LOT more reliable. I use DraStic on my Android phone and it works like a dream with the Pokemon series.
    Why wouldn't they work? I have all my games back to pokemon blue and yellow. And only yellow don't work. Can't save. My silver still works. My GBA emerald version still works. 

I have SS, pearl, platinum, BW, BW2, all work perfectly.
Load up the game and listen to that intro themeüî•
Get an emulator. Black 2 is amazing
Yes
Yes
100000000%
Yes
It most definitely is,a lot of post game content,mainline game is pretty good for a sequel and the music is amazing too
Hail Yeah!
B2W2 are awesome
B2W2 are probably the best games in terms of Pok√©mon diversity and difficulty level as well as music.
One of the most fun games to nuzlocke and one of the hardest in the series. You will have a blast. (Might I recommend investing your time in catching a riolu in floccesy ranch? 

Also PS: the game gets better after the stupid move thing please get through it
Black and White 2 is a special game man. In terms of Pok√©mon game immediate sequels, I think B2W2 absolutely crushed it. They kept all the same features that made Unova cool, and then literally added nearly everything a fan could‚Äôve asked for
Favorite game in the entire series. Absolutely worth it.
B2W2 is the series at its best. It‚Äôs not perfect, there are things it‚Äôs missing that I wish were in it (like a full battle frontier and Pok√©mon that follow you), but there‚Äôs so much content, so many Pok√©mon, so much to do and see. It‚Äôs an amazing game
It's different enough I'd play it if you can get a good deal or don't mind emulation, but similar enough that I wouldn't pay a ridiculous amount for it.
Absolutely, it‚Äôs a whole new story after the original Black and White
It's story isn't as good as the original black and white. But it's still really enjoyable, and very different from the originals. Would recommend
I loved white 2 it is difficult and fresh
Yes, but don't play it immediately after BW

Idk if it's just me but I get burned out after playing B2W2

Either that or I didn't have a team that I got super attached too and so, I got kinda bored of them
Definitely. In my opinion they are the best overall games in the entire series. Great story with interesting charackters, maybe the best region with just lots to explore both during the story and in the post game, Phantastik choice of available Pok√©mon,  imo the graphic style that brought the Pok√©mon to live the most, a ton of thing to do in the post game and even an available hard mode (although you have to unlock it first). My favorite games are D.P.PT but they are in my opinion definitely the best overall package of the entire series.
Just emulate it for free, and yes they‚Äôre worth playing they‚Äôre better than most Pok√©mon games
I enjoyed them, story is almost as good as BW but with various other things better.

Get an emulator and play, you'll enjoy.
I found a version of black 2 in my 3ds while cleaning out my junk droor. Don't remember buying it and dont have the case but have been playing it for the first time and it feels almost like the best version of the 2d games.
It‚Äôs the superior game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, gen 5 is my favorite generation. B2W2 is the better story, amount of Pok√©mon, and characters.
    Look, I liked B2W2 mechanically, but BW‚Äôs story and characters are so much better, they‚Äôre not even comparable. BW remains the gold standard for storytelling in the Pok√©mon franchise to me.
    Riolu on the first route is the best.
    B2W2 in no world is the better story, you're kidding yourself when you say that, BW1 is one of the better ones in terms of story, but B2W2 is XY bad in story
For someone who was in a similar boat, yes it's worth a go.
They are the best main games.
For me, the endgame in B&W2 is my favorite in the entire series. The PWT is just *cool.*
Ther short answer, YES
200% must play game imo
YES YES YES PLEASE PLAY BLACK 2 PLEASE OR EVEN WHITE 2
Just emulate it.
Black and White 2 are very different games from the originals. They‚Äôre sequels where the characters have progressed and are often in different roles, a couple of new towns are included in previously unused parts of the map, there are plenty of older Pok√©mon joining the roster (including some good ones available early game), the gyms are shuffled up with different layouts. The adventure is much different and I very highly recommend playing these games.
Black and white suck compared to 2. They are absolutely worth playing.
Yes and extra yes. BW and BW 2 are honestly where gamefreak peaked on what a good pokemon game should be.
BW2 are not remakes, they are sequels, and yes, I do think you should play them. They are really good, very complete games!
It's totally worth it
Yes
Black and White 2 is worth playing. Black and White 1 isn‚Äôt. I quit the first one because it was just so long and draggy. I didn‚Äôt finish it and sold it. 2 kept me much more entertained.
I found B2 to be better than the previous game. Def worth playing
Black and white 2 are bloody amazing games after some people really didn't like black and white. Personally I love them I love the region and the pokemon I also really liked what they did in the 2nd ones ifmypu.havnt played them do it and don't look back. Actually I'm going to go and get my 3DS and play it aswell lol.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

Source: Grew up playing White 2
Absolutely! They're pretty awesome, especially how the music works. You unlock layers by doing certain things like walking/running or talking to certain people.
why would you even buy the original cartridges if they are so insanely expensive? emulators exist
I love BW2 more than BW1 and thats because its ecerything that I love about pkmn and more. Battles, moving sprites, just everything.
Black and White 2 were fantastic games. Honestly, they fixed most of my gripes with the OG Black and White in them.

Prices are crazy? How crazy is crazy?

Don't go dropping 80 bucks on them if that's what you're considering. They're great games but not *that* good. Get Heartgold or Soulsilver if you're gonna do something like that.
Yes
White and white 2 were some of my favourite pokemon games. It added some new features to the series as well as animated sprites. And I loved how the second one was a sequel further expanding on the story. Something I hope they do again in future games.
I‚Äôm playing through Black 2 at the moment and it‚Äôs still one of my top 5 Pok√©mon games! Hope you enjoy it if you can get a copy üòä
the whole gen 5 is worth playing
of course, they are imo the best games in the series hands down. Also they are sequels not remakes. Enjoy! And try to collect every medal in the game (Kind of achievement system)
You should *absolutely* pirate the older Pokemon games. Spending more than MSRP on these games is ridiculous. If Nintendo does not want people to pirate their games, they should make them available for purchase.
Absolutely! Unlike Emerald and Platinum which are just enhanced versions of Ruby and Sapphire and Diamond and Pearl respectively, Black and White 2 are literal sequels of the black and white series. They have new places, an awesome post game, past-gen pokemon (especially at the start, you can literally get a Riolu, Mareep and so much more within the first routes of the game), a banger soundtrack, and did I mention the really great story?

Ofc it does have some downsides, the start can be really slow, but overall it's a fantastic set of games, best mainline games imo
Black and white 2 was the last 10/10 pokemon game
Extremely worth it, even the postgame is something you could play for hours and hours but get an emulator if it's that pricey for you
Definitely. It's a direct sequel with an interesting followup to the villains from the first games, you get to see how Bianca and Cheren have grown up, new areas to explore, and a satisfying resolution to N's storyline. Plus a bigger selection of Pokemon.
Yes. Speaking as someone that _loathed_ BW1, BW2 is probably what I consider the best main line games. Gen 5 is my least favourite (though Alola gave it competition) but BW2 fixed it and then some. They added old mons so you‚Äôre not completely forced to use all gen 5 mons. The hard difficulty setting is the best experience yet, I wished all games did that. It gave all gym leaders more pokemons and up their levels. My EV train team actually got beaten by Elesa and I loved it. Plus the post game championships bring back all previous gen gym leaders and important characters. Was well worth playing.
    Woah! There‚Äôs a difficulty setting?? 

I have the same exact takes as you but skipped 2 because I just wasn‚Äôt into 1. I will give this a shot!
        > Woah! There‚Äôs a difficulty setting??

Yes. But in typical gamefreak incompetence they implemented it in a really backward way. Black 2, once you‚Äôve beaten the elite 4, unlocks the hard mode, and white 2 unlocks easy mode. But you can‚Äôt restart the game and keep the mode. 

What you need to do is having a completed black 2 cart with a ds, another cart of b2/w2 with another ds and do infrared transfer to the second cart to start a new game in hard mode. And both carts need to be real as fake carts can‚Äôt do infrared. 

So unless you have _real life friends_ with a real completed black 2 cart and a ds, it‚Äôs kinda impossible to access hard mode in a legit way. So the best way to do it is via cheating unfortunately.

Gamefreak. Incompetence. Name a more iconic duo.
I think bw is better just cos it's the authentic experience but b2w2 is better in more ways, u should play it
Everyone is giving their opinions on B&W but I'd like to add that if you're going to play Gen 7 play Ultra Sun/Moon. They're seriously underrated imo. And you dont need to play the original first.
No
Best Pok√©mon game ever created.
Skip Gen 5. It sucksssss
Wait for the remakes
    In 2027?
        Why are people today so impatient? I missed gen 4 and gen 5 and can wait for the remakes.

I was particularly disappointed with US/UM being so similar to S/M and being a blatant cash grab by Nintendo.

If OP has Black, then Black 2 isn't going to be an earth shattering experience for them
            You don't understand. Black 2 is not the same game as Black like USUM is to SM or Platinum is to DP. Black 2 is a sequel that takes place years after Black with a different protagonist, different plot, different gym leaders, somewhat different villains, even a different starting town and exploring different parts of the same region. Not to mention quality of life improvements like immediately being asked if you want to use another repel instead of having to go into your bag.
                There have been more quality of life improvements since those games were released so going backwards isnt going to rock OPs world. With regards to story, there are websites and videos that can catch you up without the time and expense, I mean, it's not exactly an immersive, theatrical experience. A lot of the changes remind me of going back to Kanto once you have finished Jotho in Gold & Silver... "wow, im doing things in different order", "wow, these pokemon are at different levels/places to last time", "cool, there is a different person to encounter at this location".
Its the best god game by Molyneux, but its a bit dated nowadays.
Play the hack of drayano, blaze black 2. It's the best
I love bw2, gen 5 in general was so much fun and had such interesting pokemon. It also sort of shows some of the characters from bw and how they‚Äôve changed. If you don‚Äôt want to buy it or feel on the fence, you can always emulate it. I recommend desmume if you do! Good luck, I hope you give the games a chance!
Black/White 2 are very worth playing (why the heck is there a black and white 2 anyways)
I only played bw2 is it worth playing bw?
Worth playing. I'd get a rom of it to play it though and if you really like it then go get a copy of the game.
most underrated games in the series
Yes yes, if I wasn‚Äôt crap at games before gen 6 I would love it a lot
Advice on Gen 7: Skip Sun/Moon. They were horrible. Ultrasun and Ultramoon are unspeakably better.
BW2 is a great game that ties up loose ends from the first iteration. You start in a different area and collect the badges in a different order. Also you can get it for free with DeSmuMe
Yes
If you think of Black and White as a reimagining of Gen 1, Black 2 and White 2 are basically Gold and Silver. So yes
Play Blaze Black or Volt White if you're really interested in playing them
Black/ White 2 are honestly one of the best/ underrated games in the series. Lots of Pok√©mon variety, post game and fun stuff to do. Graphics are nice but maybe I‚Äôm biased because I honestly don‚Äôt like 3D models for Pok√©mon I‚Äôm definitely a sprite artwork shill. But yes please play these games you won‚Äôt regret it!
B&W2 is one of the best Pokemon games out there, prove me wrong
Absolutely get samurott ???? Profit
If you are in the US, i have an extra copy of B2 card i could send ya! Doesn't have a case tho, just the card
Black and White 2 are sequels, not remakes
As others have mentioned, B2W2 are sequels to Black and White, set 2 years later, not remakes. And they are quite good, remixing Unova in interesting ways and adding a lot of non-Unovan Pokemon to the mix.  


If you're concerned about pricing, my recommendation would be an emulator
The Pokemon World Tournament alone makes it worth playing. Not to mention the huge amount of new features they added compared to B&W.
The one downside is Pokestar Studios
    I love Pokestar Studios :(. And I mean, even if you despise it, you can simply ignore it \^\^.
        It just gets annoying while doing multiple playthroughs
Absolutely
Just play a rom hack
I would recommend playing black and white 1 first because the sequels are so much better that going back to the first ones aren't as fun.
YES
I just played them a few weeks ago. Yes, they hold up rather well! It helped that I hadn't played gen 5 games since 2012 or something.
Yes. And if for some reason you don't like it, you can always sell it again. That's the one nice thing about cartriges.
Black 2 and White 2 are great Pokemon games, but they aren't nearly as good as Black and White. Then again, nothing really is tbh.
Yes, I highly recommend them.
The prices are pretty crazy on BWB2W2. It makes me sad that I lost my copies of B and B2. Such good games, ABSOTIVELY POSOLUTELY worth playing! What i would give to be able to have Lucario by the third gym in a game again.
Yes
Abso-freakin‚Äô-lutely! Love me some Gen 5.
Definitely! But since it's a direct sequel, I'd recommend playing BW first.
So have you started playing?
They‚Äôre like the best titles of the franchise, of course they are worth your time!
Black/White era has the best story line. It‚Äôs very fun
Best games in the series imo
If you play one Pok√©mon game then play BW2
Black 2 is probably my most favorite Pok√©mon game of the main series. More than silver, emerald, heart gold, and platinum.
I adore Black/White 2. They're definitely worth playing!
I loved Black 2, such a great story. It's not like Yellow/Crystal/Emerald/Platinum/USUM. They're entirely different games.
I would recommend playing BW2. If you liked BW you‚Äôll like BW2 it does a good job of finishing up the story of N and the expanded dex at the start is pretty good. It also has a lot of side quest type things to do. ( the tournaments in driftveil city, getting to become a movie star, owning and operating your own mall, and a special someone teaches you knot to randomly enter people‚Äôs homes‚Ä¶ and more) plus you get a pretty nice dark type pretty early on in you journey.
Its fun.... because of riolu early game
YES. I haven‚Äôt even beaten anything Pre XY but YES
Edit: I‚Äôve also only played pre XY Black, Platinum, Soul Silver.
B/aw is easier. (Only need to knoe cut 1 time
The only negative opinion on BW2 is PokeStar Studios, but you'll survive it. Plus now you have much more options with creating a team than in BW. Have fun playing and good luck!
Yea
Yes?
Absolutely. They're some of my favourite games in the series
Considering they're the best mainline Pok√©mon games ever created, yeah they're worth playing :)
As someone currently playing Black 2 for the first time, blind Nuzlocke, yes, they're worth playing.
They‚Äôre the zenith of the series imo, the period from emerald-bw2 was just golden
Heck yeah
I'm ngl after playing b2w2. It made me dislike b1w1 alot, they felt so mediocre in comparison
definitly
Yes
YES
Highly recommend. Imo it's not as good storywise as Black and White 1 but man do you get a lot more options in terms of what pokemon you can catch.
100% !!! Out of my 25 years of playing Pok√©mon. B2W2 was the only one I skipped when it first came out and played years later and I‚Äôm honestly so upset that I missed out back then. Holds up SUPER well and I‚Äôve played it over at least 5-6 times since
yes. in my opinion (and many others) gen 5 is the peak of Pokemon (aka the best games in the series). Black 2 and White 2 are pretty much perfect other than the fact they're decently easy (same with black and white).

Also, play Black and White 1 first, B2W2 aren't just enhanced versions, they are literally *sequel* sequels.
I just got a copy a few weeks ago from a niche game store. it's pretty expensive, and I'm glad to be playing it and completing my game collection, but it is at times a sharp regression compared to recent games.
Most definitely!
Top 3 games in the series. Emulate it.
Yes, it's the sequel to Black and White... why would you not play it?
yes
Deffo give Black and White 2 a go. I just finished a solo run of White 2 and it was fun. I haven't played them in 3 years and it was great going back 

The Unova region is also the last region which presented any kind of challenge. It can be hard at times, but they're honestly all really strong entries.
Im not the average pokemon player. I skip all text and run around aimlessly until something happens. The pokemon are super boring for the first few gyms. Thats where i stopped. Im not asking for the most op mons early like gen 4 but something interesting at least. If you can slog your way through the first few gyms and pay attention to the story then you probably will have heaps of fun
You should play it, as it's a sequel to the original, taking place only 2 years after. If you played black, play black 2, white, play white 2.

yes play it after should silver it was my favorite game
Black and White 2 are now considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series. Fantastic gameplay, story, graphics, OST, etc. And it was still challenging.
I haven't played B2/W2, but from what I've seen/heard, isn't it basically an entirely new game from B/W? It has overlapping locations, sure, but the setting of the main game is pretty much everywhere that's post-game in B/W, plus new locations that weren't in the original. And when it does cross over, the locations tend to have changes. I think it has new songs, or at least remixes, the Pokemon distribution is different (especially since Pokemon from outside of Unova are present from the start), and the story is a continuation from B/W's. Puzzles and dungeons are also new. Gyms are new, etc.


Not sure what you mean by remake though, lol. Gen 5 doesn't have a remake yet.
Gen V is great, I have Pokemon White and would love to play the sequels. Any idea how to get a copy? All I can find are questionable second hand copies for 80-150‚Ç¨, wondered if there was a better way to play in 2021.
Gen 5 was peak Pokemon. The original BW perfected storytelling and the sequels perfected the gameplay experience. Best mechanics pre gimick era (megas, z moves, max). Its not worth going broke over but if you‚Äôve got the money, go for it.
As a huge Pokemon fan just being honest: no, not really. They don't add anything of value. They're _technically_ sequels, but they're essentially the same games with the same basic story. I don't know how Game Freak got away with calling them sequels.
Better than sun/moon and sword/shield for sure
Yes, some people call it the last game where Game Freak tried
I thoroughly enjoyed it, but will admit I never got around to playing 1 and 2 so I couldn‚Äôt compare
yes its one of the better pokemon games. especially the end game.. if you just want to play through the main game though you could stick with the normal B/W
Yup, worth it. Gen 5 feels very nostalgic to me, and overall the plot is pretty neat. I could go on and on about it but it would be to much :D  
Perhaps you could play on an emulator, but you need to remove the EXP block thingy
Well, it's not as charming as the original, but I liked some of the changes, like managing armies is way better, and the creature...

Wait, you are talking about Pok√©mon, not an obscure PC series of game most people haven't heard about? Nevermind then.
Black and White 2 are love letters to every fan who unironically appreciates Pokemon's story and world. You can't pick up a better game if that describes you. Hope you enjoy them.
I find even games I just don't like were worth playing once. I kept hoping Final Fantasy III would get better, it didn't, but I think it was worth finishing still.

So yeah, absolutely worth playing. Not like Pokemon is a huge commitment like a Witcher or something where it'll take SO much of your time.
I thought you were talking about the Lionhead game for a second :(
A thousand times yes
These games were great. Would recommend
If you liked BW, you‚Äôll love B2W2 for how it made the world evolve in such an organic way.
Unrelated to your question, but if you want to play gen 7 I highly recommend playing Ultra Sun/Moon instead of basic Sun/Moon. It was one of the worst offenders of the sequels being the completed versions of the first games.
I played black 2 as my first pokemon game since gen 3 & I was not disappointed! Very fun game
This sub doesn't understand a lot of nuances of game design, so you will mostly be getting recommendations based off personal taste, which is fine.

With that said, B2/W2 are objectively the best *designed* Pokemon games ever made.
Its the peak of the entire series
Best games in the series imo
Yeah bw2 are good, try ultra sun/moon too

They‚Äôre like sun/moons hard mode
It has the best wild pokemon options out of any game
Black and White 2 have one of the best post-games in the series, they're worth playing for that alone. Exploring the region and doing the side activities are both super fun.
They are extremely close to being the best pokemon games i have ever played. 

The one thing holding it back is that just after the 2nd badge, there is an unskippable tutorial for a minigame that has no bearing on the plot and can last for upwards of 10 minutes if you mash through it imperfectly. It‚Äôs a decent minigame, and decent tutorial, but the whole ‚Äúunskippable‚Äù part makes subsequent playthroughs so much harder to work up the will to start. 

If you just want 1 save file, or don‚Äôt mind that sort of thing much, it will be the best pokemon game you ever play. Even with how deeply i hate it, i‚Äôm still willing to sit through it to experience the rest of the game again and again.
Yes
Probably the best Pokemon games out there, the took everything that the franchise did right before and made it better. BW and B2W2 together are, IMO, the definitive Pokemon experience. You basically have it almost all.
2 free shinys so ye
They're fantastic and direct sequels. The only direct sequels we've ever had Continuing the same storyline. It improved on everything the first did which the original did pretty much everyone excellently
i payed 73 dollars black and it was the best game i played so far compared to gold platinum and Y so its probably worth it if you have a good amount of money
I started my game in 2012 and picked it up again a couple months ago. Finished it last week and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Can't recall why I set it down but it was worth finishing for me. Goal is to get the shiny haxorus.
Even better if you can get another person who have the challenge key unlocked.
If it says pokemon it's worth playing
It's an incredible game that's very good for its time, you should definitely play it! :D
I'm goona save u the time reading everything.  Yes
I'm in the vast minority, but Gen 5 is my least favorite generation of games by a large margin. BW2 are definitely better than BW though.
BW2 is probably the highest of the pokemon games imo. Everything after has gotten worse ( again imo) and everything before was just not as good. 

The graphics, around track, atmosphere, story  - all amazing and my favourite pokemon game of all time. So much so that I bought both cartridges twice (lost my first pair).
Honestly if you need you can get into USUM instead of Sun/Moon. They‚Äôre pretty closely related to each other and you‚Äôre not missing much especially with USUM just being better
I enjoyed them a lot. I think it‚Äôs worth it.
Yes! Black and white 2 are still very good and worth playing if you come across them.
B2W2 are, in my opinion, some of if not the best mainline Pokemon games, absolutely phenomenal.
Black 2 is not a remake. It‚Äôs a full on sequel and continuation of the story. (Not for like the player characters but of the NPC‚Äôs who are far and away the most developed characters in the series as a result.)

We probably could have gotten more games in this direction if people at the time didn‚Äôt refer to Gen 5 as the ‚ÄúWorst Generation Ever!‚Äù As they always do with Pok√©mon Generations.
Yes
They're the best games in the mainline franchise, so yes.
Yes, in my opinion the DS era is the best Pok√©mon has ever been
Might wanna play both b/w and b2/w2
Oh my god, yes. Absolutely give them a try. I cannot recommend them enough
Am I insane or do I see a post like this every day
BW2 are honestly my favorite Pokemon games. You should definetly play them!
I didn‚Äôt play them but black & white were great so those 2 games should be even better. A fuller experience to the gameplay, right?
Yea. I just beat it a few months ago. It was fun.
Black 2 and White 2 are easily some of the best games in the series. They absolutely pushed the DS to its limit. There is just so damn much content in these games.

It‚Äôs an extension of BW. A sequel, not a remake (why would a remake be titled ‚Äú2‚Äù?). But it stands perfectly well on its own. Unova was a great region, and B2W2 only adds to it. More cities, more routes, more dungeons, more Pok√©mon. There‚Äôs great longevity and replayability.

Just play it lol.
Imo they're the best games in the entire series.
Yes
Yes.  Great game.
Black 2 is really worth playing, and honestly I think you should try an alola game to. I started playing ultra moon and didn‚Äôt really like it at first but as the game progressed I think it might be one of my favorite Pok√©mon games
Black and white 2 should be seen as sequals so play 1 first (I had a better time this way)
 
That being said, they're the best games in the series
It is amazing
BW2 are really really nice! They habe the best postgame from all Pokemon Editions imo.
The Unova games, both BW and BW2 are awesome and 100% worth playing! The story is awesome, there's lots of content, and a great post-game!
B2/W2 are worth playing especially since you played through the original B/W, it gives some nice closure to some of the NPCs frm the prequel. Having said that, I for one have only played B2/W2 and haven't played B/W (going to soon though). On a side note, you NEED to give S/M a shot. I hated the idea of having no gyms before I tried the game, and oh boy, those games exceeded my expectations by a long shot. I can't assure you they will exceed yours, but I believe you won't regret it if you give them a chance.
Yes. ü•∞
Yes yes üôåüèæ
Absolutely
Best Pok√©mon game I ever played, to be fair I only played white, sun, alpha sapphire and x, but even among the the other games.
Easily has the best story and amazing post game content
Don't pay for a copy of w2 or b2 just play it on an r4 or something it's really not worth it
Definitely worth it!!! But first play Black/White if you haven't played them yet. Black 2/White 2 are sequels not remakes
Just get emulators  and they have grottos so thats cool
Yes bruh
I enjoyed every pokemon game with exception to sw/sh.  
However no other game has made me this excited as gen 5 games bw/b2w2. I wish i could delet my memory and experience gen 5 for the first time.
You would be missing an entire new story since black and white 2 are sequels which take place a couple years after the events of black and white
Yes.
Best pokemon games with emerald
Hell yeah, those games are hugely underrated!
how did you go past sword/shield without dyeing of boredom
Worth it 100%
It's absolutely amazing, and would probably be my favourite Pokemon game if I wasn't clouded in Platinum nostalgia...

&#x200B;

I enjoy gen 5 very much as a whole. B/W and B2/W2 feel like completely different games with different goals. B/W's has laser focus on telling it's story, and set on only having new pokemon till the post games.  B2/W2 is a very laid back/chill game by comparison, the story takes a bit of a back seat but the amount of content added is insane.  PWT is great, and the giant regional pokedex led to a lot of options for teambuilding.
Yeah they're better than sword and shield in every way possible.
Definitely! There's so much you're missing out in that game and you should definitely play it.
It‚Äôs got the most post game content and it‚Äôs so charming and definitely has the best story of a Pok√©mon game to me (continuing from the first ones) I never really got bored of the games
I don't like them but they are still worth playing.
Yes, they are so good.
Yes
I am that guy who doesn't like almost all Pok√©mon games anymore.

Gen 1 is too clunky for me. Gen 2 is too easy for me. Gen 3 is too annoying for me. Gen 4 is too slow and annoying for me (also too easy for HGSS). Gen 6 is too easy and uninteresting for me. Gen 7 is too easy and handholdy for me. Gen 8 is... a thing.

**But I** ***seriously*** **like Gen 5. It's literally the** ***ONLY*** **generation I like.**

The music slaps, it's beautiful, the story and dialog are not vapid for once, it doesn't hold your hand so much, it's full of charming details - *and in Challenge Mode, it's actually legitimately challenging, gym leaders WILL(!) make you use your brain.*

I highly recommend playing Black/White 2 in Challenge Mode; *it made me rediscover why I liked these games when I was younger.*

This is where the series peaked. And it peaked *so hard* that it made a naysayer like me really, *really* like it.
Yes
BW2 and platinum are my fave pokemon games. I think BW2 has the most content (both variety and volume) out of all pokemon games
    Battle tower on black 2 was absolutely fantastic.
        Best place to ev train. The PWT is the test of battles against nostalgia trainers, reminds me of the Battle Frontier.
            I absolutely loved black 2. Hell I‚Äôm replaying it right now, trying to do a challenge (not sure if it has a name) where I can only use pokemon on the route directly before the gym. Hasn‚Äôt been too hard yet, except for Elesa, but honestly is there anything that can make her easy?
                > there anything that can make her easy?

Besides grinding those caught Pokemon? Doubt it since all her Pokemon has Volt Switch.

But me too, I'm also playing Black 2 literally right now, grinding Pokemon in the Tower for a future project I plan on uploading at a later date.
                    I usually use gen 5 and lower to farm levels because I can transfer them to black 2 for tower farming lol, and you can set it on hard to make all trainers like 10 levels higher. Gen 5 is a godsend
                    I had to train up a sandshrew just beat her in my last play through. I had an Espeon, Vaporeon, Lilligant, and Golbat. Gave me a new respect for Joltik
                She gave me problems in a challenge mode run I did a few months ago.
        That place is low-key disturbing on its higher levels.
Even if they were remakes. They're still worth playing.
    If they were remakes they would be completely different games so we don't know if it would be worth playing
        However if they were hg/ss style remakes i would literally chase nintendo down to throw my money at them.

Hg/ss were remakes perfected... it only went downhill after that (BD/SP isnt out yet so idk what quality of remakes they will be but they look great).
            Johto is paced very badly, way too grind-heavy, and the gem 2 pokemon are too rare.
            Sure buddy... Heart gold and Soul Silver improved a lot from gen 2 but they are still trash games. Hear me out. Grinding? Sucks. Gym leaders? Suck. (Except Clair her kingdra can dish out ohko's upon ohko's with sniper crits. And no Whitney is fricking easy) They way the handled non-linearty? Sucks. The dex before johto? Full of kanto. Kanto post-game? Literally THE worst type of post-game. There was barely any fun involved. Except for fighting weak kanto gym leaders except blue and except for fighting red, the post-game was non existent. I agree that the music was good and the games look beautiful, but the flaws of johto were still mostly there. Also following Pokemon don't make up for this pile of issues.

And then people choose to hate sword and shield for being underwhelming. This game had wayy more potential, but people are blinded by following Pokemon and nostalgia.
                The worst thing is the grinding. Makes the game just not fun imo
                    True. I remember spending days upon days grinding for Morty on the route below ecrutic (idk the spelling, sorry). It took literally more than 10 hours to go from 19 to 25 on like 8-9 mons. I hated the experience
                >thinking sw/sh is better than hg/ss
Opinion disregarded
I‚Äôve heard that BW are more different than each other than any other gen, even having completely different regions to explore. In that case, should I switch to White 2 from Black to get a ‚Äúfull‚Äù Unova experience?
    They change the way you move through the region in BW2 compared to BW and change the last gym leader. Basically, it‚Äôs meant to 2 years after the events of BW so they update character models and they had a larger regional dex (as opposed to the gen5 only one from before). There are a lot of references and a bit of world building done in BW that will enhance your experience of BW2. Worth a shot to put your play through on pause and give the first games a try :)
    If you have played Black, then play Black 2 and if you have played White, then play White 2.
I just started playing black 2 a few days ago after beating black. I didn't know you could connect the two.. do you know how I would go about doing this?! Any help would be appreciated!
    You need 2 DSs and on the main screen for black 2, scroll down to unova link and then memory link and choose the link via ds wireless communications. On the other ds with black, go on ds download play and choose black 2. I think the game explains it if I missed anything
        Ahhh, the old convoluted way to access a good feature presented by Nintendo/GF. Just like the difficulty options. Such awful implementation.
            The difficulty selectors suck. They should be available right from the beginning.
                This is a joke right? There‚Äôs no difficulty selector right?
                    After you beat either black or white 2 you get access to easy or challenge mode.
                        Black 2 gives you challenge, White 2 gives easy. Just so its clear. And then you can give the 'key' to unlock the difficulty to another game.
            the difficultys suck and are bad but this is basically the only way to do something like this on a system with no internal memory storage unless gamefreak decided to go full on sonic and knuckles
            To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down.
    It‚Äôs called unova link and it‚Äôs on the starting screen of bw2. All you need is two ds‚Äôs. It‚Äôs infrared connection so you use unova link on bw2 while using download play on the ds with bw1 in it
        > owning two gaming devices to access a feature in one game
            Save data was stored on the game card back then, so there wasn‚Äôt a much better way to link your old file
                You used to be able to do it over the Global Link too.
            To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World, no need for 2DSes. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down. Specifically it's a workaround for the original DS and DS lite, which were the main systems at the time and had little accessible internal memory.
            This was standard from gen 5 and back. In fact, it started to be a thing with Gold/Silver when you could transfer your Red/Blue team to it. It only stopped being a thing momentarily with Gen 3 to 4 and the Pal Park, and permanently with PokeTransfer/Bank/Home until Gen 5 to 6
    I think the connecting thingy (was it called Dream Link?) is possible anymore as support servers were taken down, but its probs possible if you emulate it.
Wait how do you connect because I have both of the games just sitting rn
    Someone posted down below

2 DS s
Black 2 select memory connect
Black 1 D's download play
In addition to extra cutscenes and dialgoue referencing your player character from B/W1, the link also allows you to catch nearly all of the Pokemon N used and released (they have a unique battle entry animation similar to shiny Pokemon and have IVs of 30 across the board, the animation was not kept in later games if you transfer up).  You can also challenge Bianca and Cheron to post-game battles where they will use the final teams they had as well, along with their original rival battle themes.
Dang, I completely forgot about this feature even though I just completed Black 2 and White 2 (defeated E4). Does this works with emulators or R4?
>B2W2 is absolutely worth playing! It's by far the most different "special version", it's basically a sequel.

I mean, it's *literally* a sequel.
    Black 3 and White 3 come in a special trilogy set as you are suppose to play all three games one after another.
        I wish
        You tease
        Please I need more N
    True \^\^.
    Yeah, but it‚Äôs a lot more similar to the first version than most game sequels are. I think ‚Äúbasically a sequel‚Äù is correct, because in many ways, it‚Äôs also just a third version
        It‚Äôs not though, because it‚Äôs literally a sequel. Calling USUM a third version is fair - though the events are somewhat different it‚Äôs the same basic story (boy becomes first champion of Alola). 

B2W2 outright references shit that happened in BW constantly. It‚Äôs not a third version.
        The mechanics are the same and they have the same general selection of pokemon. That‚Äôs it.

It has new main characters and a new story that literally takes place after the previous one. Kind of the definition of a sequel.
            They actually have a much broader selection of Pok√©mon in B2W2. In the original, you can only catch the gen 5 ones before defeating the elite 4, but in the second game you could catch pokemon from different regions immediately.
            You also traverse to basically the same areas and routes. Most sequels have completely new level design, which IMO is a bigger portion of the games "content" than the plot.
        That's like saying Trails in the Sky SC isn't a sequel to FC because it's in the same region.
            No one knows what any of that means
                For some reason I thought this was /r/JRPG.

Anyways, those two games use the exact same region, map, locations etc, but they're direct sequels.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a sequel‚Äù
It is a sequel, it expands on the previous story, different main character, different rival, returning characters that have changed since we last seen them, new gym leaders + champion.
    > It is a sequel

It is funny how confusing this is.  

I obviously understand why: Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum all set the precedent for this kind of GOTY style "remake"

But at the same time, the game is literally called "Black 2 / White 2", as in, "The sequel to Black / White"
        I'm late to reply, but they're called version 2. Slight difference imo.
            That's because the full titles for Black and White are "Pokemon Black Version" and "Pokemon White Version." All the mainline games had the word version in the title until X and Y.
    Yeah, you are absolutely correct!

>There is so much love put into this game

I think that's the thing that makes BW and its sequel so good. You can just tell the amount of passion that went into it. The game has so much detail in it's world, the sprite animations in battles, the camera angles as you travel through certain areas, the 4 seasons that change the look of all the zones. The game feels so alive. 

They went absolutely wild with the presentation of that game and I wish we got a few more games in that style of 2D blended with subtle 3D. It's what Gamefreak does best imo. I think it's clear that they're still struggling with 3D to this day. It would be nice if they was allowed a year or two off so the developers can figure things out and create a proper groundwork for their 3D games.
    Absolutely agree, doing a nuzlocke of BW2 right now and every detail, no matter how small, is just so amazing. Gyms having their own personalized ‚Äòtwists‚Äô of the main overworld gym theme, the music in caves getting pitch lowered as u go down floors, Marshal blocking you from twist mountain, how every town has so many NPCs that give you great items, encouraging you to check out every building. 

Dont get me started on the caves and routes, which also highly encourage and reward thoroughly exploring every area and how useful tms involve quite a journey to obtain (IE: Toxic, rock slide). Compared to the games that came after BW2, you can tell they really put their all into this one. Can feel the passion they put into everything.
        The exploration part is so underrated. Having useful items like TMs at the end of dungeon areas really encourages players to search everywhere for extra bits. And there's a lot of extra things to do in that game (Yancy mission is insane).
        Dude, I love nuzlocking, and I have consistently found b/w2 by far the most challenging! Maybe it's my lack of game knowledge, as I didn't play the game when it came out. But I think it's a really rich and rewarding experience - I assumed the game would be nothing special and I was blown away when I picked it up
    And it has [the single best piece of music in all of Pokemon](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pF1n0GflZMg)
        Both Team Plasma grunt themes from gen 5 are some of my all time favourite game music. Neo Team Plasma's theme sounds like a boss theme.

They really went all out in the music for this generation and I love it
[removed]
    And with the PWT final theme is probably the most underrated battle theme since a lot of people hasn‚Äôt played the PWT
Same I got white 2 on the day it came out and am still playing it to this day.
    your insane
Well, new forms is a bit exageration, you're getting keldeo's resolute form and therian formes, but as those games are old you won't get keldeo from a distribution unless traded and forces of nature are dream radar only.

Don't get me wrong, I just finished the main story of White 2 (it is indeed quite long) and I admit, this game does its job well (although it is definitely not perfect and few things stings even today). This continuation is a bit better approach than revisited alola in sun/ultra sun, although you're losing some context if you didn't play BW games.

I'm a bit saddened that few features are not accessible at all at this moment (getting black city or challenge mode is close to impossible with scarcity of games available). You'd say those are mostly cosmetic, but i.e. beating black city fights gives you special EVs + speed, while beating white treehollow gives you HP/AT/DEF EVs. Small thing, technically irrelevant, but stings (especially when reshiram/white kyurem is a special attacker).

Without PGL this game loses a lot of its value.

IMHO it all depends on the price of the game at this moment though.
    Most are playing on 3DS so Dream Radar is readily accessible. I've managed to get event Pok√©mon such as Keldeo through a Youtube video explaining how to get them from connecting to a specific server. While you can argue if it is legit or not, you can still get them.

"I'm a bit saddened that few features are not accessible at all at this moment (getting black city or challenge mode is close to impossible with scarcity of games available)."

While true, we are talking about the sequels after all so getting those through international trading/befriending is irrelevant because the system is different and they are accessible once you complete the story. Both Black Tower and White tree-hollow offer a shiny Pok√©mon if you make it to the end so along with the EV training it is a neat edition to the game.
I second this. You‚Äôre not taking money from Nintendo or game freak because it is no longer being produced. I haven‚Äôt downloaded switch emulators and played the new games yet for this reason, I can‚Äôt afford it but I don‚Äôt want to steal.
If a product ain't for sale, it's abandonware as far as I'm concerned.
I have a homebrewed 3ds but I don‚Äôt know how/where to get b2 or w2
    google "roms github" and it's the first link
Both platinum and the original black and white are better than HGSS
    Fuck no
Personally I find the story and the characters of BW to be *leagues* better than B2W2, to the point that BW remain my favorite. In terms of just gameplay features though, the sequels certainly improve on the original.
    Agreed on characters. The B/W 1 gym leaders being involved in the overarching story and having so much individual personality was dope. I‚Äôm actually in the B/W 2 post game right now and it‚Äôs great too but it feels like your main character is kinda doing his/her own thing.
    Eh sure. I find neither to be particularly good so it doesn't really factor in for me.
The route trainers in the post game have INSANE teams! I went to go get the Magma Stone on Route 18 and couldn‚Äôt believe how powerful the teams these complete randoms have! It‚Äôs fun and challenging.
    Preschoolers with Pok√©mon higher level than my whole team
The little details like this are so funny.
    I‚Äôm actually in the post game right now of my first ever play through of Black 2. And I just got to N‚Äôs Castle again and this game is WILD AF
Why wouldn't they work? I have all my games back to pokemon blue and yellow. And only yellow don't work. Can't save. My silver still works. My GBA emerald version still works. 

I have SS, pearl, platinum, BW, BW2, all work perfectly.
Look, I liked B2W2 mechanically, but BW‚Äôs story and characters are so much better, they‚Äôre not even comparable. BW remains the gold standard for storytelling in the Pok√©mon franchise to me.
Riolu on the first route is the best.
B2W2 in no world is the better story, you're kidding yourself when you say that, BW1 is one of the better ones in terms of story, but B2W2 is XY bad in story
Woah! There‚Äôs a difficulty setting?? 

I have the same exact takes as you but skipped 2 because I just wasn‚Äôt into 1. I will give this a shot!
    > Woah! There‚Äôs a difficulty setting??

Yes. But in typical gamefreak incompetence they implemented it in a really backward way. Black 2, once you‚Äôve beaten the elite 4, unlocks the hard mode, and white 2 unlocks easy mode. But you can‚Äôt restart the game and keep the mode. 

What you need to do is having a completed black 2 cart with a ds, another cart of b2/w2 with another ds and do infrared transfer to the second cart to start a new game in hard mode. And both carts need to be real as fake carts can‚Äôt do infrared. 

So unless you have _real life friends_ with a real completed black 2 cart and a ds, it‚Äôs kinda impossible to access hard mode in a legit way. So the best way to do it is via cheating unfortunately.

Gamefreak. Incompetence. Name a more iconic duo.
In 2027?
    Why are people today so impatient? I missed gen 4 and gen 5 and can wait for the remakes.

I was particularly disappointed with US/UM being so similar to S/M and being a blatant cash grab by Nintendo.

If OP has Black, then Black 2 isn't going to be an earth shattering experience for them
        You don't understand. Black 2 is not the same game as Black like USUM is to SM or Platinum is to DP. Black 2 is a sequel that takes place years after Black with a different protagonist, different plot, different gym leaders, somewhat different villains, even a different starting town and exploring different parts of the same region. Not to mention quality of life improvements like immediately being asked if you want to use another repel instead of having to go into your bag.
            There have been more quality of life improvements since those games were released so going backwards isnt going to rock OPs world. With regards to story, there are websites and videos that can catch you up without the time and expense, I mean, it's not exactly an immersive, theatrical experience. A lot of the changes remind me of going back to Kanto once you have finished Jotho in Gold & Silver... "wow, im doing things in different order", "wow, these pokemon are at different levels/places to last time", "cool, there is a different person to encounter at this location".
I love Pokestar Studios :(. And I mean, even if you despise it, you can simply ignore it \^\^.
    It just gets annoying while doing multiple playthroughs
Battle tower on black 2 was absolutely fantastic.
    Best place to ev train. The PWT is the test of battles against nostalgia trainers, reminds me of the Battle Frontier.
        I absolutely loved black 2. Hell I‚Äôm replaying it right now, trying to do a challenge (not sure if it has a name) where I can only use pokemon on the route directly before the gym. Hasn‚Äôt been too hard yet, except for Elesa, but honestly is there anything that can make her easy?
            > there anything that can make her easy?

Besides grinding those caught Pokemon? Doubt it since all her Pokemon has Volt Switch.

But me too, I'm also playing Black 2 literally right now, grinding Pokemon in the Tower for a future project I plan on uploading at a later date.
                I usually use gen 5 and lower to farm levels because I can transfer them to black 2 for tower farming lol, and you can set it on hard to make all trainers like 10 levels higher. Gen 5 is a godsend
                I had to train up a sandshrew just beat her in my last play through. I had an Espeon, Vaporeon, Lilligant, and Golbat. Gave me a new respect for Joltik
            She gave me problems in a challenge mode run I did a few months ago.
    That place is low-key disturbing on its higher levels.
If they were remakes they would be completely different games so we don't know if it would be worth playing
    However if they were hg/ss style remakes i would literally chase nintendo down to throw my money at them.

Hg/ss were remakes perfected... it only went downhill after that (BD/SP isnt out yet so idk what quality of remakes they will be but they look great).
        Johto is paced very badly, way too grind-heavy, and the gem 2 pokemon are too rare.
        Sure buddy... Heart gold and Soul Silver improved a lot from gen 2 but they are still trash games. Hear me out. Grinding? Sucks. Gym leaders? Suck. (Except Clair her kingdra can dish out ohko's upon ohko's with sniper crits. And no Whitney is fricking easy) They way the handled non-linearty? Sucks. The dex before johto? Full of kanto. Kanto post-game? Literally THE worst type of post-game. There was barely any fun involved. Except for fighting weak kanto gym leaders except blue and except for fighting red, the post-game was non existent. I agree that the music was good and the games look beautiful, but the flaws of johto were still mostly there. Also following Pokemon don't make up for this pile of issues.

And then people choose to hate sword and shield for being underwhelming. This game had wayy more potential, but people are blinded by following Pokemon and nostalgia.
            The worst thing is the grinding. Makes the game just not fun imo
                True. I remember spending days upon days grinding for Morty on the route below ecrutic (idk the spelling, sorry). It took literally more than 10 hours to go from 19 to 25 on like 8-9 mons. I hated the experience

But me too, I'm also playing Black 2 literally right now, grinding Pokemon in the Tower for a future project I plan on uploading at a later date.
            I usually use gen 5 and lower to farm levels because I can transfer them to black 2 for tower farming lol, and you can set it on hard to make all trainers like 10 levels higher. Gen 5 is a godsend
            I had to train up a sandshrew just beat her in my last play through. I had an Espeon, Vaporeon, Lilligant, and Golbat. Gave me a new respect for Joltik
        She gave me problems in a challenge mode run I did a few months ago.
That place is low-key disturbing on its higher levels.
However if they were hg/ss style remakes i would literally chase nintendo down to throw my money at them.

Hg/ss were remakes perfected... it only went downhill after that (BD/SP isnt out yet so idk what quality of remakes they will be but they look great).
    Johto is paced very badly, way too grind-heavy, and the gem 2 pokemon are too rare.
    Sure buddy... Heart gold and Soul Silver improved a lot from gen 2 but they are still trash games. Hear me out. Grinding? Sucks. Gym leaders? Suck. (Except Clair her kingdra can dish out ohko's upon ohko's with sniper crits. And no Whitney is fricking easy) They way the handled non-linearty? Sucks. The dex before johto? Full of kanto. Kanto post-game? Literally THE worst type of post-game. There was barely any fun involved. Except for fighting weak kanto gym leaders except blue and except for fighting red, the post-game was non existent. I agree that the music was good and the games look beautiful, but the flaws of johto were still mostly there. Also following Pokemon don't make up for this pile of issues.

And then people choose to hate sword and shield for being underwhelming. This game had wayy more potential, but people are blinded by following Pokemon and nostalgia.
        The worst thing is the grinding. Makes the game just not fun imo
            True. I remember spending days upon days grinding for Morty on the route below ecrutic (idk the spelling, sorry). It took literally more than 10 hours to go from 19 to 25 on like 8-9 mons. I hated the experience

Ahhh, the old convoluted way to access a good feature presented by Nintendo/GF. Just like the difficulty options. Such awful implementation.
    The difficulty selectors suck. They should be available right from the beginning.
        This is a joke right? There‚Äôs no difficulty selector right?
            After you beat either black or white 2 you get access to easy or challenge mode.
                Black 2 gives you challenge, White 2 gives easy. Just so its clear. And then you can give the 'key' to unlock the difficulty to another game.
    the difficultys suck and are bad but this is basically the only way to do something like this on a system with no internal memory storage unless gamefreak decided to go full on sonic and knuckles
    To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down.
> owning two gaming devices to access a feature in one game
    Save data was stored on the game card back then, so there wasn‚Äôt a much better way to link your old file
        You used to be able to do it over the Global Link too.
    To be fair, when BWB2W2 was the current gen, all you had to do was link both games to the Dream World, no need for 2DSes. The Unova Link is the backdoor for when the Dream World went down. Specifically it's a workaround for the original DS and DS lite, which were the main systems at the time and had little accessible internal memory.
    This was standard from gen 5 and back. In fact, it started to be a thing with Gold/Silver when you could transfer your Red/Blue team to it. It only stopped being a thing momentarily with Gen 3 to 4 and the Pal Park, and permanently with PokeTransfer/Bank/Home until Gen 5 to 6
I wish
You tease
Please I need more N
It‚Äôs not though, because it‚Äôs literally a sequel. Calling USUM a third version is fair - though the events are somewhat different it‚Äôs the same basic story (boy becomes first champion of Alola). 

B2W2 outright references shit that happened in BW constantly. It‚Äôs not a third version.
The mechanics are the same and they have the same general selection of pokemon. That‚Äôs it.

It has new main characters and a new story that literally takes place after the previous one. Kind of the definition of a sequel.
    They actually have a much broader selection of Pok√©mon in B2W2. In the original, you can only catch the gen 5 ones before defeating the elite 4, but in the second game you could catch pokemon from different regions immediately.
    You also traverse to basically the same areas and routes. Most sequels have completely new level design, which IMO is a bigger portion of the games "content" than the plot.
That's like saying Trails in the Sky SC isn't a sequel to FC because it's in the same region.
    No one knows what any of that means
        For some reason I thought this was /r/JRPG.

Anyways, those two games use the exact same region, map, locations etc, but they're direct sequels.
I'm late to reply, but they're called version 2. Slight difference imo.
    That's because the full titles for Black and White are "Pokemon Black Version" and "Pokemon White Version." All the mainline games had the word version in the title until X and Y.
The exploration part is so underrated. Having useful items like TMs at the end of dungeon areas really encourages players to search everywhere for extra bits. And there's a lot of extra things to do in that game (Yancy mission is insane).
Dude, I love nuzlocking, and I have consistently found b/w2 by far the most challenging! Maybe it's my lack of game knowledge, as I didn't play the game when it came out. But I think it's a really rich and rewarding experience - I assumed the game would be nothing special and I was blown away when I picked it up
Both Team Plasma grunt themes from gen 5 are some of my all time favourite game music. Neo Team Plasma's theme sounds like a boss theme.

They really went all out in the music for this generation and I love it
You don't understand. Black 2 is not the same game as Black like USUM is to SM or Platinum is to DP. Black 2 is a sequel that takes place years after Black with a different protagonist, different plot, different gym leaders, somewhat different villains, even a different starting town and exploring different parts of the same region. Not to mention quality of life improvements like immediately being asked if you want to use another repel instead of having to go into your bag.
    There have been more quality of life improvements since those games were released so going backwards isnt going to rock OPs world. With regards to story, there are websites and videos that can catch you up without the time and expense, I mean, it's not exactly an immersive, theatrical experience. A lot of the changes remind me of going back to Kanto once you have finished Jotho in Gold & Silver... "wow, im doing things in different order", "wow, these pokemon are at different levels/places to last time", "cool, there is a different person to encounter at this location".
I absolutely loved black 2. Hell I‚Äôm replaying it right now, trying to do a challenge (not sure if it has a name) where I can only use pokemon on the route directly before the gym. Hasn‚Äôt been too hard yet, except for Elesa, but honestly is there anything that can make her easy?
