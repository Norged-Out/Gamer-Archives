[[[UNPOPULAR OPINION] I think Black 2 and White 2 are extremely overrated]]


I am genuinely terrified of posting this, because I know that BW2 are considered to be the best games in the franchise. For the reasons given below, I want to try and explain why that isn't for me. 

**What made Black and White unique**

Black and White was a huge point of transition for Pokemon. Before Black and White, Pokemon used to be adventure games, set in worlds which would contain a story as a part of the adventure. By this, I mean that the story revolving around the evil team was a separate part of the adventure. They would regularly try and interrupt you, but the game would work without them. Gen 3 and 4 did not need to have an elaborate plot involving the mascot legendary. If the locations of the legendary pokemon were optional, and the evil team and the elaborate story were done away with, there wouldn't have been much of a loss. On the contrary, the games would instead be better, because the stories for those games were pretty bad, and they didn't mesh with the core of Pokemon. Pokemon has always been about a player going on an adventure with your friends (in this case, pokemon) and growing stronger and wiser. 

In earlier Pokemon games, the story didn't matter and there was more focus placed on the design of the world. I know there are many who would disagree with me, but take a look at the level design of the first four regions. There was thought placed on how each location in the world connected with each other. For example, look at how Saffron City connected to four different locations and how this made Lavender Town much easier to reach from Cerulean City. Or the "a-ha!" moment which came when you found that Goldenrod City connected to Violet City, or how the final gym location - Blackthorn City connected with the first village - New Bark Town. Or how there were literally THREE different ways to get from Petalburg to Mauville after beating your dad. Or how Eterna City connected to Floaroma Town, Oreburgh City, Celestic Town, the shortcut to the top of Mt. Coronet, and even (to a lesser extent) Snowpoint City. The level design made the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh, feel like an established world to me. Because, the geography made sense and the world felt like an actual world built by its inhabitants. 

Not just that, but in Hoenn and Sinnoh, there was care placed into how the locations transitioned from one another. For example, Fallarbor Town was a mountain town and in order to reach there from Mauville, you had to trek atop a mountain. The same went for Snowpoint City in Sinnoh, you had to go through a mountain tunnel and traverse a snowy forest to reach it. The colour design in each route  reflected this, with route 112 characterized by brown and route 216 being almost exclusively white. These two are the reasons why, I think Hoenn and Sinnoh are remembered so fondly by many players. Not to mention the overall tropical feel of Hoenn and the temperate feel of Sinnoh which was created by its level design.

Black and White, took this concept and entirely threw it out the window. Most locations in Unova connected to just two other locations (the location the player came from, and the location the player is going to). The only exceptions are Nimbasa City and Opelucid City, which connect to three locations. However, these exceptions did not matter during the pre-game and the game would funnel you into going through one path, through the locations which served the story. This was also done in the previous games, but never to this extent. Also, from what I can remember, Unova is the first region where two cities are connected by a desert. And while that was the worst example of Unova's geography, I don't think the other locations hold up much better.

I think this was because the story of Black and White was developed first (as opposed to what I think happened to the other games) and the world was modeled to fit the story. Black and White was the first games where the story was actually competent. It moved away from the cycle of "get eight badges->fight legend and defeat evil team between 7th and 8th badge->fight pokemon league" and tied the main villain plot to the Pokemon League plot. What made Black and White so unique, was that villains actually mattered this time. Their goal wasn't something crazy like increasing the world's landmass. The game had an actual conflict (whether Pokemon battling was ethical) and for the first time, Pokemon had villains whose motives were understandable, and Pokemon finally had a well-developed character. Honestly, I feel there was no need for Cheren or Bianca, because N was the best rival the series had, but after Accumula Town, I found them to be okay. And they were still better than any of the rivals that came before when it comes to character development.

Another thing I loved about Black and White, was how it had all original Pokemon. It's not going to matter anymore, but for someone who had played Gens 3 and 4 a lot, this was a welcome surprise. I understand many fans were disappointed at this, but it made the region so much more unique! This is a huge reason why BW felt so different from anything else that came before. It was almost as if I wasn't playing Pokemon! Along with that, I really liked the high level requirements each Pokemon had. Call me crazy, but I evolved my Zweilous and Larvesta before facing the E4 for the first time, and the sense of accomplishment I felt was, the same I felt when I beat the Gargoyles in Dark Souls.

The games weren't perfect, however, far from it. Aside from what I've already talked about before, the NPC's stopped you on every single route to deliver story-related exposition. Not to mention, the amount of exploration had significantly decreased. BW reduced the significance of HM's, but instead added artificial roadblocks. For every badge, there is an NPC at the end of the city who is not going to let you past until you've finished whatever the game wants you to finish. For someone who played Pokemon for the adventure, this was very annoying on replays. This was far less egregious in previous games, and I don't need to mention that previous games were more open in letting you collect the badges.  Kanto and Johto were more or less open worlds in the way they allowed you to collect all badges. In Hoenn, you could leave the 2nd and 6th badge till the end and in Sinnoh, you could do the 3rd, 4th and 5th badges in any order. (In Platinum, in DP it was the 3rd and 4th). Given that Pokemon was about adventuring, the freedom in collecting badges would make the adventure even more personalized on repeat playthroughs.  BW, unfortunately lost this.

I was hoping that there would be a third version, like the others, that fix these issues. Until now, the third versions were basically directors cut versions of the game. The devs took the game and made improvements to it and added more features. And what was beautiful about these third versions was that in each generation, the third version kept adding more and more features. Don't believe me? 

* In Yellow, Pikachu was made the starter, the starters were given out at certain intervals, and the levels were increased
* In Crystal, there was the option of playing as a girl, animations were added for the first time, and for the first time, there was an overarching plot (regarding Eusine and his Suicune)
* In Emerald, there was the Battle Frontier, roaming Legendaries, Trainer rematches, more move tutors, a different story and updated gym leaders/E4 to balance the game a bit more
* In Platinum, there were all the things added by Emerald as well as improved game speed, distortion world, more fire and ice types, some updated gym layouts and textures of locations and increased number of pokemon in regional dex 

Looking at the pattern of how the third versions were getting more and more features with each generation, it was honestly exciting to see how much Gen 5 would add for its third version.

 **And now I get to Black and White 2**

I'd like to preface this by saying that BLACK 2 AND WHITE 2 ARE **NOT** BAD GAMES! There were a lot of things added to the game. There were 5 new cities, 3 new gym leaders, 3 new activities (PWT, Join Avenue and Pokemon Hollywood), a new rival, return of all previous pokemon and most significantly, a continuation of Black and White's story. As well as everything Platinum added! These are more features than what any of the third versions added to their games. Also, I have to mention this, I think the music in Gen 5 is phenomenal and is some of the best music in Pokemon and Route 19 is one of my most favourite video game tracks, along with Accumula Town and Emotion!  

However, I really wouldn't be writing this if I just had good things to say. And I strongly feel,

&#x200B;

* **BW2 took everything BW did well, threw it in the toilet, and flushed it away.**

One of the major flaws of Black and White was that it did not resolve its conflict. Instead, Ghetsis pulls a Madara Uchiha and reveals that "I was secretly controlling everyone all along" and that he actually wanted to take over the world (sigh...)

I feel like a continuation of BW's story would refrain from including its weakest elements. However, I was wrong. Ghetsis is now the main villain and he has started yet another Team Plasma where he, once again, wants to take over the world.

It blows my mind to think that the same writers who wrote Black and White wrote this, because there is so much wrong here. BW's story, because of its villains, was far more serious and grounded in tone. Their character design resembled knights who were fighting for justice and the irony was that despite the game being called Black and White, the conflict was a very grey one. Because that was the point of the story, that morality is often not black or white. To follow this up with a "taking over the world" plot is ludicrous at best and a gross mishandling of the subject matter at worst. Not to mention that Team Plasma are now modeled after pirates! Pirates! Because later on in the story they have a giant ship. (Even though there's hardly any water in Unova).  And also because they loot pokemon, I guess. 

Not to mention, how are Team Plasma even functioning after the events of BW? Why is anyone is Unova following Ghetsis? Didn't Alder tell anyone that he was a madman? Also, why are the members of Team Plasma still working for him? Even if they want to "take over the world", why would they do it under Ghetsis? How is it that some people don't even know about Team Plasma after the events of BW? What makes it even more confusing is that one member knows what happened and apparently he didn't want to initially liberate the Pokemon, because he's still following Ghetsis! Not to mention Colress, who was admittedly a well designed character, but he was just there because the game needed more boss battles. He wasn't even interested in Team Plasma's goals, and he even helps you get into the boss room later! 

Also, there's a new rival, who wants to save his sister's cat. Also, Cheren and Bianca are also here and they.....help out.

Not only is the foundation of the story problematic at best, it once again follows the same structure as pre-BW. Only this time, the climax of the story is after the 8th gym instead of the 7th gym. What makes it worse, for me, is that it still takes place in Unova. A slightly different Unova, but still Unova. As in, I still can't take the world seriously because it was made to serve an originally better plot.

&#x200B;

* **While keeping all of BW's flaws.**

While I really appreciate the addition of new locations, they make as much sense to me as BW's locations do. Firstly it makes me question how Unova's geography changed so drastically within the span of two years. But the biggest throw-off for me was how Marine Tube connected Undella Town to Humilau City, which, I don't understand, because it makes more geographical sense to connect Undella to Striaton (as it connects North and South Unova so much more easily).

I could even forgive the wonky geography and the weaker story if the game finally agreed to allow me to do some more exploration, but BW2 makes use of the same roadblocks as BW. Even in BW2, there is going to be a person or a pokemon blocking you from going to the next location, even though there is no good reason to do so. In BW2, the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th gym badges should have been free to do in any order. Instead, you HAVE to do them in order and there are still roadblocks blocking you from going ahead even though there is NOTHING in those cities that cannot be made optional. The tutorial to the PWT was unnecessary and should've been optional. Instead, it's mandatory. The Plasma Frigate encounter after that could also have been optional and Zinzolin's introduction could have directly happened at Lentimas Town. Instead, you HAVE to beat them here or you can't move on.

Not to mention, the constant string of exposition that accompanies each of these mandatory cutscenes. It was excusable in BW because there was a lot more character writing going on.  However, there is far too much dialogue in BW2 for the simplicity of the story. Let me show one example of this. This is a segment of dialogue that takes place on the Plasma Frigate right after the PWT.

&#x200B;

Hugh: *This ship...Why is it so cold?*

Cheren:  *"And... It seems like it's disguised as an old sailboat... But that can't be it, right?"*  

Plasma Grunt: *Why should you care? By the time we're done with you, it won't matter anyway!*

Hugh:  *"You guys... Seriously, is this Team Plasma's base?"* 

Plasma Grunt: *Correct answer! So that's why, as you can see...There are so many of us here!*

Hugh:  *"Is this all? I think you need more backup."* 

Plasma Grunt: *Ha ha ha! Ooh, I'm so scared, big tough guy! OK! Pulverize these punks! Plasmaaaa!*

Hugh:  *"Hey, just to let you know... I'm about to unleash my rage!"* 

Plasma Grunt: *You're first! (*battle*) Next! Next! Hurry up already! It's my turn! Actually it's Trubbish time! (*battle*) What's with this trainer?! This reminds me of the trainer who messed with us two years ago...*

&#x200B;

This isn't the end BTW. During this span of dialogue, the following information was communicated to us - they're on the plasma base, Hugh is angry at the Team Plasma grunts, and two battles occur. Also, I haven't included the time it takes for the grunts to walk towards you. 

To be fair, it is not the same as the cutscene spam that was there in USUM, but I do think this is quite a lot of dialogue, especially for a mid-game section where there is no new information being conveyed apart from Team Plasma having a large ship.

But what grinds my gears most of all, is how BW2 brings back all the old Pokemon into Unova. It's not something I can harp on for too long. The game gives us a good reason for it and its something that fans really like. It does, however, take away one of the most important changes that made BW as unique as it was. And I don't understand the criticism of the cut Pokemon being bad. Unlike SwSh, they're still programmed into the game, and the GTS exists, so why can't you just trade it in?

&#x200B;

* **It killed the third version**

This is a big claim. But I'm going to make it. Gamefreak is never going to release a third version ever again. The one thing I liked most about the third versions, was that it rewarded patience. As in, if you were patient enough to not get Ruby/Sapphire or Diamond/Pearl, and waited for two years, you could buy the improved and final game. By splitting itself into two games, Black and White 2 ended the third version system. The sales of BW2 were higher than any third version except Yellow and USUM surpassed BW2 in sales. ([https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon)) And I don't think I need to elaborate on the difference in quality between the two games.

BW2 is not bad and it is not lacking in content to any degree. However, this practice started by BW2 has negatively affected future Pokemon games. The general consensus about X and Y is that they were unfinished and there needed to be a third game to finish it. While I find those claims to be a bit exaggerated, what is true is that Gamefreak did not give us a third game for Gen 6 and that Gen instead ended with ORAS. Then we got Ultra Sun and Moon, where the story is the same as SM, but worse, has the 3rd legendary fusing with the other two legendaries, two features, and the level of unskippable cutscenes and the expository nature of those games made me wonder if the "game" was secretly a torture chamber that I'd purchased for forty dollars. Not to mention how tiny Alola was so GF could pad out the gameplay time by adding in millions of expository cutscenes.

Also, I haven't purchased Sword and Shield but from the gameplay footage I've seen, those games also have a lot of cutscenes and handholding while having a mediocre story to boot. Also, the world is such that you HAVE to take the train to go from the starting town to the Wild Area. Also I'd really like to know what a third version of SwSh would be called.   

&#x200B;

* **Final thoughts**

This might sound extremely hypocritical of me, but I don't want the Pokemon games to be story-based games. At least not the way it is now. I hate the expository nature and the extreme hand-holding the Pokemon games are doing. I would rather have the Pokemon games develop a cohesive world and give us the freedom to explore it. To have the confidence that their games and their audience is smart enough to know how to play the game without holding our hand.

This doesn't look to be a popular opinion, and I partly blame Gen 5 for it. Earlier, the idea of playing Pokemon games for their story was laughable. But because Black and White was different from what Pokemon was doing before, it showed that maybe that could be done. But for me, I see BW as a starting point for building a story-based game. Part of the reason is, I don't think having a great story meshes well with Pokemon's mechanics. Part of it is because the story has to funnel the player through certain routes, and that goes at odds with Pokemon's customizable nature. 

The problem is, future games kept the mentality of being a story-based game, when it was clear that the developers hadn't put the same amount of thought into its story. For example, look at what a hot, crumbling mess the Delta Episode is. Or the bland character writing of literally FIVE "RIVALS" (they aren't rivals they're friends) who still stop you on occasion. Or, my absolute most hated example of story in any Poke..., no, ANY GAME whatsoever, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, where you basically get a waifu and you have to solve her mommy issues. (yeah, I said it, f\*\*\* that game)

To me, that began with BW2 as well. BW2 had a lot of additions and its postgame was comparable to HGSS, which is saying a lot. However, it didn't have a story that warranted a story based game but acted like it was one. While that would be okay on its own, future games adopted this policy as well. And, I strongly believe, it killed future third versions, which makes me dislike the game more.

Final note, while I understand where all the praise for the game comes from, one recurring praise I find extremely odd is that BW2 are the "first actual sequels". This confuses me for three reasons. Firstly Gold and Silver did the exact same things BW2 did! New locations, new pokemon, large postgame where you explore the area you were exploring before. Wouldn't that make GS the *first* sequel? Also, if BW2 is an *actual* sequel, what does that make all the other games? Are they *fake* sequels? Also, why is being a sequel an inherently good thing? Going by that logic, shouldn't we consider Fallout 4 good because it is the sequel to Bethesda's first Fallout sequel?

So, thanks for reading my....whatever you'd call this. My intention with this piece was just to express my opinion. If you like the games, I think that's great and I don't want to take any of that away. This was something that I just wanted to get off my chest. I have a problem in that I can't handle it when something I think is overrated is very highly praised, and writing and sharing my thoughts is what I do to solve it. Its what I did for Fury Road and a couple other movies, and its not that it actually matters to the piece of media, it just helps me get it off my chest. So, thanks for reading, all comments are greatly appreciated.


Well to answer the final point, BW2 are direct sequels, taking place in the same Unova region as BW, and yes GS are sequels
    That's true, I just don't think that its an inherently good thing that they're sequels.
        I personally greatly prefer it to 3rd versions, which are basically the exact same game but with extra content that honestly should've been in the game the first time.
            That's fine.

I'm just assuming that you're including BW2's post-game as the same level of extra content.
"How is Ghetisis have any team plasma grunts to control". It was clear even in BW that not all the grunts were out their for equality, an example are the pricks kicking the Munna or trying to physically force a person to give up their pokemon. Next the only real pirate aspect about them is the ship, the designs of the grunts are clearly some kind of soldiers, where team Aqua in Gen III as well as Gen VI are clearly pirate themed right down to the tanned skin and love of water pokemon.

The Geography of certain places can be explained by just saying they are newly built. Remember this is a world where you can turn matter into energy and store it in a capsule. With the high level of technology in this world as well as the power of Pokemon, building new cities could easily be done in a year. Also the other answer is they were just secretly there just not added in, adding them in next game so the player had more to explore.

The thing is, they ruined the third version in the sense that they showed us "Hey we can give you a different story in the same region but with expanded areas." At most before they just added minor areas but for the most part you were paying for the exact same game twice just with some added stuff which can bother a lot of people. So BW2's idea of a new story where we see old characters grown up, gyms upgraded and such and new areas made a lot of people including me very happy. I'm not gonna argue against there being too much plot, you're right about that, but its a lot more interesting buying a game with a new story and new content than just a game with the same story and some minor things.

I don't mind the cut scenes...the interesting ones anyways mainly because i liked most of the characters in the game. But i will admit there is too much and far too much hand holding.

As for the reason why people are refering to it as an actual sequel, i think when we say that we are refering to the same generation. While GS are sequels, Crystal is not a sequel of GS, same for Emerald, Platinum, and USUM. The 3rd game being a sequel is more exciting because well....its a new story.

Also i'm not sure why you are bothered by the whole Kyurem fushion thing, it flat out says in the BW dex its the shell of Reshiram and Zekrom, the only real issue was that they didn't have a fusion combining all 3 into the original dragon.
    >their 

Hi! Thanks for replying! I agree and disagree with you in certain things. 

I disagree with you about the equality aspect. Even during the incident with Munna and the time when they stole Bianca's pokemon, their dialogue was along the lines of "We're going to liberate Pokemon from foolish humans". They were crazy, no doubt, but they still had an understandable motivation. And you're correct, its not unlikely for a group like Team Plasma to attract some bullies, but I feel like BW2 Team Plasma was a too big to consist of only those bullies. Besides, that wasn't actually my main problem. Their size wasn't the issue for me, it was their motivation, which I found to be extremely poor and contradictory to the themes of the first. Also, they kinda are pirates ([https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team\_Plasma#Trivia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Plasma#Trivia)). Well, they're a cross between a pirate and a ninja. I do think that their character design is better in BW2, but I feel like its more thematically relevent in BW.

I see. That makes sense. Especially when there are pokemon like Gurderr who is literally holding a steel frame, I bet construction in Unova must be much easier. 

I disagree. I feel like the third versions added and improved the base game a lot, in terms of mechanics and Emerald and Platinum even altered the climax of the story. I listed those mechanics in my post. I completely understand the appeal of BW2's idea and I thought it was impressive that they were able to add 5 new locations. My problem is that they split the games in two, when I don't believe they needed to. They had to just combine the mechanics of Black City and White Forest, the aesthetics of Opelucid City, and there could be a dialogue in the beginning, similar to the Latias or Latios question in the Emerald postgame to decide the fusion legendary, and N could give you the stone for the other one later.

My point is, BW2 could have been a sequel while ALSO being a third game. But because BW2 and USUM had higher sales, I don't believe Gamefreak will ever make third games again. 

That's true, BW2 was the first direct sequel to the mainline games in the same generation and it is different from what the series has done before, I just don't think that's an inherently good thing on its own. 

I don't really mind the fusions. I just put it there to show the similarities between USUM and BW2. Which is a bit unfair on my part, because to me, Necrozma looks like it was built to fuse with the other two whereas the two versions of Kyurem have their own unique design.
        "My problem is that they split the games in two, when I don't believe they needed to." I think i actually have an explaination as for why they have split games for the final one. I don't remember the article but apparently both Emerald and Platinium were pirated a lot, like way too much. So my guess is they are gonna only split the games from now on to A. keep sales high, B. Reducing pirating.

I'm with you on them just having a singular game again, that would not bother me honestly. I never played GS only Crystal so i don't know if there was a story change there but i very much remember the changes for Emerald and Platinum. As for combining BW2 that would mean N only has one of the legendarys, but the solution to getting the other could be you could find the character Black or White and challenge them and the reward is you get the other legendary. They would just need to have it so the game would ask at the very beginning did you play Black or White and that would determine which legend N has and characters Black or White have.

True, design wise i could see that. While they don't entirely look like good fusions i have seen one good design, hold on....yep here it is.

Also check out the nuzlocke comic, its very good.
            I'm not sure about Platinum, but yeah, Emerald was pirated a lot. The thing is, they initially had anti-piracy measures. HGSS,for awhile, had bugs which was cause the screen to glitch and the game to freeze on pirated versions BW had a bug which would prevent your Pokemon from getting exp on pirated versions as well. They were eventually fixed, but I think the developers were able to keep them off long enough that they didn't impact the sales too much.

I'm reading the nuzlocke comic for white right now. The artwork is really good.
                Yeah, theres only a few good Finished nuclocke comics, its hard to find them. Another by a different person but the same reason is this one.
http://piandpea.smackjeeves.com/
Updating super slow now but its almost done, almost. Prefer reading the manga or fan made works because they have far better grasps on the games battle mechanics and stats along with incorporating them into a real time battle with as little plot armor or plot attacks as possible compared to the anime. Nuzlocke comics particularlly don't bullshit because they are just adapting their own walkthrough. Also I've got one other series to recommend, its called Pokemon festival of champions. If you ever wanted to see hyper intense fights, this is absolutely the one to read.
I agree somewhat. For me, there were certain aspects of each game that I liked and some that I disliked. I like story based games, but also enjoy the open world exploration experience of previous games. If GF manages to do both of these together seamlessly, it would be a superb game to me.
    I think that's difficult with a series like Pokemon. I'd say the best way to do it is to keep it completely optional or to keep their stories in the post game.
        True, since both aspects are somewhat contradicting. An option of a story based game or exploration game will be great too. But I guess at this point we can only hope.
i love this analysis and agree completely. still enjoyed B2/W2 but they're much less memorable and i really like how you explain the strength of hoenn and sinnoh's world design and how we're missing that now
    Thanks! I feel the same way about the games, I enjoyed them on my first play through as well!

I really hate how no one talks about the world design of the games. It's such an important part of Pokemon to me. The thing about the world design is that its invisible as opposed to having an obvious story and you have to be paying attention to the world in order to notice it. 

For example, take a look at Mt. Chimney. It would've been easy to just plonk a volcano on the map and call it a day. Instead, the devs took the time to think the implications of being a volcanic settlement through, and so we got the area before Fallarbor Town filled with volcanic ash and Lavaridge Town, being right under the volcano is home to hot springs.  It's this kind of consideration to how the world works that makes me fall in love with Hoenn. 

Sorry for that tangent there. I could go on about this for awhile. But I'll save it for another post.
>Final note, while I understand where all the praise for the game comes from, one recurring praise I find extremely odd is that BW2 are the "first actual sequels". This confuses me for three reasons. Firstly Gold and Silver did the exact same things BW2 did! New locations, new pokemon, large postgame where you explore the area you were exploring before. Wouldn't that make GS the first sequel? Also, if BW2 is an actual sequel, what does that make all the other games? Are they fake sequels? Also, why is being a sequel an inherently good thing? Going by that logic, shouldn't we consider Fallout 4 good because it is the sequel to Bethesda's first Fallout sequel? 

I think I have a few probable reasons why people discount GS as sequels:

* the first might have to do with the branding. Some franchises perfer to mark their sequels with numbers, which is the laziest approach, but it works. the ultimate Counterpoint would have to be Star Wars which are refereed to by the subtitles instead of numbers (course that is due to the numbering beginning at the prequels. Basically it might simple be because BW2 have an actual 2 in the names. Relatedly, GSC is considered a separate generation from RGBY while BW2 is explicitly part of the same generation as BW.
* The second is that people have no concept of Non-linear sequels, installments that are standalone but are connected to a greater narrative. Most of the Pokemon game as well as FF, Disgaea, Tales and other games are in this format, but that does not preclude certain installments being followups to other games (Final Fantasy had 2 titles that had their own sequels and one other game being connected to one of their subfranchises.The first Disgaea game has both a GS AND a BW2 Analogue and the Tales games had a follow up to Xillia). Other examples include Xenoblade Chronicles X, some FNAF games (arguably), the SMT games (with Persona have its own case of this) and Fire Emblem.
* The last might be because people were wound enought for Gen V to be their first games and as such, if they knew of GS at all, would be unlikely to know it was a sequel unless they actually played it (and possibly Kanto as well), and even then might not connect the dots.
    That's true. When someone says that, I now just take it to mean "first sequel in the same generation"

Also, even if they're not continuing the story of the previous game, the new games of each generation are definitely sequels to the previous one. Because they're adding into the mechanics or gameplay in some way. 

My issue was that being a sequel is not an inherently good thing. I said that because one praise I see often is saying something along the lines of "we got an actual sequel" implying that being a sequel was something inherently unique.
Don't worry, I also hate blacks 2.
I agree with you OP! To me, I consider B2W2 solid games, but terrible sequels. They pretty much throw out everything that made BW's plot interesting and double down on the flaws it had. It's why I would've preferred an ultimate Gray version over B2W2 because at least the story (and characters) wouldn't have been retroactively made worse.
I just played white and then black 2, so my first ever experience with gen 5 (played 3 and 4, and I know about what goes on from gen 6 onwards) and I enjoyed both games. You make a lot of good points. I think BW obviously has the better story but B2W2 is a more enjoyable Pokémon game with all its different features. For me I play the games to raise up my favorites, catch more strong Pokémon, and then kick ass. But I also enjoy a good story. Both these games are annoying as many other people have alluded to in that the region is literally shaped to forward a linear plot and there’s very few opportunities for sidequests or figuring stuff out. I liked having to figure out how to get over to fortree after beating Norman in hoenn, for example. 

The thing I did like about B2W2 story wise was how smoothly they showed all the different changes in the span of that two years. Almost everyone and everything is in place for a reason. I wish the flashbacks from memory link were included in the main game, but oh well. It makes sense to me at least why the plot unfolds the way it does. But I think the plot just gets progressively worse as you progress through the game. Colress might’ve been more interesting if they had dropped more hints earlier about his involvement with plasma (he wasn’t very interesting to me to begin with since he just shows up out of nowhere and starts talking about Pokémon potential but whatever), if you didn’t play BW then I’m guessing ghetsis at the end was pretty underwhelming, and they took hughs character and ruined it by making him just more obsessive about the purrloin/team plasma instead of adding in other motivations for him. 

But like I said, it’s a more enjoyable game experience for me even with a worse story because of the battling. The level curve is probably the best I’ve seen in the games I’ve played (I was so tilted in BW when I tried to do the postgame with my level 50 something Pokémon and everyone had level 60+), the PWT is a fan service dream, and I feel like the game overall just has tons of great visuals and needed QoL changes (thank god for being able to put on more repels with one click). Obviously it’s not a great game at all if you want to explore and customize, but I mean gen 5 isnt the generation for that at all to begin with. 

I feel like B2W2 was also when they figured out the “enhanced 3rd version” model wasn’t the best maximization of their profit, which i feel like is a more important reason for killing the 3rd version than the ones you stated. I was like you too and played emerald and platinum in favor of skipping the originals, and it was well worth it. But I’m sure GF realized at that point if they kept doing that more people would just wait to get the 3rd version when they improved everything and the story stayed similar. By making sequels it ensured that you had to get the first versions if you wanted to enjoy the second versions to the maximum, in addition to now having 2 games with different version exclusives. 

Platinum is still tops for me in terms of best combination of all the factors I care about (battling, content, and story).
    Hey there! Thanks for replying! I didn't think this post would even be visible after so many months, but it's nice to know that it still exists.

I disagree with you on the story. I find the story to be very poorly written, in nearly every aspect. I actually went into a lot more detail about why I think so, in a recent post, where I wanted to debunk this notion that "Gen 5 were the last good games". I'll link it if you would be interested in reading it.

The only part I disagree with is Hugh. To me, he's the only well-executed part of BW2, and I still had trouble taking him seriously because of his constant "where's my sister's Purrlon?". His character growth involved learning that people weren't fixed as good or evil, and that they could change. And this was shown by how he initially hated OG Team Plasma, but later came to help them in their mission.

You're right, BW2 has merits to it. The level curve was almost perfect, I'd say. The PWT was lukewarm for me, and I had a much better time at the Join Avenue. The thing is, I enjoyed everything in BW2, AFTER the story was over. Until then, my experience was not the best, to say the least. 

I mentioned that BW2 were split in order to maximize profits. And that's what I have the real issue with. To me BW2 is effectively a third version, with a different story. In the same way Emerald was a third version with a different story (just not one that narratively continued the original). And I don't believe being a sequel had anything to do with the decision to split the game, at least if USUM is anything to go by

Ultimately, the practice of DLC is better than releasing third versions/ sequels, but I take issue with people regarding BW2 as "special" because of it.
        Definitely link it!

I like Hugh and I think he is a good rival and interesting because of the reasons you stated. I just think they kind of fell into the trap of emphasizing his attention getting qualities/behavior throughout over his character development. I still noticed it for sure, but it’s harder to when he’s being “loud” more often with the purrloin and rage lines.

Join Avenue is also super fun. Makes EV training easier too. I think even though the story is lacking the playthrough was a lot more bearable given the QoL changes they made, like I said. I’m obviously at the point where no game is really that hard to me since I’m not just over leveling my starter like way back when and actually raising balanced teams of 6.  So I feel like to a certain point whatever’s in the postgame does have quite a bit of importance to me. It was better than BW at least, where I just got through all the monotonous grinding, beat Cynthia, and haven’t touched the game since 

That’s fair that they didn’t need to be split to achieve the same goal. I didn’t really even realize that until now. I guess they figured out that was an even more effective way of profit maximization by combining the third version and the version exclusive models.
I think the entirety of gen 5 games suck eight next to gen 1 in terms of trash


Sad cause I wanted to use cryogenal
    My favorite part of the original BW was that I was limited to new mons, B2W2 just destroyed this
I was in my first playthrough on black 2 and it was weird, so I asked google: Is pokemon black 2 a bad game? and they show me this article. = D In a couple of hours I was on the 4th gym and it was pretty straightfoward, no caves, dungeons or something like that, no need to use HM too, a lot of dumb talk and dumb things to do. I heard from 4th gen speedrunners that pokemon becames unbearble to replay after 5th gen because of the dialogues...so I gues this game was the start of this process.
That's true, I just don't think that its an inherently good thing that they're sequels.
    I personally greatly prefer it to 3rd versions, which are basically the exact same game but with extra content that honestly should've been in the game the first time.
        That's fine.

I'm just assuming that you're including BW2's post-game as the same level of extra content.
>their 

Hi! Thanks for replying! I agree and disagree with you in certain things. 

I disagree with you about the equality aspect. Even during the incident with Munna and the time when they stole Bianca's pokemon, their dialogue was along the lines of "We're going to liberate Pokemon from foolish humans". They were crazy, no doubt, but they still had an understandable motivation. And you're correct, its not unlikely for a group like Team Plasma to attract some bullies, but I feel like BW2 Team Plasma was a too big to consist of only those bullies. Besides, that wasn't actually my main problem. Their size wasn't the issue for me, it was their motivation, which I found to be extremely poor and contradictory to the themes of the first. Also, they kinda are pirates ([https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team\_Plasma#Trivia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Plasma#Trivia)). Well, they're a cross between a pirate and a ninja. I do think that their character design is better in BW2, but I feel like its more thematically relevent in BW.

I see. That makes sense. Especially when there are pokemon like Gurderr who is literally holding a steel frame, I bet construction in Unova must be much easier. 

I disagree. I feel like the third versions added and improved the base game a lot, in terms of mechanics and Emerald and Platinum even altered the climax of the story. I listed those mechanics in my post. I completely understand the appeal of BW2's idea and I thought it was impressive that they were able to add 5 new locations. My problem is that they split the games in two, when I don't believe they needed to. They had to just combine the mechanics of Black City and White Forest, the aesthetics of Opelucid City, and there could be a dialogue in the beginning, similar to the Latias or Latios question in the Emerald postgame to decide the fusion legendary, and N could give you the stone for the other one later.

My point is, BW2 could have been a sequel while ALSO being a third game. But because BW2 and USUM had higher sales, I don't believe Gamefreak will ever make third games again. 

That's true, BW2 was the first direct sequel to the mainline games in the same generation and it is different from what the series has done before, I just don't think that's an inherently good thing on its own. 

I don't really mind the fusions. I just put it there to show the similarities between USUM and BW2. Which is a bit unfair on my part, because to me, Necrozma looks like it was built to fuse with the other two whereas the two versions of Kyurem have their own unique design.
    "My problem is that they split the games in two, when I don't believe they needed to." I think i actually have an explaination as for why they have split games for the final one. I don't remember the article but apparently both Emerald and Platinium were pirated a lot, like way too much. So my guess is they are gonna only split the games from now on to A. keep sales high, B. Reducing pirating.

I'm with you on them just having a singular game again, that would not bother me honestly. I never played GS only Crystal so i don't know if there was a story change there but i very much remember the changes for Emerald and Platinum. As for combining BW2 that would mean N only has one of the legendarys, but the solution to getting the other could be you could find the character Black or White and challenge them and the reward is you get the other legendary. They would just need to have it so the game would ask at the very beginning did you play Black or White and that would determine which legend N has and characters Black or White have.

True, design wise i could see that. While they don't entirely look like good fusions i have seen one good design, hold on....yep here it is.

Also check out the nuzlocke comic, its very good.
        I'm not sure about Platinum, but yeah, Emerald was pirated a lot. The thing is, they initially had anti-piracy measures. HGSS,for awhile, had bugs which was cause the screen to glitch and the game to freeze on pirated versions BW had a bug which would prevent your Pokemon from getting exp on pirated versions as well. They were eventually fixed, but I think the developers were able to keep them off long enough that they didn't impact the sales too much.

I'm reading the nuzlocke comic for white right now. The artwork is really good.
            Yeah, theres only a few good Finished nuclocke comics, its hard to find them. Another by a different person but the same reason is this one.

Updating super slow now but its almost done, almost. Prefer reading the manga or fan made works because they have far better grasps on the games battle mechanics and stats along with incorporating them into a real time battle with as little plot armor or plot attacks as possible compared to the anime. Nuzlocke comics particularlly don't bullshit because they are just adapting their own walkthrough. Also I've got one other series to recommend, its called Pokemon festival of champions. If you ever wanted to see hyper intense fights, this is absolutely the one to read.
I think that's difficult with a series like Pokemon. I'd say the best way to do it is to keep it completely optional or to keep their stories in the post game.
    True, since both aspects are somewhat contradicting. An option of a story based game or exploration game will be great too. But I guess at this point we can only hope.
Thanks! I feel the same way about the games, I enjoyed them on my first play through as well!

I really hate how no one talks about the world design of the games. It's such an important part of Pokemon to me. The thing about the world design is that its invisible as opposed to having an obvious story and you have to be paying attention to the world in order to notice it. 

For example, take a look at Mt. Chimney. It would've been easy to just plonk a volcano on the map and call it a day. Instead, the devs took the time to think the implications of being a volcanic settlement through, and so we got the area before Fallarbor Town filled with volcanic ash and Lavaridge Town, being right under the volcano is home to hot springs.  It's this kind of consideration to how the world works that makes me fall in love with Hoenn. 

Sorry for that tangent there. I could go on about this for awhile. But I'll save it for another post.
That's true. When someone says that, I now just take it to mean "first sequel in the same generation"

Also, even if they're not continuing the story of the previous game, the new games of each generation are definitely sequels to the previous one. Because they're adding into the mechanics or gameplay in some way. 

My issue was that being a sequel is not an inherently good thing. I said that because one praise I see often is saying something along the lines of "we got an actual sequel" implying that being a sequel was something inherently unique.
