[[Should I play Pokemon Black or White]]


I have never played gen 5 and was wondering which is the better game? If I was to choose I would pick White because I like Zekrom better. But I want to know the differences between the 2 games to make my mind up.


I'd go with White since white forest is way better than black city
    What's the difference between the two? I was playing black city last week with my black 2 playthrough but don't know anything of white forest
        Black forest is about buying items, but most of which you can just buy at a PokeMart or something on the other hand, White Forest gives you access to Pokemon not seen anywhere else in the game, like Ralts or Gastly
how about a simple question that is used in the games. Do you look to  Truth(black) or Ideals (white) to guide you in life.
    That goes hard, my answer differs, I like the truth better, but at the same time, sticking to my ideals and improving oneself is important to me too. (I just like zekrom) but my nuzlocke run rn is on black
    Thank you sir for this. I am about to choose either black or white to start playing & needed to help to decide which one. The truth(black) is absolute, based on facts but is limited & has a set ceiling, as where ideals(white) are fluid, based on imagination, unlimited & there is no ceiling. Pokemon White it is!
        No problem. Glad my 4 year old comment is still helping someone after all this time lol. Enjoy your playthrough!
            This came in clutch with Delta. W J Manü§ù
                Great to hear! Delta is wonderful to use for the older Pokemon games that are hard to acquire

Like with most pokemon games, pretty much the only difference comes with the pokemon you can get. Check the list of exclusive pokemon and make up your mind with that.

Personally, I chose black, if you want to know.
    That's actually not true in BW. The games differ in other ways as well.¬†


Black has absolutely zero older gen Pok√©mon. White has older gen Pok√©mon in the white forest.¬†


Black focuses on battling trainers and exp gain. White focuses on catching pokemon.¬†


There are actually less battles in white than black. And the respective side quests in each focus on their special thing.
        Black had heaps of older gen mons in the post game lol
            I should reiterate. It only has 5th gen Pok√©mon before the league. You can't catch any older gen Pok√©mon until after you beat the game and get to explore the rest of the region.
                That doesn't make sense - white forest is also postgame. Neither version has gens 1-4 mons.
Zekrom is a solid exclusive, but if that's not enough there's also Braviary, Reuniclus, Liligant, and Thundurus all sit a lot better with me than their Black version counterparts
There aren't a lot of differences tbh. The city with the 8th gym leader looks different (Opelucid City) and the gym leader is different ( in white you battle iris and in black you battle drayden). Then in the post-game there is a place the differs. White gets white forest and black gets black city. I believe there are some version exclusives in these places but I don't know which ones. Honestly, just search up de version exclusive pokemon and base your decision on which version exclusives you like best.

EDIT: Just a typo
    > in white you battle iris and in black you battle drayden

That's one hell of a difference.

  
Iris is a cutie. Pokemon White it is!
Honestly white is better. The only reason being that White Forest allows you to catch more Pokemon. 

&#x200B;

However, I still chose black for the following reasons: 

1. I just like black as a color more than white 
2. I prefer the more feminine look of Reshiram 
3. Opelucid City looks better in Black than White 
4. I think cities are cooler than forests.
    Man the "I prefer the more feminine look of Reshiram" made me rofl
        welp it does look more feminine
            bro is fiendin'
        What
    I feel like Pokemon Black/ White was nearly up to personal preference with the two versions being so close.
        Very true. It really doesn't matter that much.
    Based answer thank you for being true.
If you can get either black/white 2 instead, I would get one of those. The sequel has way more content and more pokemon to catch as well as more options to do in the region. If you like Zekrom choose white/black 2 and if you like Reshiram choose black/white 2.
    Get both B/W and B2/W2, if you can. The sequels are definitely superior in terms of content, but the originals have the better story IMO, and you'll get more out of the sequels having played the originals.
        That's true. I love them both
Finished Pokemon Black for the first time a couple of months ago. Go with Pokemon Black trust me, Black city is useless
    Black City is "useless", but you recommended it?

                I'm afraid I fail to see your point.
                    It's one of the first results on Google, I don't think it's outrageous to ask someone to elaborate if they felt the need to share their opinion in the first place, so future users who land here from the SERP actually get a decent answer.
                        Ah, my only intention was to highlight the significant, and subsequently somewhat humorous, disparity in the time each of your comments were posted, that's all. Though I agree that the other user contradicted themself.

Pokemon Black has a dark UI so I prefer it. But then again, White's Opelucid City is superior.
White so you can get the bouncy bois
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Between black and white the difference are minimum, only some pokemon version exclusive, a single city in post game (black city or white forest), another city looks different and that's all.

For the sequels (black 2 and white 2) is the same thing, but they have completely new plot, cities and characters from the first two games.
black has a tech theme white has a nature theme
Yes.
Whichever you choose, make sure you get the sequels instead of the originals
    Or get both.
Ya
