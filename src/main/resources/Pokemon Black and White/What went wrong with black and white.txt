[[What went wrong with black and white]]


So I'm a fan of the  older Pokemon games. Mainly of gen 3. Ruby was one of my very first games And I was in love with it . I replayed Pokemon emerald for like 30th time this past month. I suddenly had a thought of playing the gen 4 and 5 games. I'm not a console owner so I quickly downloaded a free ds emulator and a rom for platinum and black. 
 I started my first journey with chimchar and completed my journey with Cynthia. No post game stuff.  And then replayed the game again with turtwig this time with a different team . It held up pretty well. I trained all the gift Pokemon such as riolu and togepi and they became the heavyhitters for my team. And then I started Pokemon Black.

Now tbh I haven't really played the newer games as my family would never allow me to buy games. Saying stuff as it is a waste of money or smth like that. And I'm not exactly an adult. Soooo yeah. This was my first experience of unova. I hadn't really played any of the black and whit games and only had recently found out about the art of emulation in the past year. So I booted my game and it was..... Beautiful.

They fixed the number one problem I had with the older games. Tms breaking after one use.
Before this I had to carefully calculate which Pokemon the tm most suits and revise that thought hundred of times before using the tm. Sometimes the tm would just sit there rotting in my backpack before the last fight. The gameplay became even smoother. And the storyline was also pretty interesting. Not bad for a Pokemon game. I started my journey with tepig because fire type starters are the best ones. One small problem I found that they just upped the difficulty level after you beat N like it was nothing. There I was with my level 55 team chilling and I suddenly find myself fighting a level 63 musharna in the dreamyard. But it was post game stuff so I didn't really care. The game was great , the story was great . Overall It was pretty good. So one question remained in my head. Why didn't the games sell?

I saw someone from the internet  saying that because they removed all the Pokemon from the older generations it recieved bad reception or smth. I didn't quite get the reason. My sinnoh team was fully made up of sinnoh Pokemon -
Garchomp,torterra,togekiss,lucario,gastrodon and luxray. 
Sure there were Pokemon from hoenn and kanto here and there such as munchlax line and elekid line etc. But they were difficult to obtain or worse, you needed to have FRIENDS. the absence or presence of older Pokemon didn't affect the gameplay or playability at all. So why? Why was platinum revered yet black and white was forgotten?


1. BW/Gen 5 was sorta a reboot for the series so that didn't sit quite well with people.
2. What people say about the pokemon is more about how through the main story, you only find Unova pokemon in the routes, not a single glance of any older pokemon, so this can/will feel very limiting for team members.
3. Some designs are/were seen as controversial (i.e. ice cream and trash bag) though this one is always more subjective since we've always have had pokemon like that.
4. BW released just months before the 3DS launched so they didn't get as much "wow look at this new pokemon game!" and could've even been seen as "old" compared to all the new games with proper 3D that'd come out.
    Wasn’t gen 3 also a reboot of some sort?

            Oh! Makes sense. I’m glad they made that decision.
Different players like different things. I really enjoyed BWs bigger focus on a story and the focus on new mons, but there are people who really just wanna use their old favorites over and over again just to beat the game and who don't care for the story. There were also other factors that played into this (such as Gen 5 being on the same system as Gen 4, when most people expected the next Gen to be on the 3ds).

Nowadays BW is seen in a much more positive light, but it still remains a bit divisive, with some people still disliking it a lot.
    With it being divisive, I guess it really is just black and white
I liked gen 5 on release and still do but it was a shock having an entire new roster to choose from. There were some other issues that couldn't be overlooked once they were pointed out.

>Sure there were Pokemon from hoenn and kanto here and there such as munchlax line and elekid line etc. But they were difficult to obtain or worse, you needed to have FRIENDS.

Gen 5 is equally guilty in this. You still had to trade for Gigalith & Conkeldurr. People on the GTS were asking for really dumb/illegal things when it came to version exclusives (level 10 Reshiram for a Braviary) or one-time obtainable Pokemon per save file. Then you have a chunk of late game Pokemon that evolved at a high level; Zweilous evolves at level 64 being the prime example.

>One small problem I found that they just upped the difficulty level after you beat N like it was nothing.

Part of this was because the exp gained from battles scaled unlike gen 1-4. For example, if your Pokemon at level 20 beats a wild one at level 10, you get 500 exp. If your same Pokemon at level 25 goes against the same level 10 Pokemon, you get only get 300 exp. This made grinding late game miserable. If you try a solo challenge or nuzlocke for fun, you'll notice this really quick.

On the competitive side, you had weather wars and the asinine sleep turn counter. Once weather was up via Sand Stream, Drizzle, Snow Warning, or Drought, it stayed up for the entire battle unless you changed it. If your Pokemon got put to sleep and you switched out before it woke up, the turn counter would reset. Sleep lasted 1-3 turns on paper but it was longer in practice.
    Damn didn't knew that. And I'm gonna assume that GTS is some king of global trading system. And based on that there's question I wanna ask. 

Srlsy? There were unreasonable demands like thses and the system even allowed trades such as a lvl 10 reshiram which is impossible to obtain legimately ?
        > There were unreasonable demands like thses and the system even allowed trades such as a lvl 10 reshiram which is impossible to obtain legimately ?

Correct. There were no restrictions on what you could ask for.
I thought they sold well just not as much as previous ones?

I remember a co worker telling me he fell off pokemon once the "ice cream happened." In fact for a long time  "gen 5 pokemon sucked" was not an uncommon sentiment(personally I heavily disagree). The one thing about monster collecting games is that a lot of their appeal, including pokemon, are the monsters themselves. This is why Temtem and most other "pokemon killers" falter, because their monsters just pale in comparison in design sensibility and appeal compared to pokemon.

Gen 5 is also when the genwunner mentality was at its peak, hence why gen 6 leaned so heavily on gen 1 pandering.
Nothing. Gen 5 was the last good pokemon gen. The game was actually difficult and took risks, unlike every gen after. Yes you can argue mega evolutions, z moves, gigantimax, etc are all "risks" but they aren't anywhere near as risky as limiting the pokemon you find during the main story to all new Pokemon. It forces you to use new Pokemon you never did before, and brought back the wonder of not knowing the ins and outs of Pokemon. Your first playthrough of gen 5 will always be like venturing into the unknown.

Unfortunately that same thing is what kind of doomed it. I know a lot of people that didn't play gen 5 because they couldn't get their favorite pokemon in the game until post-game. Hell, I didn't play it until years later, although in my case it's just that gen 4 had turned me off to the series with how slow it was and how campy the story was, and gen 6 was already out and couldn't grab my attention at all. Idk what made me want to buy gen 5, but I'm glad I did. Played through it and enjoyed it thoroughly. I then forced myself to play through gen 6 and wow was it a huge step back.. 

Gen 5 was a risky gen. It was a soft reboot of sorts, forcing you to use new Pokemon exclusively until the end game. It's story was far deeper than anything that came before it, making you question the relationship between trainers and pokemon and whether the entire structure of the pokemon world was ethical. It didn't hold your hand anywhere near as much as later games. Hell, gen 5 is the only gen of Pokemon where I actually got stuck on a gym, making me rework my team and strategy. Gen 5 was a game I feel like was meant for people that grew up with Pokemon. The game was more difficult and tried to bring back that sense of wonder and excitement over seeing what that new Pokemon you caught could do, what new teams you could make, etc.
While I absolutely adore these games a lot of people didn’t like that you could only use Unova Pokémon. Along with this they thought the designs were bad. Which I’ll admit some are lacking.

In my opinion I don’t see people’s issue with the story I mean yes it exsists but, there’s not that much talking overall at least compared to for example sun and moon.

Honestly I don’t see what people have against the moving 2-D sprites as I love that art style and wish they could go back to it but, I understand it’s a change from gen 4 and a lot of Pokémon fans are very negative about changes.
We're just getting old it was made for kids
Honestly I was 5 when it came out and I was my first pokemon game, I loved it lol
Too much talking. The pokemon designs are very controversial. A lot of people feel the pixelated art style is ugly, especially the super zoomed in back sprites. Releasing with just new Pokemon was highly unpopular, made worse by the fact that many people didn't like a lot of the new ones. The map is pretty linear. 

And from a mom's buying games for kids perspective, it was the third DS Pokemon game. There's probably an element of "you don't need that game. You already have a Pokemon game for DS" 

Also potentially related, I've heard many people think of the BW anime is the worst in the series, which cannot help.
    Controversial? In what way. I can understand the design problem but still....
        As in a lot of people think they suck
Gen 5 story and everything was good.

But evos were bad and it had many bad mons that just werent that good designed.
The icecream or the kling line or even reuniclus were so underwhelming in their evos. They should be 2 stages at best but they each fill 3 dex entrys.

And mons like conkeldurr which i despise to this day.
The 2 biggest reasons why I didn't like black and white:

1. Like many have said, only new Pokemon. I felt like I had to completely relearn the game again because I didn't know the names/types/moves of any Pokemon. I didn't know how to build my team because who knows what coverage and stuff I would be able to learn. At least previous gens you could slowly learn the new Pokemon while still having a foundation with all the previous ones. 

2. The story was WAY too in your face. The other gens, your main objective is to become Pokemon champion (and also work toward complete Pokedex). All the quests with team rocket are well implemented side story that you happen to be a part of. Design was minimal and focused on just exploring the world.
Each later Gen started to get more and more story heavy and also more linear. Gen 3 was the first Gen to have a story forced legendary fight, which I wasn't a fan of but ok. But then Gen 5 they have a story based interruption in the middle of the champion fight AND a legendary in that too? I felt like I was playing a game where a 5 year old just got to make up how the game ended and threw everything in at once.

        I never said the rockets were optional. I said they were a side story which is exactly what they are. You don't even hear about them until Mt Moon and really don't have a huge interaction with them until game corner. Likewise, BW introduce you to plasma literally on entering the first town and feel the need to remind you of their presence every other town. 

Also just because there are progression systems in place like HMs, doesn't mean that first Gen was linear. You can fight Sabrina and Koga in either order (only difference being level scaling), you can choose either bicycle road OR water route to get to fuschia, and you can skip seafoam entirely if you want. BW has optional areas like you mentioned, but the path through the game is strictly linear. That is to say, you have to pass B to get from A to C. 

Also I'm not trying to misrepresent the final showdown with N. I never said it was a bad story, I just said they were very much in your face about it. And the fact that you are admitting that they tell you so much exposition to set up this story just proves my point. 

End of the day MY preference is to just play the game to beat the elite four, not to save the world, which is the reason why I personally didn't enjoy BW, just like OP asked.
            Y'know I kind of agree with @garlicmonkey over here. In the earlier Pokemon games. The bad guy teams. Were never the primary goal of us the main character. We start out in the Pokemon world with a pokedex to find different Pokemon , collect gym badges and ultimately beat the Pokemon league. Form gen 1 to 4. This has been consistent. 
Gen 1- you beat gionvanni and team rocket and then beat the league.

Gen 3- the legendary Pokemon showdown. Thwarting both Maxie and Archies plans and ending it in sootopolis before the final gym and then beating the Pokemon league.

Gen 4- catching/beating giratina in the distortion world and in that case fouling cyrus's plan for a perfect world. Just before the 8th gym volkner and then beating the league.
 
Don't know about hgss since Ive never played it but still Pokemon followed the same formula. They stayed consistent. I think they tried to change smth considering that it was a reboot for the Pokemon games as many claim. And yes it was somewhat of a weird experience for me., It felt a little abrupt that I had to catch a legendary right before the final boss but it didn't bother me that much so I overlooked it.
it was always a feeling of getting refreshed.
"yes you beat the bad guy, there's no need to worry, you can now focus on your goal of becomingthe best and beating the league."
that was what it was like for me whenever it was over. just refreshment and nothing more.

    Lmfao, while re-playing White 10+ years after my first play throughs of it, I'm having to Google a lot of Pokemon and figure out their types all over again, rip
Yeah, gen 5 was revolutionary in that sense and they haven’t done it since then…pokemon fans who played gen 5 as the first games wouldn’t see a problem with the games…because they’ve never played a game before.  Gen 5 was just a departure…and the sprites are icky
    I mean I do prefer platinum over black but... I still think that  gen 5 didn't get nearly as much attention as it deserved
        Platinum is my favorite game and Gen 4 is my favorite and will always be, but White is pretty good too imo :3
A thought I've had about it for a while is the possibility that games that come out in/near console transition periods tend to not sell that well. By the time BW1 were out in the west the 3DS had already out in the west for a few months. Marketing matters too and I wonder if it was awkward for them to market a DS game while at the same time trying to convince people to drop $250+ on a 3DS. I remember first hearing about BW1, not from commercials or ad placement but online not long after the full pokedex leaked (I never saw the initial dex leaks, only the full shot that came later)
I think its mainly because alot of pokemon fans that played it originally felt like it as too much and couldnt handle it. Alot of things changed and its changes not being as gentle as gen 2,3 or 4 led alot of people astray. They also focus on some designs being underwhelming but they have their charm or are intentionally bad to try and make the pokemon world seem more authentic(also unironically makes me question if trainers and pokemon deserve to be if trubbish exists). It was also when the formula got stale i think. Early game flying time, elemental starters(not the actual starters) get legendary beat game. Emboar being the 3rd fire fighting type, also it was pretty hands on for what you had to do and then it just unleashes the other half. Alot of people who dislike the games really didnt just want to accept how different it was. Who can blame them the game changed alot. Also its the only gen where kanto wasnt in it, so obviously gen 1 lovers rose to the opporunitiies. Its really unfortunate its such a good generation with honestly some of the best designs today.
Gen 5 doesn't include Pokemon from previous gens, which sucks and breaks the pattern of Pokemon games pre Gen 5, but on the other hand it creates a sense of newness and makes it a bit more challenging as you learn more about Gen 5 Pokemon. B&W took a lot of risks and I think it ultimately paid off, despite the pitfalls. 

Gen 5 also has very few water and fire types compared to previous gens, which also sucks. Pokemon like Carracosta (mixed water/rock type Pokemon with a lot of type resistances) and Diramanitan (absolute brickhouse unit of a Pokemon with a super high attack stat and high HP moves) make up for this tho imo.

...then there's the infamous trash bag Pokemon (Trubbish) and ice cream cone Pokemon (Vanillite), lmfao.
Wasn’t gen 3 also a reboot of some sort?
