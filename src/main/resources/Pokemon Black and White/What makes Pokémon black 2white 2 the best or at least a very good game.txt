[[What makes Pokémon black 2white 2 the best or at least a very good game]]


So if there is one game that I see many people consider the best or at least in their top Pokémon games is black 2/white 2, I was wondering as a person who do love Pokémon but not an expert and only played the old ones really really long time ago, what is so special about this game? The way I  see it ( and I can be completely wrong) game freak pretty much just copied the formula over the years, just changed the graphics and the Pokémon type. So I was wondering what makes this game so special or better than other Pokémon games, because I want to play Pokémon but I only have time to play one game so I would prefer to play one of the games I used to play when I was young for nostalgia unless black 2/white 2 is really something else

Oh there are so many things that made B2W2 so revered, and for me (a player of all gens from release) it is still my favourite Pokemon game

In terms of fundamental changes

- They were a sequel game to BW1, something not done since and not really done before, but you could consider GSC a sequel to RBY. This means that characters have developed in between the games, most notably Cheren and Bianca, your rivals in the 1st BW games. This is present elsewhere, but Gen V characters are well written for the most part

- The story is not BW1 levels but is certainly better that what has come out since. The Team Plasma split is pretty cool, and shows just how unhinged Ghetsis is. Your rival in this game Hugh is a good rival as he is undergoing his own story, is not stuck to you, and is not in your face all the time unlike Hop and Hau as opposite examples

- Unova is expanded with 5 new towns in Aspertia, Floccesy, Virbank, Lentimas and Humilau, and the order of early game and post game are completely different. The post game areas in B2W2 are in BW1 the first 4 towns, gym 7 and Black City/White Treehollow. The region feels huge and there is a lovely amount of variety, not to mention the new routes and dungeons such as Relic Passage, Castelia Sewers and Routes 22/23

- Fantastic updated regional dex with a huge amount of variety in pokemon, and access to a lot of strong pokemon early on. Get an Excadrill asap!

- Join Avenue is a fun almost Animal Crossing esque addon for Route 4. Route 4 itself has changed between games and even versions of B2W2. It gets a bad rep, but Pokestar Studios I find fun as it's battling but following a script to make movies, which can be very amusing if done wrong!

- The Pokemon World Tournament is the best battle facility in Pokemon. 8 person elimination brackets with Driftveil (Gym leaders 1-5 and some rivals), Unova Leaders, each gym leader from previous games to that point, monotype tournaments, mix (take 1 poke from opponent, they take one of yours) and rentals. Not to mention the Champions tournament which has Red, Blue, Lance, Wallace, Steven, Cynthia, Alder and you in a major stakes tournament, all can be down in Singles, Doubles, Triples and Rotations. There is still Black City and White Forest as well which is almost Rougelike in style, and the battle Subway

- New songs, remixes of older themes, seasons, Hidden grottoes which can give you hidden ability pokemon. There is SO MUCH that Game Freak did not have to do in these games, but they still did. These feel like the last games that they had this mantra

I have missed other stuff for sure, but these games are a must play. Even without BW1 experience I would still recommend. I feel like most people could easily get hundreds of hours out of this game

EDIT - Minor changes that they added - Use Another? Repel menu, the Yancy/Curtis dating sim which has never been replicated to that scale, seasonal events such as route changes or N's team changing with each one(BRING BACK SEASONS!), DIFFERENT DIFFICULTIES although the method of unlocking is awful, Memory Link if you played BW1 on the same system filling holes between the games, each gym having new puzzles and remixed themes of the original gym theme, god I could keep going on!
    My personal favorite is the hidden grottos (didn’t see them mentioned but might’ve missed them)
    Biggest thing that I think you missed (and granted this exists in B/W as well); ANIMATED SPRITES!

The animations for the sprites add an unbelievable amount of personality to the pokemon, it's so great to see the pokemon moving and dispite playing pokemon for quite a while now, it still made me super excited to see what little animation some of my favourites have.
        Every trainer in B2W2 also gets an animated sprite, like literally every one down to the youngsters on the first routes to the old gym leaders being brought back for the PWT.

There was a lot of love put into those games
    Yep. You hit the nail on the head. The game is just drowning with content. As much as I love XY, the postgame was barebones compared to its predecessor.
        XY's predecessor is black white, not black white 2 as XY isn't a definitive edition, so bad comparison. Still even if you compared bw2 to XY, XY has more things to do. It has in fact the most Pokemon to collect within out of any Pokemon game
    Black City and Nature Reserve were great. The shiny Haxorus was great.






B2W2 had a lot and did everything pretty well. The only pokemon game I really liked after it were the USUM games.
        I now feel like I need to play B2W2 again.
    White Tree Hollow and Black City are amazing battle facilities with awesome bosses that use legendary Pokémon, and beating it is sooo worth it for the reward of a shiny Dratini or Gible!!! 
I personally love the design within white treehollow too with all the lush plant life and beautiful colours. Man BW2 will never be topped for me I still play it to this day over any switch title. Also Roxie wins for coolest gym leader design ever ☠️
    Both also had great returning characters like the Undella house of horrors. The Battle Tree/City where great additions as well but the whole Unova link thing was completely forgotten in W2/B2.
    Also visuals. I think BW/B2W2 have the best visuals of any Pokémon game.
    Okay, okay. Shit.  I'll play the games again, jeez.  Stop reminding me and digging up fond memories.
    The only thing I wish they did differently was the music.

I wish the wild and trainer battle theme was slightly different from BW1 (like how the Subway and Phenomenon battle themes were slightly different versions of their main themes).

If you play BW1 right into BW2 the standard battle themes get old fast.
    B/W is good and shows Gamefreak made it with care, but it feels incomplete (lack of non Unova pokemon untill post game, linear map progression, lackluster postgame, etc). B2/W2 made it feel complete by improving on all the things I mentioned and adding MORE (animating EVERY trainer, Pokestar Studios, PWT, etc)

I remember the game fondly in my heart. It feels like the last game where they really made it with love and care.
        I like the linear progression. Let's it tell a story with decent pacing. And generally they managed to have at least 2 routes/dungeons between each gym so you got opportunities for new Pokémon and varied environments.
            No, no the linear progression is fine. The problem is linear MAP progression where you go from A town to B city in a straight line (look at your B/W map, you go from Nuvema Town to the Pokemon League in one unbroken line)

Compare this to B2/W2 where they jumbled the town order a bit, you'll see what I mean
                I am fine with that as well I think.
        I wouldn't say those things necessarily make the BW incomplete; they make them worse than B2W2, sure, but not incomplete the way the 3D games have been.

The lack of non Unova mons was intentional, it wasn't some Dexit bs where the old mons were completely unavailable and unusable. Definitely an unpopular design choice, but not indicative of the game being incomplete.

I don't like the linearity of BW Unova, but it still has well made routes and cities. The routes are fleshed out and reward you for backtracking after getting new HMs, and stuff like Chargestone Cave and Twist Mountain feel like classic Pokémon dungeons. Compare that to new caves like Galar Mines 1 and 2.

The postgame isn't as extensive or exciting as Sinnoh's or B2W2's but it's still way better than the postgames we've been getting in the 3D games save for USUM and maybe ORAS.

But yeah, I totally agree with B2W2 being the last games that feel like love and care was put into them. I'm sure the 3D games have passionate people working on them, but to this day it seems like Gamefreak still hasn't fully adapted to the change to 3D and all the games since have suffered as a result.
    Biggest thing for me was that there was never a HM required Roadblock
    One game that comes very close is alpha sapphire and omega ruby. Those two got insane updates and an entire epilogue story that was practically dlc sized (gamefreak made sure to start capitalizing on post elite four content)
    I’ve heard and seen of the joys and wonders of B2W2, and god I wish I could play it. I refuse to emulate it until I’ve properly beaten it for the first time on my DSi, with earbuds in. The “intentional” experience, but it’s just so friggin hard trying to track down a cartridge, let alone be able to afford it. My broke high school ass can’t afford nostalgia prices
    For me the biggest thing is having a 2D world with parts like the boat rides or Sky Arrow bridge become 3D. Absolutely mind blown the first time I saw it, and still amazed when I replayed it recently.
    Good summary, couldn't have said it better. Still shake my head when people try to argue that HGSS are better for the most mundane reasons like 2 small and hollow regions, a copied over battle frontier, following Pokemon, etc
    Unova easily bought the best games and the best anime
    Aside from like 2 things you really didn't say much of why it was good, just better than the first game. And one of those things being PWT was lazy fanservice. Battle tree was better as it offered scouting and frontier before that is better than both combined.
    I had no idea grottoes gave pokemon with hidden abilities, I have a salamence that I got from a grotto many years ago, and im just now figuring out that moxie is a hidden ability for it, thats awesome
Beyond BW and BW2 being really good, their hacks BlazeBlack and VoltWhite from Drayano are awesome as well. Really recommend them.
    I would argue that the Drayano roms are better then any of the base games.
        I'd do too
2 year time skip

We got to see how some rings changed like the mine caved in, the victory road landslide, the desert resort
    Sorry what do you mean by 2 year time skip?
        BW ->B2W2 is 2year jump
        It's set two years after Black and White
BW2 had a good story overall and it tied well with BW stories and the "novelty" of having a sequel was a fresh thing. Plus, it expend onto Unova both on the lore (everything about Kyurem) and geographically (with new town). The post game was really good as well with the Battle Subway and the Pokemon World Tournament, the very silly but fun Pokewood. It's also have the medal system witch not only is making the player "collecting" things (and collecting is part of the DNA of pokemon, so it's appealing to some players) but it was also a nice way to introduce little challenge to the gameplay. I actually made my first monotype team because of these medals (some of the challenge was defeating the league with a monotype team, that's why). BW also have the whole things with capturing N's pokemon and watching memories as well which was a cool event. BW2 also have a difficulty option, granted it was not implemented well but it leads a lot of people hope it would be something that would come in the next title. Honestly there was a lot of good things about these games that made them more interesting than other entries of the franchise (both older and newer).
Difficultly options!
So many variety of Pokemon to be found even in your regular storyline playthrough with more Pokemon unlocked after beating the game. The extra feature of running your own department store is always addicting, or at least it is to me. And let's not forget one thing B2/W2 have that no other Pokemon games have done again, the optional feature to date a character (based on your gender). The Pokemon dress up contest (Pokemon Musical) also stands out to me. There are many more but the last three features I mentioned literally make this game feels as if it's a completely different genre while at the same time allowing you to do regular Pokemon gameplay.
I would love nothing more than to have a remake of a combine B/W & B2/W2 game. Unova was one of my favourite region.
Here are some reasons that I personally see it as one of the best:

-Having pretty much the best storyline of any mainline Pokemon game. I'd argue only SuMo and ScaVio's storylines compete in terms of core series. (I still think EOS trumps BW tho)

-Tons of quality of life changes.

-Good postgame content in BW2. The PWT is so good.

-This is the generation that they started to take a more interesting and diverse turn with their character design.

-Some good Pokemon designs. I mean, a lot are lackluster or boring imo, but there are some really good ones in there.

-Seasons are such a cool concept that  never really got properly implemented again.

-A banger OST, including the many remixes made of earlier gen battle themes for the PWT.

-Tons of cool areas to explore, it doesn't feel terribly linear or monotonous like previous generations. Though I would say that a lot of areas are a bit dull in terms of color schemes, which I find disappointing.

-Difficulty options. Though they were hell to unlock unless you hacked your game, they were still there. Drayano hacks are better for challenges though.
    You are talking with many terms that I don’t know.. what is SuMo? EOS? PWT? OST?
        Sorry, my bad!

SuMo = Pokemon Sun and Moon

EOS = Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky

PWT = Pokemon World Tournament

OST = Original Soundtrack
            Thanks!
B2W2 is just great in every conceivable way. The story is better than most of the games. The music is one of the best. There is so much postgame. I love it.
I just played the gen 5 games for the first time a year or two ago and honestly thought they were gonna be sooo overrated, but uhh B2W2 might be tied with ORAS and USUM for my favorite game ever (along with other non Pokemon games but that doesn't matter here)!

[Asperatia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HsoH-WNTtw) has such an amazing vibe to me, if it wasn't for [Littleroot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGCzCn5azI) nostalgia it would be my favorite by a long shot!
\+Mon variety is great. It's very hard to find outright duds in this game.

\+TMs are infinite use. You can mix and match between moves without a worry.

\+HMs are no longer mandatory. They unlock extra areas, but you can progress through the game without them.

\+The move pool on older mons is significantly improved. If you're coming from playing the older games, you'll notice immediately.

\+A solid challenge for a Pokemon game. It's still easy of course, but some of the later bosses do require more mindfulness than Mash A continually.

\+Bugs are actually good. Galvantula is my favorite.

\+Lots and lots of side content. 

\+Unlike B1/W1, the story isn't as intrusive or predictably paced.

\+It's a little lengthier than other games. You can even evolve Dragon mons before the endgame without a hitch because of added playtime.

\+The music is great.

\-The starters are fairly underwhelming. They're some of the least favorite throughout the series.

\-There are way more mons that evolve past Lv 40. These mons can be clunky to use because having an unevolved mon in the endgame feels like a notable downside.
1. PWT/Best Post game content

2. Region felt very explorable and less linear 

3. I was actually invested in the story 

That’s what makes it the best of me, tied with HG/SS but that’s because Typhlosion is cooler than any of the unova starters.
I just finished it and stopped at level 7 of the unova challlenge because it just felt like a grind at that point and that’s at 105 hours. This game is super long and the post game is unrivaled. The story and characters are amazing.  The only thing I didn’t really like was the Pokémon selection, it felt kinda bland. That was on white 2, when I do black 2 I’m transferring the shiny dratini, shiny haxorus, and the other 2 starters I don’t choose at the beginning and it should be a lot better.
    game: has magnezone 
u/absractthoughtz: “bland” 


/s
        Cooolllll… you named one Pokémon that’s ok, thanks for proving my point.
            wow.
BW2 and Emerald are the best Pokémon games imo
    Why is that?
BW2 has the best post game content and it’s not even close. But the top comment pretty much explained why it’s such a great game. I replay it often.
It has a lot of post game stuff to do
Fighting Cynthia
Unova was the best region, it had the best starters, the best legendaries, the best story, the best anime, the best pseudo legendary, the best games and haxorus
As a White 2 stan, it is the pinnacle of Pokemon
Kyurem
you can get almost all my favorite pokémon in the same game
It has a number in the title 👏
If you only have time to play one game, play the original Black and White. Don’t start with a sequel.
Storywise black and white are better
It gave me lots of fun things to do idek how to explain it but Im never bored and it feels like home
Music 🎶
Fun fact, they’re actually the worst performing Pokemon games in terms of sales, I guess that’s because of the ‘2’ plastered on the sides, but I really like the games! Love the range of Pokemon available, the gym leaders are interesting, and it’s just… pretty.

Even so, I wouldn’t say it’s in my top 3, nor would I say it’s nice to play unless you’ve played the originals first, I think it depends on what your nostalgic games are on whether they are better in comparison
First, I'd say the pokemon. Bw was hated for not including older pokemon, but bw2 has some of the really popular ones. So it keeps the feeling of being brand new while giving you your favorites.

Second, it'd say the difficulty. It was, and still is imo, the first pokemon game that had a consistent difficulty. Not to mention, the difficulty was higher than most games.

Lastly, I'd say all the extra content. The PWT alone makes it one of the best games. It also has a battle tower, that actually has an awesome reward, and pokestar studios.

Ik most people don't like pokestar studios, but I thought it was a little fun.
I honestly don't have the patience to write out an essay.

I played Black and white as a kid and that's where I left the series.

I came back a decade later to play Black 2 and thought it was amazing.

No nostalgia other than the for the original. 
Good story progressed from the first game instead of being a retelling.   Great Post game, lots of fun things to do.
The seasons were so cool. I remmeber going in the first route and there being an item I couldn't reach and then a few months later, leaves I can walk on em. So cool I love love love it. I thought they would bring them back for sv considering sawbucks inclusion but eh
From my own experience it had a great balance of Unova Pokemon mixed with previous generations. The flow and pacing of just playing through the game was fun. It had reasonable challenge to its major battles. It had a storyline but that did not cut into the gameplay too often so it never got annoying (my big beef with Sun and Moon and on). I think it is stronger if you play Black/White first, and Black 2/White 2 make those games better in retrospect.
My personal favorite is the hidden grottos (didn’t see them mentioned but might’ve missed them)
Biggest thing that I think you missed (and granted this exists in B/W as well); ANIMATED SPRITES!
