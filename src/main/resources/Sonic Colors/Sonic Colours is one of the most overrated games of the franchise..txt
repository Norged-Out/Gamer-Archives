[[Sonic Colours is one of the most overrated games of the franchise.]]


I see alot of people saying than Unleashed, Colours and Generations were the last 3D Good games of Sonic until Lost World, Boom and Forces came out (Frontiers is a good game, fucking finally), however, i have to disagree with Colours.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, the game is better than Lost World, Boom and Forces, but compared to Unleashed and Generations... No, in fact, if anyone ask me if they should play Colours, i say they should play the DS version, yeah, is a Rush rip off, but the story isn't terribly bad, and i prefer the Rush gameplay than the Wii version... But why is that?

&#x200B;

1: Story:

&#x200B;

I think everyone agrees on this, the writers didn't even know what Sonic was when they made the game... So you should expect a shitty story.

&#x200B;

Roger Craig Smith is a excellent VA, and in Boom and Frontiers, he finally got a fucking break of being "cringe", the story of Colours is childish, extremely childish, is basically the same thing as "Eggman wants to conquer shit and Sonic stops him", but the problem is, the dialogues are a cringefest, Sonic acts like the "RaDiCaL" Sonic we got in Adventure, but even worse, and since this was the first time Roger dubbed Sonic, a huge part of the community hated him, why? Because in this game, he needed to act like Sonic is a Youtuber from the 2013, who needs to spam words like "OMG" or "LOL".

&#x200B;

It doesn't help than this is definetly the Sonic with the less important story of the 3D Franchise by far, the world isn't collapsing, neither new interesting characters arrived, Eggman just makes Eggmanland in space, while he tries to catch aliens who gives superpowers to Sonic... And that's basically it.

&#x200B;

2: Gameplay

&#x200B;

The Gameplay of Colours is actually good, and gives more control than Unleashed... That is until you realize this game is 70% 2D.

&#x200B;

First of all, you can see every world has 6 stages, and you are like "HOLY SHIT, SO COOL" until you realize they have the same duration as the Cyberspace stages from Frontiers, not only that, but the game abuses of 2D, you are playing more 2D than 3D, and this wouldn't be a problem if we are talking about Mania, but not MODERN SONIC, you know, 3D Sonic, the guy who is trying to be different from his classic form.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, 3D Sonic can have some 2D gameplay, that isn't bad, but if the game abuses that and gives you entire levels of 2D, then sorry, but is not fun, you can't make Unleashed Levels full of speed and fun, and then giving me this 2D stages who most of the times are slow and boring.

&#x200B;

It doesn't help than the new mechanic, the Whisp powers, are irrelevant most of the times, sure, some are cool like the drill or the Laser, but some of them are just worthless, and not fun, like the cube... Why that exists?

&#x200B;

Seriously, this sounds like a joke, but i can't believe how so many people completly ignores the DS version, when that game has solid gameplay, with a better story, yeah, again, is a Rush rip-off, but i prefer that than playing 2D in a 3D Game.

&#x200B;

The game is fun, but not at the same level as Unleashed or Generations, in my opinion.


1. There is still people calling this game overrated when this is the most basic opinion of the fanbase, lol

2. Don't you think this sub is better for talking about story only?
    The description of this subreddit literally says you can rant about alot of things, and one of the post is saying Scythes are terrible weapons... So no, i can complain about the gameplay perfectly.
        Ignore these drone sonic fan copers bro. Colors was literally worshipped as the best 3D sonic game of all time for the better part of a decade so they don't want to give credit to any actual critique.
> The game is fun, but not at the same level as Unleashed 

The game that's 95% garbage combat is "better"...?
    Combat wasn't garbage and I actually had fun playing it as a kid. I liked the differences in difficulty back then, it made me feel like I got my moneys worth long term for a game.

Unleashed IS the best sonic game in terms of the overall package. Best cutscenes, sleekest UI, best voice actors for the series imo, amazing soundtrack actually based on real-world cultures, culturally accurate hub-worlds, the list honestly goes on. 

Compared to sonic colors, which is bloated with 2D gameplay, mid-wii era graphics, and one of the most basic and soulless sonic stories I've ever seen in my life. Wisps I will admit are a better gimmick than the werehog gameplay wise. At least there's some sort of gameplay progression with the werehog, you get combos, damage boosts, extra health, shields, ect. 

I don't see how people complain about the werehog music/gameplay when the drill wisp has annoying as fuck music and is super boring to use if we're being honest. Some of the wisps take gameplay elements that were already in sonic games and turn them into wisps. Light speed dash gets replaced by the hover wisp, spin dash/wall jump gets replaced by the spike wisp, and the "normal" wisps literally replace the rings giving you boosts for stages.
I disagree. I think Colours is the best one of modern Sonic. Unleashed has this issue where 80% of the game is not sonic and plays like a jarringly slow action beat 'em up, and is the worst part of the game.

Generations is pretty great, and it can be interchangeable with Colours, but it also has 2D levels, so I'm confused over why this is such a bad thing. The 2D levels often have better platform designs. With that said, this game is a celebration of Modern and Classic Sonic best outputs, but the final boss is garbage.

Sonic Colours feels like the complete package. It's consistently good from beginning to end, and the final boss doesn't suck. Some wisps are annoying, but thankfully they're not always a necessity in the game unless you're exploring. And the levels are short but sweet.

Werehog wasn't as bad as people thinks, sure, it isn't Sonic, but the PS3/Xbox version wasn't that long, the problem was the PS2/Wii version.

Because is CLASSIC Sonic, and it was a nostalgia celebration, that's why i don't complain of that, because Classic Sonic obviously needs to be 2D

&#x200B;

None of your examples are close to the problem of Colours, Unleashed had the Werehog, but it wasn't terrible to play, it had great music, and the Day stages are still peak design of the Boost era.

&#x200B;

Generations 2D is justified because it had Classic Sonic, and at the same time, you had 3D Sonic to compensate that.

&#x200B;

Colours has 70% 2D in a 3D Sonic Game, and that's inexcusable.

I think this is my biggest problem with the critique of sonic colors honestly. Sonic fans don't understand that sonic is rated E10 and up. There are games that will appeal to the older fans who like the darker stories of sonic. There are games (sonic colors, sonic lost world) that will appeal to the younger demographic. These are one of those games, the jokes, story, etc. most likely won't hit the same for you because they're not they wasn't really made for you (older fans) in mind.
    Sonic has sold like trash pretty much the entire post-unleashed era so this approach is clearly not working. Kids clearly do not care. Apart from the miderate movie success which I suspect is largely driven by grown men shooting up nostalgia straight to the veins.
You're not wrong. Sonic Colors only has that reputation because they kind of stripped all the "personality" that sonic had with the story and attitude and replaced it with something more PG while keeping the gameplay elements the same. 

They also removed some of sonics moveset like the lightspeed dash, spin dash, and boosts from rings to make the wisps feel more rewarding because they essentially provide him with the same abilities. 

There's nothing WRONG with the game, it's got heart put into it but compared to unleashed it fell flat when it came to making me feel like I was playing something that mattered. Sonic Unleashed blows modern sonic games out of the water by itself with the quality of the music, stage design and length, and the modern sonic gameplay. Technical issues were the biggest problems, werehog stages aren't bad at all if you're upgrading the werehog the right way. I can say this because I've actually gotten S rank on Eggmanland (PS3) and it's not even hard. I've played the ps2 version and I will say those werehog stages are mid cause there's wayy less upgrade options. 

Modern sonic stages are a breeze and all you have to do for the werehog is use combos and use the power ups wisely. I'm pretty sure the power ups for the werehog range from increased attack speed, to damage boosts, and damage reduction. The button mashing combos are satisfying to pull off, there are quicktime events that actually make you feel like theres something at risk, and theres actual precise platforming in the game that normally modern sonic can't execute. I think the werehog battle music is the reason people hate it so much, cause nobody in the sonic fandom has issues with spamming Square or X in Sonic Heroes with the power roles which 100% have less gameplay complexity than the werehog
I actively hated Colors during my playthrough of it. I chalked it up to it being the ultimate version and I assumed "The wii version MUST have a different gameplay format" and just went on my way. Ignoring the atrociously annoying Sonic I had to groan through. The game was ridiculously boring with the 2D sections. I remember waiting for Frontiers and just thinking "I need to beat this game before it comes out..." and just whined and begged for the sweet release of end credits. Even the bosses were lackluster, half the wisps I didn't care for (Whisper does it better, fight me), the stages were short but was so boring it felt I was in eternal hell, and so forth. It did look very pretty though and there were sections that were fun (like Sonic riding the Rollercoaster through space). 

I unironically had more fun with Black Knights than I did with Colors. (Colors did have some BANGER soundtracks though).
The 2D in colors is downright terrible. The double jump stiffness is awful, the wisps are crammed in and arbitrary, the level design is blocky and all these flaws get magnified 2x in Act 2 of each zone. The story is not even worth mentioning as every last aspect of it is trash. The music is pretty good but far from top tier of the series. overall I wish colors just stayed as the wii generations port it was going to be.
I still think colour ds is the better version and also the sonic rush 3 game that we all wanted
My little gaming hot take is that, when taken as overall packages, sonic colors is worse than sonic forces. When a sonic colors stage is good, it’s really good and blows anything forces has out of the water but like you said, the vast majority of the game is dumb filler that just blows. Sonic forces is mediocre all around but at least it’s consistent in that.
