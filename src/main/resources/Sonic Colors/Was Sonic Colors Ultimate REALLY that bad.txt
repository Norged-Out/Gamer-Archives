[[Was Sonic Colors Ultimate REALLY that bad]]


I'm just asking this because I feel that people were just being overly harsh to it, but do you think Sonic Colors Ultimate was really that bad? Is there anything redeemable or anything of redemption that can be found of this title?

It had some technical issues, some of which got patched out.

It didn't re-render cutscenes, meaning they stuck out compared to gameplay, looking brighter than the game.

The credits sequence was over 20 minutes, silent for the last 10.

There was remarkably little new content, a few token races against Metal Sonic, and a few red rings got moved to make use of the Jade Wisp.

But generally, it was just a port of the Wii title. Nothing incredible, but unless you're a nitpicker who wanted a flawless 1:1 conversion, or someone who hates on the game simply because of what Colours represents (boost gameplay, lots of 2D, light-hearted story with no Super Sonic vs eldritch horror ending), it seemed like it was a fair enough 7/10 post patch. Not atrocious, just good.

        I do. Is it not recommended to play if so? Bought this game for my son on Switch as I finished the Wii version back in the day.
            Oh my god it’s been almost a year
Yes. If you played the game day one you’d see how embarrassingly unfinished it was as a product. I played on PS4 and had tons of issues, the sounds and music weren’t playing right, I kept clipping through the environment and getting stuck on shit

They patched it and it’s a lot better but it shouldn’t have been put out like that in the first place. And even now it’s stuck with washed out visuals that look less good than they did on the Wii, including cutscenes they didn’t bother to re-render, and they had the audacity to take the new music they made out of the game and sell it back to you as DLC. I have never heard of music being DLC. Plenty of games release DLC that should’ve just been in the base game, but I have never heard of DLC that ***was*** in the base game
Bad on launch.  Pretty good post patch.
In my playthrough I only encountered 2 glitches. The game is a 7/10 for me mostly because its mostly short 2D levels.
I think it had a bad launch yeah, even if its mostly fixed now. It's pretty much just the same old Colors though.
Yeah.
