[[What do you guys think about Sonic Colors nowadays]]


I just stumbled upon a video of Sonic Colors and went ahead on reading some comments about the game. What suprised me is the amount of negativity and insults the game receives nowadays compared when it first released on the Wii.

As for me I still like the game and it still has one of the best Endboss fights in the history of Sonic. Even though it may be not the best game in the Series, I often come back to the game to play a few levels and have some fun! \^\^


An excellent game that was quite literally everything this series needed at the time  
  
I feel like most people who hate this game are too young to have been aware just how bad Sonic's reputation was before it came out
    I don't think it's necessarily about being too young, so much as it's expectations of the series as a whole.

If you grew up with Sonic in the early nineties, the Sonic of much of the two thousands was pretty much the opposite of how you knew Sonic to be. The status quo of the series, prior to the release of Sonic Adventure, was that of a cartoon world with a singular recurring villain who was presented as having one goal, take over the world using his robots, with Sonic constantly looking to stop him. 

This all changed following Adventure, where suddenly Eggman was a goofier villain who relied on finding deities, magical rocks, or lost precursor tech to make his attempts, but innevitably lost control over it, leaving the games in a weird position where the final boss is usually not Eggman, and has Sonic going up against some cosmic horror that are clearly anime inspired. Furthermore, the gameplay was often considered sub-par, and for ages fans said Sonic Team needed to take focus away from multiple playstyles, and make a game that was just Sonic to get the feel of that right, and it took until Colours to get that.

But this only worked for those who grew up in the nineties. Those who grew up following Adventure, had a different take; they hated Colours because it lacked all the things they'd got used to in the series, namely multiple play styles, complicated plots and boss fights against cosmic horrors. To them, Colours was a step away from what they loved, not a long overdue course correction.

Between him having silly animations and expressions in the classic games and having tons of serious moments in both Adventure games, from trying to bomb Station Square to threatening Amy at gunpoint... no, I don't see the correlation here. At least not unless you looked at SatAM Robotnik specifically and not any of his other incarnations.
            You have to look at it not just from the point of the view of the games, but also the comics and shows. Yes, AoStH's Robotnik was goofy, but both SatAM and Underground had more serious Robotnik's, as did Archie's Sonic comics once they started getting serious as well as Fleetway's Sonic the Comic. 

Yes, there are absolutely goofy moments from Eggman in the classic games. The plot of Sonic Labyrinth is clearly a prime example, but even in the mainline games, Eggman attacking Sonic with a giant mallet to hit totem polls that shoot arrows, or a large wrecking ball is inherently goofy. But at the same time, the actual substance of what was going on wasn't. Eggman was presented as a serious threat, he may have made goofy machines, but he was the singular antagonist in the first two games, and deceives Knuckles in the third only to betray Knuckles. He actually has successes, he does launch the Death Egg, he does steal the Master Emerald, it's just that Sonic is able to stop them shortly afterwards.

Contrasted to the Adventure era and especially the post Adventure era and Eggman is not taken seriously, not presented as someone to be taken seriously, and even stops being the main threat, in a series where previously he was the only threat. Up until Sonic Adventure, Sonic didn't have a rogues gallery, he didn't need one, and many will argue that he still doesn't. But the Adventure era brought with it dozens of random final bosses many of which are cosmic horrors with motives unknowable to mere mortals, which feels out of place if you grew up with multiple media about a superfast blue hedgehog trying to stop a tyrant from turning the planet into robots.

It was simply a jarring transition, compared to pretty much everything that came before. It would be like if Batman had a story where he's investigating a series of murders done by the Riddler trying to track down who the next potential victim is when suddenly Cthulhu appears and Batman was the only one who could stop him by punching the eldritch horror in the face. It simply doesn't seem to fit the tone of everything that came before, feels out of place, and renders everything previous largely inconsequential by tipping the scales out of whack.
It's perfectly fine, I suspect a lot of the hate is coming from the group that only played Colors Ultimate at launch, when it was glitchy af, and not the original.

It *can* be pretty bland and repetitive at times though, in hindsight.
Has great moments but half the time is a chore to play. Every time I start to miss the game I fire it up and after a few levels I’m like “Oh yeah, this is why I stopped”
Colours for the Wii is a pretty solid title. It plays well, looks good considering the platform, and is fun to play. But it lacks the spectacle and wow factor of other titles, and is a bit more puzzle-platformer than many other Sonic games, especially if you want to collect all the red rings. 

Colours for the DS is effectively the third Rush game, and is much easier. It's actually a lot of fun, and recommended for someone looking for another Rush title. 

Colours Ultimate I didn't bother with. Too little new content to justify buying it a second time. 

As for content, it's fine. I know a lot of people resent it for not having an Eldritch Abomination as a final boss (though the DS version does have one), and it's comedy isn't funny (at least not in cutscenes), but I think it's alright. Not the best title in the series, but far from the abomination some of it's detractors make it out to be.
Every game should be exposed to criticism. But the overwhelming negative online discourse surrounding Colours is absurd. 


Game is good, a little lackluster but doesn't deserve to be as hated as it is, especially since the reasons for it to be so are ridiculous.
it saved the franchise for the price of mediocrity. I didn't think it sucked, its just not my cup of tea anymore
shit has not aged well at all. I used to love that game, amazing music and graphics. But there was one thing that was different about this game compared to EVERY other sonic game for me. i NEVER wanted to replay it. It perplexed me for years like if the game was really good, how come im not going back to it???

Then ultimate came out, it gave me a reason to replay this game. Then i realized that game just isnt that fun. The wisps are case sensitive, half of them dont even have a purpose other than to be a stage gimmick. Calling this game a 3D sonic game is a joke since 90% of it is 2D, the levels are short and plentiful which leaves me confused because i only enjoy a couple levels in each planet so, do i actually like the planet or do i just like 2 stages out of the large spread of stages in each planet.

Most of the game is just automated anyway, not as bad as forces, but damn close. The writing in this game is the worst ive seen as well. Its fun to make fun of, but not to enjoy. The best thing i can say for this game is the music. (which not to add salt, ultimate ruined)

Edit: btw i still have the pre order spines hat
    I've not really played the original all that much, but this sums it up pretty well for me as well on the subject of the ultimate edition.

However, I want to add on since the game is pretty much 2d anyway the Wii or ultimate versions aren't even the best way to play the game. I would highly recommend the DS version over both of them anyway. Plenty of different dialogue and they got a much better feel for the platforming than the versions SEGA would have us call the definitive version. The emerald collection was also pretty fun too in the DS version.
        fuck, i gotta play the ds port. i've heard its the better of the rush style games for the ds. And it has other characters in it besides sonic and tails. Like i think rouge might be in it?
It would be a fantastic spin off game, but if you treat it like a mainline game which it is then it kinda pales in comparison to every other game,
DS version was better
I’m mixed on it. I respect what it stood for in the moment, but I’m not too fond of the game itself and what it did to the series going forward. 

I do acknowledge the role this game played in bring respect back to the Sonic brand. Regardless of how highly I think of Unleashed and Black Knight, they were not received well at all upon release thanks to the state Sonic 06 and Secret Rings had left the series in socially. As such, Colours was a major turning point in the franchise that garnered people’s respect.

However, that doesn’t stop me from disliking this game in almost every way. The story is bland, the characters are bland at best and mind-numbing at worst, the gameplay is okay, the level design for the first two stages of each planet are great but they quickly devolve into godawful levels afterwards, and the only boss I can remember liking is the final one. The only things I can give it personally that I haven’t mentioned is it’s great music (which is a staple of the Sonic franchise) and that it’s stable (but it was a Wii game, so not much of a crowning achievement).

Furthermore, this game spawned the whole “play it incredibly safe” idea that Sonic had from then until Frontiers. While I don’t explicitly blame Colours for it, it’s important to point out where it came from. Blend that with the “nostalgia = money” idea that Generations spawned (Generations was justified to abuse nostalgia, Lost World and Forces weren’t), and we got Forces.

And then you have Colours Ultimate, but I’d like to go to bed now as it’s late and I don’t wanna go ranting about Colours Ultimate.

The sad thing for me is that Colours was one of my first games in the series I ever played. It was the first game I ever bought with my own money, and it’ll forever have that special place in my heart, but I can’t deny the enormous flaws that game has.
    Well-put. The only thing I disagree with is your brief mention of Secret Rings. This isn't to speak to its quality, but I don't think people realize that SR was recieved very well on release by both critics and fans. It doesn't come up anymore because of how much its shit on nowadays, but there was a time when it was very popular.

The "slump" Sonic was in the time was mostly caused by the noticeable decline in the mainline games (SA2 > Heroes > Shadow > 06). Regardless of how people feel about these games nowadays, at the time people felt like Sonic was declining and worsening as a franchise.
It's an excellent filler game. Creative gameplay gimmicks, solid controls, especially original level aesthetics, and an entertaining story with genuinely good jokes and character moments. It's not peak Sonic; the game is noticeably more simple than most and not very challenging, but it wasn't trying to be anything besides... a good game. Not a great game, but a good one.

The unfortunate thing about Colors is that everything it was praised for was incorporated into *every* subsequent game for the next decade without paying attention to *why* that writing and game design worked in Colors specifically, and why it wouldn't work for subsequent titles; namely the fact that both of those things get stale if it's overused. Colors was short, has small stakes and an even smaller cast, but games with more urgency and a larger roster of characters suffered from that presentation.

Colors is what I'd call Sonic at par. Nothing about it is bad but nothing about it is something I'd consider to be the golden standard of the franchise, which is how it was treated by both SEGA and the fanbase because the bar was set really low by the last several games.
I don't think it's necessarily about being too young, so much as it's expectations of the series as a whole.
