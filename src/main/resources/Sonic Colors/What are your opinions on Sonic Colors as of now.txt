[[What are your opinions on Sonic Colors as of now]]


I've noticed that people have multiple opinions on this game, some people like it, some hate it, and some think it's decent. Personally, I like the game, sure the level design has its problems and the plot can be cringy at times, but I still enjoyed the games despite it's flaws, even 7 years later. 

So what are your opinions on this game?

EDIT: This includes both DS and Wii versions


Funny, I just recently replayed Colors. The Wii version anyway, as I've never played the DS version. I should get to that some day...

Anyway, I still Sonic Colors is pretty good, though I don't think it's held up as much as I remember. I think the game's biggest weakness is the platforming. Not of all it is bad, but some of it feels a bit too basic. Not Sonic Forces basic, but basic enough to where it's a little disappointing. I think the Wisps are handled the best in this game compared to other games, though not all of them are winners (Cube, Rocket, and Frenzy are the losers IMO). I feel like the Wisps enhance the game's design, because they're *usually* optional. I say usually because there will be times where you have to use them. 

People give Colors a lot of shit for the writing, since this is the first game Putnac and Graff wrote, and those people are despised in this fandom. While I do think some of their comedy is pretty awful (the clobbering scene was just terrible), I think this is the best game they've written. The copyright law gets me every time. 

If I were to rank Colors on a tier list for the main games, I'd rank it in the lower B section, above Sonic 1, but below the Adventure games.
    One of the main problems I had with the game is the bosses in the wii version, sure I liked the Nega Wisp Armor, but the bosses were basically the same thing, just with a difference to it.

Tropical Resort and Planet Wisp. Difference: Different platforms and different Wisps (Laser and Spike)

Sweet Mountain and Aquarium Park. Difference: Water, more enemies, and ship defenses

Starlight Carnival and Asteroid Coaster. Difference: one boss can utilize portals and altered attacks.

Strange how I notice that people complain with some of Sonic Forces's bosses, but the Wii version of this game did the same thing, just on different levels.
        No, I'll agree with the boss fights being lame. The Ferris Wheel bosses in particular were jokes. Then again, this is a series that isn't known for having very good bosses. As much as I give Forces shit for being conceptually broken, having incredibly barebones level design, and butchering Classic Sonic beyond comprehension, the boss fights in Forces were one of the better parts of the game. Zavok's fight in this game is better than any of his boss battles in Lost World, and Infinite's first two boss fights are okay. 
    Use an emulator for the DS version
Wii version=great.
I enjoy both. The DS is a decent follow up up Rush. The Wii is a brilliant Sonic game.
I replayed the Wii Version with the Dolphin Emulator earlier in the week.

It's still a fun game in my opinion.
I like it. It's not the greatest game in the world, but it was a good follow-up to Unleashed and a fun game overall. It had some incredibly inspired art direction, being the last Sonic game as of now that was truly original, as well as a killer soundtrack. The level design could be bland at times (not to mention how many times they recycled the same maps), but I liked how much the Wisps allowed you to explore the level, and searching for Red Rings added great depth to the stages. I also liked how the boost was limited, so that it had to be used sparingly to defeat enemies, draw in rings and take shortcuts rather than being held down the entire game. It felt like a return to the classic ideology of knowing when to go fast and when to slow down and platform/explore. 

As for the writing, I loved Eggman's PA announcements, but the cutscenes were boring and cringe-y. Still, a game like this can make up for a mediocre story with great gameplay, and Colors does just that. While the game definitely had too much 2D, to the point where it's hard to call it a 3D game, as well as having somewhat janky controls in both 3D and 2D, it's use of solid, time-tested game design methods and incredibly creative presentation make it one of the best Modern Sonic games. I'd give it a solid 8/10 and a 7 on my top 10 Sonic games; not amazing, but a fun time while it lasts.

As for the DS version, I never got past Planet Wisp's boss, but I enjoyed what I played. It was basically Sonic Rush with Wisps, and while it wasn't as good as Sonic Rush it was a good deal more fun than Rush Adventure. 7/10 for me.
It's a great Sonic game aND much better than forces
Sonic Colors is a masterpiece compared to Sonic Forces
I love Sonic Colors! It's not my favorite, but I think it's a really solid entry. Levels were vibrant and imaginative, story was pretty laid back, and the wisps made for some fun, unique little puzzles and platforming sections. Especially in some of those mini-levels...

Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the boss battles. They're pretty forgettable in my opinion.
It's really fun, I love the cutscenes and openig animation, they look great
I think it's a great game, I just fucking hate it when people call it "The best 3D Sonic game". Colors is not a 3D game, it's a 2D game with small sections of 3D.
Wii: Way too gimmicky, slow, 2D and blocky for my liking.

DS: How to make fast-paced level design with wisps right.

Also I like Forces more than Colors. It feels like a better Colors in many regards.
The Wii version is bad!

The Ds version is really good!

(Dont kill for opinion)
I absolutely LOVED both versions on release but I haven't played them in a long time. I remember really enjoying getting all S ranks since it actually took some effort and thought unlike generations and forces. Like you said everyone seems to have different opinions on them so maybe I was blinded by hype though. I'll jump back in soon and find out.

The soundtrack however is amazing that's one part I will always defend as with most games in this series.
Wii version = if I ignore act 3-6 on all zones, great. If not, bland.

DS = Great.
Wii version = pretty good, the controls are a bit toned down(no lightspeed dash, no drift or quickstep with the trigger buttons), the level design can be a little weird, the 3d sections are a bit rare, but overall still great
DS version = great it is essentially a sonic rush 3 without blaze as a playable character(which makes me sad :( ) 
Overall i think colors is a great sonic game.
It's fun and has a killer OST. Not my favorite but still good (I'm not the hugest fan of games where you only play as Sonic, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit).

Still need to finish it though to be honest, I was in the middle of it when Forces came out and I got distracted lol
I wish it would let me remap controls so that I could play it with a good scheme on the Classic Controller
Breathtaking visuals and ideas that to this day are still some of Sonic's most unique setpieces from any of his games. Wisps were a novel concept at the time and they were definitely integrated into this game very well, encouraging replayability since they weren't all unlocked from the start; both for added level exploration and Red Ring collecting. The humor, while occasionally a bit cringey, is still probably what I'd call the (main) series at its funniest. Some jokes really hit home runs, and Eggman's PA announcements were a great touch. It was definitely more hit than miss because it never felt too over-the-top, this game was more sarcastic than anything else and for Sonic that's fine.

That said, I think the game still gets a bit overpraised because while the gameplay is still perfectly solid, it's definitely not what it advertises itself as. The game is primarily 2D which is why I have a really hard time calling it a 3D Sonic game, and why I'm genuinely baffled that others would put it on the same caliber as said 3D games when it has about as much of a 3D to 2D ratio as the Classic titles compared to their special stages. 2D sections absolutely take up the bulk of the game, which for me is disappointing. Plus said 2D sections are also pretty run-of-the-mill and don't really stand out amongst each other, not helped by a ton of acts being exclusively 2D sections just for the sake of padding. When I'm not playing in 3D, the game feels a lot less exciting most of the time, even if it's never *bad* either.

The story's harmless but I like more meat in my Sonic narratives; the simple stop Eggman plot might be enough for some people but I think that's dreadfully boring and if it weren't for the game's sense of humor, the story would have put me to sleep. Not helping was how this game was the start of Sonic games being veeeeery bare-bones and/or more goofy in terms of plot, which I just... don't like. Generations was dull and Lost World was a hot mess that didn't know what it wanted to do. It wasn't until Forces where I felt like it was giving an honest effort to give us meaningful stakes again, but even that bleeds of the Pontac/Graff cheesiness, missed potential and general lack of any elaboration that I think overstayed their welcome after this game was through. It's because of this game that they're still around at all and I don't think they deserve that much credit.

At the end of the day, I feel like everything Colors does from a gameplay perspective and from a story perspective are things that basically any other boost game does better. As a result, despite Colors having some noteworthy benefits that no other game has, nowadays it still feels like it's just... there. A welcome addition at its release for sure and still a good game, but it falls flat in its main mechanics compared to other very similar titles so I don't see myself going back to it often.

This is all just for the Wii version by the way, never touched the DS version unfortunately.
I’d say it’s honestly better than Forces. Sonic Colors had lots of gimmicks that would really make you interested and focused on the gameplay. It was also one of the first sonic games I tried to compete 100%, it really has a special place in my heart :,) 
It's still a solid action platformer, a good foundation to build some ideas upon. On its own  it is pretty standard, but after the dumpster-fires of 06 and Unleashed, it was a breath of fresh air. I consider it better overall than SA1, SA2, Heroes, Shadow, 2006, Unleashed, Lost World, and Forces.
I like the DS version. I think the wii version is trash, especially when compared to the other boost games (even forces).

The game is defined by it's flow-breakers. Wisps break the flow of gameplay, stopping to wait for buttons to rotate platforms breaks the flow of gameplay, blocky 2d platforming segments break the flow of gameplay, and every few levels you're treated to a brand new way to break the flow of gameplay, and fluidity of movement is what I find fun in sonic games. The writing is reminiscent of a bad children's cartoon, the visuals, while good, don't compare to any other boost game or carry the gameplay, and something about the animation and the weird way that characters only move in exaggerated ways and only on syllables of words bothers me.

The DS version on the other hand is literally just rush, which is one of the pinnacles of fluid sonic gameplay, so thumbs up.
One of the main problems I had with the game is the bosses in the wii version, sure I liked the Nega Wisp Armor, but the bosses were basically the same thing, just with a difference to it.

Tropical Resort and Planet Wisp. Difference: Different platforms and different Wisps (Laser and Spike)

    No, I'll agree with the boss fights being lame. The Ferris Wheel bosses in particular were jokes. Then again, this is a series that isn't known for having very good bosses.
