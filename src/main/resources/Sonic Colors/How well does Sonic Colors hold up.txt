[[How well does Sonic Colors hold up]]





I’d give it a B+. 

Pros:

Great level themes

Fresh and unique story ideas

Wisp are usually well utilized 

Absolutely ducking bumping music 

Seriously just listen to the Planet Wisp Act 1 and overworld theme

Cons:

Absolutely awful writing 

Too many 2D sections

Each zone has too many acts, which leads to recycled content.
    Games since Generations have been rather short, so I can excuse the acts part.
    the drill wisp theme bangs
        Yeah, bangs my head into a wall over and over again.
It's one of the best Sonic games if you ask me.

I think it gets a lot of unfair criticism because it's similar to another Sonic game: Sonic Forces. The difference is that Colors is good, and Forces is not. Not to mention the shitty Switch port that probably hurt the game's reputation.

Sonic Colors started this "formula" in Sonic games that really hasn't gone away yet. People are tired of the Wisps and the 2D levels in 3D games, and the subpar writing, and I don't really blame them.

It seens like Sonic Team forgot what made the Wisps and 2D levels so special in Sonic Colors. By the time Sonic Forces came out, it was clear that the Colors formula had to go. Sonic Frontiers looks promising. 

But in Sobic Forces the Wisps serve no real purpose, the writing is worse than ever, the levels play themselves, the Classic Sonic levels are awful, all of that stuff.

But it's not fair to hate a game because of what it "did" to the future of the franchise. Looking Sonic Colors by itself, it's actually pretty damn good.
It holds up fine, I think. I mean, we haven't really had anything particularly great since, so there's not really anything since to make it look bad by comparison. It has a fun story, cringey dialogue, decent gameplay, mediocre level design, really cool level ideas, and great voice acting. It's a...pretty middle-of-the-road Sonic game, all things considered, but I think it ultimately has more going for it than against it. There's nothing particularly BAD about it, but nothing amazing, either. It's fine.
It's a very good game and definitely on my top 10 Wii Games

It's gameplay is great, and the wisps are really fun to use.

Also Speak with your Heart and Reach for the Stars are great.

I'm sad the Sonic Fanbase has turned on this game.

Some people acting like "Why did Sega make this game" when it started a short renaissance for Sonic for the fans, critics, and general audiences.

It's mind boggling seeing people act like Colors is bad because it's the "Meta Era".

I missed when Unleashed actually got criticism (I like the game but it went from underrated to overrated fast).
Now considering that my first experience with the game was with ultimate, I enjoyed it mostly, though this was after all the patches, but I played it on both ps5 and switch, but I had fun with it, there is some issues like with the copy paste levels, and more 2d sections, and obviously the original launch of ultimate, but it was a fun experience to me, I'd probably rate it 7/10
One of the better Sonic games. A- overall, not quite on the top tier with games like Generations or Mania but quite comparable to games like Sonic 2, the Rush series etc. 

Mechanically sonic isn’t as complex to control here as he was in the adventure series or unleashed, but he still maintains quite a good pace. The wisps are possibly the best unique mechanic implementation seen in any sonic game. Levels utilize the wisp abilities to a great extent, both aiding you to complete the level faster and opening up many different exploration routes and alternate paths. It’s incredibly satisfying to blast through a level chaining together your wisp abilities and your boost like the movements in a symphony, and it’s incredibly rewarding to go back and open up capsules that you couldn’t before to find Red Rings. The visuals are also beautiful, with environments that are only second to Unleashed imo with how jaw dropping and inspired they are, with well fitting OSTs to match. 

It’s not without its flaws though. A good bit of the levels (though I generally think it’s overstated how many) serve little purpose, being 30 second long blocky platforming challenges with minimal wisp usage that would fit in better with the bonus stages in Sonic Chaos than as mandatory levels for completion. There’s heavy usage of 2D, which most of the time isn’t a bad thing since a the game mostly hits its stride in a 2D environment, but it seems that Sonic’s speed is noticeably reduced in these sections which always peeved me. The story is nice and all, and I don’t mind the character writing nearly as much as others do (it was quite a unique presentation of Sonic back in 2010 at least), but most of the in-engine cutscenes just have not aged well, especially compared to the in-engine cutscenes in unleashed. The Marza animations look great though. It’s these problems that keep Colors from truly being a top tier Sonic game for me, but I still hold it in high regard for executing its gimmick better than any of its peers and managing to do something completely new that doesn’t clash with Sonic’s core identity.
Started replaying via Dolphin shortly after Ultimate was announced, and as of the last I touched it, it's still easily in my top 3 Modern games, and possibly top 5 overall.
    >top 3 modern games

there are only like 4 tho
        I still consider everything from Dreamcast forward to be Modern era.
Average game
It's fantastic. One of the best in the series. Doesn't have the highest highs, but it also has practically no low points. At its worst, its just a bit whatever but at its best its a ton of fun. 

I've only ever played the Wii Version and that's what I'd personally recommend. Every Sonic fan should try the game for themselves and come to their own conclusion. It's been rather contentious lately, but I'll always love it no matter what. (Helps that I'm not really bothered about story in Sonic games lol.)
Colors DS is so underrated
Favorite game since adventure. Its nice to just have a game that actually feels like a proper game. It's not as automated as Forces, it's not as random as Unleashed, it's light on filler, the story doesn't pretend to be something it's not, it doesn't lock off the final boss behind replaying the same game 4 times, it's just a fun game.
Still a good game.

I give it an A.
I like it.
It’s nothing mind blowing but I feel like it gets a lot of unnecessary hate because the “Ultimate” version was super glitchy. The base game itself is still a good time.
    I always thought it got hate because of all the "meta era bad" stuff
        That’s also true.
        And the mediocre level design, for me.
            I heavily relies on 2D level design (certainly to meet budget issues) but I wouldn't call it "mediocre". A bit repetitive at times would be more like it.
Colors is a game that was carried heavily by the optics and air at the time it was released in. By itself...it holds up fine but isn't particularly great or remarkable imo.

The DS game is superior to me in nearly every regard
Other than the start of the worst writing the series has ever had, it's an incredibly mid game, to the point of being boring
Wii version back in the day pretty ok, Ultimate? Pretty bad.
It's very short even with all the padding, and it doesn't do enough with its premise.  It's alright, but it's definitely an overhyped game that hasn't aged well.  I dislike it, but it's decidedly middle-tier among Sonic games.
A good game the first time you play it
It's one of my favourite Sonic games.
Gameplay: fun and cool

Gimmick: for the first time a gimmick to a new game is used amazingly. 

Cutscenes: cringe and asinine
My third favorite sonic game of all time
Not very well. I even think it was overrated at the time. Here's why:  
\- Terrible level design with 80% of it being extremely tedious 2D sections(waiting for platforms to move, blocky platforming, etc)   
  
\- Uneventful and extremely boring story; awful writing as well(this game started the 'meta era' writing which we all hate)

  
\- Drifting and sidestep controls are awkward, albeit this is a technical problem with the Wii's limited controls(however this wasnt even fixed in ultimate either)  


\- Game is overall a chore to play through; they went quantity over quality with the levels and it seems like they gave up halfway through each world. Acts 1-2 or 3 are typically DECENT at best, but afterwards it's just these Mario Maker-esque levels that aren't fun.  


The DS version is actually better IMO lol
Bland, short, budget title, changed the entire franchise for the worst, boring.
I really liked it when I first played it, and at the time it was a major thing the franchise needed after 06 & Unleashed's reception.

Later games have made me... dislike it in retrospect. Because alot of the problems that later games have had their seeds planted in this game.

Terrible Story
Terrible Jokes
Terrible Level Design (Blocks)
Being Too Short/Little Replay Value
Wisps

Stellar Soundtrack

Ultimate made me like it again, but overall I think it's a solid... game. But as a Sonic Game I would call it kinda... meh.
Badly.
I don't like it at all. Recently I tried revisiting Unleashed, which I initially hated, and changed my mind about it. So I've been giving Colors a second chance, and I still don't like it. And I'm really trying to, but the game ranges from boring to frustrating. 

At least Forces was *just* boring.
    What's frustrating about it?
        The clunky 2D sections, the pace-breaking wisps, the cheap enemy/spike placements, all the sections where you just need to wait for platforms to move in to range, the red rings which encourage exploration in levels that heavily discourage exploration...

And yeah, most of those issues pop up in the other games, but Colors is like a "best of" collection of poor design. Add to that a boring story with cringe-worthy humor, and there is almost nothing I like about Colors.

On the bright side, it's not glitchy.
I know people hate this game and the ones that followed, but after forces I'd say it wasn't the worst. I like the soundtrack and the stages of the game, the story not so much.
Haven’t played it in a while but I loved it, and I will never touch ultimate
not well
About as average as that Karl Urban Dredd film from 2012
Two years after Unleashed, it's a BIG step backwards.  
It's fun, but I don't give it more than a 6/10
It has great parts but the overall package has too much filler and boring content to call it a great game
- Pros: gameplay good and well designed, wisps are fun to use in this game, i found the stage to be decent. 

- Cons : Writting isn’t good, Story isn’t interesting and the game isn’t challenging. 

I’ll give it a solid B+
