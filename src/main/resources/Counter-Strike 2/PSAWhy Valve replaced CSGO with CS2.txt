[[PSAWhy Valve replaced CSGO with CS2]]


This is a short explanation to all the people who seemingly have given up hope on CS2 and don't seem to understand how Valve as a company is structured and works on its project.

Valve has pretty much a flat hierarchy where projects are not overseen by anyone higher up. Projects are structured by the employees working on it. Valve as a company has very few employees compared to other video game companies and at this point in time is more into game engine and overall electronic entertainment software/hardware development. Games are pretty much a side gig for Valve. 

Why did/does Valve replace CsGO with CS2 then? Because it's easier for the team working on CS. Moving to the Source 2 engine will make support for CS easier on Valves part and also enables external creators to generate content for the game with less hurdles. For example the Source engine made creating or updating maps unreasonably difficult. The Source 2 creator tools are just far superior and enable stuff not possible in the source engine. The team at Valve working on CS has always had less resources and had to find ways to make it work with the people who were dedicated to the project. So giving them more efficient tools to work on the game will make it easier to keep the game running smoothly and enable them to dedicate more time to update and work on the gameplay/content parts of CS more often. And they simply don't have the personal to keep GO running while working on CS2 live.

Is the game bad right now? Maybe justifiably it is an inferior game compared to CS:GO in many aspects. But if anything Valve has shown in the past and with this update to CS, that they do care about the game and are willing to work on it and improve it to satisfy the "hardcore" CS audience. We should give them atleast time until the start of next year to deduce if CS2 was a failure or not.


So u wanna say that all people at valve are doing hard crack cocaine?, This doesn't justify anything, people are not that extremely mad that they removed csgo, i mean it would be good if it stayed, but anyway everybody would go to cs2 one way or other, people are mad that they removed csgo and forced us to play only cs2, what they could do to avoid hate is, close the beta see everything that is wrong with the game and then release it, but nah they believed the hype and got the hate, so anyway we all know game will get better but they could maybe try to give better experience to people that they actually get milions from, that's all, don't try to justify them if u know well damn right that everything i wrote makes sense, as for the updates csgo got last update on february and nobody complained about it bcs i see you are telling that they couldn't get personel to work on 2 games, they stopped working on csgo since february, ofc there is maintenance but that's needed if u wanna keep players, so anyway, stay safe, and enjoy the night.

as for anyone who still wanna play csgo, u can still do it, just follow this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J\_Stt7jB0oA&ab\_channel=LobaCS2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Stt7jB0oA&ab_channel=LobaCS2)
     Just explained that Valve does things differently to most gaming companies and that people expect things to be in a way, which just doesn't make sense for how Valve operates. Idk how people haven't figured that out after like 15+ years and it hurts my brain everytime somebody cries about this
        The point is, there is no fucking point to try and justify them, first of all look at this:  https://x.com/s1mpleO/status/1709961886177915332?s=20   
After that, scroll trought his tweets where he says that he bought new pc and this happens to him, also if they do like u said "Things differently to most gaming companies" then they should do it better i mean they all compete to have more players are they not ?, all i'm saying rn is that they should do smth about all the bugs, they should've closed the beta, fix everything then release full game with less bugs and shit, then people would not complain or as u say "cry" about the game, just go watch videos where people die behind the wall, delay in between shooting and kills, and about the input lag in valves hardcoded 64 subtick system, i've been playing cs since 2004 i know what i'm talking about
        Releasing a broken game is what the rest of the gaming companies are doing
It's kinda crazy that I can go play counter strike source no problem, but am unable to play CS:GO, seems like massive oversight happened at some stage of development.
