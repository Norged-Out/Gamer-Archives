[[rcs2 be like‚Ä¶]]





hahah I completely agree. Common Spot, Sound Queue and Game Knowledge are 3 things that I've seen a lot of noobs label as cheats or a broken game...

Yesterday I played Inferno with friends (3 stack + duo of randoms). I killed the same guy 3 times on Coffin when he was CT. Round after round he was buying a scout and standing at the same place on Coffin. He typed :"Nice Wall!" ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

We change sides. My teammate called me: "He jumped second mid. Probably door." I looked into the back alley and one tapped the guy. He typed into the chat: "How did you know!? F\*\*\*\*\*\* CHEATER!". 

I checked his account: +/-300h, +/-50 competitive games on CSGO, Silver 2 with a peak Silver 4. And the guy was SoloQueuing this match. I tried to make this guy understand his mistake, he was in total denial. In his minds, I was 100% cheating.

Probably we'll see a post :"Cheater are everywhere" from him soon ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
    It's a vicious cycle. Cheating is a problem in this game. No question about it. But once it's known that cheating is a problem then it leads to people assuming everyone is cheating. Which makes the cheating problem seem even worse than it is. Which makes more people assume everyone is cheating. Which makes people....

I'm 11k premier/faceit 7 rn and was global in GO. Every time I get in my groove on deathmatch someone calls me a hacker and puts the report number in chat.
        It‚Äôs well known on the internet that there are two infallible rules of competitive FPS games: 1. The problem our team had isn‚Äôt me and could never be me and 2. If someone is better than I am they are cheating. Everytime.
        Confirmation bias sure can be a bitch in gaming once you know that cheaters are abound.
    lol it‚Äôs either the good old hacking complaint or running while shooting an awp and saying ‚Äúwhere did my bullet go!? Broken game!‚Äù
        I really haven't played much yet because the hackusations are insane. I have put SO much time into learning how to Bhop, and I love Bhopping sideways and backwards when I know I am being spectated, but now it's insane.

"He's scripting" "He has Bhop hacks"
No, I just care about this game and have more time. Also Bhopping backwards is more consistent, but they don't know because they haven't taken the time to learn. It's easier to say "You're hacking" than "Wow, I suck and need to improve"

I'm waiting for the bandwagon kiddies to go away before I waste my time in premier.
            The new, former Valorant players don‚Äôt understand that we grinded bhop servers on CSS for 10 years
                I can't wait until we get our kz and surf servers back. Shout out to the friends in Sneaks, yes even you, Nicko.
        hahah yeah
    I placed pretty low, like 1.6k and while climbing got accused of cheating like every 5th game, or when I play with my low elo friends and they blame something on subtick and I‚Äôm spectating them and see a perfectly normal thing happen
        Keep in mind that what you as a spectator see isn't what the actual players see in real time. Usually they have an added delay to what you as a spectator see.
            Yeah but I‚Äôm also talking about simple things like how they complain that a guy checked a spot or predicted them when it‚Äôs a common position, or they made noise or gave away their shadow etc
    Cheaters are everywhere lol. Go play comp and count how many lvl 1 accounts with only cs on them top frag in a day.
        There's a lot of good Valorant and other FPS players that switched from their game to CS2 lately. LVL1 account doesn't automatically mean cheater. 

My friend just installed CS2 for the first time, and his aim is better than my 2000h ass.

I get your point, but without demos, you can't tell that someone is cheating only because he top-frag with low hours count.
            I play with old LEMs and when they are getting sh@t stomped by a lvl 1-5 STEAM accounts with only free to play games and CS2 its pretty bloody obvious.
    Bro same thing I've been accused twice same day.
It's funny how instead of looking at themselves first people just straight up either blame the game or the opponent.
Edit: and blame their teammates of course.
        Classic:

GUY : ‚ÄúMy teammates are bad"  
ME: "Did you communicate with them?"  
GUY : "No!"

People play SoloQ without a mic and say their teams are bad. Give yourself a F chance...
    People just don't realise how big the skill differences are in this game
    problem is it feel like 1.6 when I had a crappy 56k connection. You have to shoot into the future every time lol.
    what are  2nd mid door* and back alley? ik 2nd mid is the building with boiler apps with the stairs case on the outside
        "2nd mid door" is the red door in the second mid that brings you to the T-Apps. 

BackAlley is the small alley between TApps and Apps stairs.

2nd mid isn't a building, it's between the first mid (or just mid) and the T.Apps. 

You can check on Google for Inferno callouts
    Are you denying that cheaters aren‚Äôt everywhere in counterstrike, though?
        Nah, I'm not denying anything. There are cheaters! But there is a gap between denying cheaters and seeing cheaters everywhere.

CS2 has a new rank database, and all the players who started at the same level, there are a lot of ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù which are just ‚Äúskill gap‚Äù situations. 

During the Beta, the CSGO database was cross-referenced on CS2. I was MG on CSGO, I was playing against GN and MG on CS2 Premier (Beta). When they released the game, we all started at ‚Äúzero‚Äù. My first game after release (\*see picture) was against GE and LEM.

Silvers playing against Globals (or even MG) and saying :"OMG they are cheating..." just because they have insane aim and knowledge of the game is common.

    You can see csgo rank stats cs2? I just thought it was only hours you could see because it‚Äôs displayed directly on their profile.
        Yeah, on [CSSTATS.gg](https://CSSTATS.gg), you can see their matches CSGO and CS2 (before Sept 28th, it's currently down because of the GOTV).

 On their profile, you see their Higher CSGO ranks and higher ELO on CS2.

            During the beta :

            Cool, weird it shows the premier rank I got during the beta instead of my current premier rank
                That's because on Sept 29th, Valve has temporarily disabled demos

If you check at the top of the page, it's saying :"Until these are re-enabled, statistics for Premier and Competitive modes will not update"
            completely outside of the topic at hand, i just tried this site and its not exactly accurate, my best was LE and it shows only MGE so eh.
                Did you have the tracking enabled? When did you reach LE? 

If nobody ever searched your account and you never connected before, you might have a short history only.

Click on CSGO in the search bar of your profile, then "OK." Click on "MATCHES" and you'll see the first match recorded on your profile.
                    ah ye, it was in like 2016 so i dont blame it :D the first appears to be september of 2023, i remember there used to be a website for this very old and ive no idea if it exists anymore and that one i used to use in those times, my point being that the guy in the ops picture might be the same, it does show how many wins you got but it does not take into account that most people are playing or were playing cs before the site even existed
                        It was Tracker.gg... but since CS2, there is no tracking üòï
                            Think it was even older than that, i was searching for it with "steam.id" but it was not the steam id site if it makes sense. It used to display stats and stuff. We played on faceit a couple of times but after tryharding i was just goofing around with silver friends most of the time. Its unfortunate people still need to use third party to do statistics, it should be done ingame
                                I was personally using the CSGO 360 Stats (0.99$/month) but since CS2, that feature got removed :'(
            How far does this website track backwards?

In 2015 or 16 i was definitely LEM but it shows my best rank was DMG which is valid because after a long break not playing at all i came back to the game and hit DMG.
                I think it started late 2016, but it was not using the API, so you had to manually input the demo link on the website. The auto update started in 2017-2018. 

Also, some player have this error message when I check their profile :   <<This player does not have match tracking enabled. Some matches may be missing.>> It's maybe your cases
        And most of the top frags with insane gamesense that I play against don't have faceit or esea .. this is helpful but I will always play with that mindset" man cheater for sure fucking no name killed me behind a wall"


The problem is closet cheaters! And there are many .. it is obvious why some noobs check some angles nobody even a 10 wouldn't check after u bait the hell out of your team .. lot of comments here are just dumb not accepting cheaters.
    People just love to hate the new game, yeah it‚Äôs got issues but valve even said in the interview that fixing those issues goes way quicker when the whole playerbase on all types of hardware is playing
    [https://streamable.com/unxkx2](https://streamable.com/unxkx2)

You can imagine how the rest of the match went.

Tbh most of them were bots with wh and soft aim, it's hilarious how cheaters call me a cheater every single match
    Lol I have around 200ish hours, mostly on csgo surf and got called a cheater and a smurf account (I peeked SEM on go) because I ran onto point with a bizon and killed him in a single mag.  Then started going on about he was the top 2% in valorant and how he would beat my ass since I couldn't cheat there.

Went the whole game like that until he started insta teamkilling because his teammates were calling him trash for going 2-14
I like the videos where the someone gets shot from the enemies elbow.

The problem is matching people with +3k hours with noobs. For you is obviously, not for them.
    I have 2k hours and im a noob ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Go watch the demo" Oh wait...
I guess pro players are noobs too because of they have complained about this issue.
    True, but I have encountered players who over and over again play stupidly and then blame it on things like subtick or peeker's advantage
        on one hand yes on the other the issue is there. as a former LE player peeking really is worse than on go. the desync issues are VERY noticeable. ever since i got the beta access the game just felt "laggy" as if when you bait or corner peek and you get shot when youre already behind the wall,or when youre just dead before you could even see the guy on your screen shoot etc etc. i kind of got acustomed to it and i take it with a grain of salt as i understand what it is but it really creates some unfair advantages that when they happen they are incredibly demoralizing, especially when rn pretty much everyone is stuck on the 4-10k range and the skill difference between people of the same rank are more often than not night and day, and to top it all off the rank system not acknowledging better people tanking everyones rank even with 5-6 game win streaks with those +100 -600 games is not really helping the issue.

&#x200B;

so tldr, i in no way am mad to see these posts because people in general are just rightfully angry about the game and about the fact it replaced go.
            I don't know what you mean by "peeking really is worse". I think we have the same opinion and are 100% in agreement based on everything you wrote after.

I don't mean to be a one-upper, but I have 6k hours on this game and I've ranged from LEM-Global throughout my time playing and I can tell you there are massive issues with CS2, but the major one is that peeking is too strong. Peeker's advantage is way too much right now. Pros have also shared this sentiment in interviews after Sydney was over.

That all being said, when a player in my game is stomping around making hella noise and peeks an angle and dies then rages about how "CS2 is unplayably bad", it just gets on my nerves. I hate idiotic behavior. Raging to begin with is low iq as fuck. Attributing your garbage play to something outside of your control is just going to serve to make me slightly annoyed. Rinse repeat at least once every 3 games, it gets annoying.' That's all I'm saying. If you hate the game so much right now, quit. Come back when it's good, because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell that Valve is aware and fixing issues. Although this community is so braindead they go and make a post complaining about the MJ peek the top rated post in the sub when Valve literally patched it the day before. I'm just tired of the collective retardation. That's it. That's all I'm saying. Plenty of really good criticism could and should be given to the game, but this community doesn't seem to be very good at giving it. We agree the game is rough.
                yes, i dont really hate it, i stopped playing go because of the unfixed issues for years and no real new content in the game, nothing was changing or being fixed the map pool was the same for years, i think people are just enthusiastic and since valve has a history of well not caring for shit for the past 5 years people are worried that the game will stay like this for the next 10 years like go did. i understand the annoyingness, for me the most annoying things in order are: the fact that every single game someone gets dcd and everyone is forced to watch a 10 minute youtube video untill the timeout passes, the peeks, and lastly the matchmaking being a mess, GE facit 10 players playing alongside people with 50 hours in the game on 4k-10k ranks etc. now what remains is to just wait and enjoy what we have untill then.
I think you are referring to this r/GlobalOffensive post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/17jb3em/holding\_angles\_in\_cs2\_is\_a\_joke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/17jb3em/holding_angles_in_cs2_is_a_joke/) or have I missed a post here ahaha
    But I really agree with your post

So many CS player think others are cheating when in reality it is just common sense for better player to preaim and sometimes prefire the most common angles

Good players don't leave corners unchecked either

So have my upvote
        It was an off angle tho.
            I was standing in the open‚Ä¶!!! No one could have guessed I‚Äôd be there
                But no one can aim that fast! I know this because I played Valorant for years!
                    VALVE PLEASE!!
                that's not the point. no one prefires off angles lmao.
he is 100% using cheats
I agree this is true.

But the amount of times I die to a kid full sprinting is disturbing
lmao if im holding a common angle and get prefired, regardless
of if i ‚Äúsaw the person‚Äù or not im not gonna complain, but when someone‚Äôs swinging me on 100 ping every match 1tapping me before i see them that‚Äôs when i start calling out the obvious flaws in this game.
    When you hold an angle, all that matters is your ping (holders ping) and not the peekers ping. It is a common misconception that high ping players will benefit more from a peek than a low ping player, but it is utterly wrong.
        Yeah it's crazy. High ping players have an insane disadvantage over lower ping players. It has been like this since day 1 of online mp games.

Yes you have lag compensation now, but it only makes the game more playable for high pingers. They will still get absolutely destroyed by lower pings.
Yup, every single pro player who has criticized the game (aka every single one of them) also has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.

Valve could shit in some people‚Äôs mouths and they‚Äôd swear it was filet mignon.
I was accused of cheating yesterday in casual, which is hilarious because I am usually not very good but I kept feeding on these guys that were playing really dumb. They kept peaking the same spots, so I was one tapping them just as they came out, because they did the same 2 things over and over.

I was accused of wall hacks. For pre-aiming obvious angles on mid in Overpass. I can‚Äôt help but think some of those same people are the ones complaining here.

That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt hackers galore - I have had multiple matches, in casual, where guys are dropping in, spamming messages in chat that advertise their hacks, then proceeding to 1v10 the other team. It‚Äôs definitely an issue, but so far I‚Äôve only noticed these super obvious ones. I‚Äôm also a filthy casual so take that with a grain of salt.
Time to down vote and install CSS
My main problem is literally seeing the blood spray from a landed shot, then getting killed by the person with 0 damage inflicted.
And common spots didn't exist in CSGO. Got it.
Ah hacking is a major issue atm tho especially with the promises of a new anti cheat ,it wasnt nearly as bad in the beta and just got worse and worse,I haven't played in 2 weeks, and this coming from someone with 5k+ hrs in csgo and used to do overwatch cases for fun  ,I'm sure people with low hours do call hax too much but that's kinda making light the fact there is a massive fucking issue rn and csgo was riddled for far too long.
    Yeah I used to do overwatch all the time. I got really good at identifying cheaters and eventually I started to realize CS:GO was just unplayable. Probably like at least 40% of players at DMG level were walling -- even on main with knives. It was so obvious, like you could spectate them and all they would do was full-speed run and jump around the map, hunt after players while disregarding info or lack thereof, never use utility ever, have trash crosshair placement/sens too high, and drop 40 kills. They were also always high or obviously drunk on the mic and usually had some kind of cringe bikini photo as an avatar. Like it was so bad I could just look at avatars and names and predict who the waller was going to be that match with reasonable accuracy. And of course I'd go look at the demo and the guy's just super obvious.

Can't do that now though. How convenient that they disabled demos for CS2! I can't wait for them to come back.
        Yea i didn't buy the whole " we are turning off the demos to free up server space "bs for a second they just don't want people to be able to show how cancerous an experience they have atm is
Yeah cause Michael Jackson peaks are noob mistakes
    That was a hilarious bug that got fixed immediatly, relax my dude.
        It took a few tries for them to fix it, I remember seeing it after it got fixed.
            now all we have is twerking ):
Fuckin fax 

This sub sux
lmfao this is on point, have my update op
Making fun of people pointing out clear flaws in a game released by a billion dollar company. Imagine thinking you're the one in the right when you do this lol. The game has been criticised by people who are better and more experienced than anyone in this sub will ever be. Go tell s1mple or snappi that they're just shit and shouldn't complain. CS2 is clearly unfinished. I have faith it will improve but not if everyone is silent about the issues.
    This sub is turning into Valve's bootlicker circlejerk, if this is how  this game is going to be, I'm out, i had hopes from the community to give good feedback to devs but forgot how dumb average redditor is
        Lots of toxic casuals on Reddit. These guys saying there's no cheater problem probably peaked at silver 4 in CS:GO and didn't encounter any. Once you hit DMG they were EVERYWHERE. I didn't know this at first because I was kind of naive and didn't know what to look for, and I thought I was just getting outskilled or outaimed all the time. But then a banwave happened and everyone who was able to swing out wide and instant headshot me was completely gone. The skill level of players just plummeted overnight. It was crazy.

People who say cheating is uncommon or isn't an issue, or that it's all just caused by desync or this nebulous thing -- this empty signifier -- everyone refuses to explain called "lag compensation," are just really new/bad. Or they're cheating and insecure about it.
            I was only LE in csgo, and it was so hard to rank up because of cheaters that i eventually quit playing this stupid game (faceit isn't available in my region). All i wanted from CS2 was 128 tick and a working anticheat. I cannot understand the mentality of devs, they have the perfect game, they just need those 2 things and people will have nothing major to complain about, ever. Yet they go on to make everything dogshit that shills are willing to die for. I just don't know anymore, enjoy your game i guess, I'm out for another year.
This face is exactly how i imagine OP and other cs2 bootlickers to look like, lol
But CS2 BAD!! Volvo BAD!! Volvo subtick BAD!!! GIVE ME 128 TICKERS! 64 TICKER BAD!! ME MISS SHOT? NO! IT SUBTICK FAULT!
imagine making fun of people that have problems with a game. 

i have 5k hours, lvl10 and feel pity for douchebags like you cause you obviously think that your post is the better option than the actual complaining. 

you are probably the type of guy who was excited for valve's pc gamer dev interview that had no substance at all.
    I really don't get why people do this. It's so irrational; like what would make a person superior for disdaining "haters" or "complainers?" Doesn't that just make you a sycophant? Aren't you just hating haters and complaining about complainers? So wouldn't you be a hypocrite? It makes no sense to me. My only guess is that people are super insecure and in denial over the cheating problem/their own skill, and they would like to believe that the 1,000+ hours they've invested in CS weren't a total waste and that they just lost because of a skill issue and not just getting RNG matched with cheaters.
    It‚Äôs‚Ä¶its actually just a meme my guy‚Ä¶
        your whole life is a meme then
            You‚Äôre taking Reddit memes too seriously my guy
                and you're taking reddit too seriously
The valve dickriding is endless
Don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúhitreg‚Äù issues that revolve around players not putting their crosshair on the opponent and then being surprised when the bullet doesn‚Äôt hit.
Really been loving the people playing on dial up posting a clip of lag and then going ‚ÄúWHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET HUH?!‚Äù
Pre firing or not you shouldn't be dying before they even turn the corner on 20 ping.
FRFRRRFFRR
That mp9 user in cave/sewer/hut in shambles

The maps have been out for a decade now, or almost. If you don‚Äôt know the positions and **don‚Äôt do pre fire maps** . That‚Äôs your own fault.
    Oh, you're a CS veteran? Ok. Name every off angle.
        You need to have higher education to realize how easy it is. I assume you don‚Äôt
I‚Äôm being teleported back around corners when getting directly hit with a thrown object itself. That‚Äôs my quarrel lol
You‚Äôre all fucking losers. That‚Äôs all.
    We found the guy in the picture
        Says the one who posts complaints about complainers lmfao..
            It‚Äôs a meme, you took it too seriously bud

                    Midwit behaviour
Fr some dude was crying on here about not having enough time to react because a humans reaction time is blah blah blah bad get prefired lmao I just commented on his thing "get gud scrub"
cs2 subreddit on its way into gaslighting devs that there is a problem
Agreed. People need to chill on bitching. CS2 kicks ass.
    you‚Äôre unfortunately one of the main problems in expecting solid development. you‚Äôre kind of just taking what you get instead of understanding that corners get cut in early development for new titles and that‚Äôs just unacceptable for a product marketed as competitive. 

also unacceptable from a company like valve they‚Äôre more than capable of pushing out a mechanically solid product and we as the consumers are not asking a lot from them to make their game work the way it‚Äôs supposed to.
    I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say it kicks ass. It‚Äôs definitely got some very real problems. It‚Äôs a solid game that‚Äôs getting better with every update though, and people are definitely being over dramatic with their complaints.
        Agreed. This had to happen. We needed to update the foundation it's built on. The problems will get fixed. Let em cook.
    CS2 is extremely underwhelming. The lighting looks good and the smokes are different and that's all we got. A ton of game modes, maps, community servers, etc. are gone. And yeah you can go into community servers through the beta client, but a lot of my favorite servers shut down due to lack of traffic because valve intentionally killed CSGO.
        They will be back. You're all acting like this is permanent
Add more than 9 maps so people don't have all the prefire lineups memorized. ?
    We played the 10 maps (7+3 reserve) for 12 years (except Anubis)...

Even if they add maps, it will take 2-3 months and they will be mastered.
        Csgo prior to 2018(?) Left the maps in the 5v5 pool. There was other maps to play. Many. 

Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it...
            My point was about the ‚Äúlineup memorized‚Äù. Even if they add 3-4 maps, the competitive pool is the one that matters. I don't know the common spots on Militia, Agency, or Office because they weren't competitive maps when I started playing so worthless to learn. Valve current priority are competitive/eSport maps.

&#x200B;

> Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it... 

It's not about being a shill, it's about understanding the priorities. They already have a shitload of things to fix on the current maps plus on movement & shooting.
                Your definition of "competitive " is arbitrary. Militia assault agency .... good, coordinated 5 stacks can dominate. 

Also, people expect valve maps to be in the valve game.  

After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Choice is the nectar of Gods, and we have premeir maps, office and dust2.
                    Well, that's not MY definition of competitive... I talk about THE official competitive map pool set by Valve. 

* Mirage
* Vertigo
* Nuke
* Ancient
* Anubis
* Inferno
* Overpass

This doesn't mean that Militia, Assault, and Agency aren't good maps; only that they are not ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù in the literal sense.

&#x200B;

> After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Well, they released Office, Italy and Dust2... These maps are not in the official map pool. I also think that some maps are not owned by Valve, so they do not have 100% rights to do the remake of the maps on Source2 engine.
                        Italy is lost in 10v10 unavailable in 5v5. This is baffling.
            When any attempt at rationality immediately gets called off as shilling, you know the person you're talking to doesn't have much else to come with
                Let's roll in the mud :)  

I did beta test all year. There are no other maps nor modes tested. 

This is Counterstrike-Mobile-Lite.
                    No thank you. Maybe next time!
Seen so many posts about cheaters and im yet to come across one. Experienced it in CS:GO but it was not often at all and the highest rank I was at was SMFC. Worst was a blatant spinbotter. But yeah pre firing people in common spots is a thing yet so many dont understand hence the mess this subreddit is now
    It is partly because of actual issues in the game found at a high level of play, but most of the uproar is this subreddit is caused by all the new players who never experienced a game with such a high skill ceiling
    What are you using? Must not be very good if all you got was SMFC.
        I don‚Äôt understand the question? Are you saying I was cheating or what? Clueless
Sure theres some truth to this, some of the more ridicolous clips are just very lucky running Hs (which are also definitely a lot more common). Is this games netcode also a steaming pile of dogshit compare to go and holding angles significantly less viable than it used/needs to be for this game to function properly? Yes also true, most players can tell by feeling the "i shouldnt have died like that" moments but few actually know how to capture an instance actually showcasing this, no point in defending the sorry state this games in and although the bitching about it can get a bit circlejerky thats exactly what its gonna take to get Valve to maybe fix this shit still in the not too distant future. Overall L meme if people didnt cry their eyes out wed still be missing shots on ceouching players due to misaligned hitboxes
the peakers advantage in cs2 is noticably different as an aggressive rifler on T side but I feel like 75% of the posts in here are just skill issue and would've happened in GO lol
" I have a lot of hours in the game, 600 btw. I'm in 1k elo and people are cheating they are prefiring me"
for me the meme will be better with: "I got kill 1 second after pick""
Ok but i should at least be able to *see* the guy
U boys clearly haven't seen a cheater.
Haven't played cs2 yet but some maps have been mostly unaltered for 20+ years. Concealment isn't cover.
    "Concealment isn't cover," hahaha bro this isn't Arma 3. We're not diving behind bushes or sitting behind chain link fences. Pretty much everything in CS is solid cover that you can't see through. What are you even talking about?

I recently got a vac live in a comp game, I'm unsure if that was the first cheater I've seen or if he was the only one who got caught :/
Silvers be like:
For real
Real
I keep getting pre-fired in off angles despite the enemy having no info. Explain that maybe?
CS2 is so hard to play as someone who

a) has friends who love the game

b) wants to play with said friends

c) hates competitive shooters
lol, can't meme your way out of legitimate issues making the experience lesser. I agree people have blown the cheating problem out of proportion but the game absolutely does not feel great right now and blowing off all the complaints as people being bad is stupid.
It's a vicious cycle. Cheating is a problem in this game. No question about it. But once it's known that cheating is a problem then it leads to people assuming everyone is cheating. Which makes the cheating problem seem even worse than it is. Which makes more people assume everyone is cheating. Which makes people....

I'm 11k premier/faceit 7 rn and was global in GO. Every time I get in my groove on deathmatch someone calls me a hacker and puts the report number in chat.
    It‚Äôs well known on the internet that there are two infallible rules of competitive FPS games: 1. The problem our team had isn‚Äôt me and could never be me and 2. If someone is better than I am they are cheating. Everytime.
    Confirmation bias sure can be a bitch in gaming once you know that cheaters are abound.
lol it‚Äôs either the good old hacking complaint or running while shooting an awp and saying ‚Äúwhere did my bullet go!? Broken game!‚Äù
    I really haven't played much yet because the hackusations are insane. I have put SO much time into learning how to Bhop, and I love Bhopping sideways and backwards when I know I am being spectated, but now it's insane.

"He's scripting" "He has Bhop hacks"
No, I just care about this game and have more time. Also Bhopping backwards is more consistent, but they don't know because they haven't taken the time to learn. It's easier to say "You're hacking" than "Wow, I suck and need to improve"

I'm waiting for the bandwagon kiddies to go away before I waste my time in premier.
        The new, former Valorant players don‚Äôt understand that we grinded bhop servers on CSS for 10 years
            I can't wait until we get our kz and surf servers back. Shout out to the friends in Sneaks, yes even you, Nicko.
    hahah yeah
I placed pretty low, like 1.6k and while climbing got accused of cheating like every 5th game, or when I play with my low elo friends and they blame something on subtick and I‚Äôm spectating them and see a perfectly normal thing happen
    Keep in mind that what you as a spectator see isn't what the actual players see in real time. Usually they have an added delay to what you as a spectator see.
        Yeah but I‚Äôm also talking about simple things like how they complain that a guy checked a spot or predicted them when it‚Äôs a common position, or they made noise or gave away their shadow etc
Cheaters are everywhere lol. Go play comp and count how many lvl 1 accounts with only cs on them top frag in a day.
    There's a lot of good Valorant and other FPS players that switched from their game to CS2 lately. LVL1 account doesn't automatically mean cheater. 

My friend just installed CS2 for the first time, and his aim is better than my 2000h ass.

I get your point, but without demos, you can't tell that someone is cheating only because he top-frag with low hours count.
        I play with old LEMs and when they are getting sh@t stomped by a lvl 1-5 STEAM accounts with only free to play games and CS2 its pretty bloody obvious.
Bro same thing I've been accused twice same day.
It's funny how instead of looking at themselves first people just straight up either blame the game or the opponent.
Edit: and blame their teammates of course.
    Classic:

GUY : ‚ÄúMy teammates are bad"  
ME: "Did you communicate with them?"  
GUY : "No!"

People play SoloQ without a mic and say their teams are bad. Give yourself a F chance...
People just don't realise how big the skill differences are in this game
problem is it feel like 1.6 when I had a crappy 56k connection. You have to shoot into the future every time lol.
what are  2nd mid door* and back alley? ik 2nd mid is the building with boiler apps with the stairs case on the outside
    "2nd mid door" is the red door in the second mid that brings you to the T-Apps. 

BackAlley is the small alley between TApps and Apps stairs.

2nd mid isn't a building, it's between the first mid (or just mid) and the T.Apps. 

You can check on Google for Inferno callouts
Are you denying that cheaters aren‚Äôt everywhere in counterstrike, though?
    Nah, I'm not denying anything. There are cheaters! But there is a gap between denying cheaters and seeing cheaters everywhere.

CS2 has a new rank database, and all the players who started at the same level, there are a lot of ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù which are just ‚Äúskill gap‚Äù situations. 

During the Beta, the CSGO database was cross-referenced on CS2. I was MG on CSGO, I was playing against GN and MG on CS2 Premier (Beta). When they released the game, we all started at ‚Äúzero‚Äù. My first game after release (\*see picture) was against GE and LEM.

Silvers playing against Globals (or even MG) and saying :"OMG they are cheating..." just because they have insane aim and knowledge of the game is common.

You can see csgo rank stats cs2? I just thought it was only hours you could see because it‚Äôs displayed directly on their profile.
    Yeah, on [CSSTATS.gg](https://CSSTATS.gg), you can see their matches CSGO and CS2 (before Sept 28th, it's currently down because of the GOTV).

 On their profile, you see their Higher CSGO ranks and higher ELO on CS2.

        Cool, weird it shows the premier rank I got during the beta instead of my current premier rank
            That's because on Sept 29th, Valve has temporarily disabled demos

If you check at the top of the page, it's saying :"Until these are re-enabled, statistics for Premier and Competitive modes will not update"
        completely outside of the topic at hand, i just tried this site and its not exactly accurate, my best was LE and it shows only MGE so eh.
            Did you have the tracking enabled? When did you reach LE? 

If nobody ever searched your account and you never connected before, you might have a short history only.

Click on CSGO in the search bar of your profile, then "OK." Click on "MATCHES" and you'll see the first match recorded on your profile.
                ah ye, it was in like 2016 so i dont blame it :D the first appears to be september of 2023, i remember there used to be a website for this very old and ive no idea if it exists anymore and that one i used to use in those times, my point being that the guy in the ops picture might be the same, it does show how many wins you got but it does not take into account that most people are playing or were playing cs before the site even existed
                    It was Tracker.gg... but since CS2, there is no tracking üòï
                        Think it was even older than that, i was searching for it with "steam.id" but it was not the steam id site if it makes sense. It used to display stats and stuff. We played on faceit a couple of times but after tryharding i was just goofing around with silver friends most of the time. Its unfortunate people still need to use third party to do statistics, it should be done ingame
                            I was personally using the CSGO 360 Stats (0.99$/month) but since CS2, that feature got removed :'(
        How far does this website track backwards?

In 2015 or 16 i was definitely LEM but it shows my best rank was DMG which is valid because after a long break not playing at all i came back to the game and hit DMG.
            I think it started late 2016, but it was not using the API, so you had to manually input the demo link on the website. The auto update started in 2017-2018. 

Also, some player have this error message when I check their profile :   <<This player does not have match tracking enabled. Some matches may be missing.>> It's maybe your cases
    And most of the top frags with insane gamesense that I play against don't have faceit or esea .. this is helpful but I will always play with that mindset" man cheater for sure fucking no name killed me behind a wall"


The problem is closet cheaters! And there are many .. it is obvious why some noobs check some angles nobody even a 10 wouldn't check after u bait the hell out of your team .. lot of comments here are just dumb not accepting cheaters.
People just love to hate the new game, yeah it‚Äôs got issues but valve even said in the interview that fixing those issues goes way quicker when the whole playerbase on all types of hardware is playing
[https://streamable.com/unxkx2](https://streamable.com/unxkx2)

You can imagine how the rest of the match went.

Tbh most of them were bots with wh and soft aim, it's hilarious how cheaters call me a cheater every single match
Lol I have around 200ish hours, mostly on csgo surf and got called a cheater and a smurf account (I peeked SEM on go) because I ran onto point with a bizon and killed him in a single mag.  Then started going on about he was the top 2% in valorant and how he would beat my ass since I couldn't cheat there.

Went the whole game like that until he started insta teamkilling because his teammates were calling him trash for going 2-14

I have 2k hours and im a noob ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
True, but I have encountered players who over and over again play stupidly and then blame it on things like subtick or peeker's advantage
    on one hand yes on the other the issue is there. as a former LE player peeking really is worse than on go. the desync issues are VERY noticeable. ever since i got the beta access the game just felt "laggy" as if when you bait or corner peek and you get shot when youre already behind the wall,or when youre just dead before you could even see the guy on your screen shoot etc etc. i kind of got acustomed to it and i take it with a grain of salt as i understand what it is but it really creates some unfair advantages that when they happen they are incredibly demoralizing, especially when rn pretty much everyone is stuck on the 4-10k range and the skill difference between people of the same rank are more often than not night and day, and to top it all off the rank system not acknowledging better people tanking everyones rank even with 5-6 game win streaks with those +100 -600 games is not really helping the issue.

&#x200B;

so tldr, i in no way am mad to see these posts because people in general are just rightfully angry about the game and about the fact it replaced go.
        I don't know what you mean by "peeking really is worse". I think we have the same opinion and are 100% in agreement based on everything you wrote after.

I don't mean to be a one-upper, but I have 6k hours on this game and I've ranged from LEM-Global throughout my time playing and I can tell you there are massive issues with CS2, but the major one is that peeking is too strong. Peeker's advantage is way too much right now. Pros have also shared this sentiment in interviews after Sydney was over.

That all being said, when a player in my game is stomping around making hella noise and peeks an angle and dies then rages about how "CS2 is unplayably bad", it just gets on my nerves. I hate idiotic behavior. Raging to begin with is low iq as fuck. Attributing your garbage play to something outside of your control is just going to serve to make me slightly annoyed. Rinse repeat at least once every 3 games, it gets annoying.' That's all I'm saying. If you hate the game so much right now, quit. Come back when it's good, because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell that Valve is aware and fixing issues. Although this community is so braindead they go and make a post complaining about the MJ peek the top rated post in the sub when Valve literally patched it the day before. I'm just tired of the collective retardation. That's it. That's all I'm saying. Plenty of really good criticism could and should be given to the game, but this community doesn't seem to be very good at giving it. We agree the game is rough.
            yes, i dont really hate it, i stopped playing go because of the unfixed issues for years and no real new content in the game, nothing was changing or being fixed the map pool was the same for years, i think people are just enthusiastic and since valve has a history of well not caring for shit for the past 5 years people are worried that the game will stay like this for the next 10 years like go did. i understand the annoyingness, for me the most annoying things in order are: the fact that every single game someone gets dcd and everyone is forced to watch a 10 minute youtube video untill the timeout passes, the peeks, and lastly the matchmaking being a mess, GE facit 10 players playing alongside people with 50 hours in the game on 4k-10k ranks etc. now what remains is to just wait and enjoy what we have untill then.
But I really agree with your post

So many CS player think others are cheating when in reality it is just common sense for better player to preaim and sometimes prefire the most common angles

Good players don't leave corners unchecked either

So have my upvote
    It was an off angle tho.
        I was standing in the open‚Ä¶!!! No one could have guessed I‚Äôd be there
            But no one can aim that fast! I know this because I played Valorant for years!
                VALVE PLEASE!!
            that's not the point. no one prefires off angles lmao.
When you hold an angle, all that matters is your ping (holders ping) and not the peekers ping. It is a common misconception that high ping players will benefit more from a peek than a low ping player, but it is utterly wrong.
    Yeah it's crazy. High ping players have an insane disadvantage over lower ping players. It has been like this since day 1 of online mp games.

Yes you have lag compensation now, but it only makes the game more playable for high pingers. They will still get absolutely destroyed by lower pings.
Yeah I used to do overwatch all the time. I got really good at identifying cheaters and eventually I started to realize CS:GO was just unplayable. Probably like at least 40% of players at DMG level were walling -- even on main with knives. It was so obvious, like you could spectate them and all they would do was full-speed run and jump around the map, hunt after players while disregarding info or lack thereof, never use utility ever, have trash crosshair placement/sens too high, and drop 40 kills. They were also always high or obviously drunk on the mic and usually had some kind of cringe bikini photo as an avatar. Like it was so bad I could just look at avatars and names and predict who the waller was going to be that match with reasonable accuracy. And of course I'd go look at the demo and the guy's just super obvious.

Can't do that now though. How convenient that they disabled demos for CS2! I can't wait for them to come back.
    Yea i didn't buy the whole " we are turning off the demos to free up server space "bs for a second they just don't want people to be able to show how cancerous an experience they have atm is
That was a hilarious bug that got fixed immediatly, relax my dude.
    It took a few tries for them to fix it, I remember seeing it after it got fixed.
        now all we have is twerking ):
This sub is turning into Valve's bootlicker circlejerk, if this is how  this game is going to be, I'm out, i had hopes from the community to give good feedback to devs but forgot how dumb average redditor is
    Lots of toxic casuals on Reddit. These guys saying there's no cheater problem probably peaked at silver 4 in CS:GO and didn't encounter any. Once you hit DMG they were EVERYWHERE. I didn't know this at first because I was kind of naive and didn't know what to look for, and I thought I was just getting outskilled or outaimed all the time. But then a banwave happened and everyone who was able to swing out wide and instant headshot me was completely gone. The skill level of players just plummeted overnight. It was crazy.

People who say cheating is uncommon or isn't an issue, or that it's all just caused by desync or this nebulous thing -- this empty signifier -- everyone refuses to explain called "lag compensation," are just really new/bad. Or they're cheating and insecure about it.
        I was only LE in csgo, and it was so hard to rank up because of cheaters that i eventually quit playing this stupid game (faceit isn't available in my region). All i wanted from CS2 was 128 tick and a working anticheat. I cannot understand the mentality of devs, they have the perfect game, they just need those 2 things and people will have nothing major to complain about, ever. Yet they go on to make everything dogshit that shills are willing to die for. I just don't know anymore, enjoy your game i guess, I'm out for another year.
I really don't get why people do this. It's so irrational; like what would make a person superior for disdaining "haters" or "complainers?" Doesn't that just make you a sycophant? Aren't you just hating haters and complaining about complainers? So wouldn't you be a hypocrite? It makes no sense to me. My only guess is that people are super insecure and in denial over the cheating problem/their own skill, and they would like to believe that the 1,000+ hours they've invested in CS weren't a total waste and that they just lost because of a skill issue and not just getting RNG matched with cheaters.
It‚Äôs‚Ä¶its actually just a meme my guy‚Ä¶

                        Ah so its more than just looks.
                Midwit behaviour
you‚Äôre unfortunately one of the main problems in expecting solid development. you‚Äôre kind of just taking what you get instead of understanding that corners get cut in early development for new titles and that‚Äôs just unacceptable for a product marketed as competitive. 

also unacceptable from a company like valve they‚Äôre more than capable of pushing out a mechanically solid product and we as the consumers are not asking a lot from them to make their game work the way it‚Äôs supposed to.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say it kicks ass. It‚Äôs definitely got some very real problems. It‚Äôs a solid game that‚Äôs getting better with every update though, and people are definitely being over dramatic with their complaints.
    Agreed. This had to happen. We needed to update the foundation it's built on. The problems will get fixed. Let em cook.
CS2 is extremely underwhelming. The lighting looks good and the smokes are different and that's all we got. A ton of game modes, maps, community servers, etc. are gone. And yeah you can go into community servers through the beta client, but a lot of my favorite servers shut down due to lack of traffic because valve intentionally killed CSGO.
    They will be back. You're all acting like this is permanent
We played the 10 maps (7+3 reserve) for 12 years (except Anubis)...

Even if they add maps, it will take 2-3 months and they will be mastered.
    Csgo prior to 2018(?) Left the maps in the 5v5 pool. There was other maps to play. Many. 

Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it...
        My point was about the ‚Äúlineup memorized‚Äù. Even if they add 3-4 maps, the competitive pool is the one that matters. I don't know the common spots on Militia, Agency, or Office because they weren't competitive maps when I started playing so worthless to learn. Valve current priority are competitive/eSport maps.

&#x200B;

> Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it... 

It's not about being a shill, it's about understanding the priorities. They already have a shitload of things to fix on the current maps plus on movement & shooting.
            Your definition of "competitive " is arbitrary. Militia assault agency .... good, coordinated 5 stacks can dominate. 

Also, people expect valve maps to be in the valve game.  

After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Choice is the nectar of Gods, and we have premeir maps, office and dust2.
                Well, that's not MY definition of competitive... I talk about THE official competitive map pool set by Valve. 

* Mirage
* Vertigo
* Nuke
* Ancient
* Anubis
* Inferno
* Overpass

This doesn't mean that Militia, Assault, and Agency aren't good maps; only that they are not ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù in the literal sense.

&#x200B;

> After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Well, they released Office, Italy and Dust2... These maps are not in the official map pool. I also think that some maps are not owned by Valve, so they do not have 100% rights to do the remake of the maps on Source2 engine.
                    Italy is lost in 10v10 unavailable in 5v5. This is baffling.
        When any attempt at rationality immediately gets called off as shilling, you know the person you're talking to doesn't have much else to come with
            Let's roll in the mud :)  

I did beta test all year. There are no other maps nor modes tested. 

This is Counterstrike-Mobile-Lite.
                No thank you. Maybe next time!
It is partly because of actual issues in the game found at a high level of play, but most of the uproar is this subreddit is caused by all the new players who never experienced a game with such a high skill ceiling

GUY : ‚ÄúMy teammates are bad"  
ME: "Did you communicate with them?"  
GUY : "No!"

People play SoloQ without a mic and say their teams are bad. Give yourself a F chance...
"2nd mid door" is the red door in the second mid that brings you to the T-Apps. 

BackAlley is the small alley between TApps and Apps stairs.

2nd mid isn't a building, it's between the first mid (or just mid) and the T.Apps. 

You can check on Google for Inferno callouts
Nah, I'm not denying anything. There are cheaters! But there is a gap between denying cheaters and seeing cheaters everywhere.

CS2 has a new rank database, and all the players who started at the same level, there are a lot of ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù which are just ‚Äúskill gap‚Äù situations. 

During the Beta, the CSGO database was cross-referenced on CS2. I was MG on CSGO, I was playing against GN and MG on CS2 Premier (Beta). When they released the game, we all started at ‚Äúzero‚Äù. My first game after release (\*see picture) was against GE and LEM.

Silvers playing against Globals (or even MG) and saying :"OMG they are cheating..." just because they have insane aim and knowledge of the game is common.

Yeah, on [CSSTATS.gg](https://CSSTATS.gg), you can see their matches CSGO and CS2 (before Sept 28th, it's currently down because of the GOTV).

 On their profile, you see their Higher CSGO ranks and higher ELO on CS2.

    Cool, weird it shows the premier rank I got during the beta instead of my current premier rank
        That's because on Sept 29th, Valve has temporarily disabled demos

If you check at the top of the page, it's saying :"Until these are re-enabled, statistics for Premier and Competitive modes will not update"
    completely outside of the topic at hand, i just tried this site and its not exactly accurate, my best was LE and it shows only MGE so eh.
        Did you have the tracking enabled? When did you reach LE? 

If nobody ever searched your account and you never connected before, you might have a short history only.

Click on CSGO in the search bar of your profile, then "OK." Click on "MATCHES" and you'll see the first match recorded on your profile.
            ah ye, it was in like 2016 so i dont blame it :D the first appears to be september of 2023, i remember there used to be a website for this very old and ive no idea if it exists anymore and that one i used to use in those times, my point being that the guy in the ops picture might be the same, it does show how many wins you got but it does not take into account that most people are playing or were playing cs before the site even existed
                It was Tracker.gg... but since CS2, there is no tracking üòï
                    Think it was even older than that, i was searching for it with "steam.id" but it was not the steam id site if it makes sense. It used to display stats and stuff. We played on faceit a couple of times but after tryharding i was just goofing around with silver friends most of the time. Its unfortunate people still need to use third party to do statistics, it should be done ingame
                        I was personally using the CSGO 360 Stats (0.99$/month) but since CS2, that feature got removed :'(
    How far does this website track backwards?

In 2015 or 16 i was definitely LEM but it shows my best rank was DMG which is valid because after a long break not playing at all i came back to the game and hit DMG.
        I think it started late 2016, but it was not using the API, so you had to manually input the demo link on the website. The auto update started in 2017-2018. 

Also, some player have this error message when I check their profile :   <<This player does not have match tracking enabled. Some matches may be missing.>> It's maybe your cases
And most of the top frags with insane gamesense that I play against don't have faceit or esea .. this is helpful but I will always play with that mindset" man cheater for sure fucking no name killed me behind a wall"


The problem is closet cheaters! And there are many .. it is obvious why some noobs check some angles nobody even a 10 wouldn't check after u bait the hell out of your team .. lot of comments here are just dumb not accepting cheaters.
on one hand yes on the other the issue is there. as a former LE player peeking really is worse than on go. the desync issues are VERY noticeable. ever since i got the beta access the game just felt "laggy" as if when you bait or corner peek and you get shot when youre already behind the wall,or when youre just dead before you could even see the guy on your screen shoot etc etc. i kind of got acustomed to it and i take it with a grain of salt as i understand what it is but it really creates some unfair advantages that when they happen they are incredibly demoralizing, especially when rn pretty much everyone is stuck on the 4-10k range and the skill difference between people of the same rank are more often than not night and day, and to top it all off the rank system not acknowledging better people tanking everyones rank even with 5-6 game win streaks with those +100 -600 games is not really helping the issue.

&#x200B;

so tldr, i in no way am mad to see these posts because people in general are just rightfully angry about the game and about the fact it replaced go.
    I don't know what you mean by "peeking really is worse". I think we have the same opinion and are 100% in agreement based on everything you wrote after.

I don't mean to be a one-upper, but I have 6k hours on this game and I've ranged from LEM-Global throughout my time playing and I can tell you there are massive issues with CS2, but the major one is that peeking is too strong. Peeker's advantage is way too much right now. Pros have also shared this sentiment in interviews after Sydney was over.

That all being said, when a player in my game is stomping around making hella noise and peeks an angle and dies then rages about how "CS2 is unplayably bad", it just gets on my nerves. I hate idiotic behavior. Raging to begin with is low iq as fuck. Attributing your garbage play to something outside of your control is just going to serve to make me slightly annoyed. Rinse repeat at least once every 3 games, it gets annoying.' That's all I'm saying. If you hate the game so much right now, quit. Come back when it's good, because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell that Valve is aware and fixing issues. Although this community is so braindead they go and make a post complaining about the MJ peek the top rated post in the sub when Valve literally patched it the day before. I'm just tired of the collective retardation. That's it. That's all I'm saying. Plenty of really good criticism could and should be given to the game, but this community doesn't seem to be very good at giving it. We agree the game is rough.
        yes, i dont really hate it, i stopped playing go because of the unfixed issues for years and no real new content in the game, nothing was changing or being fixed the map pool was the same for years, i think people are just enthusiastic and since valve has a history of well not caring for shit for the past 5 years people are worried that the game will stay like this for the next 10 years like go did. i understand the annoyingness, for me the most annoying things in order are: the fact that every single game someone gets dcd and everyone is forced to watch a 10 minute youtube video untill the timeout passes, the peeks, and lastly the matchmaking being a mess, GE facit 10 players playing alongside people with 50 hours in the game on 4k-10k ranks etc. now what remains is to just wait and enjoy what we have untill then.
It was an off angle tho.
    I was standing in the open‚Ä¶!!! No one could have guessed I‚Äôd be there
        But no one can aim that fast! I know this because I played Valorant for years!
            VALVE PLEASE!!
        that's not the point. no one prefires off angles lmao.
Yeah it's crazy. High ping players have an insane disadvantage over lower ping players. It has been like this since day 1 of online mp games.

Yes you have lag compensation now, but it only makes the game more playable for high pingers. They will still get absolutely destroyed by lower pings.
Yea i didn't buy the whole " we are turning off the demos to free up server space "bs for a second they just don't want people to be able to show how cancerous an experience they have atm is
It took a few tries for them to fix it, I remember seeing it after it got fixed.
    now all we have is twerking ):
Lots of toxic casuals on Reddit. These guys saying there's no cheater problem probably peaked at silver 4 in CS:GO and didn't encounter any. Once you hit DMG they were EVERYWHERE. I didn't know this at first because I was kind of naive and didn't know what to look for, and I thought I was just getting outskilled or outaimed all the time. But then a banwave happened and everyone who was able to swing out wide and instant headshot me was completely gone. The skill level of players just plummeted overnight. It was crazy.

People who say cheating is uncommon or isn't an issue, or that it's all just caused by desync or this nebulous thing -- this empty signifier -- everyone refuses to explain called "lag compensation," are just really new/bad. Or they're cheating and insecure about it.
    I was only LE in csgo, and it was so hard to rank up because of cheaters that i eventually quit playing this stupid game (faceit isn't available in my region). All i wanted from CS2 was 128 tick and a working anticheat. I cannot understand the mentality of devs, they have the perfect game, they just need those 2 things and people will have nothing major to complain about, ever. Yet they go on to make everything dogshit that shills are willing to die for. I just don't know anymore, enjoy your game i guess, I'm out for another year.
your whole life is a meme then
    You‚Äôre taking Reddit memes too seriously my guy
        and you're taking reddit too seriously
You need to have higher education to realize how easy it is. I assume you don‚Äôt
Says the one who posts complaints about complainers lmfao..
    It‚Äôs a meme, you took it too seriously bud
        Oh my gosh i‚Äôm being so completely serious right now! You caught me!
            You look dumb bro.
                Broke boy
                    Ah so its more than just looks.
            Midwit behaviour
Agreed. This had to happen. We needed to update the foundation it's built on. The problems will get fixed. Let em cook.
They will be back. You're all acting like this is permanent
Csgo prior to 2018(?) Left the maps in the 5v5 pool. There was other maps to play. Many. 

Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it...
    My point was about the ‚Äúlineup memorized‚Äù. Even if they add 3-4 maps, the competitive pool is the one that matters. I don't know the common spots on Militia, Agency, or Office because they weren't competitive maps when I started playing so worthless to learn. Valve current priority are competitive/eSport maps.

&#x200B;

> Being a shill for a lesser-game is ... I have no words for it... 

It's not about being a shill, it's about understanding the priorities. They already have a shitload of things to fix on the current maps plus on movement & shooting.
        Your definition of "competitive " is arbitrary. Militia assault agency .... good, coordinated 5 stacks can dominate. 

Also, people expect valve maps to be in the valve game.  

After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Choice is the nectar of Gods, and we have premeir maps, office and dust2.
            Well, that's not MY definition of competitive... I talk about THE official competitive map pool set by Valve. 

* Mirage
* Vertigo
* Nuke
* Ancient
* Anubis
* Inferno
* Overpass

This doesn't mean that Militia, Assault, and Agency aren't good maps; only that they are not ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù in the literal sense.

&#x200B;

> After premeir matches, I don't want to go to 5v5 and play only premeir maps. 

Well, they released Office, Italy and Dust2... These maps are not in the official map pool. I also think that some maps are not owned by Valve, so they do not have 100% rights to do the remake of the maps on Source2 engine.
                Italy is lost in 10v10 unavailable in 5v5. This is baffling.
    When any attempt at rationality immediately gets called off as shilling, you know the person you're talking to doesn't have much else to come with
        Let's roll in the mud :)  

I did beta test all year. There are no other maps nor modes tested. 

This is Counterstrike-Mobile-Lite.
            No thank you. Maybe next time!
I don‚Äôt understand the question? Are you saying I was cheating or what? Clueless

Yeah but I‚Äôm also talking about simple things like how they complain that a guy checked a spot or predicted them when it‚Äôs a common position, or they made noise or gave away their shadow etc
I play with old LEMs and when they are getting sh@t stomped by a lvl 1-5 STEAM accounts with only free to play games and CS2 its pretty bloody obvious.

Well, they released Office, Italy and Dust2... These maps are not in the official map pool. I also think that some maps are not owned by Valve, so they do not have 100% rights to do the remake of the maps on Source2 engine.
    Italy is lost in 10v10 unavailable in 5v5. This is baffling.
No thank you. Maybe next time!
It was Tracker.gg... but since CS2, there is no tracking üòï
    Think it was even older than that, i was searching for it with "steam.id" but it was not the steam id site if it makes sense. It used to display stats and stuff. We played on faceit a couple of times but after tryharding i was just goofing around with silver friends most of the time. Its unfortunate people still need to use third party to do statistics, it should be done ingame
        I was personally using the CSGO 360 Stats (0.99$/month) but since CS2, that feature got removed :'(
Broke boy
    Ah so its more than just looks.
