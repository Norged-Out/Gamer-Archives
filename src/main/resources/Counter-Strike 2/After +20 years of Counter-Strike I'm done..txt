[[After +20 years of Counter-Strike I'm done.]]


Welcome to my TED talk.  


Game is unplayable without actual anti-cheat and it's in the worst state it has ever been. Don't play.  


Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I'm off to greener pastures.


Yea...see you later on dust 2
    Did you mean Dota2?
        I never mean Dota2
        That how bad CS is it's pushed me back to Dota 2 aswell.
            Same haha
            Worse, it pushed me back to LoL
                LoL will always drag you back, it's not CS's fault that you signed a deal with Teemo.
                    My name is actually Timo. I am the devil
                I still struggle with LoL my brain just can't take it all in. I have way too many hours on Dota and I'm still learning :)
        I switched to faceit and so far zero cheater encounters 
            Faceit is so hot breath nerd though.  I have a life. 
                What does that even mean? If you don’t want to sweat the low levels of faceit should feel very casual lol and if you’re here reading about premier and cheaters it’s basically the same experience  -cheaters
                Well you complain in MM that your team mates are poo, then play faceit and realize they're too good. 

I guess just wait for danger zone...
                    Did u just say good teammates in faceit?😂 im lvl 8 and constantly get teamed with lvl 4-5s going 1-18 in games
                        Skill issue
                doubts
            i would but i’m running off linux on my steam deck. n if i use wine to use faceit they’ll ban me…
                Are you playing with gyro?
                    keyboard and mouse
                    only reason keyboard n lmouse is just better is really just button layout i guess you could set up your own button layout on the deck to have all the right buttons and there are community layouts but half of them never worked for me but i’ve played many fps 3ps with gyro and its so fire fr
            That's the best thing you can do. Aswell as having actual missions to earn points for rewards, which is something CS should have had since the beginning. Playing MM after MM for no other reason than to change the colour of your service medal a max of three times in a year is absolutely rediculous.
            Don’t you love it how people bitch about cheaters in Premier (which I understand) and then they bitch about not being good enough to play faceit? Makes you wonder if people like OP are even running into cheaters or if they just fucking suck
        Fuck no!
            There are literally zero cheaters in faceit. Theyre all just better than you. Getting reported and accused of being a cheater in faceit is a compliment
                If u actually think there are no cheaters on faceit someone gaslit you.
                i cheat on face it. so do all my friends. there's entire groups of us with private cheats. we just do so legit not like these dummies in premiere that don't have any game sense and go full spin.
                    Well then fuck you. and I really hope they release hardware bans or whatever the hell they would need to boot you off this shit. I work hella hard to learn this damn game and it's so fucking lame that you decide to play this way. It took me years to get as good as I am today and you just shit on everyone's hard work. Totally fucking lame.
                        He’s delusional lol and probly trolling. Let’s hope it’s the latter.
                        lol. buddy. im global elite without hacks. I only use them to combat other cheaters. I've been playing since 1999. I also hope they do something about it
                            Loser, you just rage when you get pooped on more than likely.  What a stupid take lol. Actual mouth breather right here.
                                lol. leave it to the liberal pussies to run their mouth about people they don't know
                    You are the worst kind of cheater not even the balls to go full spin
                        That's a nonsensical statement. It doesn't take balls to go full spin. That would be a lack of intelligence. lol. 

besides, I just use shams only when visible because I'm color blind and sound ESP. So if I hear you, It just makes a little footstep blink through the wall during the sound. So I have a little more accurate idea of where the sound came from. 

I'm still trying to actually have fun here lol. you get real worked up though don't you dummy. lol
                            Bro you are the cheating loser in here not me. I'm actually having fun smashing loser like you with pure skill
                                lol. you sound like the eunuch bragging about how big their dick is 😂😆.
                                    Atleast I wear my small pp with proud and don't try to extend it with 30$ trojans
Yup. Completely overrun by cheaters.
    I have been living under a cs2-free rock for a few months. Care to explain what all this fuss about cheating is about? I have always had a great experience with this game and it’s anti cheat
        If you play around 7k-15k prime the game is playable with minimal issues. Higher than that tho…
            So what has happened to make cheating so much more prevalent?
                Its always been prevalent at higher ratings? People have realised nobody gets banned for cheating so now they just do it super obviously
                Valve had some issues with the anticheat so they basically turned it off, plus there is a console command allowing players to run sv_cheats cvar on any server they please, cpmp premier etc so the cheating is just out of hand, rage hackers everywhere.
        Don't listen to people on this sub. This is the wrong sub. This is the cs2 sub where everybody hates the game. In reality everyone still loves it considering its still setting records. (Check the global offensive reddit. It's the one people actually use because everyone here is a drooling idiot.

This is an echo chamber for people who continue to play this game after 6 months of complaining like idiots, instead of just quitting when they first started saying the game is unplayable.
I’ve been playing since 1.5, game was unplayable until I reach faceit, 80games in 0 cheaters level 8 atm
    You'll start to find the legit hackers around 2200 elo. Certainly not every game or anything, but they're around. Still makes the game fun again though.
        You just don’t know how to play the game. The cheaters are either low elo boosting people or high elo using undetected and obscure cheats. No one mid range elo is cheating. Everyone is just relatively good. Different things got them their, some people can just aim their way up there while others are good at reads gamesense and timings. You probably just got bad timings and determined that they’re cheating.
            Are you trying to say 2200 isn't high elo and is actually mid range? Thats 200 elo into level 10. I usually sit around 2400 and have cracked into top 1000 many times. I know how to play the game lol.
                Yeah that’s mid elo. I say this as a 2200 player.
                    Well if you assume w0nderful sits around ~4800 as #1 (if the tracking sites are correct), this statement is, technically,  true
                        People who get an ego at 2k elo are jokes. I’m always learning. I don’t mind the dvs
            Bruh what a comment
        Nah. I played 1600 matches and I still haven’t met a blatant cheater. Maybe I’m just lucky. My highest elo is 2700 and currently at 2300.
            You quite literally won't find a blatant cheater so I believe you. Blatant cheating will get you banned on the first real report. You'll only find legit cheaters in faceit, and typically that just means they will have more info than they should. It will feel unlucky, you won't know with certainty.
                At that point I just don’t care. Either they were just good or cheating I won’t be able to tell the difference.
    i’m a bit uneducated in this area. what actually is faceit i’m not sure i understand
        it's a 3rd party site with its own servers, system and anticheat. but I generally can't recommend it to newer players. it's extremely tryhard and even more toxic than cs matchmaking. much higher skill ceiling, generally. and just a lot less fun since half the people on there think they're gonna play at the next major (they ain't).

but if you're very competitive, then go for it
            super interesting, shit thanks for the info mate. tried looking around and just thought it was like a software that stopped other people from hacking which didn’t make sense to me
            I’m only playing in a clan and can only deny the toxicity and the try hard part but I’m French so idk how it works for you
        google it you'll figure it out i believe in you
    You should watch this video which explains that faceit also has cheaters that are basically undetectable. https://youtu.be/RwzIq04vd0M?si=LRG-qWkCFDKX691i
Heard and seen this since 2015 
You’ll be back like all the others
    I might when they fix the game and community. In the meantime best of luck for everybody looking for new home.
        Mythic league is your new home
            Or valor-🤮
    y’all keep saying that but I haven’t came back yet

just cause you’re addicted don’t mean everyone else is
    This time in cs2 a lot of people actually aren’t coming back to premier MM. CS has never been so infested with spinbotters before, a lot of people have switched to faceit permanently, this is also the first time in cs history that pro players and content creators explicitly stopped playing MM.
    I’ve never come back. There are lots of us no longer playing ever again
    nothing wrong with coming back. why should one torture theirself when you could play something else until the game is fixed.

csgo was the same for 3 years. 3 fuckin years until it became somewhat playable. many og players didnt touch csgo at the beginning. (why should they, 2010-2014 was full of good games)
        Can confirm (20 year steam account).

I didn't play csgo till operation riptide.   Was surprised at the amount of cheaters in it, for it's last year before cs2 launched. 

Cs2 has now been out for somentime and it's basically unplayable. Cheating problem is worst it's been in 20 years.
it's weird how salty some people get about people posting about leaving, i think it's a good thing you're quitting and announcing it, we need more people to sit out so they can finally be forced to come up with a solution. continuing to play and buying cases isn't ever going to push valve to do anything. The games in such a bad state that valve should remove matchmaking until it's fixed
    Only way to draw attention to the issue is to cry about it. We can only hope Lord GabeN notices us puny mortals and our pleas.
Upvote and all, agree with you and all, I feel both sympathy and empathy.


That being said, what greener pastures are you talking about dude? 


FPS cheat development is a multi million dollar industry in expansion. It ain't a couple developers in their basement anymore, it's full blown companies with marketing teams, sales teams, commission plans, etc.


Technology has been adapted, Direct Memory Access (DMA) cards are undetectable as long as they are properly spoofed, but it's only been used so far for private development and the entry price is in +$100 price range. Once the software anti-cheats catch up with the regular $10-30 cheat price brackets, developers will switch to DMA, the priced will come down, and it's game over all over again.


It will take a complete overhaul on the gaming platform as we know it with custom operating systems and hardware to make it unprofitable for cheat development and only then we will see greener pastures.
    I really don’t get the exitement people over 14years old get from cheating and that people are willing to pay for it seems so weird to me
        Yeah I can't understand it either, if I don't have challenge in a pvp fps, it gets boring, because what I like about these games is learning and feeling you are getting better.
If it's just for lol, I prefer single player games then.

But I know people who play every game on easy because they just want to enjoy the context, though for fps... There isn't much content, so I suppose they just feel their egoes stroked even if under the surface they know they are just cheating and bullying honest players
            I totally agree, and also dont understand why ppl cheat. Also a 20y vet here.  
Although, now there is a new big detail on the game, Valve made a Top players list. Many are using cheats to "be" on the Top, and see their names there. That's why ppl say that is impossible to play on higher rating points matches.  
So, basically valve gave cheaters one more reason to hack.    
Since the CS2 was launched, and after all theses months, everyone's see how many top10 players were cheaters.

So I do agree, that, more then ever, CS is full of cheaters. The Top ranking system, push cheaters to be, more and more agressive, in order to reach the Top. Even that being a fake Top... But they dont care. They only want to see their names on the top.
                The problem is cheaters are also on non-competitive, I get one every few games. Some are blatant with autoaim or wh, some are less blatant and activate some autoaim thing after first-second shot (you see it clearly because they are spraying with AK and their first two shots completely miss the target, third moves the crosshair very fast on head and bang!).

I managed to have one banned by telling all players to report and then kick, he tried to come back in the game but it said it was banned (first time I see a real time ban on CS!).

But often players are either lazy, complicit (either because they are friend or because they are just shitty people that prefer to have the botter on their side of the match), or just don't report (or don't know hot to do that).
        Same with cheating in everything. Work, sports or whatever. Some ppl just don’t care. It’s the same with going to the gym. 30 day tren challenge on TikTok isn’t because people wants to put in the grind. Ppl always look for the short cut, the new method no one knows bla bla. It’s all the same

Since the brain isn’t fully developed till 25 a 14 year old by natural explanation can’t think of consequences or w/e
    yeah, i'm done with competitive FPS in general. it's a solved issue for cheaters at this point. cheats are extremely difficult to detect, new accounts are in plentiful supply, devs actively like people getting new accounts as it makes their numbers look good (not to mention bot farming accounts), the rewards for cheating are massive - you can go from a broke nobody to making a living streaming a videogame or creating ADHD tiktok shit of your l33t plays, while the punishment is irrelevant.

if you have the required lack of moral character, you have every reason to cheat and nothing is going to stop you.
        Console players are going through cronus zen which is basically a $100\~ DMA sold on a massive scale. ximming, or faking the input as a controller when you're on kb+m, is becoming more common for the aim assist and even small streamers are doing it(you can tell bc they have controller player xhair movement despite supposedly playing on kb+m).

Streaming/content creation has become main stream enough that a lot more people are doing it for money. It's no longer a hobby that you did on the side which means cheaters/bad actors are going to appear more frequently and they're going to defend with "it's how I make my living."

Modern issues require modern laws and cheating in multiplayer games should be against the law by allowing ISP providers to ban cheaters from using their service the second a registered game developer bans their IP/hardware for cheating. Game developers will never win against cheat developers so we have to make it punishable for the user of cheats as much as possible.
            i wish each CS season cost $1 to enter, then you could either win $2 by ranking up or losing it by ranking down. 

the actual monetary amount would be meaningless, but it would mean CS would come under proper gaming/gambling laws and if you got cheating you could do time.
                I just think that if ISP's were legally allowed to know what customers get banned from using a service of another companies then it would solve the cheating issue for the whole gaming industry. Someone banned in CS would carry their ban length over their entire internet. Cheating/using malicious software is already against everyone's ISP TOS...

A VPN wouldn't save them either since it's the in game account getting banned and their ISP would be notified of which one of their customers got banned for cheating using their network(no VPN can change your ISP).

We already pay a lot for internet so I don't see why this isn't possible.
                    Having some sort of legislation to tackle cheating should definitely be investigated. Fines or blocking internet service should be the punishment. I believe South Korea has some laws to prevent cheating in online games. I wish somebody would take this to EU level.
    As software developer myself, out of professional curiosity, I've been digging in to this cheating business too and I honestly see no easy way out of this. Plenty of great videos/documentaries out there by people who know the game and methods. Simple client side anti-cheat nowadays is nowhere near enough.

Those who are curious this is one the best videos about anti-cheats and cheating I've been able to find so far

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwzIq04vd0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwzIq04vd0M) - Hacking into Kernel Anti-Cheats: How cheaters bypass Faceit, ESEA and Vanguard anti-cheats by Unity Research.

100% recommend everyone to watch it. You'll lose hope but at least you're informed about the reality.
        making people aware of the issue with the facts and statistics is a big step though.  i'm seeing more people aware of the cheating problem now than ever before which is a good thing.  just a few years back, you literally couldn't find a single person who would believe you about there being any cheaters at all.  so the cheating thrived and almost always went unreported.

it's true that the cheaters have a bunch of big communities dedicated to cheating. maybe now that people are finally accepting the magnitude of the issue, we can also start seeing more anti-cheat communities forming.  i think higher cheating awareness of the community will also put pressure on people who are cheating to stop and/or help prevent players from picking up cheats in the first place.
        Oh dang I forgot about the micro controller cheats LOL
        This is my biggest fear as a game developer. I want to make games that people enjoy and don’t want to cheat in, but someone will always want to be better than everyone through any means necessary. It really makes me weary to see this because I’ve been developing a multiplayer game for the past little while and I’ve seen cheating become so rampant in other multiplayer games, I’m considering refactoring my codebase to implement an external anticheat like easy anticheat just because of all of this. It’s crazy but it seems every game needs that level of anticheat now
            I feel you. There are some interesting server side AI/ML solutions cooking but so far the adoption of those has been slow. [Anybrain.gg](http://Anybrain.gg) seems most promising so far, there are others popping up at regular interval. I think client side cheat detection is most likely dead at this point. Only some sort of statistical analysis/biometric profiling of game style and performance is the only way forward. Kernel 0 anti-cheats don't do shit anymore against the multitude of attack vectors available for malicious developers.
                Yeah I don’t think I’d ever consider a kernel level anticheat at all. I like the idea of server side solutions though, that way people don’t need it if they just want to play with friends they trust
    Have played cs since 1.2, gave up on CSGO because cheaters. It was too obvious years ago, but I can’t imagine playing CS2, must be awful from what I see. I play Warzone DMZ with mouse and keyboard on PS5, restricted to ps5 users. It’s literally a million times more fun. I won’t be going back.
As a fellow 20+ year vet, not even close to the worst it’s ever been. But cheating specifically seems to be plaguing the entire fps industry. Good luck on those greener pastures, gaming or not I hope you enjoy it!

        There is a link. I'm a simple man. I upvote. Won't click it I can't read.
            And a link to a .edu domain no less. Has to be good.
                too many words but 3 pages of references, i believe whatever is being said.
        just shows how many psychopaths are really out there too.
    I've been playing since 1998 beta, and I can firmly attest that cheating right now is the worst it's been in franchise history, there has never been a time where so many cheat devs are making massive bank off monthly subs to their cheats, so many cheat programs, so many cheaters ranging from ranked/comp/premier, to casual, to wing man to death match, every single mode.

There's a reason why pros were very outspoken when cs2 dropped during the first few months about how many cheaters are in premier and they just all gave up playing ranked (this hasn't happened to the scale it has in any cs).

Sure you can load up 1.6 right now or source and play against cheaters every game but it was never as bad as cs2 is.

Anything above 20k rating is unplayable due to cheaters (it's widely known that 20k+ is mostly just hvh). I managed to solo queue to global elite in 2017, and barely ran into cheaters, my biggest issue was playing against people who lived close to the server vs my 70 ping.

When the game became f2p, that's when you saw cheating becoming an epidemic but it's never been as bad as it is now. Before f2p, you mainly saw cheaters would buy the game for 10 bucks or so when it went on sale during steam sales, but they would eventually get banned from overwatch.

There has never been a time where so many bot accounts with farmed hours are selling for a dollar or less just for people to spam their cheats on. NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A TIME WITH SO MANY BOTTED HOUR ACCOUNTS SELLING FOR MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO USE TO CHEAT IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. so I really don't know what you're yapping about when you say it's not even close to being as bad as it used to be (you're likely lying for reddit karma and ego because every way to measure the amount of cheating there is proves your statement wrong).

Sure valve made prime in 2016, enabled phone verification as part of the process (no longer needed), and overwatch was in since 2013 and magicly got removed March 2023 which now is the primarily reason we see so many cheaters. The only reason people got VAC back in the day was due to overwatch, with this gone, there is nothing stopping people from cheating or being worried about being banned unless they play against fl0m when he's streaming because some valve employees love the guy and watch him all the time.

At the bare minimum, valve NEEDS to bring back overwatch to get rid of the blatant cheaters.
        Do you not remember CS before VAC was even a thing? Cheating has been around since the betas of cs, its nothing new.
             We used to have anti-cheats that took screenshots players client and uploaded them after the match to public http server. Of course in time cheaters found a way to circumvent those too but it's always the case in arms race.  
  
This was back in the days before match making services. In those days you found PCW or scrims in IRC or websites like Clanbase or ESL among others. Things were simpler back then. Community moderated itself.

There have been anti-cheats before VAC just as there has always been cheats.
        Mate has played since 1998 and thinks premier competitive is what defines CS ICANT

This is like saying back in source/1.6 that they have a cheating problem because you'd go on a shitty public server and there was a cheater connecting there one time.
            did you read anything I said? i didn't just day premier you blatant idiot.
            r/confidentlyincorrect
    For CS specifically this is the worst iv seen it in 20+ years.
    Valorant has working anticheat, just saying…
        I wouldn't be so sure....

            Imagine thinking an anti cheat is instant and bans everyone automatically. Of course there are cheaters you should know this for how long you've been playing. Val anti cheat is far and above way better than cs2.
        You sure?
    I stopped even wanting to play this game as veteran. And not even because of the cheaters.
    I've been playing this game since 1.3 in a LAN Cafe as a 13 year old. This is easily the worst state any Counter-Strike game has been. I don't know how it could've been any worse. There's literally no incentive to try and play Counter-Strike 2, anyone who does is just manipulated to play with their NFT skins,

Actually that's what this game is now, a NFT skin game, not a competitve tactical shooter anymore.
        Yeah, you must have really enjoyed the valve matchmaking in 1.3 and reasonably that's the pinnacle of CS these days too.
            You didn't need matchmaking, you played with everyone at the LAN Cafe. That was the best experience ever in Counter-Strike, let alone video games.
                What if I told you that you can still do that
                    What if I told you I wasn't 13 years old anymore and worked 40 hours a week now.
                        Ha! 40 hours a week, weak sauce my man. Weak sauce.
    Clearly doesn't even play the game anymore and waffling now L
I am not playing CS2 until they implement AntiCheat and clean all the mess, even though I might not even come back ever, tbh, let's see
Just gotta stick to playing on Faceit until Valve fixes the problem.

My friends and I queue a few matches on Faceit each night and then finish with an Office on the competitive queue.
    Faceit has been amazing so far. I'm only a level 4.. but it's a relief to get away from premiere.
        i hear all these things about faceit being a sweaty toxic tryhard experience, but is that not the case? i've had the client for a while but never pulled the trigger on jumping in yet.
            Just don't solo Q. That's the only time I've really encountered toxicity.
After last night, I'm not playing a single premier game ever again, better off on faceit at least. Past 5 games... At least 1 cheater on either team (19-20k elo)
Fellow 20+ year player.  Its as bad as its ever been however I do feel like something will actually be done about it now.  they have a new engine,  a bigger player base than there has ever been.  The cheating conversation is pretty much the only conversation left at this point so I have faith they will do something about it.   I'm really hoping for a gigantic VAC wave followed by a minimum account age to play in mainstream servers.  Boot them out,  keep them out,  with an AI based filter for new accounts with how they play.   I mean you could spot most cheaters using a  spreadsheet of info from the scoreboard at this point with HS percentage,  kills to deaths,  let alone the info available within a demo of,  total rotations,  speed of mouse,  average time a mouse was over a head hitbox.   Theres way too much easy info for valve to not have a proper plan there.
    like account age matters anymore.

ive seen blatant cheaters using 10+ year old accounts, probably as high as 18 at one point.
        I agree but I would say the majority of cheaters are level 1 accounts.  It would be an easy way to remove a large percentage.  Anyway,  hopefully Valve have a better plan than me!
        Account age or number of hours do not matter. 13k hours, 10 year badge account aimbotting blatantly in every other lobby. They are stolen/bought accounts. I wonder why even bother buying old account at this point if you intend to cheat. Matters none. You ain't fooling anyone. People with experience notice trigger bot/wh within few rounds.
    The worst thing is that there has been zero communication from Valve to address the issue. They've buried their heads in the sand. It's ridiculous.
Faceit is the only way to go

and community dm for warmup
    Thanks for the tip now I just have to convince my entire friends list to go Faceit. Or not bother and play other games.
Confirmed, I quit at the end of Feb. Shits busted.  RiP CS.
This game is an advertisement to play WON CS 1.5
I did this and switched to helldivers 2 and it’s been amazing.
Love how people are recommending Faceit like Valve should be allowed to keep this awful anti cheat history going. How many times have they said they are working on the anti cheat and that it’s their priority?

Then how the fuck has Faceit and ESEA lived for so fucking long with CS as a staple that Valve can’t do? Remember guys, Gaben has 1 billion dollars in Yachts alone. 

Remember that on your Steamdeck purchase and case openings.
I started playing Rainbow Six Siege again. It's far from perfect but at least you can see during games that Ubi bans people. Saw a few ban waves just yesterday.
install face it and register and play , havent come across one cheater .... face it is gg but you gotta pay but totally worth imo
    You don't have to pay for Faceit?  
Free version and paid versions.  
Both of which require Faceit AC to run to play games.
    Less cheaters, more Smurfs. Outcome is almost the same. You get stomped by someone you have no chance of beating. I'm level 9 currently and I have a level 5-7 guy in almost every game that top frags. Level 2 steam account, no medals, no other games, just cs and he plays like 3000 ELO.     
Great experience all around.
        Smurfs are a problem but you can report them and they get banned and you get your ELO back
            If you can prove it sure.
    You can still cheat on faceit you just can't spin around like a bladeblade, since they actually have a mod team.
        And even if you lose your game, if you are seen wallhacking, aimbotting, or anything other form of cheating, you will get banned by said mod team.  
Elo will be reinstated to the losing team and the winning team will have their winning elo taken away.

Unlike MM where you don't get your elo back, Faceit you do.
            Yeah but people with be sneaky there which I mean I guess it's better since you can't tell. And it probably won't make you question why you play said game.

I thought valve claimed they give back elo when someone does get banned?
                Trust me, I've played against people who I thought MIGHT be cheating, watched the GOTV back and have seen it looked like they had walls so reported them.  
Faceit admins are good with detecting if someone is cheating.  
Hundreds or thousands of hours, you know if someone is holding an angle or just keeping the outline of a player on their screen.  
Many many many things to look into and not just if he locked onto that persons head...

Radar hacks and wallhacks are both used.

I haven't seen anything claiming Valve give elo back, I might be mistaken though.  
I have gone against spinbotters but haven't seen elo come back in premier.

In Faceit, you will always get your elo back if someone on the opposition is cheating.
>and it's in the worst state it has ever been.


CS 1.6 has always been in A LOT worse state than CS2 is now. It's literally a bugfest. Which didn't stop it from becoming a classic.
    Skill ceiling in 1.6 was way higher, wall bangs and much more movement skills required. Also better netcode + ac (ESL with passport registration). 

Not sure if you ever played it.
        It didn't need any more NECESSARY movement skills than GO or 2. Wallbangs through whole maps are exactly a bug (because it has never been an intended gameplay feature obviously), along with double crouching, grenade damage through the walls, defusing A from B site on Nuke, quick silencer trick, huge amount of map bugs, not working flashbangs/smokes (you needed two smokes so they would work somehow) and tons of other BUGS. Also server crashes due to messed config files and a lot of other "cool" things. CS 1.6 has always been a shitfest. CS2 is far away from it now. It's A LOT more polished and a lot more competitive game.
            Some call it bugs, some call it opportunities who needed to be mastered. 

Less skills and opportunities now, consequentially a worse game with lower skill ceiling.
                Skill ceiling isn't lower because it's still a competitive game with a lot of variables to remember, they just make more sense. You need to rely more on your gamesense and aim to win in CSGO than on ability to exploit unintended bugs, which is exactly why CSGO is ultimately a better game. It's both more fun to play and (most importantly) more fun to watch. Same goes to CS2.
                    So simpler game isn't equal to lower skill ceiling, understood. :)

Guess you're just not playing CS long enough to notice how shit it is nowadays.
                        I play CS long enough to notice how GOOD it is nowadays. Not only I played 1.6, I hosted local tournaments. Hosting servers is even bigger shitshow than just playing the game btw.

CSGO/2 is not simpler. You have to remember what you can wallbang and what not. You have to be a lot more careful through smokes. Spraying, spray transfers. Different methods of throwing grenades. Knowing when you can noscope with AWP and when you can't. Knowing how to move scoped on (quickscoping is another 1.6 unintended functionality). And a lot more things that require skills AND make the game more interesting to watch.
    You're lying and wrong and I will prove this.

I've been playing since 1998 beta, and I can firmly attest that cheating right now is the worst it's been in franchise history, there has never been a time where so many cheat devs are making massive bank off monthly subs to their cheats, so many cheat programs, so many cheaters ranging from ranked/comp/premier, to casual, to wing man to death match, every single mode.

There's a reason why pros were very outspoken when cs2 dropped during the first few months about how many cheaters are in premier and they just all gave up playing ranked (this hasn't happened to the scale it has in any cs).

Sure you can load up 1.6 right now or source and play against cheaters every game but it was never as bad as cs2 is.

Anything above 20k rating is unplayable due to cheaters (it's widely known that 20k+ is mostly just hvh). I managed to solo queue to global elite in 2017, and barely ran into cheaters, my biggest issue was playing against people who lived close to the server vs my 70 ping.

When the game became f2p, that's when you saw cheating becoming an epidemic but it's never been as bad as it is now. Before f2p, you mainly saw cheaters would buy the game for 10 bucks or so when it went on sale during steam sales, but they would eventually get banned from overwatch.

There has never been a time where so many bot accounts with farmed hours are selling for a dollar or less just for people to spam their cheats on. NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A TIME WITH SO MANY BOTTED HOUR ACCOUNTS SELLING FOR MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO USE TO CHEAT IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. so I really don't know what you're yapping about when you say it's not even close to being as bad as 1.6 (you're likely lying for reddit karma and ego because every way to measure the amount of cheating there is proves your statement wrong).

Sure valve made prime in 2016, enabled phone verification as part of the process (no longer needed), and overwatch was in since 2013 and magicly got removed March 2023 which now is the primarily reason we see so many cheaters. The only reason people got VAC back in the day was due to overwatch, with this gone, there is nothing stopping people from cheating or being worried about being banned unless they play against fl0m when he's streaming because some valve employees love the guy and watch him all the time.

At the bare minimum, valve NEEDS to bring back overwatch to get rid of the blatant cheaters.
        It has nothing to do with the state of the game. If CS 1.6 had paid skins + cases + drops, it would crawl with hackers that just pull down servers. Because it WAS a bugfest. Trust me, I hosted multiple CS 1.6 servers in the past. It's a nightmare.
            in cs2 they literally can take down servers with their cheats, its been documented already where hackers kick people out of games or shut their games down.

Sure maybe 1.6 was buggy but all games were buggy but in a better state than what AAA devs manage to send out now (I.e. meet deadlines and targets and fix game later ex. cyberpunk).

Cs1.6 was niche, even if they had paid skins drops and cases it wouldn't mean anything because not many people gamed as they do now.

I thought you were talking about cheating specifically, not just bugs or w.e. Cs2 has had its fair share of bugs, to the point there was a huge scare about RCE and people getting their IPs stolen just from playing official servers.
I mostly play Casual and DM and a few times per week Premier. I am very low elo in Premier (7k) so I very rarely encounter cheaters down there (no spinners for sure), but still I know that they are out there.
    90% of games past 15k rank have cheaters in it. It's over.
![gif](giphy|CA6x20oQ0jljG)
Cya later of faceit ma dude
16 years CS vet here, same

it had to be done
I mean imagine wasting your time cheating in a game and that too for what?
I played religiously from 2019 till this year. I cant stand what theyve done. Doesnt seem like anyone likes the game. I dont know why people havent boycotted it yet.
Yeah I’ve been taking a break for a while now but I’m in the same boat as you.

Very unfortunate state the game is in right now.
I was excited after the major, then I went to play, then cheaters, then I quit and will only comeback if AC is on, until then I'm playing other games.
People gonna play it anyway
Cheating is a problem in every game these days. You can’t escape it
I guess I will stop playing premier at the moment. Maybe some competitive matches.
Thanks for the update.
the closet cheaters and the people in general are awful, terrible community, I hope it fails
Same
Same. I'm helldiving till it gets better.
Can agree with you, same shit, but 12-14 years of CS. For all the people who say "will see you later on dust2", just have some self-respect. Replace this trash with other games that can really bring joy, and where developers care about their community.
I’ve solo qued since I started playing this CS, the past 3 months has been the worst experience ever had playing this. It’s to the point I have to force myself to finish a game to avoid a ban and Elo loss, 20+ kills a game and stuck at 2,500 🥲
Lmao its so funny how its been happening to tf2 for years and most people just cope but when it happens for a few months to cs2 everyone is freaking out and quitting
    The size of the communities do not even compare. Also completely different game modes and game loop. Not to mention eSports.
Got me considering a tolerance break out here lmao
I'm down to replace cs2 but with what
It's not even just cheating. They removed CSGO even though CS2 doesn't have half the content. Subtick is also broken.
Simple trick, do as I do and stick with the past, play CS Source 😎
    Tempting... I still have more hours in that game than all the other games I've ever played combined by my last calculation.
Lol okay, but you have to make a post if you ever launch the game again announcing to the world that you're back, it's only fair.
something something not an airport something something announce your departure
Yup. I prefer cs over Val and have played cs since 2001 but I only play Val as far as fps games go now because while it isn’t completely cheater free, there are significantly less cheater in Val than any other fps. I’ve played for 3 years now and only encountered blatant cheaters twice, both were banned. 

In cs I encounter blatant cheaters almost every time I play. Fuck that waste of time. Uninstalled
The gaslighting of players “not cheating” thinking the other team is “cheating” so they start spin hacking… it’s out of hand. Everyone got a Glock in their waste band pulling it out in traffic cause they got cut off.
Can confirm (20 year steam account).

I didn't play csgo till operation riptide.   Was surprised at the amount of cheaters in it, for it's last year before cs2 launched. 

Cs2 has now been out for somentime and it's basically unplayable. Cheating problem is worst it's been in 20 years.
Faceit
I wish they'd just use faceit anti cheat for premier :x
    they should release a few more cases and then just buy out faceit to use as their competitive system 😭😭😭

  
\^ sarcasm, valve would never do anything that would help their games
I'm haven't played since December, reinstalled it for the first time yesterday. Either I'm lucky or the cheaters are sleeping, because I didn't encounter any blatant cheating or even an accusation of someone cheating. I played only 5 matches so it's not a good data sample, but I'm in the NA region so I should at least encounter a cheater or two. In any case I uninstalled it again immediately because I wasn't as pumped to play as I used to be.
Can you sell me your skins ? Thx
This is every shooter at the moment. Cheaters are at an all time high right now
you are washed!
Why are the cheaters always on the enemy team? 🤔

I have a few team mates that accuse the enemy team each time we lose. "How does he know I'm there?"

What I mean is that probably not everyone who you accuse is cheating. Sometimes people are lucky. Sometimes they even have a whole lucky game. Same goes for me or my mates. I sometimes make plays where I would accuse myself and sure enough I get comments from the enemy team.
> Came back to check out if cs2 fixed gos issues
> played for 2 weeks found out it has a whole lot of other issues that not even go had
> knowing very welll enough that valve wont fix shit for another 10 years i just didnt play since
> profit ?
I have 20+ years in CounterStrike and i still enjoy it.
Then you were there for the csgo release. I'm sure you'd be able to remember that It was the same. New game new exploits and valve takes their sweet ass time doing everything and we still wait to play the game. It's been almost a year since the release of the beta, just like how in csgo it took them almost a year to buff the cz and R8. Y'all are too impatient. Also feel free to try any other multiplayer game, there are cheaters every turn you take.
Just play rust
No sea marica we
Do like me, play on faceit
Good riddance. One less whiner. 

I get the game has problems but you ceremonial complainers are quite annoying. Shouldn't you have quit 6 months ago? I mean what changed since then? I think maybe you have brain damage.
game is so bad I play valorant now and I’m lowkey loving
Same low effort, clone post. Just get off the game, stop crying on reddit over a game
I think they do that on purpose so people have to sub faceit and esea
See you tmrw
Yeah I really only play on mythic anymore
See ya next week friend
Anomaly leave = everyone quits. I like this gangy 👌🏻
yeah, i also uninstalled CS this week....for the 32nd time....its busy downloading again as we speak...

this game is a drug. you know its bad for you, but there is nothing else like it.
    I have plenty of other drugs to keep me occupied. This game ain't worth it anymore. 4/5 games has cheaters beyond 15k rank.
Cheaters vs. Anti-cheat will always be an arms race that will not be beat with today's AC, kernel level spyware or not. That's why I cope and hope that the AI AC that Valve is working on will be the future. The only thing that can beat human programmers will be AI, which will lead to AI cheats probably and the problem will be back. But that will be another issue for another time.

I support Valve and their hopes of making AI AC which is not a mandatory chinese spyware you have to install to play.
    In mainstream gaming we don't really need a perfect AC, but let's start by having one that at the very least catches the script-kiddies.

And this isn't a small indie company, but they still have problems with sv_cheats being available on public servers. I mean, that's just neglect. I think this is stuff we struggled with in 2000-2005 ish. Would really think that it was a thing of the past.
        Do remember that they literally just built a new engine from the ground up. It was not tested enough before release, granted. But shit will happen
            The "new" engine that's been out since 2015
                No the new engine that they released with CS2. Nice bait
                    My dude, cs2 runs on source 2, which came out in 2015 with dota 2...
I play everyday and I don't see any cheaters.

But it's because I use faceit, with anticheat.
Bye Felicia won't be missed.
player since 1998 here, played CAL league, watched CPL, and now im done. Ya'll hacker can have CS back, im done!
    You're showing your age there lol. CS didn't exist, even as a mod until 99. It didn't come out of beta stage until mid 2000. I bought it retail in 2001.
There was no premier for like 90% of the time you played cs on, why are you basing your experience on that? 

Like, if you actually played cs for 20+ years, you'd already know how to avoid cheaters.
Can i get ur skins while you're at it 👉🏻👈🏻
lol link steam for proof, you’ll be playing tomorrow.
Before ya hang it up.. try faceit. Servers feel great, and its overall a better experience than premiere.
Considering how long you been playing, you're honestly a fucking old man my guy.

Welcome to every competitive online video game in the 2020's. Get gud. Like REALLY FUCKING GUD. Or join them. Don't forget to move somewhere with fiber optic 2gig internet and 0ms ping. Cheat or no cheat, ping is king.
Lost respect by posting sorry. Now you can install and play again after your upvotes
Can I have your skins?
Bye give me your skins 
Okay. Bye
It’s 20+. See ya!
Face it or stop complaining
Bye Felicia.
[deleted]
    No
After 20 years you’re telling me this is what stops you from playing. CS2 is in a better place than CSGO was less than a year after its release. Post like this are either trolling or they are liars.
    Plenty of other games nowadays to spend my time. They all have cheating problem but CS2 is ridiculous.
Did you mean Dota2?
    I never mean Dota2
    That how bad CS is it's pushed me back to Dota 2 aswell.
        Same haha
        Worse, it pushed me back to LoL
            LoL will always drag you back, it's not CS's fault that you signed a deal with Teemo.
                My name is actually Timo. I am the devil
            I still struggle with LoL my brain just can't take it all in. I have way too many hours on Dota and I'm still learning :)
    I switched to faceit and so far zero cheater encounters 
        Faceit is so hot breath nerd though.  I have a life. 
            What does that even mean? If you don’t want to sweat the low levels of faceit should feel very casual lol and if you’re here reading about premier and cheaters it’s basically the same experience  -cheaters
            Well you complain in MM that your team mates are poo, then play faceit and realize they're too good. 

I guess just wait for danger zone...
                Did u just say good teammates in faceit?😂 im lvl 8 and constantly get teamed with lvl 4-5s going 1-18 in games
                    Skill issue
            doubts
        i would but i’m running off linux on my steam deck. n if i use wine to use faceit they’ll ban me…
            Are you playing with gyro?
                keyboard and mouse
                only reason keyboard n lmouse is just better is really just button layout i guess you could set up your own button layout on the deck to have all the right buttons and there are community layouts but half of them never worked for me but i’ve played many fps 3ps with gyro and its so fire fr
        That's the best thing you can do. Aswell as having actual missions to earn points for rewards, which is something CS should have had since the beginning. Playing MM after MM for no other reason than to change the colour of your service medal a max of three times in a year is absolutely rediculous.
        Don’t you love it how people bitch about cheaters in Premier (which I understand) and then they bitch about not being good enough to play faceit? Makes you wonder if people like OP are even running into cheaters or if they just fucking suck
    Fuck no!
        There are literally zero cheaters in faceit. Theyre all just better than you. Getting reported and accused of being a cheater in faceit is a compliment
            If u actually think there are no cheaters on faceit someone gaslit you.
            i cheat on face it. so do all my friends. there's entire groups of us with private cheats. we just do so legit not like these dummies in premiere that don't have any game sense and go full spin.
                Well then fuck you. and I really hope they release hardware bans or whatever the hell they would need to boot you off this shit. I work hella hard to learn this damn game and it's so fucking lame that you decide to play this way. It took me years to get as good as I am today and you just shit on everyone's hard work. Totally fucking lame.
                    He’s delusional lol and probly trolling. Let’s hope it’s the latter.
                    lol. buddy. im global elite without hacks. I only use them to combat other cheaters. I've been playing since 1999. I also hope they do something about it
                        Loser, you just rage when you get pooped on more than likely.  What a stupid take lol. Actual mouth breather right here.
                            lol. leave it to the liberal pussies to run their mouth about people they don't know
                You are the worst kind of cheater not even the balls to go full spin
                    That's a nonsensical statement. It doesn't take balls to go full spin. That would be a lack of intelligence. lol. 

besides, I just use shams only when visible because I'm color blind and sound ESP. So if I hear you, It just makes a little footstep blink through the wall during the sound. So I have a little more accurate idea of where the sound came from. 

I'm still trying to actually have fun here lol. you get real worked up though don't you dummy. lol
                        Bro you are the cheating loser in here not me. I'm actually having fun smashing loser like you with pure skill
                            lol. you sound like the eunuch bragging about how big their dick is 😂😆.
                                Atleast I wear my small pp with proud and don't try to extend it with 30$ trojans
I have been living under a cs2-free rock for a few months. Care to explain what all this fuss about cheating is about? I have always had a great experience with this game and it’s anti cheat
    If you play around 7k-15k prime the game is playable with minimal issues. Higher than that tho…
        So what has happened to make cheating so much more prevalent?
            Its always been prevalent at higher ratings? People have realised nobody gets banned for cheating so now they just do it super obviously
            Valve had some issues with the anticheat so they basically turned it off, plus there is a console command allowing players to run sv_cheats cvar on any server they please, cpmp premier etc so the cheating is just out of hand, rage hackers everywhere.
    Don't listen to people on this sub. This is the wrong sub. This is the cs2 sub where everybody hates the game. In reality everyone still loves it considering its still setting records. (Check the global offensive reddit. It's the one people actually use because everyone here is a drooling idiot.

This is an echo chamber for people who continue to play this game after 6 months of complaining like idiots, instead of just quitting when they first started saying the game is unplayable.
You'll start to find the legit hackers around 2200 elo. Certainly not every game or anything, but they're around. Still makes the game fun again though.
    You just don’t know how to play the game. The cheaters are either low elo boosting people or high elo using undetected and obscure cheats. No one mid range elo is cheating. Everyone is just relatively good. Different things got them their, some people can just aim their way up there while others are good at reads gamesense and timings. You probably just got bad timings and determined that they’re cheating.
        Are you trying to say 2200 isn't high elo and is actually mid range? Thats 200 elo into level 10. I usually sit around 2400 and have cracked into top 1000 many times. I know how to play the game lol.
            Yeah that’s mid elo. I say this as a 2200 player.
                Well if you assume w0nderful sits around ~4800 as #1 (if the tracking sites are correct), this statement is, technically,  true
                    People who get an ego at 2k elo are jokes. I’m always learning. I don’t mind the dvs
        Bruh what a comment
    Nah. I played 1600 matches and I still haven’t met a blatant cheater. Maybe I’m just lucky. My highest elo is 2700 and currently at 2300.
        You quite literally won't find a blatant cheater so I believe you. Blatant cheating will get you banned on the first real report. You'll only find legit cheaters in faceit, and typically that just means they will have more info than they should. It will feel unlucky, you won't know with certainty.
            At that point I just don’t care. Either they were just good or cheating I won’t be able to tell the difference.
i’m a bit uneducated in this area. what actually is faceit i’m not sure i understand
    it's a 3rd party site with its own servers, system and anticheat. but I generally can't recommend it to newer players. it's extremely tryhard and even more toxic than cs matchmaking. much higher skill ceiling, generally. and just a lot less fun since half the people on there think they're gonna play at the next major (they ain't).

but if you're very competitive, then go for it
        super interesting, shit thanks for the info mate. tried looking around and just thought it was like a software that stopped other people from hacking which didn’t make sense to me
        I’m only playing in a clan and can only deny the toxicity and the try hard part but I’m French so idk how it works for you
    google it you'll figure it out i believe in you
You should watch this video which explains that faceit also has cheaters that are basically undetectable. https://youtu.be/RwzIq04vd0M?si=LRG-qWkCFDKX691i
I might when they fix the game and community. In the meantime best of luck for everybody looking for new home.
    Mythic league is your new home
        Or valor-🤮
y’all keep saying that but I haven’t came back yet

just cause you’re addicted don’t mean everyone else is
This time in cs2 a lot of people actually aren’t coming back to premier MM. CS has never been so infested with spinbotters before, a lot of people have switched to faceit permanently, this is also the first time in cs history that pro players and content creators explicitly stopped playing MM.
I’ve never come back. There are lots of us no longer playing ever again
nothing wrong with coming back. why should one torture theirself when you could play something else until the game is fixed.

csgo was the same for 3 years. 3 fuckin years until it became somewhat playable. many og players didnt touch csgo at the beginning. (why should they, 2010-2014 was full of good games)
    Can confirm (20 year steam account).

I didn't play csgo till operation riptide.   Was surprised at the amount of cheaters in it, for it's last year before cs2 launched. 

Cs2 has now been out for somentime and it's basically unplayable. Cheating problem is worst it's been in 20 years.
Only way to draw attention to the issue is to cry about it. We can only hope Lord GabeN notices us puny mortals and our pleas.
I really don’t get the exitement people over 14years old get from cheating and that people are willing to pay for it seems so weird to me
    Yeah I can't understand it either, if I don't have challenge in a pvp fps, it gets boring, because what I like about these games is learning and feeling you are getting better.
If it's just for lol, I prefer single player games then.

But I know people who play every game on easy because they just want to enjoy the context, though for fps... There isn't much content, so I suppose they just feel their egoes stroked even if under the surface they know they are just cheating and bullying honest players
        I totally agree, and also dont understand why ppl cheat. Also a 20y vet here.  
Although, now there is a new big detail on the game, Valve made a Top players list. Many are using cheats to "be" on the Top, and see their names there. That's why ppl say that is impossible to play on higher rating points matches.  
So, basically valve gave cheaters one more reason to hack.    
Since the CS2 was launched, and after all theses months, everyone's see how many top10 players were cheaters.

So I do agree, that, more then ever, CS is full of cheaters. The Top ranking system, push cheaters to be, more and more agressive, in order to reach the Top. Even that being a fake Top... But they dont care. They only want to see their names on the top.
            The problem is cheaters are also on non-competitive, I get one every few games. Some are blatant with autoaim or wh, some are less blatant and activate some autoaim thing after first-second shot (you see it clearly because they are spraying with AK and their first two shots completely miss the target, third moves the crosshair very fast on head and bang!).

I managed to have one banned by telling all players to report and then kick, he tried to come back in the game but it said it was banned (first time I see a real time ban on CS!).

But often players are either lazy, complicit (either because they are friend or because they are just shitty people that prefer to have the botter on their side of the match), or just don't report (or don't know hot to do that).
    Same with cheating in everything. Work, sports or whatever. Some ppl just don’t care. It’s the same with going to the gym. 30 day tren challenge on TikTok isn’t because people wants to put in the grind. Ppl always look for the short cut, the new method no one knows bla bla. It’s all the same

Since the brain isn’t fully developed till 25 a 14 year old by natural explanation can’t think of consequences or w/e
yeah, i'm done with competitive FPS in general. it's a solved issue for cheaters at this point. cheats are extremely difficult to detect, new accounts are in plentiful supply, devs actively like people getting new accounts as it makes their numbers look good (not to mention bot farming accounts), the rewards for cheating are massive - you can go from a broke nobody to making a living streaming a videogame or creating ADHD tiktok shit of your l33t plays, while the punishment is irrelevant.

if you have the required lack of moral character, you have every reason to cheat and nothing is going to stop you.
    Console players are going through cronus zen which is basically a $100\~ DMA sold on a massive scale. ximming, or faking the input as a controller when you're on kb+m, is becoming more common for the aim assist and even small streamers are doing it(you can tell bc they have controller player xhair movement despite supposedly playing on kb+m).

Streaming/content creation has become main stream enough that a lot more people are doing it for money. It's no longer a hobby that you did on the side which means cheaters/bad actors are going to appear more frequently and they're going to defend with "it's how I make my living."

Modern issues require modern laws and cheating in multiplayer games should be against the law by allowing ISP providers to ban cheaters from using their service the second a registered game developer bans their IP/hardware for cheating. Game developers will never win against cheat developers so we have to make it punishable for the user of cheats as much as possible.
        i wish each CS season cost $1 to enter, then you could either win $2 by ranking up or losing it by ranking down. 

the actual monetary amount would be meaningless, but it would mean CS would come under proper gaming/gambling laws and if you got cheating you could do time.
            I just think that if ISP's were legally allowed to know what customers get banned from using a service of another companies then it would solve the cheating issue for the whole gaming industry. Someone banned in CS would carry their ban length over their entire internet. Cheating/using malicious software is already against everyone's ISP TOS...

A VPN wouldn't save them either since it's the in game account getting banned and their ISP would be notified of which one of their customers got banned for cheating using their network(no VPN can change your ISP).

We already pay a lot for internet so I don't see why this isn't possible.
                Having some sort of legislation to tackle cheating should definitely be investigated. Fines or blocking internet service should be the punishment. I believe South Korea has some laws to prevent cheating in online games. I wish somebody would take this to EU level.
As software developer myself, out of professional curiosity, I've been digging in to this cheating business too and I honestly see no easy way out of this. Plenty of great videos/documentaries out there by people who know the game and methods. Simple client side anti-cheat nowadays is nowhere near enough.

Those who are curious this is one the best videos about anti-cheats and cheating I've been able to find so far

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwzIq04vd0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwzIq04vd0M) - Hacking into Kernel Anti-Cheats: How cheaters bypass Faceit, ESEA and Vanguard anti-cheats by Unity Research.

100% recommend everyone to watch it. You'll lose hope but at least you're informed about the reality.
    making people aware of the issue with the facts and statistics is a big step though.  i'm seeing more people aware of the cheating problem now than ever before which is a good thing.  just a few years back, you literally couldn't find a single person who would believe you about there being any cheaters at all.  so the cheating thrived and almost always went unreported.

it's true that the cheaters have a bunch of big communities dedicated to cheating. maybe now that people are finally accepting the magnitude of the issue, we can also start seeing more anti-cheat communities forming.  i think higher cheating awareness of the community will also put pressure on people who are cheating to stop and/or help prevent players from picking up cheats in the first place.
    Oh dang I forgot about the micro controller cheats LOL
    This is my biggest fear as a game developer. I want to make games that people enjoy and don’t want to cheat in, but someone will always want to be better than everyone through any means necessary. It really makes me weary to see this because I’ve been developing a multiplayer game for the past little while and I’ve seen cheating become so rampant in other multiplayer games, I’m considering refactoring my codebase to implement an external anticheat like easy anticheat just because of all of this. It’s crazy but it seems every game needs that level of anticheat now
        I feel you. There are some interesting server side AI/ML solutions cooking but so far the adoption of those has been slow. [Anybrain.gg](http://Anybrain.gg) seems most promising so far, there are others popping up at regular interval. I think client side cheat detection is most likely dead at this point. Only some sort of statistical analysis/biometric profiling of game style and performance is the only way forward. Kernel 0 anti-cheats don't do shit anymore against the multitude of attack vectors available for malicious developers.
            Yeah I don’t think I’d ever consider a kernel level anticheat at all. I like the idea of server side solutions though, that way people don’t need it if they just want to play with friends they trust
Have played cs since 1.2, gave up on CSGO because cheaters. It was too obvious years ago, but I can’t imagine playing CS2, must be awful from what I see. I play Warzone DMZ with mouse and keyboard on PS5, restricted to ps5 users. It’s literally a million times more fun. I won’t be going back.

    There is a link. I'm a simple man. I upvote. Won't click it I can't read.
        And a link to a .edu domain no less. Has to be good.
            too many words but 3 pages of references, i believe whatever is being said.
    just shows how many psychopaths are really out there too.
I've been playing since 1998 beta, and I can firmly attest that cheating right now is the worst it's been in franchise history, there has never been a time where so many cheat devs are making massive bank off monthly subs to their cheats, so many cheat programs, so many cheaters ranging from ranked/comp/premier, to casual, to wing man to death match, every single mode.

There's a reason why pros were very outspoken when cs2 dropped during the first few months about how many cheaters are in premier and they just all gave up playing ranked (this hasn't happened to the scale it has in any cs).

Sure you can load up 1.6 right now or source and play against cheaters every game but it was never as bad as cs2 is.

Anything above 20k rating is unplayable due to cheaters (it's widely known that 20k+ is mostly just hvh). I managed to solo queue to global elite in 2017, and barely ran into cheaters, my biggest issue was playing against people who lived close to the server vs my 70 ping.

When the game became f2p, that's when you saw cheating becoming an epidemic but it's never been as bad as it is now. Before f2p, you mainly saw cheaters would buy the game for 10 bucks or so when it went on sale during steam sales, but they would eventually get banned from overwatch.

There has never been a time where so many bot accounts with farmed hours are selling for a dollar or less just for people to spam their cheats on. NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A TIME WITH SO MANY BOTTED HOUR ACCOUNTS SELLING FOR MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO USE TO CHEAT IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. so I really don't know what you're yapping about when you say it's not even close to being as bad as it used to be (you're likely lying for reddit karma and ego because every way to measure the amount of cheating there is proves your statement wrong).

Sure valve made prime in 2016, enabled phone verification as part of the process (no longer needed), and overwatch was in since 2013 and magicly got removed March 2023 which now is the primarily reason we see so many cheaters. The only reason people got VAC back in the day was due to overwatch, with this gone, there is nothing stopping people from cheating or being worried about being banned unless they play against fl0m when he's streaming because some valve employees love the guy and watch him all the time.

At the bare minimum, valve NEEDS to bring back overwatch to get rid of the blatant cheaters.
    Do you not remember CS before VAC was even a thing? Cheating has been around since the betas of cs, its nothing new.
         We used to have anti-cheats that took screenshots players client and uploaded them after the match to public http server. Of course in time cheaters found a way to circumvent those too but it's always the case in arms race.  
  
This was back in the days before match making services. In those days you found PCW or scrims in IRC or websites like Clanbase or ESL among others. Things were simpler back then. Community moderated itself.

There have been anti-cheats before VAC just as there has always been cheats.
    Mate has played since 1998 and thinks premier competitive is what defines CS ICANT

This is like saying back in source/1.6 that they have a cheating problem because you'd go on a shitty public server and there was a cheater connecting there one time.
        did you read anything I said? i didn't just day premier you blatant idiot.
        r/confidentlyincorrect
For CS specifically this is the worst iv seen it in 20+ years.
Valorant has working anticheat, just saying…
    I wouldn't be so sure....

        Imagine thinking an anti cheat is instant and bans everyone automatically. Of course there are cheaters you should know this for how long you've been playing. Val anti cheat is far and above way better than cs2.
    You sure?
I stopped even wanting to play this game as veteran. And not even because of the cheaters.
I've been playing this game since 1.3 in a LAN Cafe as a 13 year old. This is easily the worst state any Counter-Strike game has been. I don't know how it could've been any worse. There's literally no incentive to try and play Counter-Strike 2, anyone who does is just manipulated to play with their NFT skins,

Actually that's what this game is now, a NFT skin game, not a competitve tactical shooter anymore.
    Yeah, you must have really enjoyed the valve matchmaking in 1.3 and reasonably that's the pinnacle of CS these days too.
        You didn't need matchmaking, you played with everyone at the LAN Cafe. That was the best experience ever in Counter-Strike, let alone video games.
            What if I told you that you can still do that
                What if I told you I wasn't 13 years old anymore and worked 40 hours a week now.
                    Ha! 40 hours a week, weak sauce my man. Weak sauce.
Clearly doesn't even play the game anymore and waffling now L
Faceit has been amazing so far. I'm only a level 4.. but it's a relief to get away from premiere.
    i hear all these things about faceit being a sweaty toxic tryhard experience, but is that not the case? i've had the client for a while but never pulled the trigger on jumping in yet.
        Just don't solo Q. That's the only time I've really encountered toxicity.
like account age matters anymore.

ive seen blatant cheaters using 10+ year old accounts, probably as high as 18 at one point.
    I agree but I would say the majority of cheaters are level 1 accounts.  It would be an easy way to remove a large percentage.  Anyway,  hopefully Valve have a better plan than me!
    Account age or number of hours do not matter. 13k hours, 10 year badge account aimbotting blatantly in every other lobby. They are stolen/bought accounts. I wonder why even bother buying old account at this point if you intend to cheat. Matters none. You ain't fooling anyone. People with experience notice trigger bot/wh within few rounds.
The worst thing is that there has been zero communication from Valve to address the issue. They've buried their heads in the sand. It's ridiculous.
Thanks for the tip now I just have to convince my entire friends list to go Faceit. Or not bother and play other games.
You don't have to pay for Faceit?  
Free version and paid versions.  
Both of which require Faceit AC to run to play games.
Less cheaters, more Smurfs. Outcome is almost the same. You get stomped by someone you have no chance of beating. I'm level 9 currently and I have a level 5-7 guy in almost every game that top frags. Level 2 steam account, no medals, no other games, just cs and he plays like 3000 ELO.     
Great experience all around.
    Smurfs are a problem but you can report them and they get banned and you get your ELO back
        If you can prove it sure.
You can still cheat on faceit you just can't spin around like a bladeblade, since they actually have a mod team.
    And even if you lose your game, if you are seen wallhacking, aimbotting, or anything other form of cheating, you will get banned by said mod team.  
Elo will be reinstated to the losing team and the winning team will have their winning elo taken away.

Unlike MM where you don't get your elo back, Faceit you do.
        Yeah but people with be sneaky there which I mean I guess it's better since you can't tell. And it probably won't make you question why you play said game.

I thought valve claimed they give back elo when someone does get banned?
            Trust me, I've played against people who I thought MIGHT be cheating, watched the GOTV back and have seen it looked like they had walls so reported them.  
Faceit admins are good with detecting if someone is cheating.  
Hundreds or thousands of hours, you know if someone is holding an angle or just keeping the outline of a player on their screen.  
Many many many things to look into and not just if he locked onto that persons head...

Radar hacks and wallhacks are both used.

I haven't seen anything claiming Valve give elo back, I might be mistaken though.  
I have gone against spinbotters but haven't seen elo come back in premier.

In Faceit, you will always get your elo back if someone on the opposition is cheating.
Skill ceiling in 1.6 was way higher, wall bangs and much more movement skills required. Also better netcode + ac (ESL with passport registration). 

Not sure if you ever played it.
    It didn't need any more NECESSARY movement skills than GO or 2. Wallbangs through whole maps are exactly a bug (because it has never been an intended gameplay feature obviously), along with double crouching, grenade damage through the walls, defusing A from B site on Nuke, quick silencer trick, huge amount of map bugs, not working flashbangs/smokes (you needed two smokes so they would work somehow) and tons of other BUGS. Also server crashes due to messed config files and a lot of other "cool" things. CS 1.6 has always been a shitfest. CS2 is far away from it now. It's A LOT more polished and a lot more competitive game.
        Some call it bugs, some call it opportunities who needed to be mastered. 

Less skills and opportunities now, consequentially a worse game with lower skill ceiling.
            Skill ceiling isn't lower because it's still a competitive game with a lot of variables to remember, they just make more sense. You need to rely more on your gamesense and aim to win in CSGO than on ability to exploit unintended bugs, which is exactly why CSGO is ultimately a better game. It's both more fun to play and (most importantly) more fun to watch. Same goes to CS2.
                So simpler game isn't equal to lower skill ceiling, understood. :)

Guess you're just not playing CS long enough to notice how shit it is nowadays.
                    I play CS long enough to notice how GOOD it is nowadays. Not only I played 1.6, I hosted local tournaments. Hosting servers is even bigger shitshow than just playing the game btw.

CSGO/2 is not simpler. You have to remember what you can wallbang and what not. You have to be a lot more careful through smokes. Spraying, spray transfers. Different methods of throwing grenades. Knowing when you can noscope with AWP and when you can't. Knowing how to move scoped on (quickscoping is another 1.6 unintended functionality). And a lot more things that require skills AND make the game more interesting to watch.
You're lying and wrong and I will prove this.

I've been playing since 1998 beta, and I can firmly attest that cheating right now is the worst it's been in franchise history, there has never been a time where so many cheat devs are making massive bank off monthly subs to their cheats, so many cheat programs, so many cheaters ranging from ranked/comp/premier, to casual, to wing man to death match, every single mode.

    It has nothing to do with the state of the game. If CS 1.6 had paid skins + cases + drops, it would crawl with hackers that just pull down servers. Because it WAS a bugfest. Trust me, I hosted multiple CS 1.6 servers in the past. It's a nightmare.
        in cs2 they literally can take down servers with their cheats, its been documented already where hackers kick people out of games or shut their games down.

Sure maybe 1.6 was buggy but all games were buggy but in a better state than what AAA devs manage to send out now (I.e. meet deadlines and targets and fix game later ex. cyberpunk).

Cs1.6 was niche, even if they had paid skins drops and cases it wouldn't mean anything because not many people gamed as they do now.

I thought you were talking about cheating specifically, not just bugs or w.e. Cs2 has had its fair share of bugs, to the point there was a huge scare about RCE and people getting their IPs stolen just from playing official servers.
90% of games past 15k rank have cheaters in it. It's over.
The size of the communities do not even compare. Also completely different game modes and game loop. Not to mention eSports.
Tempting... I still have more hours in that game than all the other games I've ever played combined by my last calculation.
they should release a few more cases and then just buy out faceit to use as their competitive system 😭😭😭

  
\^ sarcasm, valve would never do anything that would help their games
I have plenty of other drugs to keep me occupied. This game ain't worth it anymore. 4/5 games has cheaters beyond 15k rank.
In mainstream gaming we don't really need a perfect AC, but let's start by having one that at the very least catches the script-kiddies.

And this isn't a small indie company, but they still have problems with sv_cheats being available on public servers. I mean, that's just neglect. I think this is stuff we struggled with in 2000-2005 ish. Would really think that it was a thing of the past.
    Do remember that they literally just built a new engine from the ground up. It was not tested enough before release, granted. But shit will happen
        The "new" engine that's been out since 2015
            No the new engine that they released with CS2. Nice bait
                My dude, cs2 runs on source 2, which came out in 2015 with dota 2...
You're showing your age there lol. CS didn't exist, even as a mod until 99. It didn't come out of beta stage until mid 2000. I bought it retail in 2001.
No
Plenty of other games nowadays to spend my time. They all have cheating problem but CS2 is ridiculous.
I never mean Dota2
That how bad CS is it's pushed me back to Dota 2 aswell.
    Same haha
    Worse, it pushed me back to LoL
        LoL will always drag you back, it's not CS's fault that you signed a deal with Teemo.
            My name is actually Timo. I am the devil
        I still struggle with LoL my brain just can't take it all in. I have way too many hours on Dota and I'm still learning :)
I switched to faceit and so far zero cheater encounters 
    Faceit is so hot breath nerd though.  I have a life. 
        What does that even mean? If you don’t want to sweat the low levels of faceit should feel very casual lol and if you’re here reading about premier and cheaters it’s basically the same experience  -cheaters
        Well you complain in MM that your team mates are poo, then play faceit and realize they're too good. 

I guess just wait for danger zone...
            Did u just say good teammates in faceit?😂 im lvl 8 and constantly get teamed with lvl 4-5s going 1-18 in games
                Skill issue
        doubts
    i would but i’m running off linux on my steam deck. n if i use wine to use faceit they’ll ban me…
        Are you playing with gyro?
            keyboard and mouse
            only reason keyboard n lmouse is just better is really just button layout i guess you could set up your own button layout on the deck to have all the right buttons and there are community layouts but half of them never worked for me but i’ve played many fps 3ps with gyro and its so fire fr
    That's the best thing you can do. Aswell as having actual missions to earn points for rewards, which is something CS should have had since the beginning. Playing MM after MM for no other reason than to change the colour of your service medal a max of three times in a year is absolutely rediculous.
    Don’t you love it how people bitch about cheaters in Premier (which I understand) and then they bitch about not being good enough to play faceit? Makes you wonder if people like OP are even running into cheaters or if they just fucking suck
Fuck no!
    There are literally zero cheaters in faceit. Theyre all just better than you. Getting reported and accused of being a cheater in faceit is a compliment
        If u actually think there are no cheaters on faceit someone gaslit you.
        i cheat on face it. so do all my friends. there's entire groups of us with private cheats. we just do so legit not like these dummies in premiere that don't have any game sense and go full spin.
            Well then fuck you. and I really hope they release hardware bans or whatever the hell they would need to boot you off this shit. I work hella hard to learn this damn game and it's so fucking lame that you decide to play this way. It took me years to get as good as I am today and you just shit on everyone's hard work. Totally fucking lame.
                He’s delusional lol and probly trolling. Let’s hope it’s the latter.
                lol. buddy. im global elite without hacks. I only use them to combat other cheaters. I've been playing since 1999. I also hope they do something about it
                    Loser, you just rage when you get pooped on more than likely.  What a stupid take lol. Actual mouth breather right here.
                        lol. leave it to the liberal pussies to run their mouth about people they don't know
            You are the worst kind of cheater not even the balls to go full spin
                That's a nonsensical statement. It doesn't take balls to go full spin. That would be a lack of intelligence. lol. 

besides, I just use shams only when visible because I'm color blind and sound ESP. So if I hear you, It just makes a little footstep blink through the wall during the sound. So I have a little more accurate idea of where the sound came from. 

I'm still trying to actually have fun here lol. you get real worked up though don't you dummy. lol
                    Bro you are the cheating loser in here not me. I'm actually having fun smashing loser like you with pure skill
                        lol. you sound like the eunuch bragging about how big their dick is 😂😆.
                            Atleast I wear my small pp with proud and don't try to extend it with 30$ trojans
If you play around 7k-15k prime the game is playable with minimal issues. Higher than that tho…
    So what has happened to make cheating so much more prevalent?
        Its always been prevalent at higher ratings? People have realised nobody gets banned for cheating so now they just do it super obviously
        Valve had some issues with the anticheat so they basically turned it off, plus there is a console command allowing players to run sv_cheats cvar on any server they please, cpmp premier etc so the cheating is just out of hand, rage hackers everywhere.
Don't listen to people on this sub. This is the wrong sub. This is the cs2 sub where everybody hates the game. In reality everyone still loves it considering its still setting records. (Check the global offensive reddit. It's the one people actually use because everyone here is a drooling idiot.

This is an echo chamber for people who continue to play this game after 6 months of complaining like idiots, instead of just quitting when they first started saying the game is unplayable.
You just don’t know how to play the game. The cheaters are either low elo boosting people or high elo using undetected and obscure cheats. No one mid range elo is cheating. Everyone is just relatively good. Different things got them their, some people can just aim their way up there while others are good at reads gamesense and timings. You probably just got bad timings and determined that they’re cheating.
    Are you trying to say 2200 isn't high elo and is actually mid range? Thats 200 elo into level 10. I usually sit around 2400 and have cracked into top 1000 many times. I know how to play the game lol.
        Yeah that’s mid elo. I say this as a 2200 player.
            Well if you assume w0nderful sits around ~4800 as #1 (if the tracking sites are correct), this statement is, technically,  true
                People who get an ego at 2k elo are jokes. I’m always learning. I don’t mind the dvs
    Bruh what a comment
Nah. I played 1600 matches and I still haven’t met a blatant cheater. Maybe I’m just lucky. My highest elo is 2700 and currently at 2300.
    You quite literally won't find a blatant cheater so I believe you. Blatant cheating will get you banned on the first real report. You'll only find legit cheaters in faceit, and typically that just means they will have more info than they should. It will feel unlucky, you won't know with certainty.
        At that point I just don’t care. Either they were just good or cheating I won’t be able to tell the difference.
it's a 3rd party site with its own servers, system and anticheat. but I generally can't recommend it to newer players. it's extremely tryhard and even more toxic than cs matchmaking. much higher skill ceiling, generally. and just a lot less fun since half the people on there think they're gonna play at the next major (they ain't).

but if you're very competitive, then go for it
    super interesting, shit thanks for the info mate. tried looking around and just thought it was like a software that stopped other people from hacking which didn’t make sense to me
    I’m only playing in a clan and can only deny the toxicity and the try hard part but I’m French so idk how it works for you
google it you'll figure it out i believe in you
Mythic league is your new home
    Or valor-🤮
Can confirm (20 year steam account).

I didn't play csgo till operation riptide.   Was surprised at the amount of cheaters in it, for it's last year before cs2 launched. 

Cs2 has now been out for somentime and it's basically unplayable. Cheating problem is worst it's been in 20 years.
Yeah I can't understand it either, if I don't have challenge in a pvp fps, it gets boring, because what I like about these games is learning and feeling you are getting better.
If it's just for lol, I prefer single player games then.

But I know people who play every game on easy because they just want to enjoy the context, though for fps... There isn't much content, so I suppose they just feel their egoes stroked even if under the surface they know they are just cheating and bullying honest players
    I totally agree, and also dont understand why ppl cheat. Also a 20y vet here.  
Although, now there is a new big detail on the game, Valve made a Top players list. Many are using cheats to "be" on the Top, and see their names there. That's why ppl say that is impossible to play on higher rating points matches.  
So, basically valve gave cheaters one more reason to hack.    
Since the CS2 was launched, and after all theses months, everyone's see how many top10 players were cheaters.

So I do agree, that, more then ever, CS is full of cheaters. The Top ranking system, push cheaters to be, more and more agressive, in order to reach the Top. Even that being a fake Top... But they dont care. They only want to see their names on the top.
        The problem is cheaters are also on non-competitive, I get one every few games. Some are blatant with autoaim or wh, some are less blatant and activate some autoaim thing after first-second shot (you see it clearly because they are spraying with AK and their first two shots completely miss the target, third moves the crosshair very fast on head and bang!).

I managed to have one banned by telling all players to report and then kick, he tried to come back in the game but it said it was banned (first time I see a real time ban on CS!).

But often players are either lazy, complicit (either because they are friend or because they are just shitty people that prefer to have the botter on their side of the match), or just don't report (or don't know hot to do that).
Same with cheating in everything. Work, sports or whatever. Some ppl just don’t care. It’s the same with going to the gym. 30 day tren challenge on TikTok isn’t because people wants to put in the grind. Ppl always look for the short cut, the new method no one knows bla bla. It’s all the same

Since the brain isn’t fully developed till 25 a 14 year old by natural explanation can’t think of consequences or w/e
Console players are going through cronus zen which is basically a $100\~ DMA sold on a massive scale. ximming, or faking the input as a controller when you're on kb+m, is becoming more common for the aim assist and even small streamers are doing it(you can tell bc they have controller player xhair movement despite supposedly playing on kb+m).

Streaming/content creation has become main stream enough that a lot more people are doing it for money. It's no longer a hobby that you did on the side which means cheaters/bad actors are going to appear more frequently and they're going to defend with "it's how I make my living."

Modern issues require modern laws and cheating in multiplayer games should be against the law by allowing ISP providers to ban cheaters from using their service the second a registered game developer bans their IP/hardware for cheating. Game developers will never win against cheat developers so we have to make it punishable for the user of cheats as much as possible.
    i wish each CS season cost $1 to enter, then you could either win $2 by ranking up or losing it by ranking down. 

the actual monetary amount would be meaningless, but it would mean CS would come under proper gaming/gambling laws and if you got cheating you could do time.
        I just think that if ISP's were legally allowed to know what customers get banned from using a service of another companies then it would solve the cheating issue for the whole gaming industry. Someone banned in CS would carry their ban length over their entire internet. Cheating/using malicious software is already against everyone's ISP TOS...

A VPN wouldn't save them either since it's the in game account getting banned and their ISP would be notified of which one of their customers got banned for cheating using their network(no VPN can change your ISP).

We already pay a lot for internet so I don't see why this isn't possible.
            Having some sort of legislation to tackle cheating should definitely be investigated. Fines or blocking internet service should be the punishment. I believe South Korea has some laws to prevent cheating in online games. I wish somebody would take this to EU level.
making people aware of the issue with the facts and statistics is a big step though.  i'm seeing more people aware of the cheating problem now than ever before which is a good thing.  just a few years back, you literally couldn't find a single person who would believe you about there being any cheaters at all.  so the cheating thrived and almost always went unreported.

it's true that the cheaters have a bunch of big communities dedicated to cheating. maybe now that people are finally accepting the magnitude of the issue, we can also start seeing more anti-cheat communities forming.  i think higher cheating awareness of the community will also put pressure on people who are cheating to stop and/or help prevent players from picking up cheats in the first place.
Oh dang I forgot about the micro controller cheats LOL
This is my biggest fear as a game developer. I want to make games that people enjoy and don’t want to cheat in, but someone will always want to be better than everyone through any means necessary. It really makes me weary to see this because I’ve been developing a multiplayer game for the past little while and I’ve seen cheating become so rampant in other multiplayer games, I’m considering refactoring my codebase to implement an external anticheat like easy anticheat just because of all of this. It’s crazy but it seems every game needs that level of anticheat now
    I feel you. There are some interesting server side AI/ML solutions cooking but so far the adoption of those has been slow. [Anybrain.gg](http://Anybrain.gg) seems most promising so far, there are others popping up at regular interval. I think client side cheat detection is most likely dead at this point. Only some sort of statistical analysis/biometric profiling of game style and performance is the only way forward. Kernel 0 anti-cheats don't do shit anymore against the multitude of attack vectors available for malicious developers.
        Yeah I don’t think I’d ever consider a kernel level anticheat at all. I like the idea of server side solutions though, that way people don’t need it if they just want to play with friends they trust
There is a link. I'm a simple man. I upvote. Won't click it I can't read.
    And a link to a .edu domain no less. Has to be good.
        too many words but 3 pages of references, i believe whatever is being said.
just shows how many psychopaths are really out there too.
Do you not remember CS before VAC was even a thing? Cheating has been around since the betas of cs, its nothing new.
     We used to have anti-cheats that took screenshots players client and uploaded them after the match to public http server. Of course in time cheaters found a way to circumvent those too but it's always the case in arms race.  
  
This was back in the days before match making services. In those days you found PCW or scrims in IRC or websites like Clanbase or ESL among others. Things were simpler back then. Community moderated itself.

There have been anti-cheats before VAC just as there has always been cheats.
Mate has played since 1998 and thinks premier competitive is what defines CS ICANT

This is like saying back in source/1.6 that they have a cheating problem because you'd go on a shitty public server and there was a cheater connecting there one time.
    did you read anything I said? i didn't just day premier you blatant idiot.
    r/confidentlyincorrect
I wouldn't be so sure....

    Imagine thinking an anti cheat is instant and bans everyone automatically. Of course there are cheaters you should know this for how long you've been playing. Val anti cheat is far and above way better than cs2.
You sure?
Yeah, you must have really enjoyed the valve matchmaking in 1.3 and reasonably that's the pinnacle of CS these days too.
    You didn't need matchmaking, you played with everyone at the LAN Cafe. That was the best experience ever in Counter-Strike, let alone video games.
        What if I told you that you can still do that
            What if I told you I wasn't 13 years old anymore and worked 40 hours a week now.
                Ha! 40 hours a week, weak sauce my man. Weak sauce.
i hear all these things about faceit being a sweaty toxic tryhard experience, but is that not the case? i've had the client for a while but never pulled the trigger on jumping in yet.
    Just don't solo Q. That's the only time I've really encountered toxicity.
I agree but I would say the majority of cheaters are level 1 accounts.  It would be an easy way to remove a large percentage.  Anyway,  hopefully Valve have a better plan than me!
Account age or number of hours do not matter. 13k hours, 10 year badge account aimbotting blatantly in every other lobby. They are stolen/bought accounts. I wonder why even bother buying old account at this point if you intend to cheat. Matters none. You ain't fooling anyone. People with experience notice trigger bot/wh within few rounds.
Smurfs are a problem but you can report them and they get banned and you get your ELO back
    If you can prove it sure.
And even if you lose your game, if you are seen wallhacking, aimbotting, or anything other form of cheating, you will get banned by said mod team.  
Elo will be reinstated to the losing team and the winning team will have their winning elo taken away.

Unlike MM where you don't get your elo back, Faceit you do.
    Yeah but people with be sneaky there which I mean I guess it's better since you can't tell. And it probably won't make you question why you play said game.

I thought valve claimed they give back elo when someone does get banned?
        Trust me, I've played against people who I thought MIGHT be cheating, watched the GOTV back and have seen it looked like they had walls so reported them.  
Faceit admins are good with detecting if someone is cheating.  
Hundreds or thousands of hours, you know if someone is holding an angle or just keeping the outline of a player on their screen.  
Many many many things to look into and not just if he locked onto that persons head...

Radar hacks and wallhacks are both used.

I haven't seen anything claiming Valve give elo back, I might be mistaken though.  
I have gone against spinbotters but haven't seen elo come back in premier.

In Faceit, you will always get your elo back if someone on the opposition is cheating.
It didn't need any more NECESSARY movement skills than GO or 2. Wallbangs through whole maps are exactly a bug (because it has never been an intended gameplay feature obviously), along with double crouching, grenade damage through the walls, defusing A from B site on Nuke, quick silencer trick, huge amount of map bugs, not working flashbangs/smokes (you needed two smokes so they would work somehow) and tons of other BUGS. Also server crashes due to messed config files and a lot of other "cool" things. CS 1.6 has always been a shitfest. CS2 is far away from it now. It's A LOT more polished and a lot more competitive game.
    Some call it bugs, some call it opportunities who needed to be mastered. 

Less skills and opportunities now, consequentially a worse game with lower skill ceiling.
        Skill ceiling isn't lower because it's still a competitive game with a lot of variables to remember, they just make more sense. You need to rely more on your gamesense and aim to win in CSGO than on ability to exploit unintended bugs, which is exactly why CSGO is ultimately a better game. It's both more fun to play and (most importantly) more fun to watch. Same goes to CS2.
            So simpler game isn't equal to lower skill ceiling, understood. :)

Guess you're just not playing CS long enough to notice how shit it is nowadays.
                I play CS long enough to notice how GOOD it is nowadays. Not only I played 1.6, I hosted local tournaments. Hosting servers is even bigger shitshow than just playing the game btw.

CSGO/2 is not simpler. You have to remember what you can wallbang and what not. You have to be a lot more careful through smokes. Spraying, spray transfers. Different methods of throwing grenades. Knowing when you can noscope with AWP and when you can't. Knowing how to move scoped on (quickscoping is another 1.6 unintended functionality). And a lot more things that require skills AND make the game more interesting to watch.
It has nothing to do with the state of the game. If CS 1.6 had paid skins + cases + drops, it would crawl with hackers that just pull down servers. Because it WAS a bugfest. Trust me, I hosted multiple CS 1.6 servers in the past. It's a nightmare.
    in cs2 they literally can take down servers with their cheats, its been documented already where hackers kick people out of games or shut their games down.

Sure maybe 1.6 was buggy but all games were buggy but in a better state than what AAA devs manage to send out now (I.e. meet deadlines and targets and fix game later ex. cyberpunk).

Cs1.6 was niche, even if they had paid skins drops and cases it wouldn't mean anything because not many people gamed as they do now.

I thought you were talking about cheating specifically, not just bugs or w.e. Cs2 has had its fair share of bugs, to the point there was a huge scare about RCE and people getting their IPs stolen just from playing official servers.
Do remember that they literally just built a new engine from the ground up. It was not tested enough before release, granted. But shit will happen
    The "new" engine that's been out since 2015
        No the new engine that they released with CS2. Nice bait
            My dude, cs2 runs on source 2, which came out in 2015 with dota 2...
Same haha
Worse, it pushed me back to LoL
    LoL will always drag you back, it's not CS's fault that you signed a deal with Teemo.
        My name is actually Timo. I am the devil
    I still struggle with LoL my brain just can't take it all in. I have way too many hours on Dota and I'm still learning :)
Faceit is so hot breath nerd though.  I have a life. 
    What does that even mean? If you don’t want to sweat the low levels of faceit should feel very casual lol and if you’re here reading about premier and cheaters it’s basically the same experience  -cheaters
    Well you complain in MM that your team mates are poo, then play faceit and realize they're too good. 

I guess just wait for danger zone...
        Did u just say good teammates in faceit?😂 im lvl 8 and constantly get teamed with lvl 4-5s going 1-18 in games
            Skill issue
    doubts
i would but i’m running off linux on my steam deck. n if i use wine to use faceit they’ll ban me…
    Are you playing with gyro?
        keyboard and mouse
        only reason keyboard n lmouse is just better is really just button layout i guess you could set up your own button layout on the deck to have all the right buttons and there are community layouts but half of them never worked for me but i’ve played many fps 3ps with gyro and its so fire fr
That's the best thing you can do. Aswell as having actual missions to earn points for rewards, which is something CS should have had since the beginning. Playing MM after MM for no other reason than to change the colour of your service medal a max of three times in a year is absolutely rediculous.
Don’t you love it how people bitch about cheaters in Premier (which I understand) and then they bitch about not being good enough to play faceit? Makes you wonder if people like OP are even running into cheaters or if they just fucking suck
There are literally zero cheaters in faceit. Theyre all just better than you. Getting reported and accused of being a cheater in faceit is a compliment
    If u actually think there are no cheaters on faceit someone gaslit you.
    i cheat on face it. so do all my friends. there's entire groups of us with private cheats. we just do so legit not like these dummies in premiere that don't have any game sense and go full spin.
        Well then fuck you. and I really hope they release hardware bans or whatever the hell they would need to boot you off this shit. I work hella hard to learn this damn game and it's so fucking lame that you decide to play this way. It took me years to get as good as I am today and you just shit on everyone's hard work. Totally fucking lame.
            He’s delusional lol and probly trolling. Let’s hope it’s the latter.
            lol. buddy. im global elite without hacks. I only use them to combat other cheaters. I've been playing since 1999. I also hope they do something about it
                Loser, you just rage when you get pooped on more than likely.  What a stupid take lol. Actual mouth breather right here.
                    lol. leave it to the liberal pussies to run their mouth about people they don't know
        You are the worst kind of cheater not even the balls to go full spin
            That's a nonsensical statement. It doesn't take balls to go full spin. That would be a lack of intelligence. lol. 

besides, I just use shams only when visible because I'm color blind and sound ESP. So if I hear you, It just makes a little footstep blink through the wall during the sound. So I have a little more accurate idea of where the sound came from. 

I'm still trying to actually have fun here lol. you get real worked up though don't you dummy. lol
                Bro you are the cheating loser in here not me. I'm actually having fun smashing loser like you with pure skill
                    lol. you sound like the eunuch bragging about how big their dick is 😂😆.
                        Atleast I wear my small pp with proud and don't try to extend it with 30$ trojans
So what has happened to make cheating so much more prevalent?
    Its always been prevalent at higher ratings? People have realised nobody gets banned for cheating so now they just do it super obviously
    Valve had some issues with the anticheat so they basically turned it off, plus there is a console command allowing players to run sv_cheats cvar on any server they please, cpmp premier etc so the cheating is just out of hand, rage hackers everywhere.
Are you trying to say 2200 isn't high elo and is actually mid range? Thats 200 elo into level 10. I usually sit around 2400 and have cracked into top 1000 many times. I know how to play the game lol.
    Yeah that’s mid elo. I say this as a 2200 player.
        Well if you assume w0nderful sits around ~4800 as #1 (if the tracking sites are correct), this statement is, technically,  true
            People who get an ego at 2k elo are jokes. I’m always learning. I don’t mind the dvs
Bruh what a comment
You quite literally won't find a blatant cheater so I believe you. Blatant cheating will get you banned on the first real report. You'll only find legit cheaters in faceit, and typically that just means they will have more info than they should. It will feel unlucky, you won't know with certainty.
    At that point I just don’t care. Either they were just good or cheating I won’t be able to tell the difference.
super interesting, shit thanks for the info mate. tried looking around and just thought it was like a software that stopped other people from hacking which didn’t make sense to me
I’m only playing in a clan and can only deny the toxicity and the try hard part but I’m French so idk how it works for you

        That's a nonsensical statement. It doesn't take balls to go full spin. That would be a lack of intelligence. lol. 

besides, I just use shams only when visible because I'm color blind and sound ESP. So if I hear you, It just makes a little footstep blink through the wall during the sound. So I have a little more accurate idea of where the sound came from. 

I'm still trying to actually have fun here lol. you get real worked up though don't you dummy. lol
            Bro you are the cheating loser in here not me. I'm actually having fun smashing loser like you with pure skill
                lol. you sound like the eunuch bragging about how big their dick is 😂😆.
                    Atleast I wear my small pp with proud and don't try to extend it with 30$ trojans
Its always been prevalent at higher ratings? People have realised nobody gets banned for cheating so now they just do it super obviously
Valve had some issues with the anticheat so they basically turned it off, plus there is a console command allowing players to run sv_cheats cvar on any server they please, cpmp premier etc so the cheating is just out of hand, rage hackers everywhere.
Yeah that’s mid elo. I say this as a 2200 player.
    Well if you assume w0nderful sits around ~4800 as #1 (if the tracking sites are correct), this statement is, technically,  true
        People who get an ego at 2k elo are jokes. I’m always learning. I don’t mind the dvs
At that point I just don’t care. Either they were just good or cheating I won’t be able to tell the difference.
The problem is cheaters are also on non-competitive, I get one every few games. Some are blatant with autoaim or wh, some are less blatant and activate some autoaim thing after first-second shot (you see it clearly because they are spraying with AK and their first two shots completely miss the target, third moves the crosshair very fast on head and bang!).

I managed to have one banned by telling all players to report and then kick, he tried to come back in the game but it said it was banned (first time I see a real time ban on CS!).

But often players are either lazy, complicit (either because they are friend or because they are just shitty people that prefer to have the botter on their side of the match), or just don't report (or don't know hot to do that).
I just think that if ISP's were legally allowed to know what customers get banned from using a service of another companies then it would solve the cheating issue for the whole gaming industry. Someone banned in CS would carry their ban length over their entire internet. Cheating/using malicious software is already against everyone's ISP TOS...

A VPN wouldn't save them either since it's the in game account getting banned and their ISP would be notified of which one of their customers got banned for cheating using their network(no VPN can change your ISP).

We already pay a lot for internet so I don't see why this isn't possible.
    Having some sort of legislation to tackle cheating should definitely be investigated. Fines or blocking internet service should be the punishment. I believe South Korea has some laws to prevent cheating in online games. I wish somebody would take this to EU level.
Yeah I don’t think I’d ever consider a kernel level anticheat at all. I like the idea of server side solutions though, that way people don’t need it if they just want to play with friends they trust
too many words but 3 pages of references, i believe whatever is being said.
What if I told you that you can still do that
    What if I told you I wasn't 13 years old anymore and worked 40 hours a week now.
        Ha! 40 hours a week, weak sauce my man. Weak sauce.
Trust me, I've played against people who I thought MIGHT be cheating, watched the GOTV back and have seen it looked like they had walls so reported them.  
Faceit admins are good with detecting if someone is cheating.  
Hundreds or thousands of hours, you know if someone is holding an angle or just keeping the outline of a player on their screen.  
Many many many things to look into and not just if he locked onto that persons head...

Radar hacks and wallhacks are both used.

I haven't seen anything claiming Valve give elo back, I might be mistaken though.  
I have gone against spinbotters but haven't seen elo come back in premier.

In Faceit, you will always get your elo back if someone on the opposition is cheating.
Skill ceiling isn't lower because it's still a competitive game with a lot of variables to remember, they just make more sense. You need to rely more on your gamesense and aim to win in CSGO than on ability to exploit unintended bugs, which is exactly why CSGO is ultimately a better game. It's both more fun to play and (most importantly) more fun to watch. Same goes to CS2.
    So simpler game isn't equal to lower skill ceiling, understood. :)

Guess you're just not playing CS long enough to notice how shit it is nowadays.
        I play CS long enough to notice how GOOD it is nowadays. Not only I played 1.6, I hosted local tournaments. Hosting servers is even bigger shitshow than just playing the game btw.

CSGO/2 is not simpler. You have to remember what you can wallbang and what not. You have to be a lot more careful through smokes. Spraying, spray transfers. Different methods of throwing grenades. Knowing when you can noscope with AWP and when you can't. Knowing how to move scoped on (quickscoping is another 1.6 unintended functionality). And a lot more things that require skills AND make the game more interesting to watch.
No the new engine that they released with CS2. Nice bait
    My dude, cs2 runs on source 2, which came out in 2015 with dota 2...
My name is actually Timo. I am the devil
Did u just say good teammates in faceit?😂 im lvl 8 and constantly get teamed with lvl 4-5s going 1-18 in games
    Skill issue
keyboard and mouse
only reason keyboard n lmouse is just better is really just button layout i guess you could set up your own button layout on the deck to have all the right buttons and there are community layouts but half of them never worked for me but i’ve played many fps 3ps with gyro and its so fire fr
Well then fuck you. and I really hope they release hardware bans or whatever the hell they would need to boot you off this shit. I work hella hard to learn this damn game and it's so fucking lame that you decide to play this way. It took me years to get as good as I am today and you just shit on everyone's hard work. Totally fucking lame.
    He’s delusional lol and probly trolling. Let’s hope it’s the latter.
    lol. buddy. im global elite without hacks. I only use them to combat other cheaters. I've been playing since 1999. I also hope they do something about it
        Loser, you just rage when you get pooped on more than likely.  What a stupid take lol. Actual mouth breather right here.
