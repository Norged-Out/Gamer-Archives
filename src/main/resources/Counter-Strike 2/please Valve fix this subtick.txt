[[please Valve fix this subtick]]





Is this demo? Not defending the shitty subtick system, but the demo footage is always messy.
    Just checked again, not a demo, but spectating a teammate, that's probably why it's severely unsynced?
        Wouldn't be surprised if that is actually what happened though. CS3 when?
            wdym, i love Cheater-Strike 2.
                My favorite is when people call someone cheaters because they don't understand team communication. Just last night someone accused our top frag for knowing a guy was mini when I was inside mini and could hear him scoping in.
                    Cheaters ruin games that they’re not in, too. In Valorant if someone hits a couple crazy shots and has some good luck, it’s more likely they got lucky and have skill so people don’t accuse them of cheating. 

In CS2 it’s more likely they’re cheating, especially at anything other than the highest of trust factors. 

So people rationally suspect other people are cheating when they’re not. Merely the existence of cheaters in other games or a user’s past games ruins their future games as it’s not fun to think you’re playing against a cheater regardless.
                    congrats you got called cheater for once. dont invalidate others experiences cause your ego got pushed once
                        Nobody called me a cheater you fucking trog. Read it again and use the working part this time.

                It is caused by the shitty subtick system. Remove that, bring 128. I am a genius, Valve should hire me.
                    This stuff happened in CSGO too.
            You get what you see, right?
        yes, the teammate had probably high ping, and in their screen they hit the collat although other people don't see it
            Nope, no high ping. I was playing at 40/50 ping and teammate at 20.
                well, maybe in that precise moment their ping went up, or idk why could it be, but i believe he must've seen the collat hit, bc that's how subtick works
                First, this has nothing to do with subtick. Second, you’re a spectator, this has no effect on gameplay. 

This GIF is incredibly low quality, I have no idea what you did to mess that up so badly. So i’m unable to really count the frames to get any decent estimate as to how much time passed since their heads were overlapping. 

You were at 50 ping, teammate at 20, and let’s say enemies were also at 20.

It goes from server to your teammate, that’s 20ms, it goes back to the server, another 20ms, it goes from server back to you, 50ms. That’s 90ms right there. And the last 50ms is merely for a spectator and the sever doesn’t care because it doesn’t affect gameplay so it might not prioritize your view right away. Your teammate will have lag compensation, but there is no lag comp for spectators. As long as your teammate saw overlapping heads then it is working as expected. That’s true for any multiplayer game in existence, and Valve can’t change physics.
                    game is shit this was never happening in csgo but in cs2 its almost every game why are you defending it with your nerdy analitics or whatever are you that much delusional, i am 3300 elo on faceit and i never met anyone above 3k elo on faceit who say that cs2 is good optimized game, game is shit and only you noobs can like it
                        This definitely still happened in CSGO.

I’m not saying CS2 doesn’t have netcode issues, they do, and it’s not tuned to the level that CSGO was. 

This however is not an example of that.
                    Chill bro, chill. If this game seems legit and perfectly playable for you then okay.  The majority of the community doesnt like this.
                        You’re a spectator, this had no effect on your game play.

You are not in the majority, spectator delay is nothing new and exists in every game because it’s basic physics.
                            okay bro, xd
        still thats not normal brah
    subtick is possibly what awarded the killer the well-deserved double kill.
        well-deserved? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
            most likely, yes, he fired when they aligned on his screen so, well-deserved. even though thats not what you see here because spectate is not accurate and has never been even in csgo. dont let your hate cloud your brain.
                This. The spectate is delayed. The player actually shot when both T's were aligned.
                Yes. I agree with this guy. It was well deserved. Subtick system fixes the problem of bullets not hitting where they should in CS:GO
                yes, he "must" have clicked his mouse right as they lined up, *assuming this still works as intended.*  
Although probably still somewhat off from what we see from this spectator
                tbh fair but most likely we will never know if that was a subtick issue or a lucky shot
                    true but in theory it should be possible to post-process a demo to obtain a universally correct demo. maybe we will get there
    Even if it is, sub-tick is bad right now, I’m dying AFTER I’ve gone behind the corner (multiple occasions). And most recently, I’m in a very tight space turning the corner, at the same time enemy was also…at point blank range I fired 4 shots at center mass (AK)…only one hit! There was nowhere else for the shots to go but in him.
        Same happened all the time in csgo, the behind wall, and stuff in this post is just lag compansation.
        [deleted]
            Ok. How? Please elaborate.
    Nope, its not a demo.
i'm just imagining someone posting this with the title "why wasn't that a hit!?" and the shot wouldn't have hit.   
"omg you were moving"   
"crosshair still blurry"   
"your crosshair was not even on the enemy"  
...
    Shot 1-5: clearly missed.
    True. This sub has a good amount of brain dead people who love to suck valve off.
        Yeah, you only have to see the people comments defending valve sht, idk what happens in people's head honestly
I see lag
    But the shot still shouldn’t hit because CrOsS HaiR WaS BLurrY?
    as others said, he's spectating that apparently isn't synced with game for some reason.
        >apparently isn't synced with game for some reason.

spectating with network latency will always be behind the live game state of any given person.

On the teammates side, locally he probably did see them entirely lined up and clicked correctly. But the earliest OP's game can possibly know that the shot hit is after the teammates game sends info to the server and the server relays that info to the OP, which could take like 50+ ms depending on ping.
There is a point in the game where the two Ts cross paths, and the AWP shot at that point.
    Thank you Mr. Holmes
    this is exactly the case and its just a few ticks behind the firing we see in this spectate footage which checks out because the person that fired had subtick while the spectator had the ping delay.
    [deleted]
        buddy did you watch the video footage?
            [deleted]
                buddy can you see his ping? can you see the quality of his internet connection? do you play the game? the desync in this game is unreal
If this were CSGO, I would almost guarantee a lag/latency issue (which is still  the most likely case, just less certain), as the player shot when the 2 players were lined up, but they had 100+ ping, and/or packet loss.

Also, it's the very last kill of the game, and there's a bunch of extra stuff that executes, so that could cause some extra weirdness.

Is this from the demo or clipped during gameplay? Didn't see the demoui, so not sure.

EDIT: Just to add, since this looks like a recording of your POV, spectating a teammate, there are  layers of latency to factor in. Latency of each of the 3 players, latency rendering the deaths as the game is also rendering/preparing to render the end of game elements.
    Spectating, with probably some high ping. From the AWP pov they were probably aligned. Would be more interesting to see demo playback. Not saying the valve servers are perfect, they have their fair share of spikes but this clip doesn't tell/prove anything.
        Not high ping, my ping was like 40/50 and teammate playing on 20 ping
            Also, here is the demo frame of the shot. They were not aligned in the demo but i think that is a normal thing when we talk about demos in CS.

Totally ready for release and not in beta
wtf, I've never seen this before

edit: oh it's spectator pov

surely they can fix this, didn't notice valorant or Siege having any problems with spec pov
Sheesh can't defend this one.
    [deleted]
        This is the correct answer. Spectators will not see the exact same thing as the person that shot because of latency.
        If this is the case tho then how does the awper get shot.  The AK fires clearly way after they lined up.  So that shot should have never register because the AK should have been dead before it.  But the AWPer still gets shot.  If this was the case you could have people kill each other at the same time which never happens
            cause they were still lagging. the other players had better ping, so their shots came out first. the high ping player had to wait a few more MS before they lined up on their screen, and then a few more MS for the shot to register with the server.

if the Ts shot better, their kill would have registered first and the awper's shot would have registered second; therefore being discarded. but the Ts missed their chance by quite a while, and the awper got a fair shot in even with lag.
                Plz stop, game is trash if u have to make so much assumptions to justify a kill
                    just because you dont understand how it works doesnt mean he is wrong. this footage is perfectly legitimate and makes sense. you are choosing to be a hater over trying to understand it.
                    that's just latency. as a spectator, you're going through a whole lot more steps in the packet chain so things will look even more strange and delayed to you. so its a good thing that what you see as the spectator shouldn't matter in the slightest. what matters is what the Ts saw on their screen, and what the CT saw on their screen. CT was lagging, Ts got to shoot first fair and square. they missed, CT won a little bit after that once their shot registered with the server.

this is how latency works in any game. nobody said it wasn't bullshit, its just simply the compromises that need to be made in order for online play to work in the first place. people who want the most fair experience play LAN.
        is it too much to ask that everyone in the game actually see the same thing?
            It kinda is, as a general statement.
                why?
                    I'm glad you asked the question and removed the previous reply attacking me.

Well, for starters every computer has a different latency, so it'd be practically impossible to have a game working the way they do if they didn't try to compensate by extrapolating and then course-correcting. This is why desyncs happen and it's an extremely hard thing to avoid in all situations.
                        meh I'll refer to my previous comment.
            for the real-time players, yes it is.

for the spectators, i guess we could afford to watch a bit delayed but precise.
                how is it impossible when csgo never had a problem with spectating team mates on this scale?
                    in csgo the shooter would experience the inaccuracy but not in terms of what he sees rather where his bullet is registered by the server. the server decided the ultimate truth. i dont know why the csgo spectate wasnt even perfect.

in cs2, imagine the shooter fires at tick T but this information would reach and be acknowledged by the server at tick T+X due to his ping. so the spectator while watching tick T+X sees what the shooter did at tick T. the spectator experiences the full scale of the inaccuracy which this footage is a very good example of.

i believe if the cs2 spectate had a delay of X ticks, it could display what happened at tick T correctly while the server is processing tick T+X but i dont know if this is feasible or not.
                        well then subtick is shit and they should go back to 124 tick servers which literally got zero complaints
                            its a trade-off at best. subtick has perfect hitreg
                                So the 0.5 seconds it takes for my frag to show on the kill feed is intentional from valve?
                                    what are you smoking brother?
this happened in csgo too
The mouse was clicked when both heads alligned ffs how hard is it to understand
    pretty hard when the game shows 3 different versions of the same thing happening. how is this clip NOT an example of something being wrong with the game??
        The important POV is one we can’t see when spectating (what happens on the players screen). It’s a deserved kill. How it looks like to us is just a matter of how good the connection is
        there is nothing wrong with the game in this clip. it simply is NOT. lmao
im not complaining if I do it, but I am complaining if it happenes to me
You saw them both. You got them both.

What you see is what you get.
Why do none of you get how this works. Subtick and the demo make this look like they weren't close together. But on this player's screen he saw both of them lined up and shot, killing both of them?
    Its not a demo xd
Nothing to do with subtick. Spectator desync was a thing in csgo too. Holy shit this sub is stupid
[deleted]
    Yeah hahaha, I post this as a Meme with the "Entertainment & Humor" tag but some sub admin just changed it.
This is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
This is fucking ridiculous! Valve, stop fucking our asses and fix your game!
The servers should run at 128 tick with subtick. Subtick does not resolve the condition when you are retreated behind a wall but on the other player's computer you are outside the wall.
Valve does not give a damnn, go open cases and buy skins .
Skill issue!!! Ha! Am i right guys??
I have been playing on around 20 Ping on official servers, and that feels good and the game feels responsive enough, but on 40+ ping the game feels really bad. If I'm reading the stamp correctly, you're on 54ping, which would match my experience with the game so far, really annoying on 40+ ping.

The game seems to feel amazing on 0ms though, the other day I hosted a match to play fy\_pool\_party with some friends and that was really responsive, hope they can get close to that someday

EDIT: Just noticed this is from spectating a teammate, what I said doesn't matter
    latency is not a thing that valve can solve, except they queue only people from the same country, you can set your max matchmaking ping to be 25 or 35 max so you get only servers and matches with that max ping, however if mm cant find servers with that ping they will choose the next best automatically, so its will always be an issue its just how networking works
        Yup, just hope they can magically can find a way to make the game feel closer to that, but the game feels good for me currently on 20ms, seems like they're targeting < 40 ms and that's fine IMO
This is subtick working perfectly for the killer. If you spectate, of course it wont align.
This is an older repost, many updates have been released since this was first posted. Stop Karma farming...
    Bottom left says Jan 04
    Hahahaha, this clip was from yesterday xd.
Lol joke of a game
    league is indeed a joke yes
Its shocking just how superior CSGO was functionally compared to CS2.
    Lol fuck off with those rose tinted glasses. CSGO always had the same spectator desync problem

One example
https://youtu.be/aYedlp3v9tE?si=RWGPka4488zwrV5j
"What you see is what you get."
I leave cs2 for moment this hes broken
What you see is what you get
They wont fix anything because they dont even understand what the issue is. Since subtick is timestamp based and every client is running at different hardware and at different worldwide locations, at different clock frequencies, a perfect client to client synchronization is not possible.A packet with the same timestamp generated on my local client and sent to the server is generated at a different real time interval in regard to the packets sent by other clients.The CPU clocks, framerate and all the other bullshit also is out of sync client to client. Even if they ensure timestamp sequencing on the server is always in the proper order, the clients remain out of sync. They would have to use satellite tracking systems and geolocalization, and at that, make sure EVERYONE'S game is running relativistically in sync with each other.Not to mention all the routing devices on the way. The game is and will be permanently broken online.

They will regard what I said above as just welp, unsolvable part of the networking, just like thermal throttling leading to fallacies in computations, but that's the real underlying issue they try to stitch with more shitty networking - the butterfly effect causing minor synchronization errors to grow into massive desync, and more layers of networking will simply add up to the desync issue.  


While you may not pick it up and the game seems like it works as it should, the CPU does pick it up, and grants advantage to one of the sides.

This guy was playing on 20 ping and I was playing at 40/50 ping. Its not a ping issue
ahahahahahahaahah
So, there is a desync problem with the spectator view but the problem is that there is not desync with the enemy players "supposedly", so... Yeah, not a subtick problem, but a huge problem anyways.
wtff hahah
64-tick subtick + shit valvo servers = 100000000000 problems

So you are telling me that a significant amount of my deaths to AWPs could just be subtick?

    This is the correct answer. Spectators will not see the exact same thing as the person that shot because of latency.
    If this is the case tho then how does the awper get shot.  The AK fires clearly way after they lined up.  So that shot should have never register because the AK should have been dead before it.  But the AWPer still gets shot.  If this was the case you could have people kill each other at the same time which never happens
        cause they were still lagging. the other players had better ping, so their shots came out first. the high ping player had to wait a few more MS before they lined up on their screen, and then a few more MS for the shot to register with the server.

if the Ts shot better, their kill would have registered first and the awper's shot would have registered second; therefore being discarded. but the Ts missed their chance by quite a while, and the awper got a fair shot in even with lag.
            Plz stop, game is trash if u have to make so much assumptions to justify a kill

CT was lagging, Ts got to shoot first fair and square. they missed, CT won a little bit after that once their shot registered with the server.

this is how latency works in any game. nobody said it wasn't bullshit, its just simply the compromises that need to be made in order for online play to work in the first place. people who want the most fair experience play LAN.
    is it too much to ask that everyone in the game actually see the same thing?
        It kinda is, as a general statement.
            why?
                I'm glad you asked the question and removed the previous reply attacking me.

Well, for starters every computer has a different latency, so it'd be practically impossible to have a game working the way they do if they didn't try to compensate by extrapolating and then course-correcting. This is why desyncs happen and it's an extremely hard thing to avoid in all situations.
                    meh I'll refer to my previous comment.
        for the real-time players, yes it is.

for the spectators, i guess we could afford to watch a bit delayed but precise.
            how is it impossible when csgo never had a problem with spectating team mates on this scale?
                in csgo the shooter would experience the inaccuracy but not in terms of what he sees rather where his bullet is registered by the server. the server decided the ultimate truth. i dont know why the csgo spectate wasnt even perfect.

in cs2, imagine the shooter fires at tick T but this information would reach and be acknowledged by the server at tick T+X due to his ping. so the spectator while watching tick T+X sees what the shooter did at tick T. the spectator experiences the full scale of the inaccuracy which this footage is a very good example of.

i believe if the cs2 spectate had a delay of X ticks, it could display what happened at tick T correctly while the server is processing tick T+X but i dont know if this is feasible or not.
                    well then subtick is shit and they should go back to 124 tick servers which literally got zero complaints
                        its a trade-off at best. subtick has perfect hitreg
                            So the 0.5 seconds it takes for my frag to show on the kill feed is intentional from valve?
                                what are you smoking brother?
pretty hard when the game shows 3 different versions of the same thing happening. how is this clip NOT an example of something being wrong with the game??
    The important POV is one we can’t see when spectating (what happens on the players screen). It’s a deserved kill. How it looks like to us is just a matter of how good the connection is
    there is nothing wrong with the game in this clip. it simply is NOT. lmao
Its not a demo xd
Yeah hahaha, I post this as a Meme with the "Entertainment & Humor" tag but some sub admin just changed it.
latency is not a thing that valve can solve, except they queue only people from the same country, you can set your max matchmaking ping to be 25 or 35 max so you get only servers and matches with that max ping, however if mm cant find servers with that ping they will choose the next best automatically, so its will always be an issue its just how networking works
    Yup, just hope they can magically can find a way to make the game feel closer to that, but the game feels good for me currently on 20ms, seems like they're targeting < 40 ms and that's fine IMO
Bottom left says Jan 04
Hahahaha, this clip was from yesterday xd.
league is indeed a joke yes
Lol fuck off with those rose tinted glasses. CSGO always had the same spectator desync problem

One example
https://youtu.be/aYedlp3v9tE?si=RWGPka4488zwrV5j
His teammate saw the two heads crossing his cross hair as he shot
Done
Wouldn't be surprised if that is actually what happened though. CS3 when?
    wdym, i love Cheater-Strike 2.
        My favorite is when people call someone cheaters because they don't understand team communication. Just last night someone accused our top frag for knowing a guy was mini when I was inside mini and could hear him scoping in.
            Cheaters ruin games that they’re not in, too. In Valorant if someone hits a couple crazy shots and has some good luck, it’s more likely they got lucky and have skill so people don’t accuse them of cheating. 

In CS2 it’s more likely they’re cheating, especially at anything other than the highest of trust factors. 

So people rationally suspect other people are cheating when they’re not. Merely the existence of cheaters in other games or a user’s past games ruins their future games as it’s not fun to think you’re playing against a cheater regardless.
            congrats you got called cheater for once. dont invalidate others experiences cause your ego got pushed once
                Nobody called me a cheater you fucking trog. Read it again and use the working part this time.
                Lancelz?
    Rofl, valve? A 3?

        It is caused by the shitty subtick system. Remove that, bring 128. I am a genius, Valve should hire me.
            This stuff happened in CSGO too.
    You get what you see, right?
yes, the teammate had probably high ping, and in their screen they hit the collat although other people don't see it
    Nope, no high ping. I was playing at 40/50 ping and teammate at 20.
        well, maybe in that precise moment their ping went up, or idk why could it be, but i believe he must've seen the collat hit, bc that's how subtick works
        First, this has nothing to do with subtick. Second, you’re a spectator, this has no effect on gameplay. 

This GIF is incredibly low quality, I have no idea what you did to mess that up so badly. So i’m unable to really count the frames to get any decent estimate as to how much time passed since their heads were overlapping. 

You were at 50 ping, teammate at 20, and let’s say enemies were also at 20.

It goes from server to your teammate, that’s 20ms, it goes back to the server, another 20ms, it goes from server back to you, 50ms. That’s 90ms right there. And the last 50ms is merely for a spectator and the sever doesn’t care because it doesn’t affect gameplay so it might not prioritize your view right away. Your teammate will have lag compensation, but there is no lag comp for spectators. As long as your teammate saw overlapping heads then it is working as expected. That’s true for any multiplayer game in existence, and Valve can’t change physics.
            game is shit this was never happening in csgo but in cs2 its almost every game why are you defending it with your nerdy analitics or whatever are you that much delusional, i am 3300 elo on faceit and i never met anyone above 3k elo on faceit who say that cs2 is good optimized game, game is shit and only you noobs can like it
                This definitely still happened in CSGO.

I’m not saying CS2 doesn’t have netcode issues, they do, and it’s not tuned to the level that CSGO was. 

This however is not an example of that.
            Chill bro, chill. If this game seems legit and perfectly playable for you then okay.  The majority of the community doesnt like this.
                You’re a spectator, this had no effect on your game play.

You are not in the majority, spectator delay is nothing new and exists in every game because it’s basic physics.
                    okay bro, xd
still thats not normal brah
well-deserved? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
    most likely, yes, he fired when they aligned on his screen so, well-deserved. even though thats not what you see here because spectate is not accurate and has never been even in csgo. dont let your hate cloud your brain.
        This. The spectate is delayed. The player actually shot when both T's were aligned.
        Yes. I agree with this guy. It was well deserved. Subtick system fixes the problem of bullets not hitting where they should in CS:GO
        yes, he "must" have clicked his mouse right as they lined up, *assuming this still works as intended.*  
Although probably still somewhat off from what we see from this spectator
        tbh fair but most likely we will never know if that was a subtick issue or a lucky shot
            true but in theory it should be possible to post-process a demo to obtain a universally correct demo. maybe we will get there
Same happened all the time in csgo, the behind wall, and stuff in this post is just lag compansation.
[deleted]
    Ok. How? Please elaborate.
Yeah, you only have to see the people comments defending valve sht, idk what happens in people's head honestly
>apparently isn't synced with game for some reason.

spectating with network latency will always be behind the live game state of any given person.

On the teammates side, locally he probably did see them entirely lined up and clicked correctly. But the earliest OP's game can possibly know that the shot hit is after the teammates game sends info to the server and the server relays that info to the OP, which could take like 50+ ms depending on ping.
buddy did you watch the video footage?
    [deleted]
        buddy can you see his ping? can you see the quality of his internet connection? do you play the game? the desync in this game is unreal
Not high ping, my ping was like 40/50 and teammate playing on 20 ping
    Also, here is the demo frame of the shot. They were not aligned in the demo but i think that is a normal thing when we talk about demos in CS.

https://preview.redd.it/8ugpfpeofsac1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd64b7c22d950f4b34f8f0378b08a8847dee21a8
This is the correct answer. Spectators will not see the exact same thing as the person that shot because of latency.
If this is the case tho then how does the awper get shot.  The AK fires clearly way after they lined up.  So that shot should have never register because the AK should have been dead before it.  But the AWPer still gets shot.  If this was the case you could have people kill each other at the same time which never happens
    cause they were still lagging. the other players had better ping, so their shots came out first. the high ping player had to wait a few more MS before they lined up on their screen, and then a few more MS for the shot to register with the server.

if the Ts shot better, their kill would have registered first and the awper's shot would have registered second; therefore being discarded. but the Ts missed their chance by quite a while, and the awper got a fair shot in even with lag.
        Plz stop, game is trash if u have to make so much assumptions to justify a kill
            just because you dont understand how it works doesnt mean he is wrong. this footage is perfectly legitimate and makes sense. you are choosing to be a hater over trying to understand it.

game is shit this was never happening in csgo but in cs2 its almost every game why are you defending it with your nerdy analitics or whatever are you that much delusional, i am 3300 elo on faceit and i never met anyone above 3k elo on faceit who say that cs2 is good optimized game, game is shit and only you noobs can like it
    This definitely still happened in CSGO.

I’m not saying CS2 doesn’t have netcode issues, they do, and it’s not tuned to the level that CSGO was. 

This however is not an example of that.
Chill bro, chill. If this game seems legit and perfectly playable for you then okay.  The majority of the community doesnt like this.
    You’re a spectator, this had no effect on your game play.

You are not in the majority, spectator delay is nothing new and exists in every game because it’s basic physics.
        okay bro, xd
true but in theory it should be possible to post-process a demo to obtain a universally correct demo. maybe we will get there
just because you dont understand how it works doesnt mean he is wrong. this footage is perfectly legitimate and makes sense. you are choosing to be a hater over trying to understand it.
that's just latency. as a spectator, you're going through a whole lot more steps in the packet chain so things will look even more strange and delayed to you. so its a good thing that what you see as the spectator shouldn't matter in the slightest. what matters is what the Ts saw on their screen, and what the CT saw on their screen. CT was lagging, Ts got to shoot first fair and square. they missed, CT won a little bit after that once their shot registered with the server.

this is how latency works in any game. nobody said it wasn't bullshit, its just simply the compromises that need to be made in order for online play to work in the first place. people who want the most fair experience play LAN.
I'm glad you asked the question and removed the previous reply attacking me.

Well, for starters every computer has a different latency, so it'd be practically impossible to have a game working the way they do if they didn't try to compensate by extrapolating and then course-correcting. This is why desyncs happen and it's an extremely hard thing to avoid in all situations.
    meh I'll refer to my previous comment.
in csgo the shooter would experience the inaccuracy but not in terms of what he sees rather where his bullet is registered by the server. the server decided the ultimate truth. i dont know why the csgo spectate wasnt even perfect.

in cs2, imagine the shooter fires at tick T but this information would reach and be acknowledged by the server at tick T+X due to his ping. so the spectator while watching tick T+X sees what the shooter did at tick T. the spectator experiences the full scale of the inaccuracy which this footage is a very good example of.

i believe if the cs2 spectate had a delay of X ticks, it could display what happened at tick T correctly while the server is processing tick T+X but i dont know if this is feasible or not.
    well then subtick is shit and they should go back to 124 tick servers which literally got zero complaints
        its a trade-off at best. subtick has perfect hitreg
            So the 0.5 seconds it takes for my frag to show on the kill feed is intentional from valve?
                what are you smoking brother?
Nobody called me a cheater you fucking trog. Read it again and use the working part this time.
