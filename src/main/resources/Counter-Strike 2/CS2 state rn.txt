[[CS2 state rn]]





This was the state during GO as well.
    No it wasn’t, and second why compare both games, they released in different eras, valve didn’t know that cs go was going to be big if they didn’t put that much effort is because of that, but now they know that cs is big, and that cs2 had to be better, better release, game was rushed dude. They don’t seem to put any effort. “Shotgun shells added” wow amazing update
        CS has been big since source..
            Can't speak on earlier, but CS was one of the biggest games in the world as far back as 1.5
                That is true but gaming as a whole was much more of a niche market in the 90’s.
            Source was never big... It was always the smaller brother.
                You downvote this guy but he is right. CS1.6 had 25% higher player count up until 2012 when the beta dropped and only fell off around 2014. Another reason not to give any respect to the commenters and posters on this sub.
                    Your 100% right but once the down votes start I have to contribute
        You say no it wasn't and then go on to talk about how Valve is incompetent. CSGO was plagued by issues nonstop and valve gave us nothing. 

I've played CS since 2004 and I started GO in beta, I played throughout the entire life span of the game and it is clear to me that you are relatively new to the franchise.
            Amen. People either need to play, or find a new game. Were used to this. We’ve adapted time and time again while they cry cause they’ve never been in this exact same position.
    People just like to complain. Let them go until they tucker themselves out
        People posting about getting banned for high dpi or just playing the game is definitely just a “people like to complain” issue? Lmao have you even been seeing the issues this game’s been having?
            No one got banned for high dpi lol. They just lie to get unbanned
                You have a source showing they're all lying? Because that just sounds like you pulled it out of your ass. Here's a thread with many people talking about this same issue, and the op created a pretty thorough video of them recreating the vac ban on a brand new account. [https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/17e5a5p/cs2\_reproduceable\_high\_dpi\_vac\_ban\_bug/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/17e5a5p/cs2_reproduceable_high_dpi_vac_ban_bug/)
                    Yes, I've tried it myself since day 1 and still try from time to time. Many people also tried and no one got banned. Any idea why?
                        No one? Except I literally just linked you someone who did?

The non existence of something in one place doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist anywhere.
                            Obviously everyone in that tread cheated. Kinda sad that they have a .7 kd and have to use walls + aim lock every game. 

/s
                        this is obvious bait
                There were literally speedruns to get banned on a fresh account lol. Were you born this stupid or did you have to practice?
        I mean it’s a fairly objective fact that the game isn’t being updated much. I am surprised they decided to release CS2 but still haven’t done an operation?
As long as there are people like OhnePixel, nothing will change. The community will be milked by them. They will keep buying skins and cases. They will keep supporting them.

They will defend their wall by claiming that GO was in the same state. That is a very weak argument. How much money did VALVE make with GO? CS:GO is an example of getting the most but doing the least.

They could actually hire great people, with this huge amount of money, to prepare the game for the big release, but no, you still see little effort from their side. Shouldn't you learn from your mistakes? Especially when your company has gotten so big over time?

The **community**, and only the **community**, keeps the game **alive**. All creative ideas come from the community, not from the developers.

But of course you can continue to enjoy your one and only "premiere" mode, which is dominated by cheaters.

Instead we get beautiful water at cost of -150 FPS, which they haven't solved aprox. in 2 months. And there is so much more.
    Beautiful mollys at the cost of -150 fps too
        If a Molly is that bad for someone's FPS they don't have 150fps to lose even at 480p lol
        Nice pc
    We didn’t give overwatch a pass when they resold the same game but with changes that fucked it up so idk why people are doing the same for counter strike
        Ding ding ding! It’s a brand “new” CS with less modes, less maps, no anticheat, and it runs awful! Who’s ready to buy some cases!?
            Cringe way to talk.
        A lot of why people hated overwatch 2 was because of the changed monetization system that basically stole the ability to get skins by grinding that people expected when they bought overwatch. CS2 has issues ofc but they haven’t just taken something people paid for. (Not completely and intentionally at least)
            They shoved CS:GO into a hidden beta branch when I paid for that not CS2... Should have just released it separately, every time I even look at CS2 on my Steam library my blood boils.
        Because it’s a free update
        Because Valve are holier than thou
    Yea, that's the issue with Valve, like Valorant's Anti Cheat team consists of 8 members, and according to a post on r/CSGO, CS2's Dev team strength is ~20, including Graphic Artists, Programmers, etc. So it's easily understandable why development is slow and why they take 100s of days to release new maps and new content, because their team can at most handle one aspect at a time. 

A good example can be that guy on Twitter who was talking about Server issues, he repeatedly used the word "I" instead of "us", meaning that he alone was working on server issues we were facing that time, like it's a lone guy fixing 100s of issues, and then we wonder why normal level updates take 5-6 days to release. 

I just think that we the community are too complacent with Valve, they did give us CS, but I don't think they deserve it. Like they earn millions of dollars, if they hire part time programmers/artists, they can make the user experience 10x better, but they just want to sit there and save their money, sub tick is a good example about that too, they will create a whole freaking new system, but will not pay for 128 tick servers.
        I don’t disagree with your post entirely but it is clear you do not have any understanding of software development
            Brooo they are a billion dollar company and released a beta, they are too greedy to invest in some more developers, cmon even a kid understand this.
It's just a shitty game and way worse than valorant. It's still like playing with 100ms even with 10ms ping
    Skins are the very reason why we will never get a true sequel to CSGO. We will be on CS2 and whatever “engine updates” come for the next 30 years because of skins. Countless weapon problems will never be properly addressed because valuable skins are on those weapons.
    Same reason I haven’t bought CoD in a long time… The greatest games of my childhood are slowly dying one money hungry move at a time
    I actually got into a fight with OhnePixel fans.  I didn't know that that subreddit was CS and I went on my massive tirade over how trash the game and why I quit.  Suddenly, I'm getting attacked from all angles.  It was beautiful watching those preordering pieces of shit rage.
        That tends to happen to people with main character sydrome
            Maybe, but do you know what's worse than that?  A company that releases an update the overrides and deletes maps and gamemodes and introduces bugs and a cheating epidemic.
                A delusional playerbase that thinks there wasn't already a cheating epidemic will never get old. But regardless, you don't need to make a Karen style "I'm leaving" announcement
                    I wasn't making an "I'm leaving" announcement.  I just stated that as a side note when talking about these issues.  And when you say there wasn't a cheating epidemic before?  Sure, there may have been cheating, BUT NOT SO MUCH that it gets advertised on Reddit.
                        If you think the cheating the last couple years wasn't this bad you're just delusional
                            How so?  Show me how the cheating was JUST as bad.
                                If you were around you would know. People bring it up more now because it's the cool thing to do AND cs2 was supposed to fix it
                                    Really?  For some reason I find that false.  In my hours of playing CSGO, I only came across 1 cheater.  Also, you didn't show me anything.  You just insulted me again and failed to provide good points.
    Ive been saying that since forever but i get downvoted because people love ohne
    Gaben never liked or understood CS, that's the truth.
        The only game he plays is Dota so I’m no surprised. It’s similar with Tarkov, the main guy doesn’t even play video games and it shows
    Yea no , the market dropped 30-50% lmfao
    Skins made and destroyed CS.
not surprising as this is literally every live-service game. new cosmetics and things to buy make money, stopping hackers and fixing bugs does not. stop supporting this practice.
Honestly an edible and two beers is all that one needs to fix the game.
    This is the way... (we still doin that right?)
    I do one or the other. I envy people that don't get crossfaded.
    Drunk cs > high cs
        nah fam for me i take a kief topped bowl and the 1taps start appearing
        I mean I would agree with you but my motor skills drop exponentially when drunk...
            The alcohol takes an edge off. An edible would make me anxious for me.
add to that performance and servers.
i’m having fun with the game
    Same here but on matches where there is no packet loss or blatant cheaters
        Yeah the packet loss has been bad for me since yesterday. It’s making games miserable
            Notice packet loss when you shoot at the enemy. It’s been pretty bad but faceit doesn’t have the issue which is weird
    until someone shoot you through the wall in first second of the game and they detected you change your DPI too high, hit your teammate
    yeah me too
    Same bro can’t believe I never played this before but cs2 has been a blast
where is bob?
In CSGO you could at least feel opponents become easier the more you lose. In CS2 every game is just terrible. You need to be lucky to get either a smurf or a cheater on your team to break the loss streak.
Imagine playing cs 2 sober...
I'll be back when they fix the game. A lot of new and good games out there for now.
You forgot the mic not picking low voice problem.
    idk that issue :O
        That's like massive issue. Mic picking up sounds only if you scream at it. Basically push to talk works like voice activation with high treshhold. No fixes for that despite those fixes that some users described.
Use voice loop back 1 command to test yourself. Maybe you also have this issue and don't know about that and think your team just don't wanna reply to you sometimes.
            This is such a huge issue for me and a lot of my friends. I cannot believe they haven't fixed this yet.
[removed]
    I honestly wouldn't be surprised
And honestly how CS2 has been handled is really tarnishing my opinion of valve as a whole, a company that is otherwise pretty good compared to most others out there.
    That is quite true
I’m confused about the high DPI bans. I have been fucking SPINNING pre round for fun at 18,000 DPI for like 6 years on GO and now 2 and never had any bans
    People read one post with a complaint and then log it into their memories forever. CS has always had the most toxic fan base
    [removed]
        ??? I Don’t determine your choices and I very highly doubt that’s the reason you got kicked
Valve most likely benefits from false VAC bans honestly since idiots will lose their inventory but still want to play the game and end up buying even more skins to play with
    that makes 0 sense
I'm still having fun with Counter Steike 2. Still waiting for more content.
I see a LOT of the same people playing on the servers I connect to regularly. Some have become casual gaming friends. I see some walling, once in a while, but the obvious cheaters kind of stick out. It is easy enough to log out and back into a different match if you are feeling outclassed outmatched or just plain beat up on. When I get my ass kicked a few rounds, I log out, take a break, and then come back in after I am feeling like taking the abuse. This game can be a bit masochistic when you're taking a beating .
Chickens with hat is a w tho for sure
my biggest irk is how TK damage and bans have remained unchanged despite making little sense
Man I don't want to play so much that I've forgot to get my weekly caches ...
spot on
wish we had chicken with hat :c
All true
Security issue that can leak players IP!!
Valve: here’s a patch. But I’m not saying shit. Figure it out.
The fat lazy developers are fucking shit valve should do something about that or hire some new ass developers atleast they can work faster

Yeah the packet loss has been bad for me since yesterday. It’s making games miserable
    Notice packet loss when you shoot at the enemy. It’s been pretty bad but faceit doesn’t have the issue which is weird
That's like massive issue. Mic picking up sounds only if you scream at it. Basically push to talk works like voice activation with high treshhold. No fixes for that despite those fixes that some users described.
Use voice loop back 1 command to test yourself. Maybe you also have this issue and don't know about that and think your team just don't wanna reply to you sometimes.
    This is such a huge issue for me and a lot of my friends. I cannot believe they haven't fixed this yet.
??? I Don’t determine your choices and I very highly doubt that’s the reason you got kicked
Can't speak on earlier, but CS was one of the biggest games in the world as far back as 1.5
    That is true but gaming as a whole was much more of a niche market in the 90’s.
Source was never big... It was always the smaller brother.
    You downvote this guy but he is right. CS1.6 had 25% higher player count up until 2012 when the beta dropped and only fell off around 2014. Another reason not to give any respect to the commenters and posters on this sub.
        Your 100% right but once the down votes start I have to contribute
Amen. People either need to play, or find a new game. Were used to this. We’ve adapted time and time again while they cry cause they’ve never been in this exact same position.
No one got banned for high dpi lol. They just lie to get unbanned
    You have a source showing they're all lying? Because that just sounds like you pulled it out of your ass. Here's a thread with many people talking about this same issue, and the op created a pretty thorough video of them recreating the vac ban on a brand new account.

        Yes, I've tried it myself since day 1 and still try from time to time. Many people also tried and no one got banned. Any idea why?
            No one? Except I literally just linked you someone who did?

The non existence of something in one place doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist anywhere.
                Obviously everyone in that tread cheated. Kinda sad that they have a .7 kd and have to use walls + aim lock every game. 

/s
            this is obvious bait
    There were literally speedruns to get banned on a fresh account lol. Were you born this stupid or did you have to practice?
Cringe way to talk.
They shoved CS:GO into a hidden beta branch when I paid for that not CS2... Should have just released it separately, every time I even look at CS2 on my Steam library my blood boils.
Brooo they are a billion dollar company and released a beta, they are too greedy to invest in some more developers, cmon even a kid understand this.
It's just a shitty game and way worse than valorant. It's still like playing with 100ms even with 10ms ping
Maybe, but do you know what's worse than that?  A company that releases an update the overrides and deletes maps and gamemodes and introduces bugs and a cheating epidemic.
    A delusional playerbase that thinks there wasn't already a cheating epidemic will never get old. But regardless, you don't need to make a Karen style "I'm leaving" announcement
        I wasn't making an "I'm leaving" announcement.  I just stated that as a side note when talking about these issues.  And when you say there wasn't a cheating epidemic before?  Sure, there may have been cheating, BUT NOT SO MUCH that it gets advertised on Reddit.
            If you think the cheating the last couple years wasn't this bad you're just delusional
                How so?  Show me how the cheating was JUST as bad.
                    If you were around you would know. People bring it up more now because it's the cool thing to do AND cs2 was supposed to fix it
                        Really?  For some reason I find that false.  In my hours of playing CSGO, I only came across 1 cheater.  Also, you didn't show me anything.  You just insulted me again and failed to provide good points.
