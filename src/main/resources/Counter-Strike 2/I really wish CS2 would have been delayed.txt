[[I really wish CS2 would have been delayed]]


I know a lot of the content I'm missing is likely to be added soon but its unfortunate that GO was completely deleted for a game that's still rough around the edges. Valve has never felt the need to delete their old game when a sequel came out. I can understand taking down official servers but I can't understand why it was necessary to nuke every community server and workshop map that the community spent a decade building. It's frustrating but it'd be an easier pill to swallow if all the content like Cache, Train, Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman, etc. was included at launch. " If you're a returning player you'll find your favorite maps and matchmaking modes right where you left them" my ass.

Also, it really sucks that Valve has doubled down on not upgrading their servers to 124 tick and instead are going with subtick, this game makes tens of millions of dollars monthly and they refuse to upgrade the servers for it because money.

I'm still optimistic for the future of this game though, and hope I put as much time into CS2 as I did into GO. 


the servers are disappointing, i agree. still having fun playing some here and there though.
no, its fine, me and my friends are having lots of fun in cs2. 

I think it's you
Honestly the whole tick thing made it even worse imo.
The hitreg is the only thing that ms delayed
i agree
Am I the only one lagging with high ping in the servers? I'm in the east coast and playing mm in tlSeattle based servers.
    Lower your max acceptable ping, I'm west coast and with the exception of two odd games in east asian servers all of my games have been san jose or los angeles
        I've always had it set at 150 I've since lowered it to 75 I might put it lower.
