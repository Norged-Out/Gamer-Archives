[[Literally Valve]]





Replace the fire with money and you're golden
    As long valve is still making money they will not resolve these issues.
        Good luck fighting against the dopamine apes who keep opening cases and don't care that the game is shit.  They are the ones that give Valve all of the money and encourage their bad behavior.

A gaming company that doesn't make games should be considered a travesty by all.
            The case market is so popular now that i don’t think people will stop opening cases for the next 10 years. I believe that Valve released CS2 just to get people re-interested in the game, to buy more and more cases. I also believe that they’re not going to fix these bugs as long as people are playing the game and buying more cases.
                Interesting thought
        literally couldn't agree more than this
        you really think valve is going to abandon their biggest game? really?
            Nah, volvo ain't gonna abandon dota2
            They abandoned TF2.
            No While the game still make money.
                what does this mean? people are way to quick to call valve lazy lol. it’s funny how the same thing happens every new cs game release.
                    People with no idea how game or business development work insulting one of the most successful game development companies on their game and business development.
                    No point in arguing these people, they clearly have not once seen how valve handles these things. Nor read a single interview, or been to any business training.
                        haha you’re right, just interested in what they actually think is happening lol
            Do you really think CSGO had a good anticheat for its entire existence?
                Or any valve game for that matter?
        You have never played Valve games. They are slow but they will get it done.
    now that i think about it . . why didn't i do it sooner?
    My thoughts as well
They made 1 billion dollars from you morons last year. Would you change anything?
    short answer:yes  
long answer: i would make the anti cheat better and make the 68 sub tick servers into 128 sub tick servers
        ![gif](giphy|3oEjI67Egb8G9jqs3m)
            I did the same exact thing after reading this as well.
        How would you make the anti-cheat better, like specifically.
            Find and hire talented anti-cheat devs or outsource it.
        If you had a company where you could get away with doing the bare minimum like bare bare minimum and you still earned 1 billion would you give a fuck?

Most wouldn’t.
    >1 billion dollars

When I read that news I knew it was game over. I wouldn't change a thing.
The cup of coffee should say $kin$.
What is "bad subtick" 
    have you ever experienced when your trying to shoot someone and some bullets didn't register?, that's what's called an bad subtick
        when it first came out it worked really well for me, but they patched some ping related things a while back and now it just feels like GO where it won't register hits crazy often
            I was in first round of Beta invites and it was basically perfect for someone with low ping.

It was apparantely really bad for players with above 40 ping though
                I'm a high ping player, play with foreign friends, and it felt perfect at launch. which I never felt with go or valorant
Is the game dying? Lately I’ve had this feeling of playing other games. CS2 has no content, no operation since 2 years, nothing new, no events. This game is boring.
    The game is slowly losing players, but that's most likely a transitional period. Doesn't feel like it's going to die out anytime soon looking by looking at steamdb
    First year they said they are going to make the game esports ready  ( that's their main focus ) 

, so till october 2024 ~ so we're gonna suffer for a while
    Doesn't matter so long as idiots buy skins and cases. The dollar signs look all the same and they're the only thing that matters to them. And they made 1 BILLION recently
    People have been wondering the same since like 2016. The gap between operation Hydra and Shattered Web was also more than 2 years. The playerbase by this point is not only used to content draught, they were probably born in it. So no, I wouldn't say CS is going anywhere.
"Fixed gap on geometry"
hahah im still in the delusion they have a plan up their sleeves :')
    couldn’t implement a working anticheat or mm system for 25 years already. i have no faith in valve
    I strongly believe that they're cooking something cool rn. I don't have high hopes for VAC improvements, but new operation alongside map(s) and game mode is probably coming soon
        For VAC to be updated we'd need Valve 2, not CS2

Literal valve
it seems valve could not care less
Friendly reminder that posts exacerbating the number of cheaters in game is driven and funded by cheating organizations to promote their cheap malicious software
you forgot to add "over 980million in case sales"
vavle most rat company, and most rat devs ever
[deleted]
    Same, been 13 days🤡 this game is dead soon
Its up to the players too...   I've been in multiple servers where a side has voted to not kick someone clearly hacking. (which leads me to believe they do not report as well)     Also been in servers where the servers drop after people vote no...that I dont mind as much as its atleast sending a message to the asshat.
    Hackers also boost the team so it was obvious that they will not kick him just because they got the higher advantage
        Yep had that today too. If we kicked the cheater it would've been 4vs5 and a clear disadvantage.
            Not a W with a cheater it’s hollow
they wiping their tears with our money
In this case valve isn”t even in danger from the fire. They’d be like miles away looking at the burning house all the while bathing in money
Don't forget false bans instead of actually banning cheaters
Just play palworld!
    My wallet: that's a negative
        Ill gift it to you, literally. DM me your steam id
            Is it really that worth it? I just don't wanna try it and it end up being one of those fad games you know?  But shit it does look fun lol.
                Never played it tbh, but im willing to help a fellow redditor to buy a game if they cant afford it
                    Hell yeah, MVP \^
            Let me join I'll play with y'all, cs2 is hurting me
        check out r/crackwatch, you can even play the cracked version with legit steam owners as long as you're on the same version. if you can't afford to buy games in the first place then you have nothing to be ashamed of. if you ever feel bad about pirating it and want the convenience of auto-updating to the right version, you know where you can buy it.
            let me guess . . it will hack your pc isn't it ? , so you can get the ever living f\*\*\* out because i hate hackers and cheaters
You guys sound like you hate this game. You never quit bitching.
    probably because they love the game and hate its current state. not that hard to comprehend
    That's Reddit in a nutshell. It's easier to bitch on the forums and rake in the karma than actually do something productive. This sub has some of the worst crybabies I've ever seen online, but fortunately they don't represent the entire playerbase.
I think you mean figuratively, this is not what literally means
First and second premier games last night I had a speed bunny hopper...
For real fuck valve. I still enjoy cs but don't play really much since cs2, sold all my skins other month which i have had for years. I think it's mad this this game stays alive with the amount of fucks valve give. Its so annoying they control the best fps game to have ever been created...... I know I don't know much about games but if valorant can make a good anti cheat why can't valve. Legit cs2 is flooded with cheaters in Premier.
I mean I 4 stacked last night and had a 4 win streak with no cheaters
    You know it’s f*cked when 4 games without cheaters is regarded as such a good thing
        I have 125 wins and have seen maybe 5 cheaters
            did you make them cry? or made them rage?, if you did then your a legend
                Unfortunately not
                    well did you report them?
                        I did but they seemed just good at the game and watching demos it was clear enough I’m glad I reported during the game because after they immediately left so if I waited it would’ve not let me
    u also play silver elite dust 2 competitive. not really a fair comparison
        It was 3 games were vertigo premier
Forgot pro teams leaving
Everyone stop playing MM and jump over to faceit
People still be thinking CS2 was made for the game play, no it was made for the crates.
Average bitchy Reddit L.
    Its true though
    People bitching about EA and Ubisoft delivering sub-optimal low quality games: ✅✅

People bitching about Valve delivering sub-optimal low quality games: 😡😡

apparently
    Average valve dickrider L
        I can't believe people still like Valve.  They have gone to shit.

EA, Ubisoft, Blizzard...

NEW ARRIVAL!!!!  
Valve
            That's fucking ridiculous
                I know.  I never thought they would become as cold and unfeeling towards their games as the aforementioned companies.
            Nerds bitching about the video games they play constantly? Nothing new here.
                Nah, I haven't played this game for MONTHS.
As long as we open cases vavle gonna close 2 eyes and pretend nothing ever happened
And don't forget to tf2 btw
Cause you guys keep buying cases and keys...
Why would they FIX it ?? They make so much $$$  and people keep opening cases and items.  So no need to fix the game . Downward spiral .
I think Valve is busy with bigger and better things at the moment. Steam deck is taking off and they put a lot of resources into that and steam client and proton probably. CS is basically a money printer of passive income for them so they're not really bothered to do anything. To be clear, I'm not defending them, that's just the way it is unfortunately.
Still better than Valorant
