[[The New Bane of your Skyfarer Existence]]


ü•≤


Pretty dumb they don't let you trade the revenant talismans or horns in for these just like you can trade for the other rare item.

  
Game would be so much better with bad luck protection measures.
    How do you think i feel that they still havent done it with Vitality hoofs, dread tails and sequester manes, OUTSIDE of gold dahlia badges? x\_X We need a proud mode version of those 3 already just like how wolf and veil exists as the proud mode of all 3 bosses and the drops are all tied to easy to perform side task objectives...

Vit hoof always acts as the annoying initial lock when i first start pushing a new char\`s ascension weapon, though from what i can guess, they made the Eternal\`s weapon awakening involve alot more difficult boss fights i believe?
        Don't say again vitality hoofs please, i get ptsd from that shit. 2 days ago i did 40 runs and got 1!
            Oh god are vitality hoofs not a break reward? I‚Äôve been going slow on every quests trying to break the armor pieces off when she‚Äôs in her warrior form. I guess Ill just start speed running her
        I just accept I had to buy them with gold dahlia badges, at least that's an option. With these, there's not even that. Feels bad.


And yes, the eternal ascension not only requires the usual mats but they require several of crowns of lament and the other rare drop.
            Not so much for those who dont own PSplus sadly in my case lol. \^\^

Theres a reason why i want them to rework it so you can pick specific difficulty tiers when doing randoms with the quick quest and they gurantee gold badges with proud mode and multi-player simply doubles the reward, not out-right make it non-guranteed on offline mode.

I already had this annoying gripe with Fire emblem engage way back due to a large portion of the \`benefits\` like its \`challenge mode content, something something tower\`, in addition to being a lousy farming system for improving EMBLEM ring weapons(which costs are stupid high and gains are stupid low) when they had no new game plus to justify it. While doing highest difficulty would GIMP rewards & farmable stages and basically flip a perma death and limited \`rewind times\`.

Throw in the fact they barf a bunch of pick up stuff that gives EZ money and restore\`ables only if you were online was like saying you need a nintendo subscription to play part of that game in \`full\`.

Welp, its not like GBF: Relink is intended to last for many years, so i can only hope 1.3.0 balances that portion out, alongside giving my rant for proud mode difficulty farms for basically guranteed \`important\` resources for those remaining fights, since going thru EVERY unit you want to give them an ascension weapon, if you can\`t find the zeal to spam Terminus in less then a week to sweep it all down, which is just another case of rare resource hunting, but likely those ones are less of a headache i assume in comparison.

Also as for those crowns and medallions, kind of a shame they seem to have forgot to plop a clean out dump spot like Large exp crystals since once you got all the warpaths and what not sigils, those value likely turn to the same feel as i do when i just go and burn those excess 1:15 ticket exchange surplus ones when i get REALLY thirsty to try and do 300+ sigil reroll spams and then likely another 200\~ with all the scrap and refund looping.
Yepüç∫ 25 out of 70 runs, which is pretty good from my understanding. Still I feel like I need 180 of these things.
    with how many you need (and how horrible the fight is) id like a 50% drop rate minimum. feels awful to fight him and get nothing
        Fight is pretty easy and fun. I've been farming with full cpu team, takes about 4min per run...
            Happy birthday! What's your team comp?
            i average 5 mins with my friend, but its just unfun and lame.

probably depends on who you're playing, i had a much better experience as vane than with siete
So this is the Grindblue Fantasy.
Bet you when 1.3 is about to come out they'll make the drop rates higher like they did with Lucilius.
This thing is rarer than the horns, yet each sigil asks for 7 of these and 3 of the horns. Who in their right mind made this???
    sigil + weapon + awakening weapon

yeah man its hard
I already feel the drain building up farming for these ALONE
This can‚Äôt be purchased, correct?
    No
I swear if Sandalphon needs this or a different one to farm several times just to get special sigils. I'm quitting, just straight up deleting the game. I love the game but the progression is just inhumane. 

I have played hundreds of hours of monster hunter games but it's never like this to be so draining.
    I think that the GBF Relink problem, it's that you have that single quest to do if you need to farm a specific material.

In MH you could have the same monster you need to farm in several different quests, like on in a map and an other in the arena, and special random generated quest, aka investigations, that give different modify to the quest and special drop rates.

  
Wish Relink could have a similar system.
        At least this and Luci Tears drop from quests that are actually rewarding and relatively challenging. Personally, I don‚Äôt mind it when I‚Äôm farming the shit out of these quests for azurite and curios anyways. Now Shrimp tails, hoofs, manes on the other hand‚Ä¶
    They need to think long and hard about this. Granblue Fantasy Relink is not a gacha game. Relying on RNG farming sucks and tends to make people burn out. I haven't even finished building 1 new character entirely and I'm already over it. The thought of doing the same grind AGAIN by fighting the exact same bosses hoping for a drop that has annoyingly low odds isn't fun.
The Supreme Weapon Essences are impossible to get for me.
    At least you can trade for them‚Ä¶ albeit too damn expensive.
        I unlocked both new characters in about 3 hours of grinding. It‚Äôs not that bad.
            you need waaaay more than six essences if want their sigils and ascended ascension weapons

the essence is also required to create warpath sigils for other characters
                lol people downvote the dumbest shit on reddit
Hell I'm still trying to beat a weapon out of proto for a character I actually want to play. Think I got one drop in about 20 runs. FML.
    I‚Äôm calling animal abuse hotline..
    I stopped bothering with proto and only got back to farm for his horn. got three weapons within four runs dunno if they boosted the drop rate. at least it's fun bullying the poor thing with tweyen.
    Up voted you because who the hell downvoted you. Reddit, man‚Ä¶
    At least that‚Äôs a one time drop. You need 7 of these crowns for any new sigil, and the rate is just a little better than the terminus weapons(don‚Äôt fact check me, but it‚Äôs at most 30%).
As a zeta main, I just bonk the horn and get it almost every time this is vengeance for the IW Dodge cancel nerf.
For me it's still Silver Centrum and those damned Fortitude Crystals...
    the new mission gives like 50....
It takes 9 mins for my afk team to clear I haven‚Äôt gotten 1 yet let alone 5
    good. why should you be rewarded for not even playing the game? with a solid online team you can get 3min runs, go play the game.
        Ok snowflake
            ok buddy
        Bitter Betty. Let people play the way they wish. They're not hurting anyone.
            neither am i, just replying to a comment on Reddit. so step aside white knight.
                He wouldn't need to white knight for them if you weren't being gatekeeping schmuck.
                No one cares about the opinion of the gamer elitist.
                    oh man, that hurts, deep in my felines. you make me qq irl.
        I played it a bunch I put 300 hours into the game and manually fought the quest dam near 20 times not that I need to really explain myself
        Not to mention I work 60 hours a week I gotta grind somehow I don‚Äôt have time to play it so yes I afk a lot especially for stuff that don‚Äôt drop alot
These things drop for me like rain, I've gotten 2 in 1 go before as well. The essence drops on occasion and I have yet to see a supp V+
    Yeah true you can occasionally get from chest or S+ rating if i am not mistaken. The essence is quite rare for me only once from the S++ rating and the rest from the chest.
Idk about you guys but at least these things drop for me. The supreme essence though? God damn myth
    You get currency you trade 30 of for one. They are stupidly easy to get.
It feels like it's bugged.
    Just unreasonably low droprate. Not bugged.
        So basically just Tears of the apocalypse again.
            Yes, indeed.
