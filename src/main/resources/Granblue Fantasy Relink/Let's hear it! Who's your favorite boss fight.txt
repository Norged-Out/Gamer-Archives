[[Let's hear it! Who's your favorite boss fight]]


After playing the demo prior to the launch, I figured this game would have some pretty good boss fights, but I was constantly impressed going through the campaign at the quality and cinematic presentation of most of the big boss battles in this game.

Oh, but then you complete the campaign and start unlocking higher difficulty versions of each of these excellent bosses and they just get better and better.

With that said, who's your favorite boss to battle (or two)? For me, It's absolutely Magliette, followed by Gallanza. The Magliette fight is cinematically gorgeous, mechanically interesting, and just a ton of fun.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: Looking through all the great replies, here are the standout bosses mentioned:

1. Pyet-A
2. Bahamut Versa
3. White/Black Wyrms
4.  Excavallion

I just unlocked Proud difficulty last night, so I'm pumped to jump into these fights!


The mech raptor dude that shoots lasers everywhere.
    Yeah, ya know, that is an excellent fight! There are just so many good ones, I swear, lol.

**Edit**: I thought you were talking about Tayu'itar at first, but you mean Pyet-A :).
    Mecha Godzilla is a great fight. Especially with Vaseraga. Ending the fight with a huge arching cleave on its head on the photofinish is freaking beautiful.
    Bro this fight is too good.  The music, the visuals, the chaos.  I hope we get more fights of this caliber
Pyat-A
    Haven't gotten to him yet but a lot of folks hear are mentioning him so I guess I'm in for a treat here soon. I should be strong enough to complete the Final Report tonight (fingers crossed).
        To sum that fight in simple term: Raptor Gundam with element shifting.
Easily Pyet-A. 

Awesome design, great boss theme, challenging difficulty without really feeling unfair (looking at you, Gallanza+Maglielle). I honestly think it’s a much better and more challenging fight than the actual final boss.

All hail the robo raptor
    Sounds right up my alley: a difficult boss where you really have to focus and bring your A-game. I love Magliette for all the crazy "bullet hell'ish" moments, and I get the impression this fella is similar with the cool mechanics.
    i reached proud difficulty and thought i had seen all the bosses, game to this thread confused at how i missed a Pyet-A, googled it and its the automagod mech from the gacha game wtf?? did not expect that to be in relink
    Pyet-A feels like a power rangers villain, and I love him for that.
Pyat-A and Versa
My favorite boss is the teammates that don't want to stay in my Vane bubble. 

For reals though it's probably Pyet-A or the Dark/Light Wyrms.
Pyet A and people are find me crazy for this one but I really love the gallanza + maglielle fight because that was the most challenging fight in the game
    Yeah, I think that was the first boss fight that tested me quite a bit during the Story. It is definitely a good time, and a feast for the eyes with all the visual effects everywhere, lol.
        Yeah I thought it was a very amazing fight but I know not a lot of people like that fight cuz sometimes their attacks do be kinda bs but I just found it extremely fun to do
    Bruh, im a lancelot main and I can dodge 90% of the shit in that fight, and I still say fuck that fight. If their damage was toned down like…15% so gallanza wasnt just hopping everywhere one shotting everyone it wouldn’t be as bad, but anytime I get that fight I spend more time rezzing people than I do fighting.
    Yeah I really enjoy chaotic boss fights and those two are crazy lol
1. Versa
2. Whitewyrm
3. Pyet-A
The Camera Boss.

Hardest boss in the game, and it's not even close.
    LOL,  I will say the lock on is really frustrating with certain fights (typically those with ads or environmental things that get locked on). I believe the team is working on improving it soon.
Gallanza. I just love his character. I know he's the typical battle loving anime character, but fuck his enthusiasm is infectious lol
    Hah, yeah, he's a pretty unique boss in that he's just a regular person, albeit a powerful one, where you just battle. He's not some giant monster or anything. I also like his attack patterns.
    Gallanza is a freackin beast
    Lol exactly this. Haven’t made it to raptormech yet bc I haven’t attempted the Gallanza-Mag battle yet 
Versa for sure, was really sad the final fight wasn't Versa on crack, I would have enjoyed farming Versa way more then the actual final fight
    Imagine fighting him in pocket dimension and he goes nuts, a more fitting endgame boss imo.
Honestly,  Quakadile and all its variants. No cinematics, so it's just pure action the whole fight, It's fast but not too fast, Super satisfying to dodge/counter it, easy to hit break points and cool design.
    Yeah I hate how any sort of buffs you have keep ticking down and your combo is reset whenever a cinematic triggers, you can even totally waste skills if you use one right before the cinematic.  

Enemies already give off huge fuckoff pushback waves and damage reduction during many organic phase transitions and the cinematics get really old. They’re fine for story mode but I really wish they had gone with more organic ones for endgame that don’t totally throw off the flow of the fight.

As crazy as the endgame dragons are at least they don’t have this nonsense either.
    Have you made it to the mission (Maniac difficulty, I believe...) where you have to fight all three types at once? If not, you're gonna love that one ;).
        I've done nothing but farm for my main's Terminus weapon for the last week, I long for the days to fight Quakadile again.
            Three quakadile fight is actually one of the better silver centrum farms, which you need a crazy amount of for your terminus. So once you get it, you can gorge yourself on that sweet, sweet quakadile
I like the later Dragon encounters, the dark and light dragons I can't remember their names off the top of my head.  I had a ton of fun with the dark dragon specifically his bloodlust phase might be my favorite of the game.
    Are those in Proud difficulty? I haven't gotten there yet, if so, but I'm looking forward to it!
        Yeah I think they are the last couple fights before the final boss.
    Radis Whitewyrm and Evil Black Wyrm (Evyl Blackwyrm)
Not proto drake -_-
White dragon to this day makes me sweat like no other bosses in gbf re link. Black is cool too with his slow gimmick but white dragon in contrast has no gimmick at all, its just tons of damage hitting everywhere all at once. Its attacks almost feels unfair to melee units specially to seigfried but i do like the challenges so thats my pick. :) Pyet -A is a strong second. So many colors and effects. I love his hexagon shaped attack thingy. That felt innovative to me. In a world where Boss fights and Raid bosses tend to use Circles for their attacks. Hexagon definitely felt like a breath of fresh air to me. :)
    White has a gimmick (judging from my matchmaking experience many people dont know or ignore it). He gets some pretty significant buffs and hitting him with the orbs dispels them. You can also stun him out of summoning more obnoxious lightning merry gorounds. The longer the fight goes the more BS he attempts to summon so knocking out the buffs is crucial
    Dang, I haven't reached these two yet (or Pyet) but I'm getting really hyped from all the praise for these bosses I'm seeing in this thread.

Here's to hoping I can complete Final Report tonight.
    Fr! Granted I haven’t done it as much as some of the other fights, but I found White Dragon to be the hardest fight in the game
Galanza + magellie fight (or whatever you spell it) i have basically memorized its moveset as ive play that quest for probably over 100-200+ now, its just so fun and easy to perfect dodge
    Agreed! Love that one. I definitely don't have THAT many fights, though, holy smokes!
    I hate that fight but to each their own
I'm a sucker for big boss fights, so imma go with Proto Bahamut (Proud) and/or Excavallion (Story).

Proud Bahamut is just so cinematic, ramming him with your ship and everything. Also one of the few stages where the *battlefield* changes and moves around. The final DPS check is my personal favorite part, killing the boss before he blows your ship to kingdom come after you trying to do a hit-and-run on em. 

Excavallion is just pure FFXVI dopamine. Big ass boss, slowly climbing to the weak point to waste em. Also, all the ships around shooting at him while panicking before getting shot at makes for a thrilling scene.
    I like Excavallion, but part of me wishes we got the sliding across his body part from the story mission during the later difficulties. I think that was probably one of the cooler parts of the encounter, it feels a little odd to just teleport onto his back after knocking him down. But I get it, the missions are cut down to accommodate having to repeat them dozens of times for materials.
    He blows up the ship if you don’t have enough dps? lol what?? I’ve always killed him when we ram him with the ship or the stage right before that if I’m lucky.
        Yep, just failed a run today at that final stand and he straight up obliterates it to dust lol
    I loved Excavallion as well (the Story version moreso).

I haven't gotten to Proud Bahamut yet, as I'm stuck at the Final Report right now (playing offline with AI only, so I'm currently grinding my AI characters up to snuff). Can't wait to see this, though!
The robo dragon
Maglielle and Gallanza. It actually feels like a fight. I’m honestly a bit disappointed about the “final” boss fights we get. The final story mode versa fight with you playing as Bahamut is just a gimmick, and Proto is a sandbag where half the fight is waiting for the game to let you have a turn at hitting. 

Who knows, maybe I’m just salty at getting 3 weapons over 40 runs and none of them being for characters I want to use.
    Yeah, I've unlocked almost the entire roster, and only then realized from recent tips that it's better to only unlock a few characters to make the Terminus weapon farming a lot easier. I'm so screwed, but ahwell...
    Yea it’s a toss up for sure. Friend did like 60 runs for two weapons 4 weapons. I did like 10 runs and got 3 weapons for my team, just missing my main. They definitely should fix the drop rate. It’s all over the place.
    Love the duo fight. 

Imagine a trio with Id tossed in lol
        Hell no lol I love the 2 but 3?? Too much 🤣
Excavallion, and I'm extremely disappointed we didn't get more fights of that scale in game right now
    Fingers crossed we get some more titan battles down the road, for sure.
[deleted]
    I've been hearing those mentioned a lot, so I am really pumped to fight them soon. I'm gonna be tackling the Final Report tonight!
The ones that don’t move bloodthirst and zip around the screen for 5 minutes
Dragons that are not called Bahamut or Bolla. They are tough enough to be interesting without much annoying cinematics.
Mecha dino cuz it's same theme as Diaspora theme from the mobile game
Any of the dragons, because that boss music is just awesome.
Excavallion, definetely. SotC vibes.
Gerasene. I’m a simple man.
Surprisingly Goblin Warrior shield one, i like the bright rural map alot, and also the boss is super simple when farming as in doesn't have any "untargetable phase".
Pyet-A
Versa
Pyet-A (2-maned it with a friend today)
White Wyrm (Nice farm and good boss)
Versa (best hard fight imo)
Red/Green Wyrm (8bit music)
Versa, and it's not even close. The sheer and absolute spectacle of that fight is insane and it has one of the best soundtracks in gaming in a hot minute.
Gallanza & Maglielle and Id. Character fight
Furycane for me. The music and the transformation get me every time.
Quakadile, the first boss I had difficulty with (the ice version that comes out from one of those omen tomb things, the one that is like, 20lvs above you st that point of the story, the AIs died so much lol), so had to build up my character and the first goal I had (went back to town and did quests to lvl up and such).  Also the name, it's Quakadile, it's amazing
Unpopular opinion but the dual boss fight is the most fun for me
Proud Versa is a lot of fun. Like, my favorite fight.
Proto Bahamut /s
Ancient Dragon. Cause I dont have to press anything and gives me curio. 

But seriously, just like the most, I love the robo raptor’s design as for me it perfectly fit GBFR’s combat play
The fortress giant. Omfg. My jaw dropped. The whole sand thing. Loved. Every. Single. Bit.
    Definitely a highlight. I just wish we could do the full fight in the quests outside the story. But yeah, I want more titans in the future.
Id and the two generals
    Definitely agree!
Managarmr for me it has a great theme, cool stage and fun mechanics! I really enjoy dealing with the tracking ads that freeze you
Pyat-A, Radis, and Evyl
the gallanza/maglielle fight, it seems to be the one people wipe the most in and i enjoy helping people get through it with vane bubble and potion hoarder blues
The dark and light wryms were a lot of fun
That Giant Fortress Golem. Story mode
gallanza + maglielle, that fight took me back to nier automata and i loved it
Cinematically speaking? Excavallion and Bahamut Versa. Honorable mention to Gallanza and Maggie(visually. Gameplay wise... might be fighting for bottom with the magma wyrm boss for me)

Gameplay wise? Pyet-A like everyone else. Incredibly well designed fight overall. Every other fight has some kind of thing I just don't particularly like. Pyet however, just feels like a really good, pretty challenging fight that I enjoy. 

I do want to commend them though with Excavallion with just how absolutely good it felt for the entire story campaign. Big boss fights *usually* kinda suck but Excavallion and kinda breaking him down starting at his feet and ending up running up his body and sliding down his arms and blowing up the core on his back while dodging shit just feel cool as hell.
My id vs id.
Versa
Man f Magliette. My least favorite boss lol. Damn shields
Personally was dissapointed that none of the bosses gain an expanded moveset, you just got reskins and a new CC effect to deal with each time.

So by that standard I liked the first time of all monster type bosses, Pyet-A, both Bahamuts, and the dark and light dragons because they actually bring something new.
Maglielle by a mile. Love her kit and I need her to be playable asap.
Vulkan Bolla is my favorite boss.
Proto bahamut
Probably proto bahamut and bahamut versa , the galanza + mag is pretty bad not cause it s hzrd but mostly cause the game isn y mafe for double fight and it feels , and it s mostly because of the targeting thats complete trash and camera controls are aweful
Yeah, ya know, that is an excellent fight! There are just so many good ones, I swear, lol.

**Edit**: I thought you were talking about Tayu'itar at first, but you mean Pyet-A :).
Mecha Godzilla is a great fight. Especially with Vaseraga. Ending the fight with a huge arching cleave on its head on the photofinish is freaking beautiful.
