[[End-game best team- need help!]]


I am at end-game, am at proud level quests now, just stuck to main character.

  
I wonder what character to control, and what are best 3 AI- team members (playing offline) 

  
Does someone got a mini-guide where to start, who to grind further in the end-game?


you are far away from the real endgame. for now just upgrade your weapons as much as you can and your sigils when you get them,  i dont think there is best AI companions, just go with who you like best or upgrade AI that have supportive skills.
You’ll hear a lot of different answers, especially when considering the AI is better/worse at different characters. 

IMO, don’t worry about min/maxing so much, as worry about what you want to play yourself. Try the roster. Find who clicks with you. Make a main. 

And then, personally…do that 4 times. The game is SUPER grindy endgame. I find having a few characters I can swap between, really alleviates a lot of those issues.
no skill zeta with two less is more sigils, and eugene are among the best AI companions objectively speaking. you can pick anyone for the last slot, generally it won't make a lot of difference.

    Where's AI looking at with new guys? Tweyen seems like the AI would like her. Her and Eugen could be reliable for nuking down fights when afk especially.
        Her damage is pretty low since the AI usually relies on skills to deal damage, and Tweyen's skills suck. The AI is also really bad at using her normal attacks and almost never fully charges multilock hail.
            Yea I was assuming this would happen.

Im about to unlock Katalina warpath. Wondering if her damage boost would buff Eugen/Zeta to the point of faster clears on Behemoth.

Edit: So Katalina has two different SBAs lol. One with Ares out and one without lol. You only get the damage buff when you SBA with Ares out.

And the AI most of time just does SBA when its not out. So you dont get the damage buff often lol. oof.
            Oh. How impossibly unfortunate.
I just gear up who I enjoy, then make them a party member when I’m ready to try the next
Rose,zeta,eugene.
