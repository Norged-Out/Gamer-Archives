[[What Master Hand or Crazy Hand move did you hate as a child]]


I remember when I was young playing smash 64 I got scared whenever Master Hand did the move where he goes into the air with his hand folded kind of and then came down spinning. For some reason, I could never dodge this. I was also scared of pretty much any of crazy hands moves. I wanted to see if any one else has bad memories of fighting Master or crazy hand in the smash games as a child.


Hand drill. I got hit by that move so many times as a kid.
    Fuck that move. It always comes down right on top of you and you can't even dodge roll because the hitbox is freaking huge AND it sucks you in. With fast characters it's not too bad because they can usually escape just by sprinting, but when I'm trying to use Bowser is just like no screw you you're getting hit. 
        Yup. Bowser was one of my most playing characters in Melee so yeah I completely know what you're saying.
        You mean melee Bowser with most moves?
    How about when both hands do it at the same time? I was never able to avoid that.
    Oh my god so true ! Big issue with that one is that it's hard to avoid AND even if you're at 0% it does more than 20% and throws you with great speed laterally... Many characters can be one shot by this one without anything to do against it :( Actually I just lost against Crazy Hand because of that :'( Just before unlocking Dr. Mario, screw you Crazy Hand !
Nothing will compare to Tabuu's fucking triple pulse.

Fuck that move and everything it stands for.
    Never understood the difficulty with that one, just spot doge (although that is generally my only means of evading attacks) 
            wow
      spot doge
     such pun
       name ginger
     sorry disappoint
        The only time I ever spot dodge is by accident, so that attack always managed to hit me.


On my Intense runs of Brawl, I can usually dodge everything he can do except for the dreaded slap. It just comes out so fast and covers the ENTIRE stage. Freaking BS.
    Double jump 
All of them. No, but seriously I cannot really decide. One of his moves that I didn't like was the one where he acts like a gun and shoots you. I also didn't like when he shot lasers at you and when he grabbed and squeezed you.
    Oh man, the lasers were my favorite because if you were under him when he started, which I usually was, you can just wail on him without taking damage.
    >grabbed and squeezed

‎( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
    The gun one I didn't mind because even as a kid I mained Marth so I could just counter.
        So did I. And its why I hate the grab. You can't counter that. Or shield it. 
        Huh, you can counter the bullets? But you couldn't reflect them with a shine or Mario's cape...
            Sakurai logic. 
            Ness and Lucas can PK Magnet them. I believe GW can use his bucket as well.
            I remember reflecting them for some reason.
                Hmm, maybe my timing was off, then... I could never quite master that cape... not entirely sure about the shine, but I'd think it would be one of the most obvious things to try, and I don't seem to recall being successful...
                    I don't remember for Melee but in 64 the gun fires at a downward angle so if you reflect it the projectile won't hit master hand anyway. 
            You could with a perfect shield
                Perfect shield?
                    Power shield, perfect shield. Don't know the exact name
                        What is it? Put up your shield at the exact moment a projectile hits you, it gets reflected, or something?
                            Yeah, it doesn't work with every projectile and it differs per game.
    But the lasers are so easy! Just run under him and wail away at him... sure, you might get hit once or twice, but each individual laser doesn't do all that much damage...
I was convinced it was possible to reflect the finger tip lasers with Fox/Falcos shine. Wasn't a fan of that move, or the fingers marching on the stage. 
    It is possible.
    I tried to reflect the bullets. That did not end well...
That stupid Hand Drill
I would have 0 damage and then he would do that attack which raises my damage to like 80 and then followed by that annoying ass  bitch slap
The laugh... seriously, I was 4 or 5 when SSBM came out and I had my GameCube in my basement and I was playing with the lights off and when I saw Master Hand and he laughed I nearly shat myself. The actual move however, the one where he grabs you. I usually mashed out but the sheer feeling of helplessness when you're being grabbed is unsettling 
Did he do the spinning move in the 64 version as well? Cuz I remember being pretty scared of that at some point in time.
Hand drill is the worst by far. So powerful, it's pretty much an OHKO on higher difficulties. 
I still hate Drill + Slap combo.
Both of them clapping.
I hate when they grab you. It's just annoying. The hand drill thing they do sucks too.
The one where both of them team up, put you to sleep, and then clap three times on you.
I don't hate this, but Crazy Hand's violent Spasms always cracks me up.

But Crazy Hand's Jetstream attack where it electrocutes and sends you to your death at +50% is the sole reason I lost Event 50 so many times.
The move where Master Hand cracks Crazy Hand's knuckles. For some reason I could never dodge that.
Hand drill or Team Attacks
All I know is that I was terrified of Master Hand when I was younger.
I hate the Hand Drill and the one where he walks his fingers across the stage because its usually way to high to jump over
The grab. It was so sudden, and it did huge amounts of damage, and then he threw you for almost a guaranteed KO - only when I figured out you could mash buttons to escape was I no longer afraid!
The same move you hated. I think I only dodge it 1/20 times...
Those balls that crazy hand dropped
Never fought crazy as a kid, but Master's lasers were evil. Had no idea how to avoid them.
The skip from 64 to Melee was a rollercoaster of emotions. I'm over here fighting Master Hand and all of a sudden, TWO HANDS!? Let me tell you something, as a child, I hated the very essence of the Crazy Hand. But that one move, the hand seizure, it's not even that it was hard to dodge... it was just "what am I looking at right now?"
Fuck the hand drill, it's impossible for me to dodge it
I loved it when he shot bullets because little me was all REFLECTOR! HA GET WRECKED! 

I hated the clapping until I figured out to jump up and air dodge it. 
When you were playing against both and they'd put you to sleep, fly off stage and smack you in between. Bull Fucking Shit. I finish Master Hand before I touch Crazy nowadays just because of that move
Grab
The drill thing it did. It seemed like I could never escape it!
Drill. It's bulshit.
I was never a child when these games existed..
