[[Super Smash Bros Brawl is the best game, change my mind.]]





Meta Knight


Best campaign/story? Yes!
    544 trophies and coin launcher.

Added Boss mode.

Tripping happens 1% of the time.
        You can have an argument on whatever you want but tripping is just bad in general
            Yeah but it doesn’t give enough of a reason that this game sucks.
                Your argument isn’t that there game sucks. Your argument is that the game is the best. I think it’ll be hard to find anyone who thinks that brawl sucks simply for Subspace Emissary.
                I didn’t say that the game sucks I said that tripping sucks. If you want to go down that route tough here’s my opinion:

I like brawl for the story mode, the amount of characters it has and it also has other really cool game modes . It’s a really cool smash game to play casually and free for all’s are really fun to play.

On the other hand in a competitive manner brawl isn’t that good. The game is super floaty, it feels slow, the game wasn’t balanced very well, chain grabs are annoying and tripping makes dashing a risky to do (you might loose your stock just because you tripped, it’s not even risky in a good way because it’s random and punishing)


If it’s the best game or not depends on how much you value each parts of the game. To me brawl wasn’t ever something I played a lot since after finishing the story mode and playing all of the modes I didn’t want to play those again and I prefer playing games in other smash games
                    How would you rate the games by?
                        personally I'm more interested in the competitive part of the game
I don't want to change your mind but i think it's the worst in the series
Game itself is actual garbage but it gets points for the sheer amount of extras available
    It does it’s job for what it’s supposed to be.

A party game.

Or fighting game.
        Best smash game though? Yeah sure it does it’s job as a party game, but even when considering that, is it really the best party game out of the SSB franchise?
            Well it has the best solo and vault I’ve seen.
                Yeah but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best smash game. While you personally might enjoy those features, it isn’t the main reason people play Smash. People look to smash as a competitive high-skill and rewarding platform fighter. A lot of the mechanics introduced in smash bros brawl aim to decrease the skill ceiling in favour of a new-player-friendly environment. Even a mechanic as unlikely to occur as tripping is still working to reduce the impact that experience and practice will have in any particular match. So while brawl may be your favourite game to play in the franchise, it does not necessarily make it the best smash game as it does not satisfy what a player interprets a smash game to be.
                    🤓🤓🤓
                    I said it was my opinion about the game.
                    Just because fighting exist doesn’t make it the best game.

There has to be more than just doing the same god damn thing for 6 years
                    I'm a year late, but I can say pretty confidently that I adapted by just jumping more and experienced tripping far less frequently than people make it seem like it happened. Being high skilled was still being high skilled regardless of any of that. Melee quickest movement was a short hop anyway so I don't understand why people complain the tripping reduced the skill ceiling. If anything it forced better people to get better.

I personally feel like the newest smash is the worst for high skill because almost every character feels the same.
Mega knight is OP
The competitive nature of the game is seriously lacking unlike melee and the later smash games
It’s more rough around the edges and everything it adds gets better as the series goes on. ALSO
Tripping is trash
The music however is S tier and it’s my second favorite Smash game after the original n64 one
    At leasts it doesn’t reuse events in classic mode and has better hit boxes on the ledges in battlefield.

Which most of things I said there is what Melee lacked.
Tripping
Crazy how ultimate didn’t have a story mode like brawl, it’s could of been way better.
    What about world of light, well does it count as story mode? But still brawls adventure mode was better than world of light in my opinion
I shan't change your mind, because I entirely agree.
    Get an upvote.
**Melee.**
Its unbalanced and objectively not the best one 

But its my favorite and I think its hilarious and its the best one to mod
    Smash has always been unbalanced, even ultimate had some balancing issues.
        melee is not balance. only top 8 char win tourney usually and like half of them struggle to even compete decently against the top tier fighters
Tripping
    This guy is tripping.
It's a fantastic game in terms of single-player offerings, but it blows for multiplayer. Pop Project M on there and you've got a game that's better than both Melee and Ultimate.
    That’s another reason.

I think it’s really easy to mod brawl because of the SD cards.
Why would I change your mind? You're right.
    Get an upvote.
[removed]
    It was mine too.

I haven’t gotten all classic mode trophies or all stars and I’m going back to it to complete them all.

I never had so much enjoyment in one smash game.
    Man just says its the first one he owned and something about the story mode and gets downvoted for it
        [removed]
            For some reason lol
beat the story mode for year and still didn't got anything unlock
You are correct
I personally think Subspace is overrated. I plan on making a video about it at some point in the future. The story was fantastic but the gameplay felt very clunky and tedious, from the platforming to the enemies. I do think the boss fights are really good but that's the only part of the gameplay I really liked in Subspace.
    Of course this is how I feel about the mode. You may feel differently, which you are more than welcome to.
Meta Knight
It was my first smash game but objectively the worst one, maybe other than 64.

Melee is the best competitive version of smash

Ultimate has the most polish and best roster

Sm4sh is great but kind of unbalanced

Brawl has easily the best story mode, but by far the worst balance. MK was unbearably overpowered

    Wasnt this game a glitchy clusterfuck when it was released?
        Yeah, but it improved way more
[reasons why brawl is best](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo)
I never Played it Before i Only Have DK, Mario Bros Wii and MK wii
No Roy :(
Definitely the one i enjoyed most as a kid along w 64, but the worst fighting game of the series for sure. But for everything else, brawl was something else, story mode, classic, bosses etc, the most complete no doubt
It’s second for me, only behind ultimate
World of light couldn't make subspace emissary any brighter
Slipping.
I only started playing the series with Ultimate, so when I finally got my hands on Brawl my brother and I got completely discombobulated by the difference in movement. Not saying its bad tho, just that the game feels very different
I love brawl but the chain grab meta was god awful and it probably has the worst balance of any smash game.
Not the best game, just the best Nintendo game
random tripping
    Not good enough reason.
Tbh the Project M mod made it legendary. My favorite just under ultimate. It was so easy to install on my actual wii too
Enjoyment is subjective and I will not attempt to change your mind on what your favorite game is. Brawl is a good game. 

&#x200B;

Yes, I'm a party pooper. :P
If it wasn’t for Smash For, it would be the worst in the series. Mods are the only thing its got going for it imo

Edit: obviously thats not all it has going for it, just an exaggeration!
    Have you even played it before?
        Yes, I was young when it came out and I had gotten a Wii on release. I played hundreds of hours of this title. I loved it then, especially subspace. But as I got older, the less I liked it. The general floatyness, tripping, art design. Gameplay doesn’t feel as tight and responsive as Melee or Ultimate. It does have a banging ass soundtrack though god damn!
            Next installment should put Tabuu in the story mode.

I wonder what remix they’ll do for his boss theme.
                Honestly my hope for next smash is a smaller, tighter roster with characters having more mechanics(the mechanic I want is air grapples) and a new subspace story.

As much as I am not a fan of Brawl, Tabuu is too damn cool. He definitely needs to come back in some way, be it new boss or as a character. Smash doesn’t have a character to represent itself, after all
first one to have official online play
    Better than Nintendo toaster online.
I miss beating my friends only using down b on Wolf since it's hit ox was so ridiculous, good times
    I love it because it sticks out so much than the other games.

And many other reasons.
too floaty
    Type more than one reason.
        Bad online. Too slow. Tripping. Better alternatives
            “Bad online” Although being the first.

Every smash game is like this bozo.
                I think you should try playing ultimate. Also don’t call me bozo that is rude
Lego Star Wars the complete saga
    What?
        I thought the title of your post said best wii game
            Wait But I thought the complete saga wasn’t on the Wii.
            I did play a lot of Lego games on the Wii though.
It gets WAY too much hate. It’s my favorite smash. 

All it needed was a couple small updates and it would be the best.
    Yeah, It’s my favorite too.

People over exaggerate tripping.
I'd be fine with you saying Brawl is the best smash game. But its not the best COMPETITIVE smash game
I very much agree with you
My childhood game and first smash game 😊 I loved the story mode!
I miss its casual aspect, modern smash feels a bit too competitive.
Smash IS a casual game, it is a PARTY GAME, it was made to be one, and nintendo wants it to be one. In that case, Brawl is objectively the best smash game, every other smash game after brawl is just an excuse for the developers to deliver less content because of "competitive smash" which is a complete joke of a competitive game. Competitive smash has completely ruined the Smash Bros. franchise with their pedophilia, their lack of hygiene, and their constant sexual harassment. In 2021 literally 60% of the smash community were all exposed as sexual predators and child endangerers. Nairo, a smash ultimate player who was forgiven by the community was "Raped" by a 15 year old boy who's mouth apparently ended up on his penis, just "out of nowhere" the entire smash competitive community is full of degenerates who have taken this casual and fun game and completely ruined it by taking all of the fun parts of the game just for their "competition" 

Brawl delivered an entire campaign which had badass moments from all nintendo characters that were present in the game, you had link and mario working together, as well as Ike and Meta Knight. In Smash 4 you have 0 story mode, in Ultimate you have 0 story mode, 0 boss fights, 0 extra content. Smash used to be a celebration of nintendo characters, now smash is just another fighting game, and a franchise which is probably dead now. When Brawl was out, you had every single person playing it, little kids were playing it, college kids at parties were playing it, anyone who was anyone knew what Smash Bros. was and loved it. Nowadays, Smash doesn't have that reputation, what it has is a toxic sexist and predatory community of gatekeepers who are no better than those bronies from 2013. Ripping fun away from the hands of children and making the community dominated by fully grown immature and sweaty men.
    That’s what I mean man even though this post came out a year ago I still hold the same opinion.
        I remember everyone at my school playing Brawl when I was a kid, and all of my older cousins and their friends who were teenagers played it as well. Nowadays while Smash is a big series, most people only see it as a competitive fighting game and not as a fun party game.
            Yeah I'd Pick Casual over competitive any day. also Wiimmfi exists now
    They got rid of boss mode in exchange for nothing basically.
    

well Said, and all honesty I prefer Brawl over melee since I'm a Yoshi main because I HATED Yoshi's Model in Melee

The game is super floaty, it feels slow, the game wasn’t balanced very well, chain grabs are annoying and tripping makes dashing a risky to do (you might loose your stock just because you tripped, it’s not even risky in a good way because it’s random and punishing)


If it’s the best game or not depends on how much you value each parts of the game. To me brawl wasn’t ever something I played a lot since after finishing the story mode and playing all of the modes I didn’t want to play those again and I prefer playing games in other smash games
    How would you rate the games by?
        personally I'm more interested in the competitive part of the game
Yeah but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best smash game. While you personally might enjoy those features, it isn’t the main reason people play Smash. People look to smash as a competitive high-skill and rewarding platform fighter. A lot of the mechanics introduced in smash bros brawl aim to decrease the skill ceiling in favour of a new-player-friendly environment. Even a mechanic as unlikely to occur as tripping is still working to reduce the impact that experience and practice will have in any particular match. So while brawl may be your favourite game to play in the franchise, it does not necessarily make it the best smash game as it does not satisfy what a player interprets a smash game to be.

    I said it was my opinion about the game.
    Just because fighting exist doesn’t make it the best game.

There has to be more than just doing the same god damn thing for 6 years
    I'm a year late, but I can say pretty confidently that I adapted by just jumping more and experienced tripping far less frequently than people make it seem like it happened. Being high skilled was still being high skilled regardless of any of that. Melee quickest movement was a short hop anyway so I don't understand why people complain the tripping reduced the skill ceiling. If anything it forced better people to get better.

I personally feel like the newest smash is the worst for high skill because almost every character feels the same.
Honestly my hope for next smash is a smaller, tighter roster with characters having more mechanics(the mechanic I want is air grapples) and a new subspace story.

As much as I am not a fan of Brawl, Tabuu is too damn cool. He definitely needs to come back in some way, be it new boss or as a character. Smash doesn’t have a character to represent itself, after all
I think you should try playing ultimate. Also don’t call me bozo that is rude
