    because of stuff like this, I forget that the predator is actually as big as a real plane, I imagine it's maybe 6' wide, like a cute mini-plane
        [It's pretty small](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RQ-1_Predator_in_Iraq_2006-05-04_F-0000R-004.jpg).  Not 6' wide small, but not as big as a regular plane either.

[Ah, the good ole days...](http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/f6iym/what_i_picture_when_i_hear_friendly_dogs_incoming/)
That was my joke in Blops, "Hey, how come I've never heard 'apathetic RC-XD in your area!'"
And how do the African Militia afford these queer kill-streaks? Where do they muster up the cash for an AC-130 or Osprey Gunner?

I love it how me reposting that image from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/ru8k7/predator_missile_is/c48t73q) thread leads to other reposts.
    It looks like OP authentically came up with it themselves.  Just sayin', it's not like the whole world has seen every version of every idea.

            So you're saying that there's no possibility that OP could have never seen the top comment post, and came up with it all by themselves?
