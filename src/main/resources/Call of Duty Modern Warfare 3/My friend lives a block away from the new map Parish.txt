[[My friend lives a block away from the new map Parish]]





your friend is google street view?
    Is it not possible that he didn't have access to a photo of his friend's house and instead settled for this?
        Everyone has a phone/camera these days.
            Maybe his friend doesn't play CoD.

1: "Hey, can you take a picture of this street?"

2: "Why?"

1: "It's the basis of a map on a video game I play.  I thought it was interesting."

2: "I don't want to walk out there for that."

1: "Alright, I guess street view will suffice."
Actually it's not too late when you hear the I.M.S. go off. Stalker Pro FTW!
    I always mutter "That's not true.." whenever I see that.
I've been using Stalker Pro for so long now I forget that they usually kill more or less instantly.
        I did that too at first. I would always be like, what's the big deal with the IMS? Just shoot it! 

Then I used a different perk and it all became clear.
Clearly not the same street. There are no tanks.
We can still see the Google maps controls on the bottom picture you know? You're not fooling anyone
    looks like he fooled a lot of people looking at the upvoted....

...or maybe he is really lonely and thinks Google is his only friend
why would someone lie about that? how else would they find it.
ProTip: All he did was look at the light pole and then look up the intersection on the sign, St. Peter & Ch(garbled)s, and see if it was real.

**I just read the comments and realized where this is...**HOLY SHIT I have walked these streets in New Orleans... Now I **have** to buy the DLC.

P.S. New Orleans joke... (better out loud)... 

there was an accident on Tchoupitoulas Street, and since a horse was killed they had to do a formal police report... anyways the one cop writing everything says "hold on what street?" and the other says "chopin' to ya... no that's not right... choppin' tulips... eh hold on a secon'..." eventually they both said "screw it" and dragged the horse over to Webster St.

    Maybe because his friend does live 1 block away from there?
    I actually used to live on that block, my grandma still paints on Jackson Square.  So give me all karma
Awesome... Where is this?? The street name even looks the same , can't really read it on my iPhone 
    Jackson square in New Orleans.  It's in part of the French Quarter.

        Can't read it on my desktop either.
        Lol , oh the cell phone wars .... opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one.
            Originality. You lack it. 
                Wasn't trying to be ... Was just laughing that people argue over opinions
                    people...argue over assholes?
                        Mines better
                    Fair enough.

Parish looks like it is straight out of CoD 3.
    I like CoD but their graphics are sooooo dated. There hasn't been any graphics engine changes CoD4
        10 years later the graphics are still good
Haha, yeah regardless if he's lying or not, it still looks cool to see the comparison! 
    That place is pretty awesome. The whole French quarter (except for bourbon street) is beautiful. 

This is Jackson square, with a statue of Andrew Jackson in it and a large church. Now I have to buy this DLC just so I can see what state the statue is in.

    Sorry to hear that.
Not surprising, it's in the French Quarter of New Orleans, I've walked down that street before.
yea I live like 5 min and that is a corner of which you can't turn around. FRENCH QUARTER is a nice place to get trashed at. 
is this a free map?
Google maps? anyone else notice that red thingy at the bottom?

Unless you're friend is the Google Street View car driver, you're full of shit.
