[[Dying when using support kill streaks ]]





Support is whats been helping me play for so long. That and DZ.
It's simple, but true. I think a lot of people who are capable of getting high assault killstreaks, but are just having a terrible day, can save themselves a lot of rage and stress by swapping to support for a while. Dying to that jerk who is camping your face off is a lot less anger inducing then being 1 kill away from that killstreak you really want.
    yes, but nothing satisfies that rage like unloading an AC130 on his camping face.
        I dunno, using an EMP on that camping asshole's AC130 feels good man
I love getting an EMP and just saving for when I hear something big coming in from the other team. AHHH it feels so good!
    my favorite is taking out strafe runs...I mean in the average match all those choppers are going down anyways, still nothing like wiping them all at once.


        I feel bad for Strafe Runs, it seems like all they are there for is stinger/Blind Eye or EMP fodder. Most of the time it just feels like a worse Stealth Bomber overall.

        Do you get them added to your killstreak like you would if you shot them down when you use EMP?
            no
                Appreciate it, something I hadn't ever thought of and I haven't run EMP to find out on my own.
                    Just as trap, sentries and bombers don't count.
                        I knew they didn't, but I don't run support that often and haven't ever payed attention to whether or not the SAM added to you ks when it knocked something down.
            Hmm, not sure about that.  I did get a whole lot of points though!  (I've done this twice, and once half the choppers had been shot down)
        Something even better is taking the entire strafe run out with 2 stinger missles while equipping hardline pro.
Rage the enemy and get upwards of 7 "kills" worth towards your own killstreak!

                I'm not sure what he's saying, but HLpro obviously reduces your Kill requirement by 1, so I guess shooting down a strafe run (5 kills) and having HLpro will net you a "kills" of 6?
                hardline lowers the amount of kills required per streak by 1, the pro part lowers the deathstreak requirement.
One added benefit is that "assists" and killing certain enemy kill streaks count as a kill.
So there are 5 choppers in a strafe run, if you get all 5 thats like getting 5 kills.
My current set up is predator, airstrike and then chopper. If i shoot all of them down i get my predator, launch the pred, get a kill and get both air strike and helecopter at almost the same time.

It's happened enough that in the span of about 10 seconds i can get all three of my perks.
                    [removed]
                        probably, i'm usually so panicky in battle i pay little attention. It's when i get that thing saying my chopper is ready when i smile and know i have done good!
    Have you ever pulled an EMP while someone has had a Pave low or Osprey gunner? That shit has butt-hurt written all over it. I can actually feel the rage through the mic. 
        [removed]
            Emp a predator? I tried that a couple times and could never get it to work. 
I love running just UAV and Vests and being a big 'team player'.  You can cycle through them 3-4 times a match easy.
    I like the same with UAV/CUAV. We gonna find you!
        CUAV, Vests, XUAV.  Ultimate team player.
            Suck it:

Vests, SAM, Recon Drone. :)
                I normally do uav, Sam/vests, juggernaut.
                    If you are going to run juggernaut, you shouldn't use UAV, you have to go high anyway, so you might as well use advanced UAV. 
This is so true. I don't think the stealth bomber should be support though.
    totally agree. stealth bombers are assault, period. 
        I wish they would make it a 7 kill streak in assault. Would so use instead of shitty chopper.
            [deleted]
            But the Stealth Bomber is good for clearing out people on top of a flag, on a bomb, or on a drop zone. I think its better under Support.
                [deleted]
                    I think the juggernaut should be double riot shield, so its more defensive then the assault and can capture/plant/defuse/defend the objective better.

As for the escort airdrop, it should just drop care packs and only shoot whoever is trying to hijack them.
                        [removed]
                            
Well that is a good idea i was thinking that it would only shoot if you were trying to open a package (you see a "Capturing... " and a progress bar underneath). So you are still Supporting your team but not by Killing enemies. It would still seem unfair to have 4(?) care packs laying there vulnerable, so it would still shoot those taking them and not people just running by.

                    But when people use it, it usually fulfills a supportive role, to take people off an objective to clear a way to it. You need to have a guy who knows what hes doing for it to be effective in anyway. Plus, it isn't even that strong.

                    Welcome to r/mw3...
                Plus it's like once per match for the player, so at least it gives them a chance.
                I'd say this is what the devs had in mind for stealth bombers, but in reality it's used as a no-skill multi-kill.
    Yeah right. It fits perfectly. I see it as a reward for not picking assault and trying to camp for a ac130 but instead running and gunning and getting something nice.
I kind of enjoy getting Assault pointstreaks a bit more, but Support is still awesome. I usually use Support, but I think I'm going to make a class for Specialist and 1 or 2 for Assault. 
I feel like support is really missing something at about 8 kills. I usually run UAV/C-UAV/A-UAV primarily because I don't find the others too attractive. The vests are decent, but not really optimal in TDM, which I play 90% of the time.

If anyone has some tips or anything they'd like to share, feel free.
I think the support strike package is a great idea, and gives opportunity to many types of players. My only problem is that a lot of people tend to use the useless killstreaks, such as Stealth Bomber and support Juggernaut (come on, you get a USP and it goes down in one clip of FMG's) But using UAV's, EMP's, and most other support killstreaks is good for the player, and the whole team.
    I wouldn't call the Stealth Bomber useless. 
        It's not useless per se, it just doesn't belong in the Support chain. I wouldn't mind it if it was an assault killstreak.
Sometimes I switch to my LMG class just so that even though that little fuck is FMG running I can still call in that delicious EMP on his killstreak.
The whole idea of support killstreaks is dumb. 

>"Man getting a bunch of kills without dying is hard. I wish I could still get 'rewards' when I go 18-30."
    Except it's perfectly balanced, allows for different play styles and makes the game more accessible and fair to all players...
        In that way alone I feel like IW knew just what the hell they were doing. The point streak system is pretty balanced in my eyes. I just despise Dead Man's Hand. 
        Perfectly balanced? If being balanced means giving killstreaks to bad players aka giving rewards to people who don't deserve them is balanced..then a monkey on acid could make a better game than this.
            Yup, cause rewarding kills is clearly rewarding bad play...
                [removed]
                    Died killing a guy in TDM? No killstreak. If you don't like KS's play bare bones!
    There are a lot of objective games that would suffer if the the support streaks weren't there. When I play Dom I am constantly running around getting points. Its nice to know that I can sacrifice a life here and there to capture a point and still keep some streaks, even if they aren't as good.
    It's not a reward. The way ive always seen it is that it allows players who don't go well over positive every match a chance to compensate in terms of team contribution.
yes, but nothing satisfies that rage like unloading an AC130 on his camping face.

    I knew they didn't, but I don't run support that often and haven't ever payed attention to whether or not the SAM added to you ks when it knocked something down.

    probably, i'm usually so panicky in battle i pay little attention. It's when i get that thing saying my chopper is ready when i smile and know i have done good!
If you are going to run juggernaut, you shouldn't use UAV, you have to go high anyway, so you might as well use advanced UAV. 
I think the juggernaut should be double riot shield, so its more defensive then the assault and can capture/plant/defuse/defend the objective better.

As for the escort airdrop, it should just drop care packs and only shoot whoever is trying to hijack them.

Well that is a good idea i was thinking that it would only shoot if you were trying to open a package (you see a "Capturing... " and a progress bar underneath). So you are still Supporting your team but not by Killing enemies. It would still seem unfair to have 4(?) care packs laying there vulnerable, so it would still shoot those taking them and not people just running by.

But when people use it, it usually fulfills a supportive role, to take people off an objective to clear a way to it. You need to have a guy who knows what hes doing for it to be effective in anyway. Plus, it isn't even that strong.
