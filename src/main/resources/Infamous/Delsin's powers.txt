[[Delsin's powers]]


Many people, especially on Youtube, keep saying that when Delsin copies a   conduits powers he only gets a weaker version. Not even a theory, for  many people is basically a "fact". But....it was never stated?

I think he just lacks experience. Because every conduit in Second Son has had their powers for years, whereas Delsin only.... 2 weeks?  

Augustine says in the final boss that she and Delsin have the same  power, the only difference is that Augustine has 7 years of practice.  It’s a direct statement, the writer’s intentions are clear, imo. 
Delsin never  masters the powers he has, he’s focused in having more  instead of  practicing and gaining experience

I always assumed Delsin's powers were more of a leech ability where he   can essentially touch a prime conduit and absorb some base power and need time to fully develop it. 

During the game he used the relay cores  to just speed up the process, but nothing suggest he can't become as strong as the original user. He just needs training.

He's probably written to be a broken character.


My theory is that when Delsin steals another conduits powers, he only takes what he wants at the moment.

Like for example:

When he first leeched Hank's smoke, he just wanted to get away from the danger thus why he received a mobility based ability.

When he leeched Fetch's power, he wanted to catch her in one way or another, thus why he got her super speed and laser beams when he had to fight her.

When he leeched Eugene's power, it was basically after the fight, thus he had no intention to inherit any form of skill therefore he was basically powerless.

And when he leeched Augustine's power, what he really wanted to do more than revenge was heal his pack, so perhaps he must only have received the heal ability but no real combat ability.

(Also, just a quick fun fact but Delsin actually possesses the ground pound ability which can only be used when you are launched into the air.)
    U mean the comet drop? U can do that from jumping off buildings
He leeches off their power but he has to strengthen it, Eugene powers were literally nothing until he got a core relay to make them something.

The other conduits powers aren’t stronger, it’s just that they have used it and mastered them for far longer comparing to delsin whose had smoke powers for like a week, and the other powers for even less.
    Also he has to keep absorbing said power or what the power channels. Like with the concrete power he has to absorb the guys who have it.
        Hank had to absorb smoke at the start of the game, and Delsin notes the neon signs dim when fetch uses her power, they need to drain power sources just like delsin does.
            I assume they meant Delsin has to absorb each specific element he has access to unlike say Cole who can recharge his fire/ice with his normal electric drain rather than needing fire and ice/water and can use those abilities simultaneously whereas Delsin is stuck with whatever he last absorbed until he absorbs something else he can use
                That's because Cole never had actual full Cryokinesis rather a aspect of it to boost his electrokinesis.
                    I mean the Ice pillars are distinctly solid ice and not related to his electric powers at all outside of using some of his energy storage
                        It can also just be, you know, game mechanics. 

Where was Lucy getting her ice from? A issue InFamous 2 has among many while people shit on SS.
                            I could easily see the explanation being that Lucy pulls moisture out of the air, Nyx probably does something similar considering certain mixtures of the gases in our atmosphere are flammable (oxygen on it’s own being the obvious one)
                                Don't get me wrong, in the comic Cole tells Moya that eventually Conduits can regen their energy and don't need to depend on absorbing from sources and it's clear that the player needs to absorb alot more than lore necessity as we see bosses not need to do as often, so whatever works works. Game mechanics <.

That said Delsin has entirely completely different concepts of power. 

Smoke/combustion 
Light/Gravity
Video which contains some space and time concepts 
And concrete which I recall in their website mentioned it's mixed or sub branched to calcium, Granite, Marvel, rocks and mud. 

Even Cole electrokinesis is beyond that. Magnetism, energy manipulation, thermal manipulation and even weather control and aerokinesis.

Conduits base of power is the named one but they branch to other things so just mechanically its hard to ge consistent.
        Every conduit has to do that. Cole is a good example. Unless they got like the power of air.
        every conduit needs to drain power, that’s not an exclusively delsin thing
            Comic state Conduits can create their own energy after a while. It's mostly game mechanics that require them to absorb as much but they can produce energy themselves within due time, just not infinite. Outside I'd absorbing they can rest and lay low to rebuild. 

Read the canon comic.
    He didn't use smoke for a week though. He used all at best for 2 or 3 days. 

Everyone else even Cole had 3 months and Kessler had the path set for him. Like all Prime Conduits Delsin will grow with time.
Augustine’s comment about having the same “power” can simply be referring to concrete itself. Delsin definitely seems to get a weaker version of any power he absorbs. Looks at how he uses smoke and video compared to Hank and Eugene. Both of them have so many more abilities and a well of power. The best example being inFamous First Light. Fetch plays entirely different to Delsin, which is very apparent when you try to use Neon as Delsin in the arena mode in First Light. Delsin seems to be the embodiment of “jack of all trades, master of none”
    He can, in theory, train his abilities and get better with them with time and practice, but, as is, his abilities are weaker than the conduits he gets them from.
        Yeah because of the timeframe the game is in tru. Future hed prob be fkn ben1000 master of all
    I mean, as i said, Hank, Fetch and Eugene had years of experience and training. Delsin only two weeks. Eh, Fetch, Hank and Eugene also were experimented on to improve their powers.

Delsin did ask to Eugene to teach him the Angel power

Y'all are not giving me any real evidence from the games. I guess that we'll never know
        Well yeah it’s never really explained at all in the games which is why these discussions are cool. But I think just logically it would make sense that Delsin’s sponge ability essentially just takes the “basics” from whatever power he absorbs
        Some evidence I can think of is that Hank's smoke dash seems to cover far more distance than Delsin's, to the point that he even points it out over his phone call to Reggie, much to the latter's disbelief. Also, the upgrades Fetch has in First Light follow a completely different pattern to Delsin's for Neon.
        Delsin has technically 3 days. 

The 1 week he was KO and the 3 and half days he was in Seattle.
    Yes when your play as any other conduit, i can feel the stronger power in those attacks. It literally feels like cole and fetch patch more of a punch with thier powers in general compared to delsin.
        Fetch had 3 years training with Augustine. 

Cole had 3 months of training and experience and having every thing layer out to amp him by Kessler, while Delsin didn't.
            Even from the beginning his basic bolt felt more powerful.
                Felt. Also not everything needs to be on par to be equal in abilities. Delsins faster. Different elements hit different too. 

Lighting > Smoke in AP

Also it's a production thing, sounds and effects etc

Cause his bolts feels stronger in 1 and in 2 they just don't feel as strong but that's due to design and engine.

Let's not forget that Cole has the Ray Sphere activate his genes and exposure to it pushes your potential even higher. So, Cole had that and many things leading to him becoming the most powerful.

Delsin replicates the Prime Conduit gene so if he would have absorbed Coles, most likely he'd be blasting his attack just as hard.
                    Hmm..your last paragraph's theory is a interesting one. Out of all then prime conduits he's leeched from, he still hasn't done so from a prime conduit who has actually used the ray sphere. I do wonder if that would indeed have some effect.
                        I don't see why that would affect his replication however I do think his replication potency is based on compability. Like, some matter and elements may be harder or easier on his body to utilize. 

Delsin with the Ray Sphere would be interesting, I feel that would allow him to swap or use all his powers ar once or at least a few at once.
    Delsin had 4 powers and had to use them all in 3 days only. 

With experience Delsin like all Conduits would be able to grow and stress his powers. A dead drop with Wolfe states that Augustine was scared of Delsins true potential.  Literally give Delsin 3 months of using his 4 powers like Cole had for electrokinesis and Delsin would be the most powerful Conduit.

People forget he only was in Seattle 3 days and a half. For 4 powers he became very exceptional and only Cole and Delson can benefit from core relays
        Wait only three days? That doesn’t make sense it feels like a week or two at the very least?
            Week he was KO.

3 days he does everything, I believe 4th he beats Augustine. Replay it. Literally 3 days pass.
                I did yesterday and just started a new one but the only thing I remember of them telling how long something took is the week he spent in a coma
                    I'm game after he gets to Seattle after he destroys Space Needle DUP towers a passes. 

Later after he gets Neon and helps Fetch and they have sex, a day passes as Fetch apologizes for lighting a room cause it's been a long time since she...concluded.

After Video and fighting Augustine with Video is another day. 

Searching for Hank, finds him. Remains low. Fights her at night. 

At best its 4 days.
                        Delsin himself says to Augustine that it’s been a couple weeks already.
                            Then he was KO for 2. 

In game you literally see the day pass from morning. To noon to after noon to night.
                                He’s KO for one week, and he tells Augustine it’s been a couple weeks. It’s ridiculous to think Delsin could liberate the entire city and do literally all he does in 3 days, even with all his powers. We see transitions from day to night and from night to day sure, but that doesn’t mean that’s the only time that passes.
                                    We see 3 days pass and he hid. 

He would attack and dismantled the DUP via ambush and later had help. 

It's ridiculous how " we see a time laps of the days" and ignore it. Even Reggie says lay low until tmrw morning like 3 times. 

This is you now being stubborn. I won't be going in circles when the game shows literally 3 at best 4 days pass for Delsin to dismantle and beat the DUP.
                            Can also be a general statement he said but you literally see the 3 days pass in game in real time.
My personal theory is that conduit powers work like a muscle, the more you use it, the more you can do with it. Core relays work like steroids, cutting out the training and letting Delsin do things he'd normally have to train to be capable of doing.
    I get what you're saying, but that's not how steroids work. If you pump a couch potato full of steroids, they won't just get jacked all of the sudden, but they might get the rush to go work out and get jacked.

You still need to put in time even if you're juiced up. The juice just makes the process faster and easier, but once it wears off, you can lose some of your gains if you're not keeping up.
But he does get a weaker version of the powers. If that wasn’t true you wouldn’t need core relays to actually do some of the basic abilities. 

Another reason that supports this is the fact that when each power is fully upgraded it’s still nothing compared to the OG version everyone else has

Until we get another game or some source material saying other wise, you literally play the game with weaker versions of everyone else’s powers
    You do realize rhat those people had years to practice those abilities, right? The core relays are basically like cheat codes to unlock stuff early
        Except that isn’t true. Delsin literally says it’s for him to get a new power. When he absorbs video he literally gets nothing.

When you absorb neon you can’t fire anything. You really expect me to believe that it’s easier to turn your whole body into neon streaks compared to firing something out of your hand?
            Meh, gameplay's gonna gameplay. Plus, same thing happened with smoke, he had the dash first. And even then, he was trying to control it. Either way, we have no way of knowing since those core relays existed. We're talking about a guy who just discovered his powers, with no real training. Like I said, everyone else had the time to figure out how to master their powers, Delsin never had that luxury.

Edit: a few typos
    He used the relay cores to just speed up the process
    Again someone who doesn't pay attention to the game...

Delsin got KO by Augustine for a week. 

Went to Seattle and defeated a OP Conduit by himself with only 3 and a half days of using 4 powers. 

Fetch with 3 years of training and Eugene with 3 as well by Augsutine to be broken Conduits couldn't beat Augustine, Delsin did what he lacked in technique he used raw power and adaptation. 

Give Delsin 3 months like Cole and he most likely becomes a God. 

Also only Cole and Delsin can absorb Cores. AUGUSTINE tried and she was knocked out.
        You said literally nothing about his powers however

Yes Delsin beat Augustine In like 3 days but that literally just says that the DUP and Augustine just weren’t that good. 

And it’s bad plot

Also Delsin and Cole aren’t the only ones to use blast cores. It’s stated in infamous 2 that a test subject of wolfes got too close and absorbed one. Bertrand also used one to get the power to corrupt people as well.
            That's your head canon. 

They managed to capture and secure almost every Conduit, nothing in lore states that they were incompetent, nor does game play limitations render Augustind bad or weak.

No it's not a bad plot. It's a sensible one. 

Yeah extreme rare events. Augustine tried and couldn't.

Augustine "I have 7 years of experience" 

Wolfe "  Augustine fears your potential"

Yeah 3 days vs everyone else who has have years of experience.

Conduits grow with time. If Delsins not a Conduit then he wouldn't but nothing makes him be the sole Conduit to not be able to expand and grow. You'd have to prove he's the sole Conduit to have no ability to grow like other Conduits which nowhere in game does this state that.
He gets a weaker “base” version than other conduits, from what we’ve seen. Best example is Infamous 1 first half hr. He says “it feels stronger” and about 10 min later his power “evolves” into the shockwave. Mind you, we have only seen Delsin with powers during the first few days (possibly weeks, dont remember how long it took him to get to Seattle) and it doesn’t evolve without outside stimuli (blast cores). 

I’d say his advantage is versatility. Where others are stronger, he’s more versatile.
    Again Delsin only has 3 days in Seattle. How was he suppose to evolve in 3 days while using 4 powers? Cole had 3 months and a half and had everything layed out for him by Kessler?

Wolfe brother even states Augustine was afraid of his true potential and "have my power, but I have 7 years of experience" proves Conduits grow with time. Nothing suggest that's it for him when the events took 3 days when Fetch had 2 years and Eugene had 3 of training.
        Actually Infamous 1 “Act 1” takes place about 2 weeks after the Ray Sphere explosion. Infamous 2 is about 3 an a half monthes though I believe. And you do make a fair point. But this is one of the things we can only speculate on because of bad lore design.
            Irrelevant, my point was Cole has about 3 months and a half with his powers and had Kessler set the path for him.

No, what bad lore? Every prime Conduit grows with power nothing is left vague about that nor contradicts it. 

Delsin literally 3 days in Seattle versus everyone else months or years with powers. Nothing about SS in terms of growth for Conduits is "bad lore". 

We have statements such as "Augustine fears your potential" and " have my power but I have 7 years experience" which indicate growth in time. As all Prime Conduits.

This hyperbole that SS is bad at lore is exaggerate and people wither didn't pay attention or use bad vs vague. 

Even then nothing says Delsin, a prime Conduit can't grow. He will like  all primes do.
                The “bad lore” I’m talking about is that we have no clue whether or not Delsins powers in universe will actually grow. The only time we ever saw it “grow” was after touching  a blast shard or blast core. Best example is the Augustine boss fight. He gains the powers, gets blast cores, and grows. At no point in the game is actually hinted that his “gained” powers are capable of growing naturally. His “prime” power is the power to copy other powers. 

That could easily grow into making his copies stronger from the start. But we are never told whether or not it’s possible for a copied power to grow stronger by itself. Not even a mention.
                    All Prime Conduits grow. He's a prime Conduit. Simple. 

Only difference is he needs to replicate another Prime Conduits specific genes. I don't see this "we don't know", when all Primes grow in time. 

So I respectfully 10000 % disagree.
                        We know prime conduits grow. The issue here is we are not told whether his “powers” are his “power” or a result of his “power”. If they are his “power” than yes they will grow.  But if they are a result of his “power”, a byproduct of it so to speak, than we can’t be sure.
                            That's just a weird nitpick, that it needs to be 100% confirmed. If his powers grow naturally then clearly like all Conduits time and experience will help increase his abilities. 

That's why we need a sequel to fix the many things they rushed cause of Sony. Celia waged war on people and has info that Augustine gathered on the First Sons. 

Easy way to finish and answer however we can't assume "nah he not getting better" when a Prime Conduit powers grow regardless. So something of his gets better. Also Karma Bombs outclassed many of the Conduits he replicated from in some degree.
                                Perfectly agree with sequel idea. Most of theory comes from how blast shards work in Second Son as a “jumpstart” for the power evolution.
                                    End it with Delsin and start a new separate Saga in some other country. Maybe this can be a canonical bad guy and was experimented by their respective goverment. 


Delsin can be around but in the US and they stay away since Delsin and Zeke are on it guardians of NA. With Fetch and new friends and allies.

That said Night City's map from Cyberpunk 2077 would be a sick ass play ground to insert Delsin in.
                                    Another note to add bud is, the cores only accelerate his growth. They're his rare candies but for his powers abilities. If he didn't have the % to grow he wouldn't get new moves via the Cores cause that's all they do for him that and amp his stats as a whole lore wise.
Gameplay wise, it is weaker. Lore wise he's just amateurish but gets the grasp of it quickly. Hell he even gets the upperhand and beats Augustine too.
    Exactly but people want to down play cause he's not Cole or didn't pay attention...

He was in Seattle for 3 days. 

Cole has 3 months Ray Sphere and Kessler layed out everything for him to amp yo true potential.

Fetch had 2 years of training by Augustine and was already using her powers for years.

Eugene had trained with Augustine for 3 years...

Hank had em for 7

Augustine had em for 7.
    Even in gameplay is he really weaker when he literally beats all of them ? I get that they can fly better and run better and even shoot better but delsin still beats them anyways and do they have their own versions of the orbital drop ? Pretty much the most OP attack ? cause I’m not sure if they even have that or not so I think delsin is still the most powerfull despite them doing specific things better
The simple fact is that there’s nothing to suggest he will get more powerful with each ability. None of us nor the characters know how his powers work exactly.
    We do know that conduits get stronger naturally over time from infamous 1. We also know that Delsin had JUST gotten his abilities at the beginning of the game. Even Cole was held up in a hospital for a while to acclimate to his new powers and he STILL isn't in complete control of them by the second game (he electrifies himself if he's in too much water).

There's nothing to suggest Delsin WON'T get more powerful and actually a lot to suggest that he's only at the very beginning, and that his current powers are the weakest they ever will be.
        Cole getting hurt in water has nothing to do with his control over his powers. Cole is considered fully developed by the end of inFAMOUS 1. The only reason that changes is due to his fight with >!The Beast!<.

Delsin speeds up his development with Blast Cores. He’s just skipping ahead basically. His karmic finishers are his final development for each power.
            The final boss at the end of infamous 1 tells Cole directly that he will get more powerful. The entire reason for Cole getting his powers at that point in time was so that he could get powerful enough to stop the beast because his old self couldn't. Even though he eventually got powerful enough to literally time-travel. 

His whole plan was based on the fact that Cole gets more powerful over time, but not fast enough to save the world from the beast, and he still isn't in infamous 2. To the point that he needs to actively seek more power in a new city instead of developing his powers naturally, like the original plan.
    Negative. All Conduits get more powerful with time and Delsin only had 3 days with 4 powers. WOLFES brother states that Augustine fears what Delsin would become with time and how OP he technically can become.

Delsin has to become exceptional with 4 powers whole even Cole had 3 months and everything layer out for him to amp, Fetch, Eugene trained by Augustine 2 and 3 years respectively and Augustine literally says "hVe my power but I have 7 years of experience" implying time to use grow and evolve with said power. 

Whatever hate boner you have with Delsin growing shows.
        I would’ve actually respected and properly responded to your comment but then you claimed that I have a hate boner for Delsin out of nowhere. Weird thing to say when my comment was perfectly neutral. Relax.
            Unless I'm confusing you with someone else I've debated here, I apologize
He has their powers, but a different expression of it, we can see this best with Neon, despite using it in very similar ways, they each have their own spin on it that makes it powerful.
Delsin needs the energy from the devices to become more powerful. He starts with basically the bare minimum when he absorbs like video you have literally nothing. You need the shards to make yourself more powerful where in infamous 1 and 2 you gain more power by experience.
    That only stressed and speeds up his ability learning. 

Only Cole and Del were able to absorb Cores. When Augustine tried I believe it KO her out as stated by Wolfes brother.
I feel like he could have mastery over all of his powers, but his real problem would be having to balance them all. He has four, he'd have to master all four to truly have any semblance of skill compared to the others.
Does anyone remember the power transfer machine from one of the other games, I always assu.ed it worked a bit like that
Speaking of powers what do you guys think the ultimate for concrete would have been
    Turning into a rock golem and slamming into the ground stunning everyone around you, or creating ground spikes to impale them if you went the evil route maybe?
        If you could combined both that be badass
I think a dev confirmed he gets a demo version something a long the lines of "He can't do everything that they can do." But maybe that just means he usually expresses their power differently or doesnt have access to the full potential like the og conduit.
    Seen all interviews...never seen that and even so. Devs alone unless Nate Foxx stated it doesn't make it fact. 

Also in game statements like Wolfes brother mentions Augustine feared his true potential and Augustine says " I have 7 years of experience". Implying Conduits period get stronger regardless.
        Well its true, I don't know what else to tell ya.
            That doesn't mean anything. Devs alone aren't word of God. What was their position?

Not to sound rude but regardless in game lore all the games have said Conduits powers grow with time. Delsin is a prime Conduit, so within game lore that point is disregarded as some devs are not all knowing of in game lore. 

We have that with Skyrim as a example.
                Just because youre a delsin fan doesn't mean anything either. I said what I said.
[deleted]
     No he’s not as in the beginning of the game the hand scanner marks him as a prime conduit
Delsin is a prime Conduit who only managed to explore his capabilities in Seattle for 3 days using 4 different matter elements.  Like all Prime Conduits he will grow with given time and experience with his powers, as nothing states he can't, whether his growth rate is faster or slower that's debatable and how his powers branch out but he will grow regardless. 

Simple. Anything else is just headcanon limitations.
That and (SPOILER AHEAD) According to the evil karma ending Delsin absorbs an unknown number of conduits abilities, and if he were to train them all a future Delsin could be wildly powerful as a hero or villain.
U mean the comet drop? U can do that from jumping off buildings
Also he has to keep absorbing said power or what the power channels. Like with the concrete power he has to absorb the guys who have it.
    Hank had to absorb smoke at the start of the game, and Delsin notes the neon signs dim when fetch uses her power, they need to drain power sources just like delsin does.
        I assume they meant Delsin has to absorb each specific element he has access to unlike say Cole who can recharge his fire/ice with his normal electric drain rather than needing fire and ice/water and can use those abilities simultaneously whereas Delsin is stuck with whatever he last absorbed until he absorbs something else he can use
            That's because Cole never had actual full Cryokinesis rather a aspect of it to boost his electrokinesis.
                I mean the Ice pillars are distinctly solid ice and not related to his electric powers at all outside of using some of his energy storage
                    It can also just be, you know, game mechanics. 

Where was Lucy getting her ice from? A issue InFamous 2 has among many while people shit on SS.
                        I could easily see the explanation being that Lucy pulls moisture out of the air, Nyx probably does something similar considering certain mixtures of the gases in our atmosphere are flammable (oxygen on it’s own being the obvious one)
                            Don't get me wrong, in the comic Cole tells Moya that eventually Conduits can regen their energy and don't need to depend on absorbing from sources and it's clear that the player needs to absorb alot more than lore necessity as we see bosses not need to do as often, so whatever works works. Game mechanics <.

That said Delsin has entirely completely different concepts of power. 

Smoke/combustion 
Light/Gravity
Video which contains some space and time concepts 
And concrete which I recall in their website mentioned it's mixed or sub branched to calcium, Granite, Marvel, rocks and mud. 

Even Cole electrokinesis is beyond that. Magnetism, energy manipulation, thermal manipulation and even weather control and aerokinesis.

Conduits base of power is the named one but they branch to other things so just mechanically its hard to ge consistent.
    Every conduit has to do that. Cole is a good example. Unless they got like the power of air.
    every conduit needs to drain power, that’s not an exclusively delsin thing
        Comic state Conduits can create their own energy after a while. It's mostly game mechanics that require them to absorb as much but they can produce energy themselves within due time, just not infinite. Outside I'd absorbing they can rest and lay low to rebuild. 

Read the canon comic.
He didn't use smoke for a week though. He used all at best for 2 or 3 days. 

Everyone else even Cole had 3 months and Kessler had the path set for him. Like all Prime Conduits Delsin will grow with time.
He can, in theory, train his abilities and get better with them with time and practice, but, as is, his abilities are weaker than the conduits he gets them from.
    Yeah because of the timeframe the game is in tru. Future hed prob be fkn ben1000 master of all
I mean, as i said, Hank, Fetch and Eugene had years of experience and training. Delsin only two weeks. Eh, Fetch, Hank and Eugene also were experimented on to improve their powers.

Delsin did ask to Eugene to teach him the Angel power

Y'all are not giving me any real evidence from the games. I guess that we'll never know
    Well yeah it’s never really explained at all in the games which is why these discussions are cool. But I think just logically it would make sense that Delsin’s sponge ability essentially just takes the “basics” from whatever power he absorbs
    Some evidence I can think of is that Hank's smoke dash seems to cover far more distance than Delsin's, to the point that he even points it out over his phone call to Reggie, much to the latter's disbelief. Also, the upgrades Fetch has in First Light follow a completely different pattern to Delsin's for Neon.
    Delsin has technically 3 days. 

The 1 week he was KO and the 3 and half days he was in Seattle.
Yes when your play as any other conduit, i can feel the stronger power in those attacks. It literally feels like cole and fetch patch more of a punch with thier powers in general compared to delsin.
    Fetch had 3 years training with Augustine. 

Cole had 3 months of training and experience and having every thing layer out to amp him by Kessler, while Delsin didn't.
        Even from the beginning his basic bolt felt more powerful.
            Felt. Also not everything needs to be on par to be equal in abilities. Delsins faster. Different elements hit different too. 

Lighting > Smoke in AP

Also it's a production thing, sounds and effects etc

Cause his bolts feels stronger in 1 and in 2 they just don't feel as strong but that's due to design and engine.

Let's not forget that Cole has the Ray Sphere activate his genes and exposure to it pushes your potential even higher. So, Cole had that and many things leading to him becoming the most powerful.

Delsin replicates the Prime Conduit gene so if he would have absorbed Coles, most likely he'd be blasting his attack just as hard.
                Hmm..your last paragraph's theory is a interesting one. Out of all then prime conduits he's leeched from, he still hasn't done so from a prime conduit who has actually used the ray sphere. I do wonder if that would indeed have some effect.
                    I don't see why that would affect his replication however I do think his replication potency is based on compability. Like, some matter and elements may be harder or easier on his body to utilize. 

Delsin with the Ray Sphere would be interesting, I feel that would allow him to swap or use all his powers ar once or at least a few at once.
Delsin had 4 powers and had to use them all in 3 days only. 

With experience Delsin like all Conduits would be able to grow and stress his powers. A dead drop with Wolfe states that Augustine was scared of Delsins true potential.  Literally give Delsin 3 months of using his 4 powers like Cole had for electrokinesis and Delsin would be the most powerful Conduit.

People forget he only was in Seattle 3 days and a half. For 4 powers he became very exceptional and only Cole and Delson can benefit from core relays
    Wait only three days? That doesn’t make sense it feels like a week or two at the very least?
        Week he was KO.

3 days he does everything, I believe 4th he beats Augustine. Replay it. Literally 3 days pass.
            I did yesterday and just started a new one but the only thing I remember of them telling how long something took is the week he spent in a coma
                I'm game after he gets to Seattle after he destroys Space Needle DUP towers a passes. 

Later after he gets Neon and helps Fetch and they have sex, a day passes as Fetch apologizes for lighting a room cause it's been a long time since she...concluded.

After Video and fighting Augustine with Video is another day. 

Searching for Hank, finds him. Remains low. Fights her at night. 

At best its 4 days.
                    Delsin himself says to Augustine that it’s been a couple weeks already.
                        Then he was KO for 2. 

In game you literally see the day pass from morning. To noon to after noon to night.
                            He’s KO for one week, and he tells Augustine it’s been a couple weeks. It’s ridiculous to think Delsin could liberate the entire city and do literally all he does in 3 days, even with all his powers. We see transitions from day to night and from night to day sure, but that doesn’t mean that’s the only time that passes.
                                We see 3 days pass and he hid. 

He would attack and dismantled the DUP via ambush and later had help. 

It's ridiculous how " we see a time laps of the days" and ignore it. Even Reggie says lay low until tmrw morning like 3 times. 

This is you now being stubborn. I won't be going in circles when the game shows literally 3 at best 4 days pass for Delsin to dismantle and beat the DUP.
                        Can also be a general statement he said but you literally see the 3 days pass in game in real time.
I get what you're saying, but that's not how steroids work. If you pump a couch potato full of steroids, they won't just get jacked all of the sudden, but they might get the rush to go work out and get jacked.

You still need to put in time even if you're juiced up. The juice just makes the process faster and easier, but once it wears off, you can lose some of your gains if you're not keeping up.
You do realize rhat those people had years to practice those abilities, right? The core relays are basically like cheat codes to unlock stuff early
    Except that isn’t true. Delsin literally says it’s for him to get a new power. When he absorbs video he literally gets nothing.

When you absorb neon you can’t fire anything. You really expect me to believe that it’s easier to turn your whole body into neon streaks compared to firing something out of your hand?
        Meh, gameplay's gonna gameplay. Plus, same thing happened with smoke, he had the dash first. And even then, he was trying to control it. Either way, we have no way of knowing since those core relays existed. We're talking about a guy who just discovered his powers, with no real training. Like I said, everyone else had the time to figure out how to master their powers, Delsin never had that luxury.

Edit: a few typos
He used the relay cores to just speed up the process
Again someone who doesn't pay attention to the game...

Delsin got KO by Augustine for a week. 

Went to Seattle and defeated a OP Conduit by himself with only 3 and a half days of using 4 powers. 

Fetch with 3 years of training and Eugene with 3 as well by Augsutine to be broken Conduits couldn't beat Augustine, Delsin did what he lacked in technique he used raw power and adaptation. 

Give Delsin 3 months like Cole and he most likely becomes a God. 

Also only Cole and Delsin can absorb Cores. AUGUSTINE tried and she was knocked out.
    You said literally nothing about his powers however

Yes Delsin beat Augustine In like 3 days but that literally just says that the DUP and Augustine just weren’t that good. 

And it’s bad plot

Also Delsin and Cole aren’t the only ones to use blast cores. It’s stated in infamous 2 that a test subject of wolfes got too close and absorbed one. Bertrand also used one to get the power to corrupt people as well.
        That's your head canon. 

They managed to capture and secure almost every Conduit, nothing in lore states that they were incompetent, nor does game play limitations render Augustind bad or weak.

No it's not a bad plot. It's a sensible one. 

Yeah extreme rare events. Augustine tried and couldn't.

Augustine "I have 7 years of experience" 

Wolfe "  Augustine fears your potential"

Yeah 3 days vs everyone else who has have years of experience.

Conduits grow with time. If Delsins not a Conduit then he wouldn't but nothing makes him be the sole Conduit to not be able to expand and grow. You'd have to prove he's the sole Conduit to have no ability to grow like other Conduits which nowhere in game does this state that.
Again Delsin only has 3 days in Seattle. How was he suppose to evolve in 3 days while using 4 powers? Cole had 3 months and a half and had everything layed out for him by Kessler?

Wolfe brother even states Augustine was afraid of his true potential and "have my power, but I have 7 years of experience" proves Conduits grow with time. Nothing suggest that's it for him when the events took 3 days when Fetch had 2 years and Eugene had 3 of training.
    Actually Infamous 1 “Act 1” takes place about 2 weeks after the Ray Sphere explosion. Infamous 2 is about 3 an a half monthes though I believe. And you do make a fair point. But this is one of the things we can only speculate on because of bad lore design.
        Irrelevant, my point was Cole has about 3 months and a half with his powers and had Kessler set the path for him.

No, what bad lore? Every prime Conduit grows with power nothing is left vague about that nor contradicts it. 

Delsin literally 3 days in Seattle versus everyone else months or years with powers. Nothing about SS in terms of growth for Conduits is "bad lore". 

We have statements such as "Augustine fears your potential" and " have my power but I have 7 years experience" which indicate growth in time. As all Prime Conduits.

This hyperbole that SS is bad at lore is exaggerate and people wither didn't pay attention or use bad vs vague. 

Even then nothing says Delsin, a prime Conduit can't grow. He will like  all primes do.
            The “bad lore” I’m talking about is that we have no clue whether or not Delsins powers in universe will actually grow. The only time we ever saw it “grow” was after touching  a blast shard or blast core. Best example is the Augustine boss fight. He gains the powers, gets blast cores, and grows. At no point in the game is actually hinted that his “gained” powers are capable of growing naturally. His “prime” power is the power to copy other powers. 

That could easily grow into making his copies stronger from the start. But we are never told whether or not it’s possible for a copied power to grow stronger by itself. Not even a mention.
                All Prime Conduits grow. He's a prime Conduit. Simple. 

Only difference is he needs to replicate another Prime Conduits specific genes. I don't see this "we don't know", when all Primes grow in time. 

So I respectfully 10000 % disagree.
                    We know prime conduits grow. The issue here is we are not told whether his “powers” are his “power” or a result of his “power”. If they are his “power” than yes they will grow.  But if they are a result of his “power”, a byproduct of it so to speak, than we can’t be sure.
                        That's just a weird nitpick, that it needs to be 100% confirmed. If his powers grow naturally then clearly like all Conduits time and experience will help increase his abilities. 

That's why we need a sequel to fix the many things they rushed cause of Sony. Celia waged war on people and has info that Augustine gathered on the First Sons. 

Easy way to finish and answer however we can't assume "nah he not getting better" when a Prime Conduit powers grow regardless. So something of his gets better. Also Karma Bombs outclassed many of the Conduits he replicated from in some degree.
                            Perfectly agree with sequel idea. Most of theory comes from how blast shards work in Second Son as a “jumpstart” for the power evolution.
                                End it with Delsin and start a new separate Saga in some other country. Maybe this can be a canonical bad guy and was experimented by their respective goverment. 


Delsin can be around but in the US and they stay away since Delsin and Zeke are on it guardians of NA. With Fetch and new friends and allies.

That said Night City's map from Cyberpunk 2077 would be a sick ass play ground to insert Delsin in.
                                Another note to add bud is, the cores only accelerate his growth. They're his rare candies but for his powers abilities. If he didn't have the % to grow he wouldn't get new moves via the Cores cause that's all they do for him that and amp his stats as a whole lore wise.
Exactly but people want to down play cause he's not Cole or didn't pay attention...

He was in Seattle for 3 days. 

Cole has 3 months Ray Sphere and Kessler layed out everything for him to amp yo true potential.

Fetch had 2 years of training by Augustine and was already using her powers for years.

Eugene had trained with Augustine for 3 years...

Hank had em for 7

Augustine had em for 7.
Even in gameplay is he really weaker when he literally beats all of them ? I get that they can fly better and run better and even shoot better but delsin still beats them anyways and do they have their own versions of the orbital drop ? Pretty much the most OP attack ? cause I’m not sure if they even have that or not so I think delsin is still the most powerfull despite them doing specific things better
We do know that conduits get stronger naturally over time from infamous 1. We also know that Delsin had JUST gotten his abilities at the beginning of the game. Even Cole was held up in a hospital for a while to acclimate to his new powers and he STILL isn't in complete control of them by the second game (he electrifies himself if he's in too much water).

There's nothing to suggest Delsin WON'T get more powerful and actually a lot to suggest that he's only at the very beginning, and that his current powers are the weakest they ever will be.
    Cole getting hurt in water has nothing to do with his control over his powers. Cole is considered fully developed by the end of inFAMOUS 1. The only reason that changes is due to his fight with >!The Beast!<.

Delsin speeds up his development with Blast Cores. He’s just skipping ahead basically. His karmic finishers are his final development for each power.
        The final boss at the end of infamous 1 tells Cole directly that he will get more powerful. The entire reason for Cole getting his powers at that point in time was so that he could get powerful enough to stop the beast because his old self couldn't. Even though he eventually got powerful enough to literally time-travel. 

His whole plan was based on the fact that Cole gets more powerful over time, but not fast enough to save the world from the beast, and he still isn't in infamous 2. To the point that he needs to actively seek more power in a new city instead of developing his powers naturally, like the original plan.
Negative. All Conduits get more powerful with time and Delsin only had 3 days with 4 powers. WOLFES brother states that Augustine fears what Delsin would become with time and how OP he technically can become.

Delsin has to become exceptional with 4 powers whole even Cole had 3 months and everything layer out for him to amp, Fetch, Eugene trained by Augustine 2 and 3 years respectively and Augustine literally says "hVe my power but I have 7 years of experience" implying time to use grow and evolve with said power. 

Whatever hate boner you have with Delsin growing shows.
    I would’ve actually respected and properly responded to your comment but then you claimed that I have a hate boner for Delsin out of nowhere. Weird thing to say when my comment was perfectly neutral. Relax.
        Unless I'm confusing you with someone else I've debated here, I apologize
That only stressed and speeds up his ability learning. 

Only Cole and Del were able to absorb Cores. When Augustine tried I believe it KO her out as stated by Wolfes brother.
Turning into a rock golem and slamming into the ground stunning everyone around you, or creating ground spikes to impale them if you went the evil route maybe?
    If you could combined both that be badass
Seen all interviews...never seen that and even so. Devs alone unless Nate Foxx stated it doesn't make it fact. 

Also in game statements like Wolfes brother mentions Augustine feared his true potential and Augustine says " I have 7 years of experience". Implying Conduits period get stronger regardless.
    Well its true, I don't know what else to tell ya.
        That doesn't mean anything. Devs alone aren't word of God. What was their position?

Not to sound rude but regardless in game lore all the games have said Conduits powers grow with time. Delsin is a prime Conduit, so within game lore that point is disregarded as some devs are not all knowing of in game lore. 

We have that with Skyrim as a example.
            Just because youre a delsin fan doesn't mean anything either. I said what I said.
 No he’s not as in the beginning of the game the hand scanner marks him as a prime conduit
Hank had to absorb smoke at the start of the game, and Delsin notes the neon signs dim when fetch uses her power, they need to drain power sources just like delsin does.
    I assume they meant Delsin has to absorb each specific element he has access to unlike say Cole who can recharge his fire/ice with his normal electric drain rather than needing fire and ice/water and can use those abilities simultaneously whereas Delsin is stuck with whatever he last absorbed until he absorbs something else he can use
        That's because Cole never had actual full Cryokinesis rather a aspect of it to boost his electrokinesis.
            I mean the Ice pillars are distinctly solid ice and not related to his electric powers at all outside of using some of his energy storage
                It can also just be, you know, game mechanics. 

Where was Lucy getting her ice from? A issue InFamous 2 has among many while people shit on SS.
                    I could easily see the explanation being that Lucy pulls moisture out of the air, Nyx probably does something similar considering certain mixtures of the gases in our atmosphere are flammable (oxygen on it’s own being the obvious one)
                        Don't get me wrong, in the comic Cole tells Moya that eventually Conduits can regen their energy and don't need to depend on absorbing from sources and it's clear that the player needs to absorb alot more than lore necessity as we see bosses not need to do as often, so whatever works works. Game mechanics <.

That said Delsin has entirely completely different concepts of power. 

Smoke/combustion 
Light/Gravity
Video which contains some space and time concepts 
And concrete which I recall in their website mentioned it's mixed or sub branched to calcium, Granite, Marvel, rocks and mud. 

Even Cole electrokinesis is beyond that. Magnetism, energy manipulation, thermal manipulation and even weather control and aerokinesis.

Conduits base of power is the named one but they branch to other things so just mechanically its hard to ge consistent.
Every conduit has to do that. Cole is a good example. Unless they got like the power of air.
every conduit needs to drain power, that’s not an exclusively delsin thing
    Comic state Conduits can create their own energy after a while. It's mostly game mechanics that require them to absorb as much but they can produce energy themselves within due time, just not infinite. Outside I'd absorbing they can rest and lay low to rebuild. 

Read the canon comic.
Yeah because of the timeframe the game is in tru. Future hed prob be fkn ben1000 master of all
Well yeah it’s never really explained at all in the games which is why these discussions are cool. But I think just logically it would make sense that Delsin’s sponge ability essentially just takes the “basics” from whatever power he absorbs
Some evidence I can think of is that Hank's smoke dash seems to cover far more distance than Delsin's, to the point that he even points it out over his phone call to Reggie, much to the latter's disbelief. Also, the upgrades Fetch has in First Light follow a completely different pattern to Delsin's for Neon.
Delsin has technically 3 days. 

The 1 week he was KO and the 3 and half days he was in Seattle.
Fetch had 3 years training with Augustine. 

Cole had 3 months of training and experience and having every thing layer out to amp him by Kessler, while Delsin didn't.
    Even from the beginning his basic bolt felt more powerful.
        Felt. Also not everything needs to be on par to be equal in abilities. Delsins faster. Different elements hit different too. 

Lighting > Smoke in AP

Also it's a production thing, sounds and effects etc

Cause his bolts feels stronger in 1 and in 2 they just don't feel as strong but that's due to design and engine.

Let's not forget that Cole has the Ray Sphere activate his genes and exposure to it pushes your potential even higher. So, Cole had that and many things leading to him becoming the most powerful.

Delsin replicates the Prime Conduit gene so if he would have absorbed Coles, most likely he'd be blasting his attack just as hard.
            Hmm..your last paragraph's theory is a interesting one. Out of all then prime conduits he's leeched from, he still hasn't done so from a prime conduit who has actually used the ray sphere. I do wonder if that would indeed have some effect.
                I don't see why that would affect his replication however I do think his replication potency is based on compability. Like, some matter and elements may be harder or easier on his body to utilize. 

Delsin with the Ray Sphere would be interesting, I feel that would allow him to swap or use all his powers ar once or at least a few at once.
Wait only three days? That doesn’t make sense it feels like a week or two at the very least?
    Week he was KO.

In game you literally see the day pass from morning. To noon to after noon to night.
                        He’s KO for one week, and he tells Augustine it’s been a couple weeks.

                    That's just a weird nitpick, that it needs to be 100% confirmed. If his powers grow naturally then clearly like all Conduits time and experience will help increase his abilities. 

That's why we need a sequel to fix the many things they rushed cause of Sony. Celia waged war on people and has info that Augustine gathered on the First Sons. 

Easy way to finish and answer however we can't assume "nah he not getting better" when a Prime Conduit powers grow regardless. So something of his gets better. Also Karma Bombs outclassed many of the Conduits he replicated from in some degree.
                        Perfectly agree with sequel idea. Most of theory comes from how blast shards work in Second Son as a “jumpstart” for the power evolution.
                            End it with Delsin and start a new separate Saga in some other country. Maybe this can be a canonical bad guy and was experimented by their respective goverment. 


Delsin can be around but in the US and they stay away since Delsin and Zeke are on it guardians of NA. With Fetch and new friends and allies.

That said Night City's map from Cyberpunk 2077 would be a sick ass play ground to insert Delsin in.
                            Another note to add bud is, the cores only accelerate his growth. They're his rare candies but for his powers abilities. If he didn't have the % to grow he wouldn't get new moves via the Cores cause that's all they do for him that and amp his stats as a whole lore wise.

            It can also just be, you know, game mechanics. 

Where was Lucy getting her ice from? A issue InFamous 2 has among many while people shit on SS.
                I could easily see the explanation being that Lucy pulls moisture out of the air, Nyx probably does something similar considering certain mixtures of the gases in our atmosphere are flammable (oxygen on it’s own being the obvious one)
                    Don't get me wrong, in the comic Cole tells Moya that eventually Conduits can regen their energy and don't need to depend on absorbing from sources and it's clear that the player needs to absorb alot more than lore necessity as we see bosses not need to do as often, so whatever works works. Game mechanics <.

That said Delsin has entirely completely different concepts of power. 

Smoke/combustion 
Light/Gravity
Video which contains some space and time concepts 
And concrete which I recall in their website mentioned it's mixed or sub branched to calcium, Granite, Marvel, rocks and mud. 

Even Cole electrokinesis is beyond that. Magnetism, energy manipulation, thermal manipulation and even weather control and aerokinesis.

Conduits base of power is the named one but they branch to other things so just mechanically its hard to ge consistent.
Comic state Conduits can create their own energy after a while. It's mostly game mechanics that require them to absorb as much but they can produce energy themselves within due time, just not infinite. Outside I'd absorbing they can rest and lay low to rebuild. 

Read the canon comic.
Even from the beginning his basic bolt felt more powerful.
    Felt. Also not everything needs to be on par to be equal in abilities. Delsins faster. Different elements hit different too. 

Lighting > Smoke in AP

Also it's a production thing, sounds and effects etc

Cause his bolts feels stronger in 1 and in 2 they just don't feel as strong but that's due to design and engine.

Let's not forget that Cole has the Ray Sphere activate his genes and exposure to it pushes your potential even higher. So, Cole had that and many things leading to him becoming the most powerful.

Delsin replicates the Prime Conduit gene so if he would have absorbed Coles, most likely he'd be blasting his attack just as hard.
        Hmm..your last paragraph's theory is a interesting one. Out of all then prime conduits he's leeched from, he still hasn't done so from a prime conduit who has actually used the ray sphere. I do wonder if that would indeed have some effect.
            I don't see why that would affect his replication however I do think his replication potency is based on compability. Like, some matter and elements may be harder or easier on his body to utilize. 

Delsin with the Ray Sphere would be interesting, I feel that would allow him to swap or use all his powers ar once or at least a few at once.
Week he was KO.

3 days he does everything, I believe 4th he beats Augustine. Replay it. Literally 3 days pass.
    I did yesterday and just started a new one but the only thing I remember of them telling how long something took is the week he spent in a coma
        I'm game after he gets to Seattle after he destroys Space Needle DUP towers a passes. 

Later after he gets Neon and helps Fetch and they have sex, a day passes as Fetch apologizes for lighting a room cause it's been a long time since she...concluded.

After Video and fighting Augustine with Video is another day. 

Searching for Hank, finds him. Remains low. Fights her at night. 

At best its 4 days.
            Delsin himself says to Augustine that it’s been a couple weeks already.
                Then he was KO for 2. 

In game you literally see the day pass from morning. To noon to after noon to night.
                    He’s KO for one week, and he tells Augustine it’s been a couple weeks. It’s ridiculous to think Delsin could liberate the entire city and do literally all he does in 3 days, even with all his powers. We see transitions from day to night and from night to day sure, but that doesn’t mean that’s the only time that passes.
                        We see 3 days pass and he hid. 

He would attack and dismantled the DUP via ambush and later had help. 

It's ridiculous how " we see a time laps of the days" and ignore it. Even Reggie says lay low until tmrw morning like 3 times. 

This is you now being stubborn. I won't be going in circles when the game shows literally 3 at best 4 days pass for Delsin to dismantle and beat the DUP.
                Can also be a general statement he said but you literally see the 3 days pass in game in real time.
Meh, gameplay's gonna gameplay. Plus, same thing happened with smoke, he had the dash first. And even then, he was trying to control it. Either way, we have no way of knowing since those core relays existed. We're talking about a guy who just discovered his powers, with no real training. Like I said, everyone else had the time to figure out how to master their powers, Delsin never had that luxury.

Edit: a few typos
That's your head canon. 

They managed to capture and secure almost every Conduit, nothing in lore states that they were incompetent, nor does game play limitations render Augustind bad or weak.

No it's not a bad plot. It's a sensible one. 

Yeah extreme rare events. Augustine tried and couldn't.

Augustine "I have 7 years of experience" 

Wolfe "  Augustine fears your potential"

Yeah 3 days vs everyone else who has have years of experience.

Conduits grow with time. If Delsins not a Conduit then he wouldn't but nothing makes him be the sole Conduit to not be able to expand and grow. You'd have to prove he's the sole Conduit to have no ability to grow like other Conduits which nowhere in game does this state that.
Irrelevant, my point was Cole has about 3 months and a half with his powers and had Kessler set the path for him.

No, what bad lore? Every prime Conduit grows with power nothing is left vague about that nor contradicts it. 

Delsin literally 3 days in Seattle versus everyone else months or years with powers. Nothing about SS in terms of growth for Conduits is "bad lore". 

We have statements such as "Augustine fears your potential" and " have my power but I have 7 years experience" which indicate growth in time. As all Prime Conduits.

This hyperbole that SS is bad at lore is exaggerate and people wither didn't pay attention or use bad vs vague. 

Even then nothing says Delsin, a prime Conduit can't grow. He will like  all primes do.
    The “bad lore” I’m talking about is that we have no clue whether or not Delsins powers in universe will actually grow. The only time we ever saw it “grow” was after touching  a blast shard or blast core. Best example is the Augustine boss fight. He gains the powers, gets blast cores, and grows. At no point in the game is actually hinted that his “gained” powers are capable of growing naturally. His “prime” power is the power to copy other powers. 

That could easily grow into making his copies stronger from the start. But we are never told whether or not it’s possible for a copied power to grow stronger by itself. Not even a mention.
        All Prime Conduits grow. He's a prime Conduit. Simple. 

Only difference is he needs to replicate another Prime Conduits specific genes. I don't see this "we don't know", when all Primes grow in time. 

So I respectfully 10000 % disagree.
            We know prime conduits grow. The issue here is we are not told whether his “powers” are his “power” or a result of his “power”. If they are his “power” than yes they will grow.  But if they are a result of his “power”, a byproduct of it so to speak, than we can’t be sure.
                That's just a weird nitpick, that it needs to be 100% confirmed. If his powers grow naturally then clearly like all Conduits time and experience will help increase his abilities. 

That's why we need a sequel to fix the many things they rushed cause of Sony. Celia waged war on people and has info that Augustine gathered on the First Sons. 

Easy way to finish and answer however we can't assume "nah he not getting better" when a Prime Conduit powers grow regardless. So something of his gets better. Also Karma Bombs outclassed many of the Conduits he replicated from in some degree.
                    Perfectly agree with sequel idea. Most of theory comes from how blast shards work in Second Son as a “jumpstart” for the power evolution.
                        End it with Delsin and start a new separate Saga in some other country. Maybe this can be a canonical bad guy and was experimented by their respective goverment. 


Delsin can be around but in the US and they stay away since Delsin and Zeke are on it guardians of NA. With Fetch and new friends and allies.

That said Night City's map from Cyberpunk 2077 would be a sick ass play ground to insert Delsin in.
                        Another note to add bud is, the cores only accelerate his growth. They're his rare candies but for his powers abilities. If he didn't have the % to grow he wouldn't get new moves via the Cores cause that's all they do for him that and amp his stats as a whole lore wise.
The final boss at the end of infamous 1 tells Cole directly that he will get more powerful. The entire reason for Cole getting his powers at that point in time was so that he could get powerful enough to stop the beast because his old self couldn't. Even though he eventually got powerful enough to literally time-travel. 

His whole plan was based on the fact that Cole gets more powerful over time, but not fast enough to save the world from the beast, and he still isn't in infamous 2. To the point that he needs to actively seek more power in a new city instead of developing his powers naturally, like the original plan.
Unless I'm confusing you with someone else I've debated here, I apologize
That doesn't mean anything. Devs alone aren't word of God. What was their position?

Not to sound rude but regardless in game lore all the games have said Conduits powers grow with time. Delsin is a prime Conduit, so within game lore that point is disregarded as some devs are not all knowing of in game lore. 

We have that with Skyrim as a example.
    Just because youre a delsin fan doesn't mean anything either. I said what I said.
That's because Cole never had actual full Cryokinesis rather a aspect of it to boost his electrokinesis.

And concrete which I recall in their website mentioned it's mixed or sub branched to calcium, Granite, Marvel, rocks and mud. 

Even Cole electrokinesis is beyond that. Magnetism, energy manipulation, thermal manipulation and even weather control and aerokinesis.

Conduits base of power is the named one but they branch to other things so just mechanically its hard to ge consistent.
He’s KO for one week, and he tells Augustine it’s been a couple weeks. It’s ridiculous to think Delsin could liberate the entire city and do literally all he does in 3 days, even with all his powers. We see transitions from day to night and from night to day sure, but that doesn’t mean that’s the only time that passes.
    We see 3 days pass and he hid. 

He would attack and dismantled the DUP via ambush and later had help. 

It's ridiculous how " we see a time laps of the days" and ignore it. Even Reggie says lay low until tmrw morning like 3 times. 

This is you now being stubborn. I won't be going in circles when the game shows literally 3 at best 4 days pass for Delsin to dismantle and beat the DUP.
Perfectly agree with sequel idea. Most of theory comes from how blast shards work in Second Son as a “jumpstart” for the power evolution.
    End it with Delsin and start a new separate Saga in some other country. Maybe this can be a canonical bad guy and was experimented by their respective goverment. 


Delsin can be around but in the US and they stay away since Delsin and Zeke are on it guardians of NA. With Fetch and new friends and allies.

That said Night City's map from Cyberpunk 2077 would be a sick ass play ground to insert Delsin in.
    Another note to add bud is, the cores only accelerate his growth. They're his rare candies but for his powers abilities. If he didn't have the % to grow he wouldn't get new moves via the Cores cause that's all they do for him that and amp his stats as a whole lore wise.
