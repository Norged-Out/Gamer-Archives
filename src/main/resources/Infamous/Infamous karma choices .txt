[[Infamous karma choices ]]


Well, we all know that the karma system on this game has never reached his full potential. The choices that you have in these games are like: or to cure cancer or poisoning the water system of Gotham.
The game that does this better is without a doubt the fist one, because you have some choices that aren't objectively good or bad. 
I think we need more of these grey choices if sucker punch decides to make a new game.
What's your opinion?


Definitely need more moral dilemmas, and no karma locks. I want a compelling villain story and i think the evil side should be replaced with a more antihero or antivillian system then pure evil.
    It sucks because that’s what inFAMOUS 2 almost had going for it, except the evil path missions weren’t even evil or all that necessary, they’re mostly all just senselessly violent things that don’t solve anyone’s problems lmao
    Perhaps 3 karmatic sides, good, evil, and maybe neutral. I think that would be pretty cool.
        I think that would be cool but my fear would be if you make a middle ground option it may make the other options redundant to choose. 

A majority of players choose the good path rather than the evil. so making a grey path would make playing evil way less then what it already is. 

With the good path it could also be affected as id argue morally grey is the best of both worlds
            They would probably have to have the powers be the main deciding factors. Like if it were for 2 good would obviously be ice and napalm for evil, but maybe just have really awesome lightning powers for the neutral.
                Thats a good idea, going off powers
Yeah I agree, I also don’t think they should make it clear as day with the blue and red. We decide what’s best and the city should react by shunning or supporting us. Also like others said, an anti-hero route.
    Sounds a lot like Fallout New Vegas, they pretty much ditched the karma system in favor of the reputation system which was a lot better imo.
    Infamous 2 kinda has it where if youre evil karma the public will throw rocks at you or go up & hit you if you're not moving but I think that's about it. It would be cool if it was explored more on the city's reaction.
Yeah inFAMOUS 1 karma is far and away the best implemented. If they ever made a new game I would hope they return to the evil choices being tempting because they make things easier, while good choices require sacrifice.
I think that in retrospect, we’re judging the game as trying to be something it wasn’t trying to be. It’s a binary ‘kill the babies or help the babies’ type system on purpose because it’s just meant to be a fun ass video game and not a statement on morality or the human condition. I’d love if a newer game posed more morally grey dilemmas for the player, but that’s not what the existing games are meant to be.
It should play out like that telltale games do it. Have some really grey area options along with the absolute decisions. Couple of unsure choices could really throw things off or really help you out.  I really hope the franchise makes a comeback
    I disagree, but I’m weird and like black and white morality.
infamous 1 had a lot of different karma choices than than infamous 2 and second son. Some karma decisions didn’t make much sense.
I absolutely love reveling in being a violent, monstrous terror to humanity so it doesn't affect me personally, but yes, I agree.
Infamous 1 karma had better choices but infamous 2’s ending is still the best choice in the series.
I feel 2 did it a little better, but it seems all the games karma centers around either what is right or what is easier or more beneficial to you. Honestly that’s pretty spot on to most morale choices in real life so I like it.
