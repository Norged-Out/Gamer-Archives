Best game devs of all time.
    They got to be the most beloved and generous dev teams around in these times. I hope they don’t overwork themselves to exhaustion to provide such a quantity of content that always meets (and often tops) the expectations of the community
        Agreed, we barely have to ask to receive with the devs. I'm familiar with four other dev teams/companies, being paradox, nintendo, valve and supercell, and GSC is aeons ahead. God bless Ghost Ship Games.
They’re buffing what now
    Some of the weaker Overclocks!
        Nah, they gotta buff Fat Boy. It doesn’t do enough damage
            20 ammo fat boy coming next patch?
                Plus shotgun spread
                rapid fire 120 ammo fatboy when
            I honestly don't get the hate if fat boy. If you combine it with L.U.R.E then it's really good
            I hope it does more radiation damage at a larger radius so it TKs more effectively
                Oh the TKs. Could the engineer rival the driller’s c4 now?
        Do we know which ones are getting buffs?
            Not yet
            I cant wait to find out. Ive been getting into trying different build ideas and there are a few weapons that i want to do more with, but they only have one or two OC that feel right.
The season opt-out is such an elegant solution to the issue.

People who like it can keep running it, people who are sick of it don't have to deal with it anymore.

And it's a system that can be used on future seasons, should it be relevant!
    What I would like to know is is it going to split the Mission browser based on whether it's on or off or is it only going to apply to lithophage missions specifically because the former would be a big problem especially on Console versions which have a smaller player base
        Yeah I was wondering the same, any changes to split the playerbase has to be implemented well or it's going to cause more harm than good.
            I'd hope that the server list is merged for the tiles without rockpox
        one of the devs responded in the news thread. if you have the season toggled off, you can still see and join all games, and others can still see yours. there's more nuance than that but long story short it will not split the playerbase into different buckets.
        Probably just a filter I’m guessing
Thanks, GSG!
See? I told y'all to let them cook! And look what happened! They fucking cooked!
    Might not be a 3 course meal we wanted (new season) but GODDAMN is it a delicious appetizer!
        It's like those big friggin mozzarella sticks you can buy at some places that are like the size of a corn cob.
            Lucky

Where I live Cheesesticks are still appetizer sized
    After feedback was given.

Edit: to those thinking I'm stating the obvious go read u/AeonAigis comment below. He words it much more elegantly than I ever could.
        Valid. But people were way overreacting and uninstalling the game entirely because they thought the devs weren’t listening
            People definitely overreacted. 100%.

But I also saw a lot of people dismissing any criticism with superficial remarks.  
Which is bad for GSG because they welcome criticism.
        All these downvotes and not one fucking argument. You're right. If they were left to just "let cook" without some pushback from the community, this wouldn't have happened. GSG is a good studio, even a great one. But they aren't mind-readers, and the "whining" that was so maligned by some individuals on this sub produced desired results.

You can be upset at a decision without being upset at a studio, and a good studio will pivot based on that energy. That is exactly what happened.

Thank you, GSG. And thank you, those who made their disappointment and frustration known.
            The reason that pre release testing and feedback is important.

If you ever wanna see something come to a game.

Don't wait for someone else to think of it to tell the devs.

Get discussion going on official forums.

Project zomboid is about to have an update that includes blacksmithing.

And some guy pointed out that the designs weren't realistic and that if the forges were made out of stone they may explode.

He got a response and it's something the devs are internally aware of now.

Let good devs cook. But you gotta tell them what you want, otherwise they'll cook what they think you want. Not what you want.
        Damn looks like a bunch of baby elves banned together to downvote you even though you made a normal comment. You'd think this sub would at least have better patience than others
            Not to be a smart stout addict but I think the word you mean is “banded.” Rock and stone ⛏️
                Thank you brother. Rock and stone
                Rock and Stone in the Heart!
        That's... how it works, yeah? The preferred way. Would you rather they make fixes *without* listening to feedback?
            How did you misunderstand my comment so much?
                Some people take straightforwardness as aggressive.

So simply stating "after feedback was given" some people may have taken that as hostile, or maybe just smarmy.

Can't say that's how I read it. Sarcastic at worst really.
                Seems like everybody misunderstood it, idk how that exactly happened but you got downvoted to hell lmao
        Yes, that's how feedback works..
        Yes, that's...how you improve a game
What did I miss? What specific changes are being made and when?
    Check the pinned post
        Awesome thanks!
If there’s one dev team on this planet I can always trust to pull through, it’ll always be GSG. Unless they start making egregious EA or blizzard level decisions, I have complete faith in them and what they choose to do.
    I doubt it's even possible to outshine EA and Blizzard on the shit-scale at this point.
        Unity
            Ubisoft, Bethesda, Bungie, also Nintendo due to copyright abuse
        You forgot Bungie, a new greedy newcomer.
            Wait, fuckin bungie is bad now too? Shit
        For real though, you guys always seem to pu through in ways other developers don't. My crew used to play DRG daily but recently took a break (all max promotion greybeard) and these tweaks are definitely going to bring us back. You guys rock!
Game devs listening to the playbase that plays the game. 

&#x200B;

Other devs should try this.
Just what I expected. I'll gladly keep playing drg until season 5 arrives. Really can't wait for survivor and rogue core to be launched on early acces too.
This is why I can buy the supporter pack without second thought for GSG but haven’t spent a dime on the Halo Infinite store.
Wait really? That's super fucking cool
    Yeah go back a couple posts and Jacob posted an update link. They’re also nefing Stingtails
        Man these devs are actually the best
            What makes them so great is that not only do they PLAY their game but they also actively listen to community feedback
                What a bunch of Karl's
I found it pretty funny that with the whole Rockpox situation they basically went:

"We should keep it around!"

"We should not!"

'Good idea. Let's do both"
Don’t forget nerfs to Stingtail and septic spreaders too
That is a major improvement for that dragged on gimmick of a season and I'm sure we are all here for it!
Rock and Stone!
    Rock and Stone, Brother!
        Good bot
Oh shit, for real?
Being able to \*toggle\* the season off and \*on again\* is genius. Love these devs.

Weapons balances between seasons!? YES PLEASE! Making an OC useful is almost like releasing a new one, honestly!
*we're
Even though the rockpox are really annoying, this is really nice news
ROCK AND STONE BABYYYYY

We all need to keep the positive mindset going- the second we take this for granted (in the sense that we stop being grateful for it) we lose support for a good game.
Best game devs strike again.


Rock and Stone, you beautiful Devs!
    Rockity Rock and Stone!
        Good bot
For real, this is the best possible response to the community's recent feelings. Absolutely based
Never doubted GSG for one second
One of the best Developers ever. ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE!!!
This is why you let good devs cook.

They'll deliver.
Damn fine work, GSG. We salute you. Rock and stone!
    Rock and roll and stone!
        Good bot.
Wait, I think I missed out on the news, when have gsg said this and when will the update go online?
    It’s literally pinned to the top of the subreddit.
        Yeah, saw it thanks
I don’t mind the rock picks
    Me either but the CC lock and floor is lava stuff got annoying eventually. I don't mind fighting it, but being punished for standing on dark spots in a dark room is slightly irritating
        Totally agree the biggest problem though, is that 90% of time with randoms no one piles on it and does it like clockwork. Stupid aggravating just basically did two all by myself today and at the first one, the guy called in pod and just fucking left lol so instead of patiently doing little by little which is how you don’t get in the smoke, I run all over it and shoot and try to do as much as quick as possible since no one is ducking helping 🤷🏼‍♂️
When did they say that?
SO when's the update?
    Update is scheduled early November so either a week from today or 2 weeks from today, I feel like the latter is more likely buse then the patch can be implemented at the end of the Halloween event
lol that’s nothing. This game hasn’t changed enough to keep me coming back. Fun to jump in and play every once in a while but this can’t be anybody’s main game right?
did they add a female miner yet
    🤦
That's the bare minimum and you idiots keep bootlicking these amateur devs lmao
    How about you bootlick these nuts lmao gottem
        Do not lick the gunk seeds..... no stop it DO NOT LICK THE GUNK SEEEEEEEEDS
            1984
    Get back to work miner 👎
    This is some leaf lovin' BULLSHIT right here...
    It's a free update for a game you already paid for.

Be appreciative, not entitled.
    ????
    This community would be better off without miners like you, ya damn leaf lover.
    Seriously? 24 weapon skins a new function and a meaningful balance pass given in less than a month after community feedback is the bare minimum to you?
    I have around 400 hours in the game and I plan to add more. The game is 35$ cad on steam. That's around a dollar for 11 hours of fun already. There is no subscription, skins (I will not count dlcs, since they make up a tiny fraction of cosmetics) etc. For the amount of content released each season that is an addon for an already good game, I'd say that everything after the second season is already bonus content and generosity on the part of the devs.
    You’re just mad because they didn’t add the steeve hats that you wanted
    Wow. Your comment history is full of hating GSG. You're a neckbeard, actually. And not in the drg insult way. Go outside. Stop telling people to git gud.
    You did read how it's called a maintenance update, yeah?
    They could have just done 1.0 and stopped giving free updates after. They are still making more content for everyone to access. Not sure you have a point to be made here.
    at least they’re listening to the community unlike most game studios
    I'm well aware its the bare minimum, its still neat tho.
        I feel like the cosmetics and OC balances specifically put them *above* the bare minimum for this update ..?
        It really isn't the bare minimum though. Paid DLC that provides no updates to actual gameplay (like cosmetics) would be bare minimum. Or doing nothing. It is a FREE DLC that provides both. I've played other games that provide less content, less frequently, for more money. Now THAT is Leaf Lover behavior
            damn, I don't think you can provide less content less frequently than drg unless the game isn't being updated at all because the season contents, especially season 4 have been getting worse and worse and smaller and smaller
                If you're unhappy with new content, and you don't enjoy the gameplay loop as-is, then I'd say look elsewhere. Developers are not required to provide free content updates on any kind on any sort of timeline. The fact that we get anything extra is a cherry-on-top of a game I already love. 

If these updates aren't enough and you want different content for this game, find some mods you enjoy.
                    they are already doing the bare minimum for seasons now with just 1 game, do you really think it's gonna get any better with rogue core now? game is gonna look like it's in maintenance mode with only seasonal events and the occasional tiny update that doesn't address any of the issues that people have complained about since the release of the game
                        And if it doesn't get any major updates I still love the game as-is. The devs are entitled to focus on what they want to work on. They owe us nothing. I enjoy the game as-is. If it never got an update again I'd still enjoy it
                            and this is why the game is in the state it is
        It's a LOT more than the bare minimum, actually. The "bare minimum" would have been nothing.
        Wait what the hell would be better than "bare minimum" for a maintenance update? A whole extra game? 20 guns and 4 new classes?

The audacity of some people holy shit lmao
    Ungrateful leaf lover
    people like you ruin games
    Not very rock and stone of you, leaf-lover
        Rock and Stone everyone!
    I hope you get a bulk detonator on your salvage operation mission while you’re fueling the drop pod
We love you GSG
I’m grounded, what’s happening? Are they adding this now or in the next season?
    We're adding it mid November
        Yooo, thanks developer
    Sometime mid next month
        Very rock and stone
            Rockity Rock and Stone!
Haben looked at the news in a bit, what’s up?
    Other comments (I think top 4 or 5 have it) have a detailed description of what will happen
I've only been playing just under a month so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I don't mind rock-pox. I think it adds an added dimension of chaos and it's the heightened chaos that is appealing (to me) about this game.
Wait when is this gonna be a thing.
hype
Playing war thunder is making me forget what good Developers are, R&S!
is it weird i kinda want an actual skill tree for each dwarf that can boost their weapons and stuff, though that could break the game, i don't know, i just need something to use those stars on since i can't right now
That is great to hear some opting out options. I have actually left a few games in the last few weeks just because I am bored of roxpox.
Oh shit, for real?
I really really like the south they’re using for the opt out. It takes all the pressure off of finishing the season while also not burdening those who are already done
What ocs are they buffing?
Based devs being based once again, hope they consider updating the perks system in the near future though
now that's quality
>weapon mastery skins

wait what
It’s crazy to me because I ended up sinking my teeth into a game the released recently that unfortunately has the most awful and trashy devs I’ve ever seen. The game shall remain nameless, but it’s become very clear to me that the whole thing was a cash grab. They announced an egregiously aggressive pricing model that does not match the base cost of the game, all additional content (including new characters) is going to be locked behind enormous paywalls, it has a hollow progression system, virtually no customization, balancing has been rough, they constantly reject criticism and fight against community given feedback, and and they were quicker to push out paid cosmetic DLC (with the crappiest designs that are basically just recolors of the default character models) than actual content fixes. 

They’re the kind of devs that just seem to make the WRONG decision at every turn. Half a step forward, snd three steps back type of a situation. 

Meanwhile, Ghostship comes out the gate with literally half an update, but it’s CHOKED to the gills with requested changes and quality modifications for the game, and it’s not even one of their big updates???

I’m so grateful for the devs of Deep Rock Galactic to be such strong examples for the rest of the industry of GOOD developers who are very sensitive to the needs of the community, and are incredibly responsive. This team blows my mind every time a new update comes around. 

Y’all going crazy, and I love what y’all do. Keep it up.
    Let me take a guess, OW2?
        Nope. I knew that was a cash grab from the beginning. Lol
ROCK AND STONE!
    Rock and Stone, Brother!
FR?!

if yes when it's gonna come on console?
GSG continuing to be the best fucking game Devs out there
Honestly, I think ghost ship made a great job all along. Yes, Rockpox was not the greatest in the end, but still creative. It was just to much, so we got annoyed. But that is a mistake, which can happen. Ghost ship is a great developer studio and I think the community should appreciate more what they got with them. Or at least the Reddit community. Often I see people here just complaining to much. That’s why I support posting things like you/OP did.
What is a season opt out?
And now I must go spend more money; not because I need to but because I like the game
Wait for real? I haven't played in half a year because frankly, I'm burned out and bored. No front intended but it does get quite stale after putting in a few 100s of hours. But if this really happens I'll come back. New shit yay
ROCK AND STONE
    For Rock and Stone!
This was pretty much me, and what I was hoping for. I felt so happy firing up again to work on finishing S4, knowing i'll get neutral DRG back <3
Wait what overclocks are getting buffed?
Aye, what did I miss?
One thing I'm hoping for is a system similar to that of PayDay where you can buy specific missions rather than the random ones. Let's say you want a long, difficult cave mission to test out weapons but the only one in the cycle is in Bogs or Bought and you hate the both, then just load that up and select Salt.

Another thing for this is to allow us to put anomaly and hazard modifiers on the mission, however it would grant less bonus cash than a mission in the regular cycle.

Other than that, everything else is randomized, so machine events, leaches, hoarders, random dreads, BET-C, and other rare events are still in the game's control. I do think it would be fun to have a way to make the game spawn a bulk every wave though.
Wait for real
W
Ghostship spoils us.
ROCK AND STONE
Perfect. Absolutely perfect! I really don’t mind them working on new stuff because deep rock rogue core sounds real cool, just wanted a few tweaks so it will still feel fresh occaisionally hopping on
Thank you GSG.
Holy hot damn
Good to see my faith in GSG was well placed, quite literally the only developers I can confidently say I trust.
We can also shoot down Glyphid Poop projectiles
I can't wait for Fat Boy to be buffed from firing Mini Nukes to Full-Size Nukes.  
  
The mining dwarves want in on the Rogue Core and they've got to get to it somehow.
I hadnt heard about the opt out feature, but thats kinda cool.  Im still going to fight the rockpox because I swear I only get it every five missions or so, but thats nice.  

Im just hoping that the OC buffs are actually BUFFS.
oh shit really? where????????
Weapon mastery?
We don't deserve such S'-tier devs
Just got done with all the achievments to get greeted with even more managment mandated grinding.
When will this happen? Or is it already in the game?
Stone and Rock! Wait...

        Ubisoft, Bethesda, Bungie, also Nintendo due to copyright abuse
    You forgot Bungie, a new greedy newcomer.
        Wait, fuckin bungie is bad now too? Shit
    For real though, you guys always seem to pu through in ways other developers don't. My crew used to play DRG daily but recently took a break (all max promotion greybeard) and these tweaks are definitely going to bring us back. You guys rock!
Yeah go back a couple posts and Jacob posted an update link. They’re also nefing Stingtails
    Man these devs are actually the best
        What makes them so great is that not only do they PLAY their game but they also actively listen to community feedback
            What a bunch of Karl's

It’s literally pinned to the top of the subreddit.
    Yeah, saw it thanks
Me either but the CC lock and floor is lava stuff got annoying eventually. I don't mind fighting it, but being punished for standing on dark spots in a dark room is slightly irritating
    Totally agree the biggest problem though, is that 90% of time with randoms no one piles on it and does it like clockwork. Stupid aggravating just basically did two all by myself today and at the first one, the guy called in pod and just fucking left lol so instead of patiently doing little by little which is how you don’t get in the smoke, I run all over it and shoot and try to do as much as quick as possible since no one is ducking helping 🤷🏼‍♂️
Update is scheduled early November so either a week from today or 2 weeks from today, I feel like the latter is more likely buse then the patch can be implemented at the end of the Halloween event
🤦
How about you bootlick these nuts lmao gottem

Get back to work miner 👎
This is some leaf lovin' BULLSHIT right here...
It's a free update for a game you already paid for.

Be appreciative, not entitled.
????
This community would be better off without miners like you, ya damn leaf lover.
Seriously? 24 weapon skins a new function and a meaningful balance pass given in less than a month after community feedback is the bare minimum to you?
I have around 400 hours in the game and I plan to add more. The game is 35$ cad on steam. That's around a dollar for 11 hours of fun already. There is no subscription, skins (I will not count dlcs, since they make up a tiny fraction of cosmetics) etc. For the amount of content released each season that is an addon for an already good game, I'd say that everything after the second season is already bonus content and generosity on the part of the devs.
You’re just mad because they didn’t add the steeve hats that you wanted
Wow. Your comment history is full of hating GSG. You're a neckbeard, actually. And not in the drg insult way. Go outside. Stop telling people to git gud.
You did read how it's called a maintenance update, yeah?
They could have just done 1.0 and stopped giving free updates after. They are still making more content for everyone to access. Not sure you have a point to be made here.
at least they’re listening to the community unlike most game studios
I'm well aware its the bare minimum, its still neat tho.
    I feel like the cosmetics and OC balances specifically put them *above* the bare minimum for this update ..?
    It really isn't the bare minimum though. Paid DLC that provides no updates to actual gameplay (like cosmetics) would be bare minimum. Or doing nothing. It is a FREE DLC that provides both. I've played other games that provide less content, less frequently, for more money. Now THAT is Leaf Lover behavior
        damn, I don't think you can provide less content less frequently than drg unless the game isn't being updated at all because the season contents, especially season 4 have been getting worse and worse and smaller and smaller
            If you're unhappy with new content, and you don't enjoy the gameplay loop as-is, then I'd say look elsewhere. Developers are not required to provide free content updates on any kind on any sort of timeline. The fact that we get anything extra is a cherry-on-top of a game I already love. 

If these updates aren't enough and you want different content for this game, find some mods you enjoy.
                they are already doing the bare minimum for seasons now with just 1 game, do you really think it's gonna get any better with rogue core now? game is gonna look like it's in maintenance mode with only seasonal events and the occasional tiny update that doesn't address any of the issues that people have complained about since the release of the game
                    And if it doesn't get any major updates I still love the game as-is. The devs are entitled to focus on what they want to work on. They owe us nothing. I enjoy the game as-is. If it never got an update again I'd still enjoy it
                        and this is why the game is in the state it is
    It's a LOT more than the bare minimum, actually. The "bare minimum" would have been nothing.
    Wait what the hell would be better than "bare minimum" for a maintenance update? A whole extra game? 20 guns and 4 new classes?

The audacity of some people holy shit lmao
Ungrateful leaf lover
people like you ruin games
Not very rock and stone of you, leaf-lover
    Rock and Stone everyone!
I hope you get a bulk detonator on your salvage operation mission while you’re fueling the drop pod
We're adding it mid November
    Yooo, thanks developer
Sometime mid next month
    Very rock and stone
        Rockity Rock and Stone!
Other comments (I think top 4 or 5 have it) have a detailed description of what will happen
Let me take a guess, OW2?
    Nope. I knew that was a cash grab from the beginning. Lol

Leaf lover! 🤣
Found the elf
Gimme another eight months and ask again.
Stoner Rock
Elf spotted
being obnoxious is just how drg players are
Agreed, we barely have to ask to receive with the devs. I'm familiar with four other dev teams/companies, being paradox, nintendo, valve and supercell, and GSC is aeons ahead. God bless Ghost Ship Games.
Nah, they gotta buff Fat Boy. It doesn’t do enough damage
    20 ammo fat boy coming next patch?
        Plus shotgun spread
        rapid fire 120 ammo fatboy when
    I honestly don't get the hate if fat boy. If you combine it with L.U.R.E then it's really good
    I hope it does more radiation damage at a larger radius so it TKs more effectively
        Oh the TKs. Could the engineer rival the driller’s c4 now?
Do we know which ones are getting buffs?
    Not yet
    I cant wait to find out. Ive been getting into trying different build ideas and there are a few weapons that i want to do more with, but they only have one or two OC that feel right.
Yeah I was wondering the same, any changes to split the playerbase has to be implemented well or it's going to cause more harm than good.
    I'd hope that the server list is merged for the tiles without rockpox
one of the devs responded in the news thread. if you have the season toggled off, you can still see and join all games, and others can still see yours. there's more nuance than that but long story short it will not split the playerbase into different buckets.
Probably just a filter I’m guessing
It's like those big friggin mozzarella sticks you can buy at some places that are like the size of a corn cob.
    Lucky

Where I live Cheesesticks are still appetizer sized
Valid. But people were way overreacting and uninstalling the game entirely because they thought the devs weren’t listening
    People definitely overreacted. 100%.

But I also saw a lot of people dismissing any criticism with superficial remarks.  
Which is bad for GSG because they welcome criticism.
All these downvotes and not one fucking argument. You're right. If they were left to just "let cook" without some pushback from the community, this wouldn't have happened. GSG is a good studio, even a great one. But they aren't mind-readers, and the "whining" that was so maligned by some individuals on this sub produced desired results.

You can be upset at a decision without being upset at a studio, and a good studio will pivot based on that energy. That is exactly what happened.

Thank you, GSG. And thank you, those who made their disappointment and frustration known.
    The reason that pre release testing and feedback is important.

If you ever wanna see something come to a game.

Don't wait for someone else to think of it to tell the devs.

Get discussion going on official forums.

Project zomboid is about to have an update that includes blacksmithing.

And some guy pointed out that the designs weren't realistic and that if the forges were made out of stone they may explode.

He got a response and it's something the devs are internally aware of now.

Let good devs cook. But you gotta tell them what you want, otherwise they'll cook what they think you want. Not what you want.
Damn looks like a bunch of baby elves banned together to downvote you even though you made a normal comment. You'd think this sub would at least have better patience than others
    Not to be a smart stout addict but I think the word you mean is “banded.” Rock and stone ⛏️
        Thank you brother. Rock and stone
        Rock and Stone in the Heart!
That's... how it works, yeah? The preferred way. Would you rather they make fixes *without* listening to feedback?
    How did you misunderstand my comment so much?
        Some people take straightforwardness as aggressive.

So simply stating "after feedback was given" some people may have taken that as hostile, or maybe just smarmy.

Can't say that's how I read it. Sarcastic at worst really.
        Seems like everybody misunderstood it, idk how that exactly happened but you got downvoted to hell lmao
Yes, that's how feedback works..
Yes, that's...how you improve a game
Awesome thanks!
