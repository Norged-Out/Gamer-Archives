Thank you for not making this NSFW üòÖ
I detect a distinct lack of Heavy Weapons Dwarf. Maybe in the future, maybe, maybe. I have yet to find one who can follow up boolet.
    He's at the bar wondering if maybe he's had too much to drink (a very un-dwarfy thought) when the other three walk in.
        The leaf lover's addiction turned the rest into waifus! Gunner is simply chugging oily oaf
            Am I wrong to imagine that's the bud/miller of the beer selection?
                Fair considering a Glyphid Slammer is probably just Natty Lite and whatever is the cheapest energy drink.
                    Space 4loko
                personally, i think its 99% sprite with only 1% vodka in it.
            Further confirmation that leaf lover's is pure estrogen
                [deleted]
                    Except the estrogen contained in soy isn't actually estrogen as in the hormone in people that causes femininity, rather it's something that's got a similar shape to it and as such is also called estrogen. Hbomberguy did a rather good video on it.
                Oh that's why I like it
    I'm imagining him curled up in a corner, inside his shield
    um heavy weapons dwarfs is already a girl dwarf
    It's gunner dwarf pov
    I prefer to believe that gunner is derping around playing with the Hurricane rocket ammo (like in the idle reload animation). Pfwiiuuuuu~
Driller licking up glyphid blood makes sense to me somehow
    *Vampire perk intensifies*
    I like how they have some blood on the drills too.
        Liquid cooling is more efficient than air cooling
            *the blood of my enemies fuels my drills.*

-every driller ever.
    I mean, there the only class with 6 weapons, 3 of which are melee. 1 of which is literally a case of c4 that they have to plant *manually* (there "support" tool, btw). Everyone else walks into a cave with equipment, guns, and a traversal tool that helps navigate that treachery of the caves and keep mobs at bay. the driller walks in with blunt force trauma, bloodlust, and 8 axes the size of a small child, with a set of tools designed to Excell *while inside of a swarm*.

If anyone has a case of the crazies it's the driller.
        Driller is OP and so much fun. There isn't anything I can't do in the game. Im like moleman.
        Everyone else walks into a cave with equipment,guns and a traversal tool that helps navigate that treachery of the caves and keep mobs at bay, the driller walks in with a total  violation of the space geneva convention
            War crimes!!! *In Space*
            Remember kids: it's not a war crime the first time.
                Quackbang out!!
        Driller is the main character in my mind
        You forgot to mention *the fire*
            Ahh yes, the primaries. Ranging from a literal flamethrower, a highly expirimental thermal sink generator, and a biohazardous filth shooter.
                The only reason we tolerate using one of these 3 weapons is that R&D couldn't combine them all into one. SMH where's Jean-Baptist Emmanuel Zorg when you need him...
        > I mean, ~~there~~ they're the only class with 6 weapons, 3 of which are melee. 1 of which is literally a case of c4 that they have to plant manually (~~there~~ their "support" tool, btw).

I'm so sorry, the twice in once sentence made me giggle
    Exactly! I was like "Ew, that's gro... Nah, it's the driller. That checks out".
        Still gross. It just somehow tracks.
    If it's a driller from my game that's another dwarf's blood.
        Scout's specifically
    You can tell which one is driller from the crazy eyes alone
        Dont stick your drill in crazy
            ...maybe just the tip...
    They do serve glyphid omelets. Maybe the fully grown variety are tasty too, just harder to shove in our tardis.
    It‚Äôs the vampire perk
        Yeah but driller specifically fits for it
    Grape flavor
    Isn't Glyphid blood green?
By Karl! Where are their beards?!
    Oh they have [beards](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmemes/comments/srsblb/the_truth_about_dwarven_women_by_saint_monster/)
        I'm almost scared to click this in public.
            Not NSFW, graphically anyway.
                Clicked it anyway, thank fuck it wasn't what I expected.

The implications, however were what I was expecting.
                    It's nice when it's less than what you expected, at least nowadays some of these can be wild.
                        It is nice. I gotta cherish moments like this more.
                    Now you said that word ‚Äúimplications‚Äù a couple of times now. The dwarves aren‚Äôt in any danger are they?
                        Nope. The dwarves are fine. It's just that female dwarves have beards in a *different* area.
            I just clicked it at work you coward
                I clicked it anyways, despite having several people right next to me, fully able to look over and see my phone screen if they wanted.
                Same.  Rock.And.Stone!
        Always loved that comic. Though I prefer the theory that it's all just a myth that started because female dwarves braid their hair under their chins.
        Loving the art style this guy has, gonna have to check his stuff out
        Hahahaha
        NO!
        That is amazing...
        I hate this.
    Dwarves in DRG don‚Äôt necessarily have beards. Both the driller and the gunner start with no beard (the driller no facial hair at all)
        Well... it's not that he doesn't have one... see there was a flamethrower incident during training... the gunner got too close...
            Also, both the Driller and Gunner use tools/weapons that involve powerful rotating parts. You \*don't\* want a beard to get anywhere close to that.
                But you still should have a powerful mustache like the Swanson in order to assert your authority and dominance. 

Glyphids think twice when they see my ‚Äú30 years on the force‚Äù power ‚Äòstache.
                    Epic Handlebar mustache + Bulbous Full beard + Massive Fro hair is the way to go for intimidation, the jiggle physics are to die for
                Yeah, might break the equipment, and NEED muh minigun!
                stick-on beards
            That's actually a great idea. Have some beards for him that are all burnt up and scorched.
                The "shaving accident" unlockable Season 1 cosmetic could work with the "got part of my beard caught in my drills/minigun" thing.
    Can't u see they're elves

Leaf lovers don't grow beards
        All dwarves are boys, all elves are girls.  Just like dogs and cats.
            It‚Äôs already relatively common to make dwarves all look like men. Why the hell is it not just as common to make all elves look like women???
                It is!
            Interesting theory, tho science disagrees with you on the dogs and cats part. And which are which according to it? Dogs and cats I mean.

                    Rock and Stone!
        And look at those pointy ears!! Damn leaf-lovers.
            Huh? Go look at the ears of our loveable dwarves ingame. They're the same shape as here
                sounds like propaganda to me
                For me the thing that makes them look like elves isn't necessarily just the ears or the beardlessness, but the figures of the scout/driller look anorexic for a dwarf. So all the evidence points to them being elves or just human cosplayers.
    This is true. Iirc in Tolkien lore female dwarves also had beards.
        I think Gimli also said non-dwarves are almost unable to tell male and female dwarves apart.
            https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/stybj6/what_did_tolkien_say_about_female_dwarves/hx6naru?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
        Yup. I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording, but LOTR dwarves had beards pretty much from birth, no matter their gender. The only time you‚Äôd see a beardless dwarf was if they‚Äôd been forcibly shaved, which is pretty much the ultimate insult.
            [They're born grumpy and with beards longer than themselves](https://twitter.com/baalbuddy/status/1410967402200899588)
        Pratchett does the same, though he takes it a bit further where even the dwarves can't tell the difference until the night after the wedding
        Not according to Amazon they don't
            Amazon's LOTR is just a fantasy setting with "Lord of the Ring" slapped on the poster to make it sell better.
                In fairness the Tolkien estate has as much of a hand in that failure as Amazon themselves. What a shitshow. I just hope it's good
                    It just goes to show the current copyright law that is so long is way above life of an author is entirely pointless thing that favours only big corporations.
                        Tolkien had been dead for almost 30 years when Jackson's adaptation was released, and that went well. It doesn't really *show* anything.
                            Christopher Tolkien was alive for that one, and not for amazon's. Christopher was very loyal to his father's vision, and is the person who compiled the Silmarillion.
                That's putting it *nicely*.
                They did the same to Wheel of Time, unfortunately. If it wasn't for The Boys, I'd be completely convinced they have no idea how to create a decent TV show
            They probably dropped the ball on that.
            Screw amazon
        Devs said they don‚Äôt want to do this in game because its lazy.
        Not everything has to be LotR
        Then its a good thing DRG isn‚Äôt set in The Lord of the Rings
    Some say there are no female dwarfs! And that we just spring out of the mountain!
    [deleted]
        Hate to say this, but drg dwarves have pointy ears
            For that matter, a lot of post Tolkien dwarves have pointy ears.  They usually just make the elf ears even pointier as well.
                Dwarf ears = strong and sharp like a spade

Elf ears = thin, weak, and flimsy like their knives.
                    Exactly what I was getting at.

That being said, lady elf ear wiggles are pretty damn cute, just sayin'.

I mean, um ..yea!  Those damn knife ears!  Stupid leaf lovers!
                        What is wrong with you, brotha
                            The elves got us acting unwise
                            It's a guilty pleasure.  I'm a filthy degenerate, I know.
                                Right there with you brother. I stand with ya. May karl forgive us.
            Rival company misinfo, no I will not check, no I will not change my mind
People complain about missing beards forgot that Gunner and Driller doesnt have beards by default.
    Which is a crime
        They also use rapidly spinning things that would do a lot of harm if a beard got caught in it. It makes sense they would go clean or trimmed.

Although for Driller I think it's more that he just burned it off at some point and it is yet to regrow. Maybe the same incident also burned off Gunner and it leads to some tension between them.... Scout and Engineer were both chilling off to the side mining and deploying specials so they still have theirs.

More I think about it, the more that situation makes sense when it shouldn't.
            I got my beard caught in a power drill a year ago next month... I don't blame the driller for going clean shaven... definitely top 5 most physical pain I've ever experienced. #1 for emotional pain... that was 2 years of hard work and dedication lost in an instant...
                Just curious, did it just take the hair off, or did it take skin and flesh as well? Does the hair grow back?
                    It pulled about 2 square inches of hair, root and all, just behind my chin. It did not take flesh, thankfully, my beard has grown back just fine, but there are some white hairs in that area, meaning the follicles where damaged and no longer process melanin correctly, but they still grow hair.

I'm far more cautious around power tools and now tuck my beard away if I'm going to be close to anything that may catch it.
                        Hey good to know the beard is safe at least!
                My respect for your loss...

A.K.A press "F"
                    The absolute best thing about beards: They grow back.

It was my first real attempt at growing a beard. And while it looked okay, my current one looks a LOT better, thanks to the knowledge and experience I gained from my first one, so not a total loss.

Still trying to figure out how to keep it out of my arm pits at night... might try braiding it, not sure...
                        Viking braid It! Totally worth

            that explains the teamkilling potential of both; theyre subtly trying to avenge a grudge!
                Right? Launch a bunch of Hurricane rockets.... then "glance" over at Driller to "make sure he's not getting swarmed" and "oops.... was the guidance system still on? Sorry mate."

Meanwhile the Driller just laughs it off, "Barely felt it. Let me give R&D some inspiration to upgrade those toy rockets by showing you what a REAL Dwarven explosion is!"

...meanwhile Engi is just throwing up platforms for Scout as they are making bets over which one goes down first and Mission Control is just in a continuous double-face-palm pose seeing the whole thing go down.
            Sure logic makes sense. But then we're allowed to put a beard on our character after the fact...so then to me it no longer makes sense.
                Would you rather have safe work conditions or a might beard? My choice is clear.
                I think it might be a company policy that recruits operating equipment like minigun or power drills have to shave their beards, but after that management doesnt care, and it's rather expected amongst the miners that you grow it back like a proper dwarf would.
                A experienced dwarf knows how to swing around giant spinny death machines and have a magnificent beard and not have the two collide. 

Or something like that.
            Yes, let‚Äôs use logic in the game about getting drunk and drilling holes in space while shooting bullets, rockets, and freeze rays at alien bugs

This is like when people were debating the science behind the walking dead ten years ago
        It‚Äôs the bears on the inside that counts
            I realize you meant *beard*, but bears gets the message across just fine.

Thanks, Action Hank.
        Driller at least should be clean shaven.  More than anyone he'd be dealing with dangerous gasses & gas transfer, requiring some sort of mask.  Can't wear an oxygen mask with any more than a small mustache, if that.
    Well they both have bulky spinning things that could rip their head appart if their beard got caught in these, so management probably told them it would be way too dangerous for them to have a beard
        Management trying to oppress our boys once again
            It's called "protection of corporate assets".
        
> so management probably told them it would be way too dangerous for them 

that's a first
    That's because, as greenbeards, they didn't know how to keep their beards out of the spinny bits of their tools and they were ripped out during training.
    Or the beards are not where you can see them

            I'm sure tomboy elves exist. Honestly, with their outdoorsy nature, you'd think there'd be more cute tomboy elves.
    What if this is how the female dwarves look in DRG?
        Not wide enough, dorfs should be stockier.
            you don't see their fat arse on these images
                Eh, I could like the look of either, but prefer stockier.  Stockier people tend to have more broad shoulders, which would make sense if these dwarves' are actually mining and in combat.
    If they can mine, get the job done, drink, and Rock and Stone, then they're a dwarf in my books. They didn't ask to be raised in a bunch of trees.

Leaf lovers jokes aside this is a very good art
I like the idea of female dwarves having braids more. The longer the hair, the older and wiser the female dwarf. These however do not have braids must be greenbraids.

I really wish we could play as some lasses in DRG, I love me some good dwarves lads but I will take every and all chances to play as and with the gals.
    My wife is a gamer, but also a girly girl baby. The fact that she would have to be a smelly hairy man dwarf keeps her from having any interest in playing with me. And I completely understand.
        If it helps at all, she can play as a smelly hairy *woman* dwarf, at least according to Tolkien:

> It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. **They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.**
            Thanks but I've tried this angle. No dice.
    Gamer girl here. I love this game, but it does make me sad I can't play as a female. Would be awesome to have some more options! All my dwarf dudes have crazy Jade hair and beards... So I guess that helps?
        Yeah, I just rock the amethyst hair color to make up for the lack of femme choices.
    I still have head-canon that all four of the dwarves in the game can be either male or female. It's actually canon for Tolkien lore:

> It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. **They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.**

Damn, driller looks smug
    Driller looks like she's gonna enjoy whatever she will have cooked soon enough.
    She knows she has the highest kill count and most minerals mined
    i'd love to drill her
I would pay for a female DLC pack. Female models, voice lines. Maybe a female mission control who would 50/50 show up instead of the male one on any given mission.
    I think if the devs made male dwarves default and put female dwarves behind a paywall there's gonna be riots
        I know that you know, but they probably meant that they would pay for it not that it should be paid for.
    Honestly same. I know how much people generally aren't a fan of the concept, but having female models in this vein, with really cool hair stuff that's the same type of thing as the beards, would absolutely get me more invested in the game. I love DRG as a game, but the dwarves just aren't my aesthetic in the end as good as they are. Stuff like in the OP would be really amazing. Make them muscular, give them exosuits, whatever works for me really.
        I agree that there would be backlash to a women are paid DLC, but I also know introducing female models would require a LOT of work on Ghost Ship's part in terms of building and animating new models, recording new voice lines, adapting all the parts/gear to fit the new models. 

Maybe release all the female models/voices for free along side a non-gender-specific batch of new cosmetics that would be a paid DLC with idea being players who wanted to support the devs and help them with the cost of the female models could buy the new DLC to do their part, while not explicitly locking females behind the DLC.
    [deleted]
        Devs already said that they don't want to add gender options as it would take way too much time
            They have access to a lot of metrics we don‚Äôt. My guess is female dwarves would create a very small uptick in female players while the simultaneous lack of new gameplay content would create a much larger exodus of current players.

For a small studio not running micro transactions or paid dlc, they really can‚Äôt afford to take that hit.
                Small correction: they do run paid dlc 

Other than that yea, that's actually basically what they said now that i remember it
            Where are you getting that from? [GSG has said many times that they'd like to add female dwarves](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Development_Q%26A).
    [Here is an article with the devs saying they would like to have female characters in the game.](https://www.thegamer.com/deep-rock-galactic-female-dwarf/)

Probably not as represented in this post's image. Which to me is a shame. I am personally (don't hate me) not a big fan of dwarves, and much prefer elves. Especially these elves.
C'mon where is the drillers C4 and why is it not hurdling down towards the rest of the team.
Now you just gotta make gunner
personally I would have made them a bit more muscular, given the fact they move rocks around and fight alien bugs all day, otherwise great job
    Maybe they use some kind of [exoskeleton](https://64.media.tumblr.com/14cde15ee78d0ba65df986f404eb2612/271166cff545b693-9e/s1280x1920/21165f43b0cc5cdabdac3ebe0ec991d2aae1001d.png)
Looks great but they could use beards
    They are elves! They have pointy ears! And dwarf wemen always have beards!
        The dwarves in drg have pointy ears.
            Oh, I still believe they are elves because they have no beards
                Driller and Gunner doesnt have beards by default....
                    They are female, takes longer for them to grow they're beards
                        Driller and gunner are female?
So that makes dwarf women the big brut force type ones...
                            Ladies always handle the tough stuff, we truly can't live without them
                                Jesus Christ lol
                            Like Berserkers from Gears of War but intelligent.
Great art. They do look like elves tho. Putting various settings' lore (on whether they should have beards or not) aside, simple logic based on dwarven culture suggests rather different body build, mainly wider shoulders and hips, and much more muscle. Otherwise, great artwork.

Rock and Stone!
    They are by the looks of it

Notice the pointy ears
While this is some pretty good artwork, I have to agree with some of the other comments here that they're pointy eared leaf lovers and not dwarves, but not for the same reasons as everybody else.

Yes they don't have beards, and yes they don't exactly look stocky/well built, but thats not the main reason they're not dwarves, the reason is their attitudes. They all have this vibe that as a character they are sexy flirty fun etc. Looking into their eyes I don't see anything like:

"I was born underground in the earth, I'll die here under the mountain, I work long and hard, breaking the rocks and the stones, shaping them into great halls. I go down to the mine drunk with ale, to mine gold and fight off those creatures deep with my trusty axe."

I don't see them singing  
"Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone  
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home  
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones  
To dig and dig makes us free  
Come on brothers sing with me!"

or  
"The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,  
While hammers fell like ringing bells  
In places deep, where dark things sleep,  
In hollow halls beneath the fells."  


Again I do think this is some good artwork, but as characters they feel like they are missing that crucial dwarven spirit.
In before a bunch of people rebel against the idea of actually cute female dwarves.

Edit: looked over OP‚Äôs past posts and I gotta commend the major improvement over time. This piece is a distinct step up. Congratulations.
    I want more like this: https://i.imgur.com/2DKWl9g.jpg

The ones in ops picture just look like stereotypical cute video game girls

That‚Äôs not a bad thing but I don‚Äôt think they fit the game. Thought they looked more like they were from Overwatch or similar
        She is perfect.
        A lot more dun want more of that
    Because they seem like elves and not like dwarves when they are cute
        Hey dwarves can be cute >:(.    right?
            Only in the same way that Steeve is cute!!!
            The tiny ones are always cute, so, yes
        Being an elf is a state of mind. If she drinks to excess, curses like a miner, and isn‚Äôt afraid to get her hands dirty, then it doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs a stunning beardless cutie.
        The farther away from being a leaf lover, the better
-is offended there isn't a gunner-

-notices they are all elves-

-is relieved there isn't a gunner-

ROCK AND STONE!
    The dwarves in DRG have pointy ears too.
    Everyone else is so hung up on the female thing that they've forgotten the most important part of being a dwarf.. Answering the call!

Like that! ROCK AND STONE!
        ROCK AND STONE BROTHAH!
        Those that bear a pickaxe alongside me shall be considered my dwarven brother or sister. That is what it truly means to be ROCK AND STONE.
            Beautiful words. The gender matters not. What matters is that WE FIGHT! For ROCK AND STONE!
Be careful brothers, these are in reality MALE elves!
    Even better
People talking about how they don‚Äôt have beards, but I like the way [Centurii-chan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/centuriic/status/1352983932946370560?s=21) did the beards for her(?) dwarf women. It‚Äôs just the hair tied under their chin.
    This is so cute!
Why is the driller looking at me like that
    Driller? I hardly know her!
I have yet to find any evidence suggesting that the dwarves are not female.
    Don't they call each other brother and fat boy all the time?
    I maintain that two actually are. I don't think I've locked down which yet.
**NOT STOUT ENOUGH!**
For Karlette!

Avert your eyes, brothers 

Leaf lover propaganda - everyone knows female dwarfs have beards larger than their boo‚Ä¶ts
    sure, its just below.
Now we need a mod of that
Tfw no gunner though. ***Sad noises intensify***. Very adorable art though.
Too small, no carry big rock.
They are too skinny and not very dwarf like
Gunner?
But wheres the gunner ?

Awesome art
God bless your kind soul
Awesome artwork! I really like the expressions each one has!
**It's taking our jobs!**
Thank you! 
Now let me kindly get a bittergem so we can chant we're rich as a form of repayment.

Did I hear a Rock and Stone?!
We are missing one.  NO DWARF LEFT BEHIND!
But where are their beards?!?! /s
STOP I WILL NOT BOW TO THE HORNY, I MUST STAY STRONG, ROCK AND STONE FOR THE BOYS!!!
Where's Gunner? Show us her *big guns* - erm, I mean *big gun*!

Excellent art!
Bout to drill the drillerüò©
Reminds me of how all the female dwarves in lineage 2 are cute anime girls compared the typical male dwarfs.
Just the thought about an anime where the scout has this design and proceeds to try a flashy move and always dies far away or from great heights and getting everyone in trouble makes me chuckle  


Tho, when we beholding your gal gunner design?
WHY ARE YOU LICKING THE BLOOD SISTER?!

YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT‚ÄôS IN THERE!!!

They are awesome but I find it very odd you put all that effort in and missed out the gunner.
this is an epic drawing i love it question where is the 4th dwarf

This is cute and all but where is the gunner :(

I'd love if they added a gender option to all the classes.  Lots of work I know, but it would be really cool and inclusive.

Girl update when?
That driller can C4 me as much as she wants... as long as she revives me right after that is
Driller....? I just met her....
this is really good

if drg incorporated more woman in their propaganda maybe we could get more recruits
Didn't they say at somepoint they'd add female miners? But it's not a nessesity/high on their list?
    i think that they maybe value gameplay over something like this. though im not against the idea, it would be a *ton* of extra work.
Can you make more mainly I want more driller for reasons please
look i'm not saying i'd want to play as the female dwarf ALL the time but

ok i am saying that
I'm not against this at all
where is gunner girl tho?
Something tingles my beard. I think gunner was too NSFW so she was cut out, as company policy
No gunner? üò≠
Ew, can you not over sexualize women and make them your ideal anime girl every time you draw something? Dwarves arent supposed to look like elves from hentai......
Where is the gunner?
what the fuck i love leaves now
Those look like leaf lovers where are the beards?!
Wait... we have pointy ears?
Well now I want lady dwarves. :(
Amazing art.. but where's the Gunner??
Scout looks like she would scream ‚ÄúNerf this!‚Äù

They are perfect. No beards needed.
Where are there beards
Woah! Dwarfs with no absolutely ugly facial features?

Based
W... Where's the gunner?

Jokes aside, nice drawing.
I only go for beards.
Male or female the driller must still answer for war crimes!!!
I've always wanted female dwarves in this game. You won't be able to tell by looking though, they will have a similar voice and all the same cosmetics.
Where is the gunner
I wantttt ‚ù§Ô∏è
Makes me sad we don‚Äôt get female dwarves.
Woah, the very thick partition between the parts of my brain that contain DRG and sex just got uncomfortably thin
That driller got me acting unwise
Can someone explain what deep rock is? I kinda want a new game to get into

    WE WANT LADY DWARVES SAY IT AGAIN FOR THE MICRO DRILLERS IN THE BACK
This should be a mod.
GUNNER WILL NEVER BE ANIME ELF GIRL
Fem gunner should look like Luisa from encanto
*no goggles? :c*

Jokes aside this is rly good
Driller looks like a tomboy, Engie is super smart and maybe a little overestimating herself, but scout? Red hair and looks like she‚Äôs shy, omg marry me
"oh boy, i hope this doesn't awaken something in me"
Great work. I hope one day the devs add some dwarf ladies for our sisters. I know my daughter would be so happy.
Now draw them

NO.
They should add elves as playable characters. Would give driller great excuse for killing teamates.
**visible dwarven rage**
Fantastic Karl would approve of this, waiting for the gunner too
They look awespme. Would love to see more.
Definitely rock and stone, someone call corporate, it's time.

ARE THOSE KNIFE-EARS?!?!?!?!?
Tfw no engineer girl
Those are clearly elves! Leaf-lovers have no hope to ROCK AND STONE DOWN IN THE MINES!
Gunner? No?  
ok
But...but where are their beards?


Great work! I like it a lot.
FOR KARA!
By the beard !
Noice.
That driller definitely eats the rocks
So why is there no gunner? The answer is that this is his Harem.
Pointy ears??  No beards??
Whatever about the beards, why do they have to be so skinny? Well made either way but I'm just really tired of any female anything having to be so skinny all the time.

Doesn't make much sense they're not at least more muscular.
Where are them beards??
This goes in the book
Where are their beards
Female dwarfs have beards
Noooo thank you. Please let me have my traditional dwarf females that are barely discernable from the men, plskthnx.

    You‚Äôre being downvoted but like, there‚Äôs no way of us knowing what gender and sex(as in noun not the verb) is like for dwarves in this universe. Dwarven women may have features we see as traditionally masculine, who knows

He's at the bar wondering if maybe he's had too much to drink (a very un-dwarfy thought) when the other three walk in.
    The leaf lover's addiction turned the rest into waifus! Gunner is simply chugging oily oaf
        Am I wrong to imagine that's the bud/miller of the beer selection?
            Fair considering a Glyphid Slammer is probably just Natty Lite and whatever is the cheapest energy drink.

                Except the estrogen contained in soy isn't actually estrogen as in the hormone in people that causes femininity, rather it's something that's got a similar shape to it and as such is also called estrogen. Hbomberguy did a rather good video on it.

I prefer to believe that gunner is derping around playing with the Hurricane rocket ammo (like in the idle reload animation). Pfwiiuuuuu~
*Vampire perk intensifies*
I like how they have some blood on the drills too.
    Liquid cooling is more efficient than air cooling
        *the blood of my enemies fuels my drills.*

-every driller ever.
I mean, there the only class with 6 weapons, 3 of which are melee. 1 of which is literally a case of c4 that they have to plant *manually* (there "support" tool, btw). Everyone else walks into a cave with equipment, guns, and a traversal tool that helps navigate that treachery of the caves and keep mobs at bay. the driller walks in with blunt force trauma, bloodlust, and 8 axes the size of a small child, with a set of tools designed to Excell *while inside of a swarm*.

If anyone has a case of the crazies it's the driller.
    Driller is OP and so much fun. There isn't anything I can't do in the game. Im like moleman.
    Everyone else walks into a cave with equipment,guns and a traversal tool that helps navigate that treachery of the caves and keep mobs at bay, the driller walks in with a total  violation of the space geneva convention
        War crimes!!! *In Space*
        Remember kids: it's not a war crime the first time.
            Quackbang out!!
    Driller is the main character in my mind
    You forgot to mention *the fire*
        Ahh yes, the primaries. Ranging from a literal flamethrower, a highly expirimental thermal sink generator, and a biohazardous filth shooter.
            The only reason we tolerate using one of these 3 weapons is that R&D couldn't combine them all into one. SMH where's Jean-Baptist Emmanuel Zorg when you need him...
    > I mean, ~~there~~ they're the only class with 6 weapons, 3 of which are melee. 1 of which is literally a case of c4 that they have to plant manually (~~there~~ their "support" tool, btw).

I'm so sorry, the twice in once sentence made me giggle
Exactly! I was like "Ew, that's gro... Nah, it's the driller. That checks out".
    Still gross. It just somehow tracks.
If it's a driller from my game that's another dwarf's blood.
    Scout's specifically
You can tell which one is driller from the crazy eyes alone
    Dont stick your drill in crazy
        ...maybe just the tip...
They do serve glyphid omelets. Maybe the fully grown variety are tasty too, just harder to shove in our tardis.
It‚Äôs the vampire perk
    Yeah but driller specifically fits for it

            I clicked it anyways, despite having several people right next to me, fully able to look over and see my phone screen if they wanted.
            Same.  Rock.And.Stone!
    Always loved that comic. Though I prefer the theory that it's all just a myth that started because female dwarves braid their hair under their chins.
    Loving the art style this guy has, gonna have to check his stuff out
    Hahahaha
    NO!
    That is amazing...
    I hate this.
Dwarves in DRG don‚Äôt necessarily have beards. Both the driller and the gunner start with no beard (the driller no facial hair at all)
    Well... it's not that he doesn't have one... see there was a flamethrower incident during training... the gunner got too close...
        Also, both the Driller and Gunner use tools/weapons that involve powerful rotating parts. You \*don't\* want a beard to get anywhere close to that.
            But you still should have a powerful mustache like the Swanson in order to assert your authority and dominance. 

Glyphids think twice when they see my ‚Äú30 years on the force‚Äù power ‚Äòstache.
                Epic Handlebar mustache + Bulbous Full beard + Massive Fro hair is the way to go for intimidation, the jiggle physics are to die for
            Yeah, might break the equipment, and NEED muh minigun!
            stick-on beards
        That's actually a great idea. Have some beards for him that are all burnt up and scorched.
            The "shaving accident" unlockable Season 1 cosmetic could work with the "got part of my beard caught in my drills/minigun" thing.
Can't u see they're elves

Leaf lovers don't grow beards
    All dwarves are boys, all elves are girls.  Just like dogs and cats.
        It‚Äôs already relatively common to make dwarves all look like men. Why the hell is it not just as common to make all elves look like women???
            It is!
        Interesting theory, tho science disagrees with you on the dogs and cats part. And which are which according to it? Dogs and cats I mean.
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P-K4LnGmUo
                Rock and Stone!
    And look at those pointy ears!! Damn leaf-lovers.
        Huh? Go look at the ears of our loveable dwarves ingame. They're the same shape as here
            sounds like propaganda to me
            For me the thing that makes them look like elves isn't necessarily just the ears or the beardlessness, but the figures of the scout/driller look anorexic for a dwarf. So all the evidence points to them being elves or just human cosplayers.
This is true. Iirc in Tolkien lore female dwarves also had beards.
    I think Gimli also said non-dwarves are almost unable to tell male and female dwarves apart.
        https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/stybj6/what_did_tolkien_say_about_female_dwarves/hx6naru?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
    Yup. I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording, but LOTR dwarves had beards pretty much from birth, no matter their gender. The only time you‚Äôd see a beardless dwarf was if they‚Äôd been forcibly shaved, which is pretty much the ultimate insult.
        [They're born grumpy and with beards longer than themselves](https://twitter.com/baalbuddy/status/1410967402200899588)
    Pratchett does the same, though he takes it a bit further where even the dwarves can't tell the difference until the night after the wedding
    Not according to Amazon they don't
        Amazon's LOTR is just a fantasy setting with "Lord of the Ring" slapped on the poster to make it sell better.
            In fairness the Tolkien estate has as much of a hand in that failure as Amazon themselves. What a shitshow. I just hope it's good
                It just goes to show the current copyright law that is so long is way above life of an author is entirely pointless thing that favours only big corporations.
                    Tolkien had been dead for almost 30 years when Jackson's adaptation was released, and that went well. It doesn't really *show* anything.
                        Christopher Tolkien was alive for that one, and not for amazon's. Christopher was very loyal to his father's vision, and is the person who compiled the Silmarillion.
            That's putting it *nicely*.
            They did the same to Wheel of Time, unfortunately. If it wasn't for The Boys, I'd be completely convinced they have no idea how to create a decent TV show
        They probably dropped the ball on that.
        Screw amazon
    Devs said they don‚Äôt want to do this in game because its lazy.
    Not everything has to be LotR
    Then its a good thing DRG isn‚Äôt set in The Lord of the Rings
Some say there are no female dwarfs! And that we just spring out of the mountain!
[deleted]
    Hate to say this, but drg dwarves have pointy ears
        For that matter, a lot of post Tolkien dwarves have pointy ears.  They usually just make the elf ears even pointier as well.
            Dwarf ears = strong and sharp like a spade

Elf ears = thin, weak, and flimsy like their knives.
                Exactly what I was getting at.

That being said, lady elf ear wiggles are pretty damn cute, just sayin'.

I mean, um ..yea!  Those damn knife ears!  Stupid leaf lovers!
                    What is wrong with you, brotha
                        The elves got us acting unwise
                        It's a guilty pleasure.  I'm a filthy degenerate, I know.
                            Right there with you brother. I stand with ya. May karl forgive us.
        Rival company misinfo, no I will not check, no I will not change my mind
Which is a crime
    They also use rapidly spinning things that would do a lot of harm if a beard got caught in it. It makes sense they would go clean or trimmed.

Although for Driller I think it's more that he just burned it off at some point and it is yet to regrow. Maybe the same incident also burned off Gunner and it leads to some tension between them.... Scout and Engineer were both chilling off to the side mining and deploying specials so they still have theirs.

More I think about it, the more that situation makes sense when it shouldn't.
        I got my beard caught in a power drill a year ago next month... I don't blame the driller for going clean shaven... definitely top 5 most physical pain I've ever experienced. #1 for emotional pain... that was 2 years of hard work and dedication lost in an instant...
            Just curious, did it just take the hair off, or did it take skin and flesh as well? Does the hair grow back?
                It pulled about 2 square inches of hair, root and all, just behind my chin. It did not take flesh, thankfully, my beard has grown back just fine, but there are some white hairs in that area, meaning the follicles where damaged and no longer process melanin correctly, but they still grow hair.

I'm far more cautious around power tools and now tuck my beard away if I'm going to be close to anything that may catch it.
                    Hey good to know the beard is safe at least!
            My respect for your loss...

A.K.A press "F"
                The absolute best thing about beards: They grow back.

It was my first real attempt at growing a beard. And while it looked okay, my current one looks a LOT better, thanks to the knowledge and experience I gained from my first one, so not a total loss.

Still trying to figure out how to keep it out of my arm pits at night... might try braiding it, not sure...

            Right? Launch a bunch of Hurricane rockets.... then "glance" over at Driller to "make sure he's not getting swarmed" and "oops.... was the guidance system still on? Sorry mate."

Meanwhile the Driller just laughs it off, "Barely felt it. Let me give R&D some inspiration to upgrade those toy rockets by showing you what a REAL Dwarven explosion is!"

...meanwhile Engi is just throwing up platforms for Scout as they are making bets over which one goes down first and Mission Control is just in a continuous double-face-palm pose seeing the whole thing go down.
        Sure logic makes sense. But then we're allowed to put a beard on our character after the fact...so then to me it no longer makes sense.
            Would you rather have safe work conditions or a might beard? My choice is clear.
            I think it might be a company policy that recruits operating equipment like minigun or power drills have to shave their beards, but after that management doesnt care, and it's rather expected amongst the miners that you grow it back like a proper dwarf would.
            A experienced dwarf knows how to swing around giant spinny death machines and have a magnificent beard and not have the two collide. 

Or something like that.
        Yes, let‚Äôs use logic in the game about getting drunk and drilling holes in space while shooting bullets, rockets, and freeze rays at alien bugs

This is like when people were debating the science behind the walking dead ten years ago
    It‚Äôs the bears on the inside that counts
        I realize you meant *beard*, but bears gets the message across just fine.

Thanks, Action Hank.
    Driller at least should be clean shaven.  More than anyone he'd be dealing with dangerous gasses & gas transfer, requiring some sort of mask.  Can't wear an oxygen mask with any more than a small mustache, if that.
Well they both have bulky spinning things that could rip their head appart if their beard got caught in these, so management probably told them it would be way too dangerous for them to have a beard
    Management trying to oppress our boys once again
        It's called "protection of corporate assets".
    
> so management probably told them it would be way too dangerous for them 

that's a first
That's because, as greenbeards, they didn't know how to keep their beards out of the spinny bits of their tools and they were ripped out during training.
Or the beards are not where you can see them

        I'm sure tomboy elves exist. Honestly, with their outdoorsy nature, you'd think there'd be more cute tomboy elves.
What if this is how the female dwarves look in DRG?
    Not wide enough, dorfs should be stockier.
        you don't see their fat arse on these images
            Eh, I could like the look of either, but prefer stockier.  Stockier people tend to have more broad shoulders, which would make sense if these dwarves' are actually mining and in combat.
If they can mine, get the job done, drink, and Rock and Stone, then they're a dwarf in my books. They didn't ask to be raised in a bunch of trees.

My wife is a gamer, but also a girly girl baby. The fact that she would have to be a smelly hairy man dwarf keeps her from having any interest in playing with me. And I completely understand.
    If it helps at all, she can play as a smelly hairy *woman* dwarf, at least according to Tolkien:

> It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. **They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.**
        Thanks but I've tried this angle. No dice.
Gamer girl here. I love this game, but it does make me sad I can't play as a female. Would be awesome to have some more options! All my dwarf dudes have crazy Jade hair and beards... So I guess that helps?
    Yeah, I just rock the amethyst hair color to make up for the lack of femme choices.
I still have head-canon that all four of the dwarves in the game can be either male or female. It's actually canon for Tolkien lore:

> It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. **They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.**
The beard that matters is on the inside ‚ù§Ô∏è
    They have beards... Just, lower...
Driller looks like she's gonna enjoy whatever she will have cooked soon enough.
She knows she has the highest kill count and most minerals mined
i'd love to drill her
I think if the devs made male dwarves default and put female dwarves behind a paywall there's gonna be riots
    I know that you know, but they probably meant that they would pay for it not that it should be paid for.
Honestly same. I know how much people generally aren't a fan of the concept, but having female models in this vein, with really cool hair stuff that's the same type of thing as the beards, would absolutely get me more invested in the game. I love DRG as a game, but the dwarves just aren't my aesthetic in the end as good as they are. Stuff like in the OP would be really amazing. Make them muscular, give them exosuits, whatever works for me really.
    I agree that there would be backlash to a women are paid DLC, but I also know introducing female models would require a LOT of work on Ghost Ship's part in terms of building and animating new models, recording new voice lines, adapting all the parts/gear to fit the new models. 

Maybe release all the female models/voices for free along side a non-gender-specific batch of new cosmetics that would be a paid DLC with idea being players who wanted to support the devs and help them with the cost of the female models could buy the new DLC to do their part, while not explicitly locking females behind the DLC.
[deleted]
    Devs already said that they don't want to add gender options as it would take way too much time
        They have access to a lot of metrics we don‚Äôt. My guess is female dwarves would create a very small uptick in female players while the simultaneous lack of new gameplay content would create a much larger exodus of current players.

For a small studio not running micro transactions or paid dlc, they really can‚Äôt afford to take that hit.
            Small correction: they do run paid dlc 

Other than that yea, that's actually basically what they said now that i remember it
        Where are you getting that from? [GSG has said many times that they'd like to add female dwarves](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Development_Q%26A).
[Here is an article with the devs saying they would like to have female characters in the game.](https://www.thegamer.com/deep-rock-galactic-female-dwarf/)

Probably not as represented in this post's image. Which to me is a shame. I am personally (don't hate me) not a big fan of dwarves, and much prefer elves. Especially these elves.
Maybe they use some kind of [exoskeleton](https://64.media.tumblr.com/14cde15ee78d0ba65df986f404eb2612/271166cff545b693-9e/s1280x1920/21165f43b0cc5cdabdac3ebe0ec991d2aae1001d.png)
They are elves! They have pointy ears! And dwarf wemen always have beards!
    The dwarves in drg have pointy ears.
        Oh, I still believe they are elves because they have no beards
            Driller and Gunner doesnt have beards by default....
                They are female, takes longer for them to grow they're beards
                    Driller and gunner are female?
So that makes dwarf women the big brut force type ones...
                        Ladies always handle the tough stuff, we truly can't live without them
                            Jesus Christ lol
                        Like Berserkers from Gears of War but intelligent.
They are by the looks of it

Notice the pointy ears
I want more like this: https://i.imgur.com/2DKWl9g.jpg

The ones in ops picture just look like stereotypical cute video game girls

That‚Äôs not a bad thing but I don‚Äôt think they fit the game. Thought they looked more like they were from Overwatch or similar
    She is perfect.
    A lot more dun want more of that
Because they seem like elves and not like dwarves when they are cute
    Hey dwarves can be cute >:(.    right?
        Only in the same way that Steeve is cute!!!
        The tiny ones are always cute, so, yes
    Being an elf is a state of mind. If she drinks to excess, curses like a miner, and isn‚Äôt afraid to get her hands dirty, then it doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs a stunning beardless cutie.
    The farther away from being a leaf lover, the better
The dwarves in DRG have pointy ears too.
Everyone else is so hung up on the female thing that they've forgotten the most important part of being a dwarf.. Answering the call!

Like that! ROCK AND STONE!
    ROCK AND STONE BROTHAH!
    Those that bear a pickaxe alongside me shall be considered my dwarven brother or sister. That is what it truly means to be ROCK AND STONE.
        Beautiful words. The gender matters not. What matters is that WE FIGHT! For ROCK AND STONE!
Even better
This is so cute!
Driller? I hardly know her!
Don't they call each other brother and fat boy all the time?
I maintain that two actually are. I don't think I've locked down which yet.

sure, its just below.
i think that they maybe value gameplay over something like this. though im not against the idea, it would be a *ton* of extra work.

You‚Äôre being downvoted but like, there‚Äôs no way of us knowing what gender and sex(as in noun not the verb) is like for dwarves in this universe. Dwarven women may have features we see as traditionally masculine, who knows
    The devs said they don‚Äôt want to go that route because it‚Äôs lazy.

            Except the estrogen contained in soy isn't actually estrogen as in the hormone in people that causes femininity, rather it's something that's got a similar shape to it and as such is also called estrogen. Hbomberguy did a rather good video on it.

    War crimes!!! *In Space*
    Remember kids: it's not a war crime the first time.
        Quackbang out!!
Driller is the main character in my mind
You forgot to mention *the fire*
    Ahh yes, the primaries. Ranging from a literal flamethrower, a highly expirimental thermal sink generator, and a biohazardous filth shooter.
        The only reason we tolerate using one of these 3 weapons is that R&D couldn't combine them all into one. SMH where's Jean-Baptist Emmanuel Zorg when you need him...
> I mean, ~~there~~ they're the only class with 6 weapons, 3 of which are melee. 1 of which is literally a case of c4 that they have to plant manually (~~there~~ their "support" tool, btw).

I'm so sorry, the twice in once sentence made me giggle
Still gross. It just somehow tracks.
Scout's specifically

Yeah but driller specifically fits for it

                It is nice. I gotta cherish moments like this more.
            Now you said that word ‚Äúimplications‚Äù a couple of times now. The dwarves aren‚Äôt in any danger are they?
                Nope. The dwarves are fine. It's just that female dwarves have beards in a *different* area.
    I just clicked it at work you coward
        I clicked it anyways, despite having several people right next to me, fully able to look over and see my phone screen if they wanted.
        Same.  Rock.And.Stone!
Always loved that comic. Though I prefer the theory that it's all just a myth that started because female dwarves braid their hair under their chins.
Loving the art style this guy has, gonna have to check his stuff out
Hahahaha
NO!
That is amazing...
I hate this.
Well... it's not that he doesn't have one... see there was a flamethrower incident during training... the gunner got too close...
    Also, both the Driller and Gunner use tools/weapons that involve powerful rotating parts. You \*don't\* want a beard to get anywhere close to that.
        But you still should have a powerful mustache like the Swanson in order to assert your authority and dominance. 

Glyphids think twice when they see my ‚Äú30 years on the force‚Äù power ‚Äòstache.
            Epic Handlebar mustache + Bulbous Full beard + Massive Fro hair is the way to go for intimidation, the jiggle physics are to die for
        Yeah, might break the equipment, and NEED muh minigun!
        stick-on beards
    That's actually a great idea. Have some beards for him that are all burnt up and scorched.
        The "shaving accident" unlockable Season 1 cosmetic could work with the "got part of my beard caught in my drills/minigun" thing.
All dwarves are boys, all elves are girls.  Just like dogs and cats.
    It‚Äôs already relatively common to make dwarves all look like men. Why the hell is it not just as common to make all elves look like women???

    Huh? Go look at the ears of our loveable dwarves ingame. They're the same shape as here
        sounds like propaganda to me
        For me the thing that makes them look like elves isn't necessarily just the ears or the beardlessness, but the figures of the scout/driller look anorexic for a dwarf. So all the evidence points to them being elves or just human cosplayers.
I think Gimli also said non-dwarves are almost unable to tell male and female dwarves apart.
    https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/stybj6/what_did_tolkien_say_about_female_dwarves/hx6naru?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
Yup. I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording, but LOTR dwarves had beards pretty much from birth, no matter their gender. The only time you‚Äôd see a beardless dwarf was if they‚Äôd been forcibly shaved, which is pretty much the ultimate insult.
    [They're born grumpy and with beards longer than themselves](https://twitter.com/baalbuddy/status/1410967402200899588)
Pratchett does the same, though he takes it a bit further where even the dwarves can't tell the difference until the night after the wedding
Not according to Amazon they don't
    Amazon's LOTR is just a fantasy setting with "Lord of the Ring" slapped on the poster to make it sell better.
        In fairness the Tolkien estate has as much of a hand in that failure as Amazon themselves. What a shitshow. I just hope it's good
            It just goes to show the current copyright law that is so long is way above life of an author is entirely pointless thing that favours only big corporations.
                Tolkien had been dead for almost 30 years when Jackson's adaptation was released, and that went well. It doesn't really *show* anything.
                    Christopher Tolkien was alive for that one, and not for amazon's. Christopher was very loyal to his father's vision, and is the person who compiled the Silmarillion.
        That's putting it *nicely*.
        They did the same to Wheel of Time, unfortunately. If it wasn't for The Boys, I'd be completely convinced they have no idea how to create a decent TV show
    They probably dropped the ball on that.
    Screw amazon
Devs said they don‚Äôt want to do this in game because its lazy.
Not everything has to be LotR
Then its a good thing DRG isn‚Äôt set in The Lord of the Rings
Hate to say this, but drg dwarves have pointy ears
    For that matter, a lot of post Tolkien dwarves have pointy ears.  They usually just make the elf ears even pointier as well.
        Dwarf ears = strong and sharp like a spade

Elf ears = thin, weak, and flimsy like their knives.
            Exactly what I was getting at.

That being said, lady elf ear wiggles are pretty damn cute, just sayin'.

I mean, um ..yea!  Those damn knife ears!  Stupid leaf lovers!
                What is wrong with you, brotha
                    The elves got us acting unwise
                    It's a guilty pleasure.  I'm a filthy degenerate, I know.
                        Right there with you brother. I stand with ya. May karl forgive us.
    Rival company misinfo, no I will not check, no I will not change my mind
They also use rapidly spinning things that would do a lot of harm if a beard got caught in it. It makes sense they would go clean or trimmed.

Although for Driller I think it's more that he just burned it off at some point and it is yet to regrow. Maybe the same incident also burned off Gunner and it leads to some tension between them.... Scout and Engineer were both chilling off to the side mining and deploying specials so they still have theirs.

More I think about it, the more that situation makes sense when it shouldn't.
    I got my beard caught in a power drill a year ago next month... I don't blame the driller for going clean shaven... definitely top 5 most physical pain I've ever experienced. #1 for emotional pain... that was 2 years of hard work and dedication lost in an instant...
        Just curious, did it just take the hair off, or did it take skin and flesh as well? Does the hair grow back?
            It pulled about 2 square inches of hair, root and all, just behind my chin. It did not take flesh, thankfully, my beard has grown back just fine, but there are some white hairs in that area, meaning the follicles where damaged and no longer process melanin correctly, but they still grow hair.

I'm far more cautious around power tools and now tuck my beard away if I'm going to be close to anything that may catch it.
                Hey good to know the beard is safe at least!
        My respect for your loss...

A.K.A press "F"
            The absolute best thing about beards: They grow back.

It was my first real attempt at growing a beard. And while it looked okay, my current one looks a LOT better, thanks to the knowledge and experience I gained from my first one, so not a total loss.

Still trying to figure out how to keep it out of my arm pits at night... might try braiding it, not sure...
                Viking braid It! Totally worth

        Right? Launch a bunch of Hurricane rockets.... then "glance" over at Driller to "make sure he's not getting swarmed" and "oops.... was the guidance system still on? Sorry mate."

Meanwhile the Driller just laughs it off, "Barely felt it. Let me give R&D some inspiration to upgrade those toy rockets by showing you what a REAL Dwarven explosion is!"

...meanwhile Engi is just throwing up platforms for Scout as they are making bets over which one goes down first and Mission Control is just in a continuous double-face-palm pose seeing the whole thing go down.
    Sure logic makes sense. But then we're allowed to put a beard on our character after the fact...so then to me it no longer makes sense.
        Would you rather have safe work conditions or a might beard? My choice is clear.
        I think it might be a company policy that recruits operating equipment like minigun or power drills have to shave their beards, but after that management doesnt care, and it's rather expected amongst the miners that you grow it back like a proper dwarf would.
        A experienced dwarf knows how to swing around giant spinny death machines and have a magnificent beard and not have the two collide. 

Or something like that.
    Yes, let‚Äôs use logic in the game about getting drunk and drilling holes in space while shooting bullets, rockets, and freeze rays at alien bugs

This is like when people were debating the science behind the walking dead ten years ago
It‚Äôs the bears on the inside that counts
    I realize you meant *beard*, but bears gets the message across just fine.

Thanks, Action Hank.
Driller at least should be clean shaven.  More than anyone he'd be dealing with dangerous gasses & gas transfer, requiring some sort of mask.  Can't wear an oxygen mask with any more than a small mustache, if that.
Management trying to oppress our boys once again
    It's called "protection of corporate assets".

> so management probably told them it would be way too dangerous for them 

that's a first
N-no that cant be theres so much rns i feel it ... NOOOOOO!!!
Most masculine elf
    I'm sure tomboy elves exist. Honestly, with their outdoorsy nature, you'd think there'd be more cute tomboy elves.
Not wide enough, dorfs should be stockier.
    you don't see their fat arse on these images
        Eh, I could like the look of either, but prefer stockier.  Stockier people tend to have more broad shoulders, which would make sense if these dwarves' are actually mining and in combat.

This gif is missing the best few frames at the end.
    I know! It was the best one I could find on short notice. The file size gets too big because no one wants to compress the image. I'm no gif maker
        Hush that tongue, you've done all you can and we thank you for it.
If it helps at all, she can play as a smelly hairy *woman* dwarf, at least according to Tolkien:

> It was said by Gimli that there are few dwarf-women, probably no more than a third of the whole people. They seldom walk abroad except at great need. **They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.**
    Thanks but I've tried this angle. No dice.
Yeah, I just rock the amethyst hair color to make up for the lack of femme choices.
They have beards... Just, lower...
I know that you know, but they probably meant that they would pay for it not that it should be paid for.
I agree that there would be backlash to a women are paid DLC, but I also know introducing female models would require a LOT of work on Ghost Ship's part in terms of building and animating new models, recording new voice lines, adapting all the parts/gear to fit the new models. 

Maybe release all the female models/voices for free along side a non-gender-specific batch of new cosmetics that would be a paid DLC with idea being players who wanted to support the devs and help them with the cost of the female models could buy the new DLC to do their part, while not explicitly locking females behind the DLC.
Devs already said that they don't want to add gender options as it would take way too much time
    They have access to a lot of metrics we don‚Äôt. My guess is female dwarves would create a very small uptick in female players while the simultaneous lack of new gameplay content would create a much larger exodus of current players.

For a small studio not running micro transactions or paid dlc, they really can‚Äôt afford to take that hit.
        Small correction: they do run paid dlc 

Other than that yea, that's actually basically what they said now that i remember it
    Where are you getting that from? [GSG has said many times that they'd like to add female dwarves](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Development_Q%26A).
The dwarves in drg have pointy ears.
    Oh, I still believe they are elves because they have no beards
        Driller and Gunner doesnt have beards by default....
            They are female, takes longer for them to grow they're beards
                Driller and gunner are female?
So that makes dwarf women the big brut force type ones...
                    Ladies always handle the tough stuff, we truly can't live without them
                        Jesus Christ lol
                    Like Berserkers from Gears of War but intelligent.
She is perfect.
A lot more dun want more of that
Hey dwarves can be cute >:(.    right?
    Only in the same way that Steeve is cute!!!
    The tiny ones are always cute, so, yes
Being an elf is a state of mind. If she drinks to excess, curses like a miner, and isn‚Äôt afraid to get her hands dirty, then it doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs a stunning beardless cutie.
The farther away from being a leaf lover, the better
ROCK AND STONE BROTHAH!
Those that bear a pickaxe alongside me shall be considered my dwarven brother or sister. That is what it truly means to be ROCK AND STONE.
    Beautiful words. The gender matters not. What matters is that WE FIGHT! For ROCK AND STONE!
The devs said they don‚Äôt want to go that route because it‚Äôs lazy.
Am I wrong to imagine that's the bud/miller of the beer selection?
    Fair considering a Glyphid Slammer is probably just Natty Lite and whatever is the cheapest energy drink.

Further confirmation that leaf lover's is pure estrogen
    [deleted]
        Except the estrogen contained in soy isn't actually estrogen as in the hormone in people that causes femininity, rather it's something that's got a similar shape to it and as such is also called estrogen. Hbomberguy did a rather good video on it.
    Oh that's why I like it

Ahh yes, the primaries. Ranging from a literal flamethrower, a highly expirimental thermal sink generator, and a biohazardous filth shooter.
    The only reason we tolerate using one of these 3 weapons is that R&D couldn't combine them all into one. SMH where's Jean-Baptist Emmanuel Zorg when you need him...
...maybe just the tip...
Not NSFW, graphically anyway.
    Clicked it anyway, thank fuck it wasn't what I expected.

The implications, however were what I was expecting.
        It's nice when it's less than what you expected, at least nowadays some of these can be wild.
            It is nice. I gotta cherish moments like this more.
        Now you said that word ‚Äúimplications‚Äù a couple of times now. The dwarves aren‚Äôt in any danger are they?
            Nope. The dwarves are fine. It's just that female dwarves have beards in a *different* area.
I just clicked it at work you coward
    I clicked it anyways, despite having several people right next to me, fully able to look over and see my phone screen if they wanted.
    Same.  Rock.And.Stone!
Also, both the Driller and Gunner use tools/weapons that involve powerful rotating parts. You \*don't\* want a beard to get anywhere close to that.
    But you still should have a powerful mustache like the Swanson in order to assert your authority and dominance. 

Glyphids think twice when they see my ‚Äú30 years on the force‚Äù power ‚Äòstache.
        Epic Handlebar mustache + Bulbous Full beard + Massive Fro hair is the way to go for intimidation, the jiggle physics are to die for
    Yeah, might break the equipment, and NEED muh minigun!
    stick-on beards
That's actually a great idea. Have some beards for him that are all burnt up and scorched.
    The "shaving accident" unlockable Season 1 cosmetic could work with the "got part of my beard caught in my drills/minigun" thing.
It‚Äôs already relatively common to make dwarves all look like men. Why the hell is it not just as common to make all elves look like women???
    It is!
Interesting theory, tho science disagrees with you on the dogs and cats part. And which are which according to it? Dogs and cats I mean.

I mean, um ..yea!  Those damn knife ears!  Stupid leaf lovers!

            It's a guilty pleasure.  I'm a filthy degenerate, I know.
                Right there with you brother. I stand with ya. May karl forgive us.
Just curious, did it just take the hair off, or did it take skin and flesh as well? Does the hair grow back?
    It pulled about 2 square inches of hair, root and all, just behind my chin. It did not take flesh, thankfully, my beard has grown back just fine, but there are some white hairs in that area, meaning the follicles where damaged and no longer process melanin correctly, but they still grow hair.

I'm far more cautious around power tools and now tuck my beard away if I'm going to be close to anything that may catch it.
        Hey good to know the beard is safe at least!
My respect for your loss...

A.K.A press "F"
    The absolute best thing about beards: They grow back.

It was my first real attempt at growing a beard. And while it looked okay, my current one looks a LOT better, thanks to the knowledge and experience I gained from my first one, so not a total loss.

Still trying to figure out how to keep it out of my arm pits at night... might try braiding it, not sure...

    Holy shit that was good, best laugh I've had all day.
Please be advised this number is fraudulent, the real number ends in -4-KARL of course
Right? Launch a bunch of Hurricane rockets.... then "glance" over at Driller to "make sure he's not getting swarmed" and "oops.... was the guidance system still on? Sorry mate."

Meanwhile the Driller just laughs it off, "Barely felt it. Let me give R&D some inspiration to upgrade those toy rockets by showing you what a REAL Dwarven explosion is!"

...meanwhile Engi is just throwing up platforms for Scout as they are making bets over which one goes down first and Mission Control is just in a continuous double-face-palm pose seeing the whole thing go down.
Would you rather have safe work conditions or a might beard? My choice is clear.
I think it might be a company policy that recruits operating equipment like minigun or power drills have to shave their beards, but after that management doesnt care, and it's rather expected amongst the miners that you grow it back like a proper dwarf would.
A experienced dwarf knows how to swing around giant spinny death machines and have a magnificent beard and not have the two collide. 

Or something like that.
Eh, I could like the look of either, but prefer stockier.  Stockier people tend to have more broad shoulders, which would make sense if these dwarves' are actually mining and in combat.

Touche! That was presumptive of me.
Hush that tongue, you've done all you can and we thank you for it.
Small correction: they do run paid dlc 

Other than that yea, that's actually basically what they said now that i remember it
Driller and Gunner doesnt have beards by default....
    They are female, takes longer for them to grow they're beards
        Driller and gunner are female?
So that makes dwarf women the big brut force type ones...

Except the estrogen contained in soy isn't actually estrogen as in the hormone in people that causes femininity, rather it's something that's got a similar shape to it and as such is also called estrogen. Hbomberguy did a rather good video on it.
It's nice when it's less than what you expected, at least nowadays some of these can be wild.
    It is nice. I gotta cherish moments like this more.
Now you said that word ‚Äúimplications‚Äù a couple of times now. The dwarves aren‚Äôt in any danger are they?
    Nope. The dwarves are fine. It's just that female dwarves have beards in a *different* area.
Epic Handlebar mustache + Bulbous Full beard + Massive Fro hair is the way to go for intimidation, the jiggle physics are to die for

It just goes to show the current copyright law that is so long is way above life of an author is entirely pointless thing that favours only big corporations.
    Tolkien had been dead for almost 30 years when Jackson's adaptation was released, and that went well. It doesn't really *show* anything.
        Christopher Tolkien was alive for that one, and not for amazon's. Christopher was very loyal to his father's vision, and is the person who compiled the Silmarillion.
