[[Grand Theft Auto 4 still looks great]]





After playing the D. E. I started to think I didn’t give 4 enough Of my time
    Yeah i think i need to replay it for the 100x time now haha
    Still hate rockstar for never adding it into psnow, even though both red dead redemption & undead nightmare are 🙄.

I guess here’s to waiting for another stupid “remaster” where they probably remove the euphoria physics engine  🙄🙄.
        I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

The trio of Niko,Johnny and Luis is countless hours of content.
            If the leaks are anywhere near true, they’ll all be remastered with the RAGE engines of RDR2/GTAV. 
Which wouldn’t be as bad, although the Euphoria engine was pretty fun.
                that doesn't make any sense - they didn't even make a mobile port of GTA4, so, what the fuck are they going to base a whole remaster off of?
                    Lmao
                    I would love to see a phone run the physics engine of gta 4... i think it will fry the entire phone right when you launch it.
                        that's the biggest reason why gta 4 runs like shit on a stick
                    Wat
                        oh, you haven't heard about the Definitive GTA Trilogy that just came out? you should look into that.
                I'll temper my expectations after the DE: Trilogy but I really hope they retain the ragdoll physics and car characteristics from GTA: IV.

I love how it feels so different from any other GTA.
                    Exactly! The driving and physics were so fun. If they change that, they’re taking away a huge part of what makes that game great
                        Personally, I liked how realistic it felt, but I remember people hating the driving back then. Motorcycles were practically useless until the Lost and Damned.
                            I hated every motorcycle chase in IV.
                The physics in 4 still amaze me. It's one aspect that's seriously lacking in the newer games imo
                Euphoria Physics is built in part of the RAGE engine. The remaster should have it, even if it will be toned down like in V and RDR2. Speaking of the remaster, I think the leaks are true, because it's from the same sources and it'd make sense, plus they already started taking down GTA IV mods lol. I just hope they won't screw my favorite GTA up so much like they did with the Trilogy.
                Euphoria is baked into the rage engine by default. They just toned down the physics a lot for GTA 5 but in RDR2 they're turned back up a bit just not quite as crazy as GTA 4. Gta doesn't run off of euphoria it runs off of RAGE as well which like I said has euphoria baked into it. You couldn't run a game using euphoria because it's not not engine.
            What's LCS got anything to do with them three?
                He most probably means EFLC.
                I meant the DLC for GTA:IV, Episode's of Liberty City.

My fault, my comment above can be confusing without the specification.
            You mean Episodes of Liberty City? Liberty City Stories is about Tony Cipriani from III.
            On the Apple store Chinatown Wars and Liberty City Stories are available but not GTA IV.. WTH?
            You can still buy the dlc just not as liberty city stories. I just bought them recently. You load BOGT and TLAD from the pause menu by going to load game or something.
            U mean episodes from liberty city lcs is the gta 3 prequel game that’s better than gta 3
            > I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

It is though?
            Johnny died bro
        Why would they remove the physics engine? That would take more effort than its worth. They didn’t remove anything from the trilogy remasters except the same music that’s been removed on every version except the PS2 original copies.
            It wasn’t the RAGE engine they more prominently use now, it’s supposedly why it’s a mess on the PlayStation. Something about the ps not being able to handle the GPU, Idk.

Although I can’t say from experience, as I had a 360 back in those days (rip). But that’s just from what I’ve read.
                If they remade the game they’d get rid of it. But I really don’t see them doing that. If they remastered it (like the trilogy) they wouldn’t be able to remove the engine cause then it would be a full on remake and that would take a LOT more effort and resources and time

Also don’t understand the fuss about it supposedly not working on PlayStation. I played it on PS3 originally and it was my most played game, I finished it over and over again. Didn’t have any problems with it
        Honestly at this point I’m thinking of just buying a cheap Xbox 360 so I can play it again
            If you do, Get the og Xbox. That’s the one you want. You can also make ur own radio station.
        Took me way too long to understand what “pee snow” was hahaha
        I think PS now is still a garbage service. It’s not worth the price that they pay for what you get. I’d rather just turn my PS3 on and off the disks in
    I always hated that Windows Live thing GTA 4 had, glad it's gone for good
Grove Street Games and Take Two:Allows us to introduce ourselves!
Seriously that game blows my mind every time I play it there has never been a better environment created
    everything about gta 4 ties together into a perfect package. the environment, the gameplay, the athmosphere, the sense of mystery, especially on the first playthrough. the new phone and internet were amazing, with all the little hidden easter eggs, secrets, and lore bits. physics with (mostly) realistic car handling and deforming, guns that have proper, satisfying punch to them, the most realistic ragdoll physics of any game ever, truly one of the best games ever made.
        The physics could actually get a little annoying sometimes, honestly, but even so I preferred 4 over 5 drastically. It was just completely unique to the series.

Plus nothing beats doing that heavy 180 turn backwards with your car.
            I loved doing that
                It's my main source of dopamine when playing the game.
            Especially while shooting at someone, capping them, and then whipping your car back around to speed away
        Damn straight
        > the most realistic ragdoll physics of any game ever

That’s a complete lie. Max Payne 3, Red 1 and 2 all have way more realistic ragdoll physics than IV does. And in some ways, V improves upon it, and makes it less exaggerated. IV’s still isn’t the most realistic, though.
    Yeah I love all the GTA games a lot, but IV succeeds unbelievably well in what it's trying to
    Totally man. Only Paris from AC Unity comes close imo, in terms of atmosphere and immersion anyway.
        Chicago in WD 1
        In AC, it's Egypt and Venice for me.
            Egypt is just perfect, definitely one of the greatest settings in any videogame ever.

I adore that game and it's beauty
        Syndicate has twice as many crowd animations and atmospheric details, if you liked Unity your mind will be blown.
            I've played both. Paris hits different imo due to the goings on and the setting in general.
    Red dead 2.
        ...is shit and has nothing to do with GTA
        I'll agree that's a badass environment I'm personally just more intrigued with a more modern setting and city that's just my opinion I love Red Dead though
    I'm curious. Why do you think it has a better environment compared to GTA V?
        I would probably say just the time period it takes place in really set the tone for the environment in GTA IV.
            I felt like they really nailed it.
                Yeah, it's that really cool sliver of time back in the mid 2000s that had one foot in the 20th century and another in the 21st. It's funny listening to the radio ads and talk shows and seeing how much about the future the got right and conversely how much they got wrong.
                    Lazlow's rants about radio, the internet and other stuff like that is especially funny with a modern ear.
        The dirty, grimey environment of Liberty City in IV provides a perfect backdrop to tell the story of a lonely, poor Middle-Eastern immigrant and war veteran who's trying to escape a shadowy past, but is destined to be thrown into dilemma after shitty dilemma trying to atone for his wicked behaviour by exacting revenge on a slave smuggling kingpin he chose to work for but who ended up betraying him and his family.

Or, you could just play V instead, where the story begins with two Americans and one Canadian who are in a sun-soaked modern paradise struggling to, get rich.
            Someone give this man a medal
            What a silly way to simplify a game about 3 characters with 3 different backgrounds compared to a game with just one, just for the sake of having a completely biased comparison for no reason.
        It’s New York vs Los Angeles. On foot, walking from block to block, Liberty City wins. But in a car, I give the advantage to Los Santos.
        From the setting the dark atmosphere the crimes to the protagonists who come from varied backgrounds and really give you that melting pot feeling. And the emotions the characters have to the many choices you have that actually have different outcomes no matter how small. It's a masterpiece. Even the voicework throughout is amazing
            Hm, I don't quite remember the game the same way. Maybe I should play it again some time, but I've only got the original PS3 version with the crappy resolution, blurry visuals and frame rate issues (with slight weird bouncy/elastic driving controls compared to GTA V). I have to imagine that the experience might be much better on PC with mods and customizations + better hardware.

What I do remember about the story was a lot of that eastern European cynicism and depressive thinking. :-p (which I think might be partly why the game tends to feel like the black sheep of the 3D GTA series that often gets forgotten or not mentioned so much. a shame though, despite the technical issues i mentioned, it was a really good game for the time)

Oh, and then Red Dead Redemption came out, which was just such an amazing game in comparison. That's probably the other reason GTA 4 kinda gets forgotten. Perhaps...
        Same, I prefer GTA V's environment like about 10 times more.
            It was a question.
Honestly 4 for me is by far the best and the dlc is top notch stuff. I really really hope Rockstar learned their lesson and they handle this remaster themselves.  All this needs is 60 fps slight clean up on draw distance and update weapon wheel for both music and weapons and tbats it.
ahead of its time for sure, it looks amazing with mods that change the coloring and shit there’s a few good ones i did a play through of it recently with mods
    All the mods I found just made it look like gta 5 with shitty graphics mods and that like completely ruined the feel for me. I love gta iv’s griminess
        same here, i downloaded one that kept the same atmosphere/vibe but made it look better. i dont like the ones that change the sky or make the colors too bright, shit hurts my eyes tbh. i’ll link the mod if i can find the one i’m talking about it’s been a bit
            Dm me the link or name of the mod if you find it
                got you
                    Post the name, if you will
                        They're usually named something like 'Natural and Realistic ENB/lighting"
                            yeah something like. it’s simple and keeps the vibe but still has some good changes
                    I’m confused, why PM .. just post it as a comment and let others know lol
                        https://youtu.be/1o-ojTM6tCE link in the description
                    me too please!
        The neat thing with mods is that you can find what you want if you are will to look for it. 

I found iCEnhancer 3.0 Natural to be what I was looking for in keeping the tone of the city still gritty.  The only issue with it is that the game looks a bit too clean on 1.0.7.0 because fog/haze doesn't load properly compared to 1.0.4.0.   

This is noted problem with in the modders patch notes.
        The only graphics mod I really recommend is CleanIV, basically its just the vanilla graphics with the color filter removed: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24247
            Ye I like the color filter tho
                Honestly so do I lol, but I understand if someone doesnt want their game to look like a noire film when its cloudy
                    Yea it was a bit weird how it the entire game like turns into greyscale any time it rains
    or you can play tbogt, like OP's version.
        the mod worked with all the dlc too, it was just a diff experience other then playing it normal again
            oh wow, thats new. havent had too much luck with mods tho, many looked nauseating, discount gtaV i mean. Hope i can find one good mod soon.
                i’ve never modded gta 5 so idk much about that, but i have used some graphics mods for gta 4, i like the ones that keep the vibe of the game but just changes it up a bit, there some shit ones that make the game look too bright and it ruins the feel, but you can you find some good ones on youtube
                    yep, YT helped a bunch but my ancient Vaio PC is kinda 🤪 rigna, 3 weeks till new arrival and i just want to have a good time with that old friend. Anyways thanks
                        no problem enjoy the new pc!
                I like the original look with boosted graphics through NVIDIA Control Panel, like forced antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering.
I love GTA4 sadly the PC port is mess to this day. Performance is all over the place on any setting and aliasng is just bad even in 4K.
    Exactly. The PC port which should be the best version out there has a lot of gfx glitches and optimization issues. Not to mention it's a 14 year old game and could definitely use a facelift on textures and overall game mechanics.
    Yeah for me it drops to low 40’s even with my pc build that’s capable of 1440p gaming.. (RTX 2060 Super, Ryzen 3600, 16 GB RAM)
    I'm pretty sure playing the 360 version on Series X would be the best way to play the game
    It is terrible indeed. I am actually playing the game at 8k and in this resolution the jaggies are gone almost 100%. What I don't like is the texture flickering because of the bad LOD. This game deserves better but still at times it can look really pretty, like this screenshot
    Install a couple of mods and it looks great
it deserves a port moreover than a remaster....a remaster in the sense as better textures and foilage would work wonders and add to that a good optimised port especially for PC,if remaster means changing lighting,nope this would ruin GTA 4 completely just like trilogy.
    It deserves a remaster but, not made by Groove Street
I find it very difficult to play GTA 5 after playing the entire episodes of liberty city. Like I was on a marathon ( only story mode) from GTA SA a couple of months ago and after I finished TBOGT, I started 5 and found the gameplay a bit strange. I mean, I just don’t see an advancement.
    GTA V is so weird, such a huge world but feels so empty. The story as well is just like… non existent. I was honestly super disappointed in the narrative aspect of the game after how incredible GTA IV and its DLCs were
        True true. 

LS is a dead, soulless city. 
The behaviour of the AI, and cops are the biggest disappointments.

Why are the AI so generic, why are the cops only present in chases or near the police stations, and only attack the player for doing fuck all, in IV, the cops would arrest pedestrians beating Nico. In IV, pedestrians would use umbrellas in rainy weather, for me, these small details are huge. 

Kinda reminds me of Ubisoft titles.
            100%. Just doing a playthrough of IV at the moment (started after realising what a shambles TDE is), and you've just reminded me why V is such a letdown and why I shouldn't bother after I've finished this.
            Damn, totally. V does feel like a Ubisoft title
            This is just brainless. The AI in V is far better in V, and the cops are definitely way more advanced. And it’s definitely not dead, compared to IV. Your reasons are really stretching it. Of course the actual reasons are so small that you can only name examples like cops arresting people who fight you, and people with umbrellas in the rain, lol. As if peds don’t have certain actions/way more than the ones in IV did, by far. You put  nothing but bias, and zero thought into any of that.
    It's basically more shiny with some glitter on. Other than that it's kinda regressed in gameplay quality, IMO.
        Also lacking the "soul" the old games had. Vice city felt like you were actually in 80s Miami. San Andreas 90s LA. 4 Modern NYC. 5 was shiny and cool but completely lacked that feeling.
            Besides, there is no real attachment to the characters. In the previous games you have that connection or a thrill about the main characters of the game but in 5, you just don’t feel anything about anyone.
                For me Michael seemed like the most fleshed out character. I mean Trevor and Franklin are good too, but Michael just seemed more like the main character in my opinion. I mean he also has more missions if I'm not wrong
                I have lots of feelings for Trevor (and Lamar - but he didn’t get to become a main character.)
                    Yes. Trevor did have his moments in the game (best of the 3) but yeah I personally didn’t get the main character vibe from him. Maybe it’s just me though.
                        I felt pretty contempt about the story mode but I think it’s because it’s vastly different in that there are multiple main characters compared to all earlier games where we only had a single main protagonist.

But I really think for GTA V the real main character is ourselves with our online character.
                            Story mode sure was an experience. I did have a good time playing it, but when it comes to comparing with the older games, I just prefer it less that’s all. 

I’m more of a story mode fanboi than an online player, so I haven’t really spent much time there in the online world tbh.
                                Yeah I agree that it was way less immersive and I’m a bit of both. I love story mode as much as online, same for most games for me.
                Well yeah, but imo, this point doesn't apply to Michael and Trevor, only Franklin.
                Ummm i disagree. I found all of gtav protagonists really likeable. I loved Trevor's loyalty, I found franklin the most relatable, and i felt bad for Michael, and i loved how his character exposes our own hypocrisy. Like calling trevor crazy but running down 30 pedestrian as Michael at the same time.
                    They are likeable and forgettable at the same time for me.
                        And if trevor exposes Michaels hypocrisy, lamar exposes franklins hypocrisy. Franklin calls lamar's gang life crazy, telling him how he is going to die, etc. Yet if you look at story missions we do with him, there is no difference between the kife of lamar and the life of franklin.
            Yeah I think you’re just mistaking your opinion for fact here. GTA V captures and commentates on modern LA quite well.
                As you state your opinion as if it's fact. Lol
                    You got me. But my opinion is a lot more reasonable than yours. Most people who plays GTA V would agree that it captures modern LA *very* well.

The way you put the previous games on a pedestal when GTA V is on the same level of quality in it’s world design makes me believe your opinion is based in bias towards the previous games.

I don’t know why there’s a hate train for  V on this sub, especially when you all love to applaud IV. 

When GTA IV came out, it arguably dropped the most from the GTA formula out of any game.
                        You thinking your opinion is more reasonable than mine is yet another opinion. You're making a whole lot of assumptions. I never said I didn't enjoy five. In fact I called it cool. Your posts are filled with logical fallacies. I'm referring to the ambiance and atmosphere of the environment. It's a pretty common opinion in the community if you don't live under a rock.

In fact. For those who do live under a rock such as yourself. You can simply reference to the remaining comment thread and all of the up voters here to see how community members agree. Its not that deep.
                            Yeah I don’t think most GTA fans would agree that V is less ambient than the previous games.

And also to have the balls to say GTA V has no soul, when most open world games can’t even come close to what Los Santos achieved in open world design.
            V feels like modern Southern California. That’s the soul. You don’t know what you’re talking about
            Hard disagree. I love the setting and environment in GTA 5 more than any other GTA game, personally. Los Santos is just so beautiful and the mountains and the Blaine County desert is amazing, too. I just love the vibe of present day California.
            But also 2010’s LA is also just uninteresting. Maybe now they could do something with TikTok culture and whatever, but GTA V seriously struggled to find its theme
        Agree.
    The only major gameplay improvement I can think of between IV and V is the weapons wheel.
        Mission checkpoints too.
        Maybe we get that in the definitive edition of GTA 4 along with other gamebreaking shit.
    GTA 5 was a downgrade when it came to gameplay. Everything is dumbed down in some way.

GTA 5s map is also pretty poor and I would go as far as to say it's possibly the worst map in the series. It's just one city with the rest of the map more or less going to waste with large empty spaces. There's just nothing to do outside of the city. You drive out, you drive back again. It needed at least another another city or island so that empty space could be used as a crossing. 

GTA IV's map might've been samey in terms of being a city but it felt alive and interesting. GTA V just feels hollow and generic for the most part.

Rockstar simply wasn't very ambitious when it came to GTA V really. It doesn't really do anything fresh besides the character switching. Even the story is pretty forgettable. This is big reason why it frustrates me to see them milking it so much. It's not the best GTA entry and yet it's still going nearly a decade later.
        Man... I see what you're saying, but calling V an unambitious game, and a downgrade in gameplay is just crazy to me. If anything GTA IV was a step back in gameplay from SA, because they got rid of planes, stats, car modifications, parachutes, properties, clothing, diving, the varied setting, and wayy more that I can't remember. GTA V brought that all back, on the same hardware as IV, and ran and looked much better. 

When people compare IV and V, they always mention the atmosphere, story, and physics. But does any of that actually make the gameplay better? Most missions in GTA IV were chase missions or cover-shoot missions, and only really 3 (bank, museum, and hotel) had interesting settings. If you don't like the story, there's very little for you to enjoy during these missions.

This is coming from a huge IV fanboy too. This game and COD4 were the games I played when I had the most free time in my life, in late middle/early high school. Got nothing but love for IV. But it's not better than SA and V, unless you *really* like its specific offerings.

Sorry about the whole rant but it's just weird seeing EVERYONE on the internet have this opinion that IV is significantly better than V, in every possible way. Idk when that started, but I remember so many people calling it a step back from SA back in the day, and now no one says that.
            I love IV, but you're making some really good points. There were lots of stuff I missed going from SA to IV, and I always felt a little claustrofobic with no countryside.
    >I just don’t see an advancement.

I don't know what the hell you're talking about but I do see a lot of improvement. The vehicle handling felt better and there's a lot more improvement in the weapons and aiming system.

Not to mention, the graphics are a lot better, too.
        Graphics, weapon wheel, weapons and the character switch were the only things that I felt were new/better. It’s probably just what I feel. Still, no hate for the game.
            And vehicle handling, parachutes, planes, map variety, etc.
                The vehicle handling is pretty generic compared to IV, they should've toned down the slipperiness of the cars, but not completely get rid of the physics, and the damage physics in V is garbage, + the NPCs and cops are pretty soulless compared to IV's, they're just buncha angry mindless bots waiting to attack you. + parachutes were added in the dlc.
                    I usually don't care much about vehicle damage physics unless it's too bad like in San Andreas where the vehicle's rear end somehow gets damaged when you hit the front end of the car lol.

GTA V's vehicle damage physics weren't noticeably bad so I didn't really care.

What I look for, personally, in the vehicles is the vehicular handling, and I like V's vehicular handling a LOT more than IV's.

Can you go into more detail about why you think NPCs and cops are "soulless" because I don't see what you mean by that. In fact, mind you, I've seen cops carry the bodies of their dead comrades in GTA V during shootouts, which is quite realistic behaviour.
                        Cuz as soon as you get close to them they start attacking, for no reason, and their behaviour makes you feel no sympathy for them at all.
A small detail that blows my mind about GTA 4, especially on PC, is how traffic jams occur naturally, in V, the traffic jams you see are scripted events that trigger only on some character change sequence, but in IV, try crossing the the east borough bridge at 7AM, or try entering Union Drive around 5pm, and there will be actual traffic jams that occur, making the city feel authentic, and adding a challenge to city driving.
    In terms of atmosphere and authenticism, IV is in a league of its own.
    Its an incredible game, on the note of traffic I downloaded a realistic traffic mod that changes how and when traffic spawns

Less cars on the road at night time in certain areas

And of course increased traffic during rush hour, they really captured NYC perfectly and its one of the best rockstar worlds to date
        I love this mod too. Only thing that bugs me is that my computer goes nuts when I play GTA IV with this mod sadly. So I have no choice but to play with the regular traffic, with the maximum setting.
But on PC it's pain in the ass, won't work properly.
That's my favorite. Don't care if you can't fly planes, Niko and his horrible accent are the best.
    I mean accent is not that bad
I just wish it had some sort of upscale job on Xbox One X like RDR got. I just turned on RDR for a few minutes and I still can't believe they were able to get that game to render in 4K, it looks stunning.

I hate that GTA IV is still 720p on that system. Sure I could play it on PC but it's horribly optimised, and I have been struggling for years trying to get it to run without issues. The stuttering gives me a headache.
Grove Street games looking at this post salivating at the very thought of absolutely butchering the remaster.
Rockstar....Please have mercy upon us...

Leave this game.
    *GTA 4 has been removed from all stores *
        I would burn down their corporate HQ.
            Start with T2.
                I might go after them anyway if they disallow modding in Kerbal Space Program 2.
    I don't really get why people act like that. It's not like you will never get to play the original gta 4 again if they release a definitive edition of it.
        lol is this a joke? They removed the originals when they released trilogy DE
            They didn't remove the originals completely. They just removed them from the store but if you already bought them and have them in your library you can play them without any issue.
                True true, good point
For me, GTA 4 is up there with GTA SA. Played it a lot, even more than GTA 5.
This is probably my favorite part of the map. Especially at night.
If you're on PC. The 360 version looks like ass.
Yes, I agree. Was playing gta 4 on PC and I'm surprised it still holds on. On Ps3/360, not so much.
I really really want to pick up 4 again but I don't think I can with over 50 of the iconic songs cut
    [*] Vladivostok FM
    You can restore them.
        Yeah I had to do some digging on that. For a while, I only saw Steam guides that were broken but I eventually came across the DEP just a few moments ago. 

Thanks :)
    What does that mean? I am out of the loop
        Rockstar updated the game, when the licenses for the music in the game ran out - they had to remove the music
            Record labels are the greediest fucks...
                You could also just add those songs back along with some of your personal faves with MP3’s on independence FM on pc, that’s always a lot of fun I find.
                Try video game publishers
                    Do you know anything about the music industry? Game devs are charities compared to the amount of greed those fuckers have. The music industry sues grandmas for millions. They will stop at no end in their pursuit of money.
                        And they’ve been around for a lot longer than video game publishers, so they’ve had time to sharpen their greed
                        "Oh 1 millisecond of our music in your video? your video's now ours."
            Wait didn't they add them back in? I remember the shicky schiky schweine song from the very first mission was removed, but I thought it was put back in.
            Was this on console versions, too?
Funny how that one shitty Shark Cards loser scrolled down and downvoted everyone who likes GTA IV. 
I fixed that lol.
GTA V has a great story, action, gameplay, replay value, everything that I would consider it an all time great game. But I only beat it once and I always go back to playing GTA IV. This is the only GTA that I’ve beaten 100% 5 times and I also got all the pigeons each time. There is just something about this game that makes me go back to it, even if it’s not the latest and greatest GTA out.
i think i have to buy gta 4 soon to the pc.
Still my favorite GTA game of all time
Anyone else willing to help me get through some multiplayer achievements before they shut down the servers on Dec 16?
    I would gladly help you with that, but sadly I’m on PC and the multiplayer aspect was completely removed from this version.
    I also need them
        PM me your xbox live handle and let’s knock em out
    Isn't that only for gta 5 online servers for the Xbox 360?
Grand Theft Awesome 4!
I was just screaming this the other day on my pc
I put hundreds of hours into gta4 online. Just messing around in free mode with friends.
Too bad it's not optimized very well..
On PC that is !!

In consoles we have a terrible draw distance and blurry game
No shit
[deleted]
It still is. On console that is. On PC it was HELL to patching the game up IMO.
    Worth the trouble, you can play at 4K 60fps with modern hardware and it's a blast
        [deleted]
            But Crysis on switch doesn’t look anything like the graphical masterpiece it is/was on PC lol. The switch also runs the Witcher 3, but it looks like blurry ass
        What patches fix performance?
            Cap the framerate at 59/60 and you shouldn't experience huge framedrops, also DXVK reduces stuttering by a lot. Again, this is on modern hardware, trying to play on low-end PCs is still pretty troublesome.

Edit: it's also important to keep the view/detail distance sliders below 50.

Honestly the original console versions are awful, slow, blurry and they barely run at 25 FPS. Definitely not the proper way to experience such a beautiful game.
    Using dxvk is hell. Dragging and dropping two files is hell. Wow.
Does anyone have a good mod that fixes the performance on PC?
    Use dxvk !
Best GTA. My judgement may have been clouded by playing the extensions straight after finishing it so in my mind it's the biggest game ever. So many moments! Don't think we'll have the same again.
So much better than GTA 5 by any aspect you can think of besides the technical limitations. It's the true GTA experience and a masterpiece of gaming. Still holds up sooo well and it's 13 years old.
Ballad of gay tony has the best atmosphere of the modern gtas imo
reddit mods should kill themselves
    Is it confirmed they’re working on the IV remaster?!
        they have been sending random copyright takedowns related to IV, a save file among other things, the pattern fits an imminent shitshow.
Been enjoying this on my Series S lately. If they remaster this I pray they don’t mess it up.
Any advice for a first play thorough in 2021? Mods probably?
    Just play vanilla. Maybe add some reshade to enhance colors and AA. Use as well DSR and install the Definitive Edition patch, it will fix lots of problems with the port.
        I mean, there's some pretty high-quality texture packs for the environment, characters, and vehicles, that make the game look significantly better while staying true to the original art style. [Here's what my current modded setup for the game looks like.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51675918282_a096c4a6df_o.png)
            What mods do you have?
                [I explained it all here a little while ago](https://reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/qt5gb8/managed_to_get_gta_iv_looking_about_as_close_to/hkhqnta/)
            Amazing
    Just tweak the game through NVIDIA Control Panel, or through an AMD equivalent, and force antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering, with these tweaks the game still looks very good.
This game alone is the reason I might be a PS3. I miss it so much
    PC would be best bc you can at least add a few mods. I think PS3 ran worse than the 360 version.
Playing through the definitive edition trilogy then hitting this up and by the time I get through this the next gen upgrade for 5 will be out
GTA IV is a great game, it’s just a shame the map was quite bland and small imo. I quite like the diversity the GTA V and SA map had with its different landscapes and environments, which GTA IV lacked.
IV doesn’t get the credit it deserves.
Best in the series.
GTA 4 is the underrated gem in the franchise
My only real complaint with IV is that often times the color palette is extremely dull and everything either looks brown or gray. To be fair that was a pretty big issue with games in general at the time.
Better than what was just realise imo
We all know it deserves a proper well made remaster but certainly not from GSG .. can't even imagine how terrible it will be if they did it
Bruh they need to remaster this.  Not a complete remodel in a new engine.  Just some better textures, lighting, and draw distance.  That’s literally all.
Just wait utntil they "remaster" it.
GTA IV and CTW are both underrated.. if rockstar was as bold as before and can’t figure out where they headed, they should remake GTA CTW completely in a 3D GTA Unreal engine 5 form if they wanna be cheap about, my fault sounding like I was born after 04😓
It's either the 4th or 5th best GTA. Big letdown from San Andreas.
Too bad it looks blurry on xbox, but i still love it
Euphoria physics is a treat to the eyes
IV is definitely my favorite atmosphere. It felt like a real breathing city with insane detail
Don't jinx it, they might decide to "remaster" this too.
San Andreas is better
During daytime its not a pretty thing on Xbox though, it has these weird water paint like graphics, back then this was one thing I hated.
Gta 4 really is Gorgeous
It was the first of the HD versions and I wouldn't agree that it's so much of a black sheep it still has a huge fan base that would probably tell you it's their favorite. It plays great on Xbox one and a decent TV I honestly don't think mods are needed but there is or were a lot of cool mods. And the game is much more diverse than just Eastern Europeans your associates and friends are from very different backgrounds not to mention the DLC especially TBOGT where you play as Luis who is Puerto Rican. That whole story is awesome and the way you play as 3 different protagonist whose story intertwines is awesome and I honestly think they did a better job of that than in V where you can instantly switch back and forth.
Even better with the zolika patch/trainer and the dxvk fix, and forcing all dynamic shadows from all light sources. Walking at night especially around broker and algonquin never felt more immersive.
I think if didn't need a remaster
Just fix GTA 4 on PC and then release it on current gen & next gen console
Which is why nobody at Rockstar should start doing a definitive edition of it. GTA IV is perfect just the way it is.
    A 14 year old game with no improvements needed? Uhhhh, nah dawg. It could definitely use a (good) remaster.
        Have you actually played the game? It literally does not need a remaster. A graphical one, knowing rockstar, would require that the engine gets modified, ruining it.
            I've owned the original and subsequent PC release and just played it for several hours yesterday so yes.. I've 'played' the game. What a silly question.
            Just port everything over to the latest rage engine. Boom, actually good remaster accomplished
                The euphoria engine is the only thing that made gta 4 good. The rage engine is not as immersive. besides, you say that like porting stuff from one engine to the other is easy? Have you been living under a rock?
                    I’d expect that porting an existing game to a slightly different internal game engine should be easy for a multi-billion dollar company, yes.
                    Euphoria is not an engine the game runs on, it’s still RAGE, just using Euphoria physics.
                        Whoops i meant euphoria physics, thats my bad. Its still outrageous to say that simply porting a game to a newer iteration of an engine can represent absolutely no drawbacks at all, there's like evidence you know... But its only my opinion.
    Still needs a port for ps4 and ps5
        That - yes. But I was referring to the idea of definitive edition like the bois from GSG did.
i just wish 4k resolution was available, and that it didn't look blurry. don't know how i can fix it. doesnt look too sharp on my tv
    You can with steam launch option.
    Just set the game resolution in the game, or edit the .ini file, or set the resolution through Steam like the other dude said.
        i didn't know that was an option. im gonna try it out thank you all
Always has..
The environments and vehicles do for sure.
Ive been playing it a lot lately. Both the Episodes from Liberty City and the original game. Really been enjoying it, though it seems to have some issues. It’s very laggy on high graphics even tho I have a high end pc with RTX 3080 and a good CPU. and I run GTA V on ultra with high FPS.
But aye, at least it looks better than on my old crappy ps3 lol.
Just got my PS3 today and can't wait to play IV again!
Man I love this game. Tearing down the roads with that driving in the wedding mission 😚👌 I always used to get a white car for it too. Such a good fucking game.
Still my favourite GTA game. I cannot fathom why they haven’t made it available on next gen, even if it’s just a straight up rerelease with no remastering.
    You can play the disc on series x
        But not PS5 :/
            Sadly no :(
It always surprises me just how detailed and vibrant the map feels. If you just walk around on any random street, it feels so realistic
Definitely my favorite in the GTA series really hope it makes it to ps5 so I can play it again! \^\^
Time to find my old PS3 and buy a new controller for it
Mine doesn't look no where near that good, is it because mine is on 360? Lol is there something I don't know about? This PC?
and the best GTA game imo
When i remember GTA 4 I just remember the song "let's get lost" by Chet Baker on JNR
    Such a great song.
GTA IV on PC looked absolutely gorgeous.
Damn i wanna play again
All I wanna do is play GTAIV but I got a PS4😩
I love the driving in IV. It’s a bit trickier at the start, especially when starting a new game after playing V for a while, but it’s so much more fun and satisfying and requires a bit more thought being put in when making turns and maneuvering.
    Yeah, the driving makes everything so much fun.
Gta 4 probably best gta imo
GTA 4 >>>>>>>> GTA 5
GTA IV is true gem. Been playing it few weeks ago with some gfx mods and HQ textures. That game is best GTA in series.
What I enjoy about GTA IV is that even though it features some of the most basic, well, features, the physics make the game so freakin' fun an replayable. You got the standard casual clothes, fancy clothes, and middle class clothes, the basic, Glock, AK47, and UZI weapons. But those weapons work so well, again, due to the physics, that the game is a sandbox masterpiece. I adore this game.

&#x200B;

And keep in mind, this is without even mentioning the story.

(sorry for clumsy grammar)
Is the best looking so far. Yeah GTAV has better graphics, but they nailed the atmosphere in 4 and that does a lot.
    GTA4 Had this dark gritty feel with it's color palette and I absolutely loved it. I can't even describe it, but GTA5 seems way to vibrant and colorful in comparison, I've played both extensively and I can safely say I think GTA4 is the superior game in terms of story and authenticity. Maybe it might be my nostalgia goggles. But I doubt it lol
        It’s the tone. In 5 is pretty inconsistent, sometimes it tries to be serious and realistic, and then everything is ridiculous like a Saints Row game. It’s like they couldn’t decide which way to go and that hurted the story a lot.
It blows my mind how awesome it looks. This game was truly ahead of its time
It does, I love the graphics more than 5s
it's sad that you have to mod gta 4, live thought 20 cops, or just play gta 4 online to get here. I think
    you unlock the island eventually.
Without checkpoints and only 720p on consoles it’s sure a slog.
My most played GTA. We don’t need a remaster, can they just port it over to current gen consoles…
    It needs a remaster, I just played it on my Xbox Series X. Still a solid game, but the faces look so scary & the controls need a tweak

You could fix that with a patch I suppose
        I’m on xbox one, would you recommend getting it? it’s been 10 years since I last played it
            GTA IV? It’s hella fun, I just replayed it

I loved it when it came out, it’s really fun now. The DLC is great too

I’d recommend playing it. It feels somewhere between GTA III & GTA V. The driving is the most realistic in the series
i think this screenshot is actually from tbogt.  doesn’t diminish op’s point in the slightest, though
Damn dude I finished it I think 2 or 3 times when it came out back in the day and haven't touched it since.

That picture made me wanna play it again after refunding the heresy that is DE.
    Played through the main game and Lost and the Damned again recently, I highly recommend it. GTA IV has to be one of the best single player experience I've ever had. I play though the main game and dlcs probably once every other year and I am never let down. I can't wait to finish this year's play through with The Ballad of Gay Tony. Yusuf Amir is by far my favorite side character and the fact that he's the guy who owns the construction site where the World Trade Center used to be is fucking hilarious.
        >Yusuf Amir is by far my favorite side character and the fact that he's the guy who owns the construction site where the World Trade Center used to be is fucking hilarious.

I never noticed that the construction site was where the twin towers used to be lmao that's pretty savage of them.

My internet is down for the past 2 days because of a storm and I'm dying to download it already...
Yea because New York City is the greatest city on earth. Queens in the building!
GTA IV is a true masterpiece. There’s never gonna be anything like it again (I lie, RDR1 and 2 probably qualify). It’s not just an open world game to mess around in it’s an experience like no other once the game sucks you into its world and the atmosphere washes over you. And Niko is by far one of the best video game protagonists ever created. 

I believe it is the game that Dan Houser at least, always wanted to make and it’s the epitome of what he envisioned for GTA before they had the technology to realise that vision. 

GTA V is an ok game, but it’s very…how do you say? It’s a product. Like how Saints Row threw away its integrity after 2, it’s not got any heart. Every game is a product in that it exists to make money, but GTA V feels like it exists for that alone. And look at what they’ve done to it…it’s become a parody of itself.
    I 99% agree with you, the missing 1% is that I disagree with you that Niko is the best protagonist ever created, for me it's Adam Jensen from Deus Ex.
        Well, I did say Niko was one of the best, rather than THE best. He’s joint first with a few others of my personal favourites
            Well, sorry for sharing my opinion then.

EDIT: did you really just downvote me? Lmao
                No, I didn’t downvote you
I did not enjoy gta iv at all unfortunately. 

Felt like a downgrade from SA in terms of mechanics. 

Hell V isnt even as robust as SA from a mechanics perspective.
Yes.
Would LOVE to see them remaster this and do it justice
Indeed my friend
playing with integrated and still looking good
But driving in this game is shit. It's the only reason I couldn't get too far into it.
    The driving in GTA4 is the best in the series.
        That is the most outrageous shit I have ever heard anybody say.
        I don't understand why people say that because the driving is way too cumbersome in IV. They improved it so much in V. If I wanted to play a driving simulator I'd pop in Forza or Gran Turismo. While driving is important in a city simulator it's not the primary focus.
            GTA V has literally the worst and most boring driving mechanics I have ever seen in any game, maybe, just maybe Watch Dogs is worse in this regard.
                I think it has the best driving mechanics of the series so far. It doesn't need to be hyper realistic but this game isn't a racing simulator. But it's ok I've seen this discussion before and people seem to be highly opinionated in favor or against both GTA IV and GTA V's driving mechanics.
                    Every car in 5 has Stability Control that cuts power mid slide and stops on a dime.

Every car in 4 has shot shocks.

A little balance would be nice.
I guess unpopular opinion but GTA IV has aged considerable. It's like a 14 year old game now. The character models, building textures, and the surrounding water don't look that good. The driving mechanics are cumbersome to learn properly. It could definitely use a face lift in gfx and modern mechanics.
    Graphics update, yes but leave mechanics alone reeeeeee
The driving in GTA 4 sucks. Not every car has super springs. Feels like you're driving a jack-in-a-box
    Its hard to get used to definitely, but atleast big cumbersome vehicles felt like they were supposed to

In GTA V it felt like everything was exactly the same
    So put in a different handling.dat file.
https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=5529
    In 5, every car comes with sport suspension.
Another gta 4 circle jerk post, great.
    There is a specific sub for posts about GTA Online, for Fortnite there is a specific sub as well, there are literally subs for all the shitty live service games you enjoy, so what's your problem?
        And there’s also a sub for gta 4, your point is?
            My point is that I don't comment on every GTA V post just to say that it's just another circle jerk.
Well, every Game looks good at night with oversaturation and a lot of contrast.
Such a great story it’s a shame the gameplay isn’t great
And plays like absolute shit
While I don't think it's a good game by any stretch, it looks fine. There's no reason to tamper with it.
Ya ok. Wheres GTA6?
I beat IV before the remasters launched. GTA IV has terrible faces for their characters, some of them look scary. At least on console, PC does look better
GSG: For now...
But the original style is ACTUALLY going for a cartoony look, so we’ll sims this bad boy up so good.
Is it still a mess on pc?
My favorite GTA game - unfairly underrated at it's time. The environment and the physics were and are amazing
It really needs a remaster to fix the horrible PC port but if R* just cheaps out and hires Grove street games to do it then it's fucking done for already
yeee took a break from gta online..
I really want gta 4 on modern hardware…
Definitely doesn't need any sort of Definitive Edition.
I play on pc and I'm thinking about buying GTA IV on steam. Any chance it's gonna on discount or should I just buy it rn?
It doesn't need a remaster and I hope it never gets remastered. If I wanted to see anything added to it, just put a weapon wheel on there - otherwise if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I've never understood why it was never put on the PS4.
and still had better multiplayer
I should pick this up on PC sometime, if only to play with mods. Saw a fun looking Delorean one.
GTA Online for 4 was fun.

I'll always miss being in the airport and Bohan.
I play this more the v on PC.
not for too long
Is the DLC any good? Haven't played IV in years, never played the DLC.
    tbogt is amazing
Really nice picture, great job dude.
Always did and always will.
At night, yes. During the day... sepia world.
absoulutely
yah
Hell yes it does and they better not butcher my baby.
Only if it ran well
What mods are being used here? ENB? After recent updates GTA IV has been really bad with enb.
This game is perfect. Played it since launch and will probably never stop.
T2 is that you trying to clean up this mess? I've seen a tonne of positive posts in a few days...
Agreed!
Pls no remaster just make this game playable on ps5/xsx
    It’s backwards compatible on xsx I’m playing it right now
I recently played through around half the game (with mods) and it was just as enjoyable as I remember. Sadly my playthrough got cut short by Steam deciding to put me back on the latest version which broke all my mods.

I know it goes against the games original vision but I modded out the bleak filter in exchange for something more vibrant. Here’s a brief video of me forgetting you cant drive the cars like you do in other GTA games

https://streamable.com/qorne0
I love this game for having one of the best ragdoll physics and physics in general. When I saw how badly cars can be damage, I was reminded of a real life accident, I've seen some terrible car crashes where cars are left unrecognizable, a pretty brutal sight to behold.
The story was better than 5 IMO, my one complaint is the driving physics. It’s as if you’ve got a boot full of water in every car.
    In Canada and North Eastern states we keep our trunk full of sand, so the handling is extremely realistic.

Makes for great long drifts. I only wish there was fresh snow on the ground.
It really does, even with my piece of shit laptop I still enjoyed playing it back in the day hahaha
I actually recently started playing again myself because I played it in middle school and didn’t think much of the game. Now as an adult I have a decent PC and can actually play it where it doesn’t look awful and it’s actually a really good experience!
This is true. The game doesn't even need a remaster, let alone a remake. It even runs at a locked 60fps on the Xbox Series S/X.
    It does need a 4K patch on console tho.
I love GTA 4,but the optimization sucks.
GTA IV is like in \[PROTOTYPE\] setting.
As someone with a PS4 and Xbox one. How can I get GTA 4? Is it online stores
People constantly shit on 4. Idk why I think it’s great
I feel like the PS3/Xbox 360 era is when games start to truly look good. Half Life 2 is an exception. Crysis has clearly set a bar for game graphics (7 years ahead of its time), and other games including GTA 4 have tried to follow it, and yeah, still looks great!

Honestly, I'm not surprised if old games still look good anymore. Obviously games before the PS3 era like GTA 3 look bad by today's standards, but we've reached a point where games look presentable and that any flaws such as blurry textures or colors will just be seen as an art direction.

If someone shows me GTA 4 and they're like "woah, the game still looks amazing!" I wouldn't even be surprised.
GenerallMarket is back, but now on the clear-net with a different method of security and encryption. For those who know about generallmarket years back on the dark-net, the marketplace was among the top 5 legit dark-net marketplaces, and I'm glad they still keep that legitimacy till date

Yeah i think i need to replay it for the 100x time now haha
Still hate rockstar for never adding it into psnow, even though both red dead redemption & undead nightmare are 🙄.

I guess here’s to waiting for another stupid “remaster” where they probably remove the euphoria physics engine  🙄🙄.
    I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

The trio of Niko,Johnny and Luis is countless hours of content.
        If the leaks are anywhere near true, they’ll all be remastered with the RAGE engines of RDR2/GTAV. 
Which wouldn’t be as bad, although the Euphoria engine was pretty fun.
            that doesn't make any sense - they didn't even make a mobile port of GTA4, so, what the fuck are they going to base a whole remaster off of?
                Lmao
                I would love to see a phone run the physics engine of gta 4... i think it will fry the entire phone right when you launch it.
                    that's the biggest reason why gta 4 runs like shit on a stick
                Wat
                    oh, you haven't heard about the Definitive GTA Trilogy that just came out? you should look into that.
            I'll temper my expectations after the DE: Trilogy but I really hope they retain the ragdoll physics and car characteristics from GTA: IV.

I love how it feels so different from any other GTA.
                Exactly! The driving and physics were so fun. If they change that, they’re taking away a huge part of what makes that game great
                    Personally, I liked how realistic it felt, but I remember people hating the driving back then. Motorcycles were practically useless until the Lost and Damned.
                        I hated every motorcycle chase in IV.
            The physics in 4 still amaze me. It's one aspect that's seriously lacking in the newer games imo
            Euphoria Physics is built in part of the RAGE engine. The remaster should have it, even if it will be toned down like in V and RDR2. Speaking of the remaster, I think the leaks are true, because it's from the same sources and it'd make sense, plus they already started taking down GTA IV mods lol. I just hope they won't screw my favorite GTA up so much like they did with the Trilogy.
            Euphoria is baked into the rage engine by default. They just toned down the physics a lot for GTA 5 but in RDR2 they're turned back up a bit just not quite as crazy as GTA 4. Gta doesn't run off of euphoria it runs off of RAGE as well which like I said has euphoria baked into it. You couldn't run a game using euphoria because it's not not engine.
        What's LCS got anything to do with them three?
            He most probably means EFLC.
            I meant the DLC for GTA:IV, Episode's of Liberty City.

My fault, my comment above can be confusing without the specification.
        You mean Episodes of Liberty City? Liberty City Stories is about Tony Cipriani from III.
        On the Apple store Chinatown Wars and Liberty City Stories are available but not GTA IV.. WTH?
        You can still buy the dlc just not as liberty city stories. I just bought them recently. You load BOGT and TLAD from the pause menu by going to load game or something.
        U mean episodes from liberty city lcs is the gta 3 prequel game that’s better than gta 3
        > I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

It is though?
        Johnny died bro
    Why would they remove the physics engine? That would take more effort than its worth. They didn’t remove anything from the trilogy remasters except the same music that’s been removed on every version except the PS2 original copies.
        It wasn’t the RAGE engine they more prominently use now, it’s supposedly why it’s a mess on the PlayStation. Something about the ps not being able to handle the GPU, Idk.

Although I can’t say from experience, as I had a 360 back in those days (rip). But that’s just from what I’ve read.
            If they remade the game they’d get rid of it. But I really don’t see them doing that. If they remastered it (like the trilogy) they wouldn’t be able to remove the engine cause then it would be a full on remake and that would take a LOT more effort and resources and time

Also don’t understand the fuss about it supposedly not working on PlayStation. I played it on PS3 originally and it was my most played game, I finished it over and over again. Didn’t have any problems with it
    Honestly at this point I’m thinking of just buying a cheap Xbox 360 so I can play it again
        If you do, Get the og Xbox. That’s the one you want. You can also make ur own radio station.
    Took me way too long to understand what “pee snow” was hahaha
    I think PS now is still a garbage service. It’s not worth the price that they pay for what you get. I’d rather just turn my PS3 on and off the disks in
I always hated that Windows Live thing GTA 4 had, glad it's gone for good
everything about gta 4 ties together into a perfect package. the environment, the gameplay, the athmosphere, the sense of mystery, especially on the first playthrough. the new phone and internet were amazing, with all the little hidden easter eggs, secrets, and lore bits. physics with (mostly) realistic car handling and deforming, guns that have proper, satisfying punch to them, the most realistic ragdoll physics of any game ever, truly one of the best games ever made.
    The physics could actually get a little annoying sometimes, honestly, but even so I preferred 4 over 5 drastically. It was just completely unique to the series.

Plus nothing beats doing that heavy 180 turn backwards with your car.
        I loved doing that
            It's my main source of dopamine when playing the game.
        Especially while shooting at someone, capping them, and then whipping your car back around to speed away
    Damn straight
    > the most realistic ragdoll physics of any game ever

That’s a complete lie. Max Payne 3, Red 1 and 2 all have way more realistic ragdoll physics than IV does. And in some ways, V improves upon it, and makes it less exaggerated. IV’s still isn’t the most realistic, though.
Yeah I love all the GTA games a lot, but IV succeeds unbelievably well in what it's trying to
Totally man. Only Paris from AC Unity comes close imo, in terms of atmosphere and immersion anyway.
    Chicago in WD 1
    In AC, it's Egypt and Venice for me.
        Egypt is just perfect, definitely one of the greatest settings in any videogame ever.

I adore that game and it's beauty
    Syndicate has twice as many crowd animations and atmospheric details, if you liked Unity your mind will be blown.
        I've played both. Paris hits different imo due to the goings on and the setting in general.
Red dead 2.
    ...is shit and has nothing to do with GTA
    I'll agree that's a badass environment I'm personally just more intrigued with a more modern setting and city that's just my opinion I love Red Dead though
I'm curious. Why do you think it has a better environment compared to GTA V?
    I would probably say just the time period it takes place in really set the tone for the environment in GTA IV.
        I felt like they really nailed it.
            Yeah, it's that really cool sliver of time back in the mid 2000s that had one foot in the 20th century and another in the 21st. It's funny listening to the radio ads and talk shows and seeing how much about the future the got right and conversely how much they got wrong.
                Lazlow's rants about radio, the internet and other stuff like that is especially funny with a modern ear.
    The dirty, grimey environment of Liberty City in IV provides a perfect backdrop to tell the story of a lonely, poor Middle-Eastern immigrant and war veteran who's trying to escape a shadowy past, but is destined to be thrown into dilemma after shitty dilemma trying to atone for his wicked behaviour by exacting revenge on a slave smuggling kingpin he chose to work for but who ended up betraying him and his family.

Or, you could just play V instead, where the story begins with two Americans and one Canadian who are in a sun-soaked modern paradise struggling to, get rich.
        Someone give this man a medal
        What a silly way to simplify a game about 3 characters with 3 different backgrounds compared to a game with just one, just for the sake of having a completely biased comparison for no reason.
    It’s New York vs Los Angeles. On foot, walking from block to block, Liberty City wins. But in a car, I give the advantage to Los Santos.
    From the setting the dark atmosphere the crimes to the protagonists who come from varied backgrounds and really give you that melting pot feeling. And the emotions the characters have to the many choices you have that actually have different outcomes no matter how small. It's a masterpiece. Even the voicework throughout is amazing
        Hm, I don't quite remember the game the same way. Maybe I should play it again some time, but I've only got the original PS3 version with the crappy resolution, blurry visuals and frame rate issues (with slight weird bouncy/elastic driving controls compared to GTA V). I have to imagine that the experience might be much better on PC with mods and customizations + better hardware.

What I do remember about the story was a lot of that eastern European cynicism and depressive thinking. :-p (which I think might be partly why the game tends to feel like the black sheep of the 3D GTA series that often gets forgotten or not mentioned so much. a shame though, despite the technical issues i mentioned, it was a really good game for the time)

Oh, and then Red Dead Redemption came out, which was just such an amazing game in comparison. That's probably the other reason GTA 4 kinda gets forgotten. Perhaps...
    Same, I prefer GTA V's environment like about 10 times more.
        It was a question.
All the mods I found just made it look like gta 5 with shitty graphics mods and that like completely ruined the feel for me. I love gta iv’s griminess
    same here, i downloaded one that kept the same atmosphere/vibe but made it look better. i dont like the ones that change the sky or make the colors too bright, shit hurts my eyes tbh. i’ll link the mod if i can find the one i’m talking about it’s been a bit
        Dm me the link or name of the mod if you find it
            got you
                Post the name, if you will
                    They're usually named something like 'Natural and Realistic ENB/lighting"
                        yeah something like. it’s simple and keeps the vibe but still has some good changes
                I’m confused, why PM .. just post it as a comment and let others know lol
                    https://youtu.be/1o-ojTM6tCE link in the description
                me too please!
    The neat thing with mods is that you can find what you want if you are will to look for it. 

I found iCEnhancer 3.0 Natural to be what I was looking for in keeping the tone of the city still gritty.  The only issue with it is that the game looks a bit too clean on 1.0.7.0 because fog/haze doesn't load properly compared to 1.0.4.0.   

This is noted problem with in the modders patch notes.
    The only graphics mod I really recommend is CleanIV, basically its just the vanilla graphics with the color filter removed: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24247
        Ye I like the color filter tho
            Honestly so do I lol, but I understand if someone doesnt want their game to look like a noire film when its cloudy
                Yea it was a bit weird how it the entire game like turns into greyscale any time it rains
or you can play tbogt, like OP's version.
    the mod worked with all the dlc too, it was just a diff experience other then playing it normal again
        oh wow, thats new. havent had too much luck with mods tho, many looked nauseating, discount gtaV i mean. Hope i can find one good mod soon.
            i’ve never modded gta 5 so idk much about that, but i have used some graphics mods for gta 4, i like the ones that keep the vibe of the game but just changes it up a bit, there some shit ones that make the game look too bright and it ruins the feel, but you can you find some good ones on youtube
                yep, YT helped a bunch but my ancient Vaio PC is kinda 🤪 rigna, 3 weeks till new arrival and i just want to have a good time with that old friend. Anyways thanks
                    no problem enjoy the new pc!
            I like the original look with boosted graphics through NVIDIA Control Panel, like forced antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering.
Exactly. The PC port which should be the best version out there has a lot of gfx glitches and optimization issues. Not to mention it's a 14 year old game and could definitely use a facelift on textures and overall game mechanics.
Yeah for me it drops to low 40’s even with my pc build that’s capable of 1440p gaming.. (RTX 2060 Super, Ryzen 3600, 16 GB RAM)
I'm pretty sure playing the 360 version on Series X would be the best way to play the game
It is terrible indeed. I am actually playing the game at 8k and in this resolution the jaggies are gone almost 100%. What I don't like is the texture flickering because of the bad LOD. This game deserves better but still at times it can look really pretty, like this screenshot
Install a couple of mods and it looks great
It deserves a remaster but, not made by Groove Street
GTA V is so weird, such a huge world but feels so empty. The story as well is just like… non existent. I was honestly super disappointed in the narrative aspect of the game after how incredible GTA IV and its DLCs were
    True true. 

LS is a dead, soulless city. 
The behaviour of the AI, and cops are the biggest disappointments.

Why are the AI so generic, why are the cops only present in chases or near the police stations, and only attack the player for doing fuck all, in IV, the cops would arrest pedestrians beating Nico. In IV, pedestrians would use umbrellas in rainy weather, for me, these small details are huge. 

Kinda reminds me of Ubisoft titles.
        100%. Just doing a playthrough of IV at the moment (started after realising what a shambles TDE is), and you've just reminded me why V is such a letdown and why I shouldn't bother after I've finished this.
        Damn, totally. V does feel like a Ubisoft title
        This is just brainless. The AI in V is far better in V, and the cops are definitely way more advanced. And it’s definitely not dead, compared to IV. Your reasons are really stretching it. Of course the actual reasons are so small that you can only name examples like cops arresting people who fight you, and people with umbrellas in the rain, lol. As if peds don’t have certain actions/way more than the ones in IV did, by far. You put  nothing but bias, and zero thought into any of that.
It's basically more shiny with some glitter on. Other than that it's kinda regressed in gameplay quality, IMO.
    Also lacking the "soul" the old games had. Vice city felt like you were actually in 80s Miami. San Andreas 90s LA. 4 Modern NYC. 5 was shiny and cool but completely lacked that feeling.
        Besides, there is no real attachment to the characters. In the previous games you have that connection or a thrill about the main characters of the game but in 5, you just don’t feel anything about anyone.
            For me Michael seemed like the most fleshed out character. I mean Trevor and Franklin are good too, but Michael just seemed more like the main character in my opinion. I mean he also has more missions if I'm not wrong
            I have lots of feelings for Trevor (and Lamar - but he didn’t get to become a main character.)
                Yes. Trevor did have his moments in the game (best of the 3) but yeah I personally didn’t get the main character vibe from him. Maybe it’s just me though.
                    I felt pretty contempt about the story mode but I think it’s because it’s vastly different in that there are multiple main characters compared to all earlier games where we only had a single main protagonist.

But I really think for GTA V the real main character is ourselves with our online character.
                        Story mode sure was an experience. I did have a good time playing it, but when it comes to comparing with the older games, I just prefer it less that’s all. 

I’m more of a story mode fanboi than an online player, so I haven’t really spent much time there in the online world tbh.
                            Yeah I agree that it was way less immersive and I’m a bit of both. I love story mode as much as online, same for most games for me.
            Well yeah, but imo, this point doesn't apply to Michael and Trevor, only Franklin.
            Ummm i disagree. I found all of gtav protagonists really likeable. I loved Trevor's loyalty, I found franklin the most relatable, and i felt bad for Michael, and i loved how his character exposes our own hypocrisy. Like calling trevor crazy but running down 30 pedestrian as Michael at the same time.
                They are likeable and forgettable at the same time for me.
                    And if trevor exposes Michaels hypocrisy, lamar exposes franklins hypocrisy. Franklin calls lamar's gang life crazy, telling him how he is going to die, etc. Yet if you look at story missions we do with him, there is no difference between the kife of lamar and the life of franklin.
        Yeah I think you’re just mistaking your opinion for fact here. GTA V captures and commentates on modern LA quite well.
            As you state your opinion as if it's fact. Lol
                You got me. But my opinion is a lot more reasonable than yours. Most people who plays GTA V would agree that it captures modern LA *very* well.

The way you put the previous games on a pedestal when GTA V is on the same level of quality in it’s world design makes me believe your opinion is based in bias towards the previous games.

I don’t know why there’s a hate train for  V on this sub, especially when you all love to applaud IV. 

When GTA IV came out, it arguably dropped the most from the GTA formula out of any game.
                    You thinking your opinion is more reasonable than mine is yet another opinion. You're making a whole lot of assumptions. I never said I didn't enjoy five. In fact I called it cool. Your posts are filled with logical fallacies. I'm referring to the ambiance and atmosphere of the environment. It's a pretty common opinion in the community if you don't live under a rock.

In fact. For those who do live under a rock such as yourself. You can simply reference to the remaining comment thread and all of the up voters here to see how community members agree. Its not that deep.
                        Yeah I don’t think most GTA fans would agree that V is less ambient than the previous games.

And also to have the balls to say GTA V has no soul, when most open world games can’t even come close to what Los Santos achieved in open world design.
        V feels like modern Southern California. That’s the soul. You don’t know what you’re talking about
        Hard disagree. I love the setting and environment in GTA 5 more than any other GTA game, personally. Los Santos is just so beautiful and the mountains and the Blaine County desert is amazing, too. I just love the vibe of present day California.
        But also 2010’s LA is also just uninteresting. Maybe now they could do something with TikTok culture and whatever, but GTA V seriously struggled to find its theme
    Agree.
The only major gameplay improvement I can think of between IV and V is the weapons wheel.
    Mission checkpoints too.
    Maybe we get that in the definitive edition of GTA 4 along with other gamebreaking shit.
GTA 5 was a downgrade when it came to gameplay. Everything is dumbed down in some way.

GTA 5s map is also pretty poor and I would go as far as to say it's possibly the worst map in the series. It's just one city with the rest of the map more or less going to waste with large empty spaces. There's just nothing to do outside of the city. You drive out, you drive back again. It needed at least another another city or island so that empty space could be used as a crossing. 

GTA IV's map might've been samey in terms of being a city but it felt alive and interesting. GTA V just feels hollow and generic for the most part.

Rockstar simply wasn't very ambitious when it came to GTA V really. It doesn't really do anything fresh besides the character switching. Even the story is pretty forgettable. This is big reason why it frustrates me to see them milking it so much. It's not the best GTA entry and yet it's still going nearly a decade later.
    Man... I see what you're saying, but calling V an unambitious game, and a downgrade in gameplay is just crazy to me. If anything GTA IV was a step back in gameplay from SA, because they got rid of planes, stats, car modifications, parachutes, properties, clothing, diving, the varied setting, and wayy more that I can't remember. GTA V brought that all back, on the same hardware as IV, and ran and looked much better. 

When people compare IV and V, they always mention the atmosphere, story, and physics. But does any of that actually make the gameplay better? Most missions in GTA IV were chase missions or cover-shoot missions, and only really 3 (bank, museum, and hotel) had interesting settings. If you don't like the story, there's very little for you to enjoy during these missions.

This is coming from a huge IV fanboy too. This game and COD4 were the games I played when I had the most free time in my life, in late middle/early high school. Got nothing but love for IV. But it's not better than SA and V, unless you *really* like its specific offerings.

Sorry about the whole rant but it's just weird seeing EVERYONE on the internet have this opinion that IV is significantly better than V, in every possible way. Idk when that started, but I remember so many people calling it a step back from SA back in the day, and now no one says that.
        I love IV, but you're making some really good points. There were lots of stuff I missed going from SA to IV, and I always felt a little claustrofobic with no countryside.
>I just don’t see an advancement.

I don't know what the hell you're talking about but I do see a lot of improvement. The vehicle handling felt better and there's a lot more improvement in the weapons and aiming system.

Not to mention, the graphics are a lot better, too.
    Graphics, weapon wheel, weapons and the character switch were the only things that I felt were new/better. It’s probably just what I feel. Still, no hate for the game.
        And vehicle handling, parachutes, planes, map variety, etc.
            The vehicle handling is pretty generic compared to IV, they should've toned down the slipperiness of the cars, but not completely get rid of the physics, and the damage physics in V is garbage, + the NPCs and cops are pretty soulless compared to IV's, they're just buncha angry mindless bots waiting to attack you. + parachutes were added in the dlc.
                I usually don't care much about vehicle damage physics unless it's too bad like in San Andreas where the vehicle's rear end somehow gets damaged when you hit the front end of the car lol.

GTA V's vehicle damage physics weren't noticeably bad so I didn't really care.

What I look for, personally, in the vehicles is the vehicular handling, and I like V's vehicular handling a LOT more than IV's.

Can you go into more detail about why you think NPCs and cops are "soulless" because I don't see what you mean by that. In fact, mind you, I've seen cops carry the bodies of their dead comrades in GTA V during shootouts, which is quite realistic behaviour.
                    Cuz as soon as you get close to them they start attacking, for no reason, and their behaviour makes you feel no sympathy for them at all.
In terms of atmosphere and authenticism, IV is in a league of its own.
Its an incredible game, on the note of traffic I downloaded a realistic traffic mod that changes how and when traffic spawns

Less cars on the road at night time in certain areas

And of course increased traffic during rush hour, they really captured NYC perfectly and its one of the best rockstar worlds to date
    I love this mod too. Only thing that bugs me is that my computer goes nuts when I play GTA IV with this mod sadly. So I have no choice but to play with the regular traffic, with the maximum setting.
I mean accent is not that bad
*GTA 4 has been removed from all stores *
    I would burn down their corporate HQ.
        Start with T2.
            I might go after them anyway if they disallow modding in Kerbal Space Program 2.
I don't really get why people act like that. It's not like you will never get to play the original gta 4 again if they release a definitive edition of it.
    lol is this a joke? They removed the originals when they released trilogy DE
        They didn't remove the originals completely. They just removed them from the store but if you already bought them and have them in your library you can play them without any issue.
            True true, good point
[*] Vladivostok FM
You can restore them.
    Yeah I had to do some digging on that. For a while, I only saw Steam guides that were broken but I eventually came across the DEP just a few moments ago. 

Thanks :)
What does that mean? I am out of the loop
    Rockstar updated the game, when the licenses for the music in the game ran out - they had to remove the music
        Record labels are the greediest fucks...
            You could also just add those songs back along with some of your personal faves with MP3’s on independence FM on pc, that’s always a lot of fun I find.
            Try video game publishers
                Do you know anything about the music industry? Game devs are charities compared to the amount of greed those fuckers have. The music industry sues grandmas for millions. They will stop at no end in their pursuit of money.
                    And they’ve been around for a lot longer than video game publishers, so they’ve had time to sharpen their greed
                    "Oh 1 millisecond of our music in your video? your video's now ours."
        Wait didn't they add them back in? I remember the shicky schiky schweine song from the very first mission was removed, but I thought it was put back in.
        Was this on console versions, too?
I would gladly help you with that, but sadly I’m on PC and the multiplayer aspect was completely removed from this version.
I also need them
    PM me your xbox live handle and let’s knock em out
Isn't that only for gta 5 online servers for the Xbox 360?
Worth the trouble, you can play at 4K 60fps with modern hardware and it's a blast
    [deleted]
        But Crysis on switch doesn’t look anything like the graphical masterpiece it is/was on PC lol. The switch also runs the Witcher 3, but it looks like blurry ass
    What patches fix performance?
        Cap the framerate at 59/60 and you shouldn't experience huge framedrops, also DXVK reduces stuttering by a lot. Again, this is on modern hardware, trying to play on low-end PCs is still pretty troublesome.

Edit: it's also important to keep the view/detail distance sliders below 50.

Honestly the original console versions are awful, slow, blurry and they barely run at 25 FPS. Definitely not the proper way to experience such a beautiful game.
Using dxvk is hell. Dragging and dropping two files is hell. Wow.
Use dxvk !
Is it confirmed they’re working on the IV remaster?!
    they have been sending random copyright takedowns related to IV, a save file among other things, the pattern fits an imminent shitshow.
Just play vanilla. Maybe add some reshade to enhance colors and AA. Use as well DSR and install the Definitive Edition patch, it will fix lots of problems with the port.
    I mean, there's some pretty high-quality texture packs for the environment, characters, and vehicles, that make the game look significantly better while staying true to the original art style. [Here's what my current modded setup for the game looks like.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51675918282_a096c4a6df_o.png)
        What mods do you have?
            [I explained it all here a little while ago](https://reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/qt5gb8/managed_to_get_gta_iv_looking_about_as_close_to/hkhqnta/)
        Amazing
Just tweak the game through NVIDIA Control Panel, or through an AMD equivalent, and force antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering, with these tweaks the game still looks very good.
PC would be best bc you can at least add a few mods. I think PS3 ran worse than the 360 version.
A 14 year old game with no improvements needed? Uhhhh, nah dawg. It could definitely use a (good) remaster.
    Have you actually played the game? It literally does not need a remaster. A graphical one, knowing rockstar, would require that the engine gets modified, ruining it.
        I've owned the original and subsequent PC release and just played it for several hours yesterday so yes.. I've 'played' the game. What a silly question.
        Just port everything over to the latest rage engine. Boom, actually good remaster accomplished
            The euphoria engine is the only thing that made gta 4 good. The rage engine is not as immersive. besides, you say that like porting stuff from one engine to the other is easy? Have you been living under a rock?
                I’d expect that porting an existing game to a slightly different internal game engine should be easy for a multi-billion dollar company, yes.
                Euphoria is not an engine the game runs on, it’s still RAGE, just using Euphoria physics.
                    Whoops i meant euphoria physics, thats my bad. Its still outrageous to say that simply porting a game to a newer iteration of an engine can represent absolutely no drawbacks at all, there's like evidence you know... But its only my opinion.
Still needs a port for ps4 and ps5
    That - yes. But I was referring to the idea of definitive edition like the bois from GSG did.
You can with steam launch option.
Just set the game resolution in the game, or edit the .ini file, or set the resolution through Steam like the other dude said.
    i didn't know that was an option. im gonna try it out thank you all
You can play the disc on series x
    But not PS5 :/
        Sadly no :(
Such a great song.
Yeah, the driving makes everything so much fun.
GTA4 Had this dark gritty feel with it's color palette and I absolutely loved it. I can't even describe it, but GTA5 seems way to vibrant and colorful in comparison, I've played both extensively and I can safely say I think GTA4 is the superior game in terms of story and authenticity. Maybe it might be my nostalgia goggles. But I doubt it lol
    It’s the tone. In 5 is pretty inconsistent, sometimes it tries to be serious and realistic, and then everything is ridiculous like a Saints Row game. It’s like they couldn’t decide which way to go and that hurted the story a lot.
you unlock the island eventually.
It needs a remaster, I just played it on my Xbox Series X. Still a solid game, but the faces look so scary & the controls need a tweak

You could fix that with a patch I suppose
    I’m on xbox one, would you recommend getting it? it’s been 10 years since I last played it
        GTA IV? It’s hella fun, I just replayed it

I loved it when it came out, it’s really fun now. The DLC is great too

I’d recommend playing it. It feels somewhere between GTA III & GTA V. The driving is the most realistic in the series
Played through the main game and Lost and the Damned again recently, I highly recommend it. GTA IV has to be one of the best single player experience I've ever had. I play though the main game and dlcs probably once every other year and I am never let down. I can't wait to finish this year's play through with The Ballad of Gay Tony. Yusuf Amir is by far my favorite side character and the fact that he's the guy who owns the construction site where the World Trade Center used to be is fucking hilarious.
    >Yusuf Amir is by far my favorite side character and the fact that he's the guy who owns the construction site where the World Trade Center used to be is fucking hilarious.

I never noticed that the construction site was where the twin towers used to be lmao that's pretty savage of them.

My internet is down for the past 2 days because of a storm and I'm dying to download it already...
I 99% agree with you, the missing 1% is that I disagree with you that Niko is the best protagonist ever created, for me it's Adam Jensen from Deus Ex.
    Well, I did say Niko was one of the best, rather than THE best. He’s joint first with a few others of my personal favourites
        Well, sorry for sharing my opinion then.

EDIT: did you really just downvote me? Lmao
            No, I didn’t downvote you
The driving in GTA4 is the best in the series.
    That is the most outrageous shit I have ever heard anybody say.
    I don't understand why people say that because the driving is way too cumbersome in IV. They improved it so much in V. If I wanted to play a driving simulator I'd pop in Forza or Gran Turismo. While driving is important in a city simulator it's not the primary focus.
        GTA V has literally the worst and most boring driving mechanics I have ever seen in any game, maybe, just maybe Watch Dogs is worse in this regard.
            I think it has the best driving mechanics of the series so far. It doesn't need to be hyper realistic but this game isn't a racing simulator. But it's ok I've seen this discussion before and people seem to be highly opinionated in favor or against both GTA IV and GTA V's driving mechanics.
                Every car in 5 has Stability Control that cuts power mid slide and stops on a dime.

Every car in 4 has shot shocks.

A little balance would be nice.
Graphics update, yes but leave mechanics alone reeeeeee
Its hard to get used to definitely, but atleast big cumbersome vehicles felt like they were supposed to

In GTA V it felt like everything was exactly the same
So put in a different handling.dat file.
https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=5529
In 5, every car comes with sport suspension.
There is a specific sub for posts about GTA Online, for Fortnite there is a specific sub as well, there are literally subs for all the shitty live service games you enjoy, so what's your problem?
    And there’s also a sub for gta 4, your point is?
        My point is that I don't comment on every GTA V post just to say that it's just another circle jerk.
tbogt is amazing
It’s backwards compatible on xsx I’m playing it right now
In Canada and North Eastern states we keep our trunk full of sand, so the handling is extremely realistic.

Makes for great long drifts. I only wish there was fresh snow on the ground.
It does need a 4K patch on console tho.
I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

The trio of Niko,Johnny and Luis is countless hours of content.
    If the leaks are anywhere near true, they’ll all be remastered with the RAGE engines of RDR2/GTAV. 
Which wouldn’t be as bad, although the Euphoria engine was pretty fun.
        that doesn't make any sense - they didn't even make a mobile port of GTA4, so, what the fuck are they going to base a whole remaster off of?
            Lmao
            I would love to see a phone run the physics engine of gta 4... i think it will fry the entire phone right when you launch it.
                that's the biggest reason why gta 4 runs like shit on a stick
            Wat
                oh, you haven't heard about the Definitive GTA Trilogy that just came out? you should look into that.
        I'll temper my expectations after the DE: Trilogy but I really hope they retain the ragdoll physics and car characteristics from GTA: IV.

I love how it feels so different from any other GTA.
            Exactly! The driving and physics were so fun. If they change that, they’re taking away a huge part of what makes that game great
                Personally, I liked how realistic it felt, but I remember people hating the driving back then. Motorcycles were practically useless until the Lost and Damned.
                    I hated every motorcycle chase in IV.
        The physics in 4 still amaze me. It's one aspect that's seriously lacking in the newer games imo
        Euphoria Physics is built in part of the RAGE engine. The remaster should have it, even if it will be toned down like in V and RDR2. Speaking of the remaster, I think the leaks are true, because it's from the same sources and it'd make sense, plus they already started taking down GTA IV mods lol. I just hope they won't screw my favorite GTA up so much like they did with the Trilogy.
        Euphoria is baked into the rage engine by default. They just toned down the physics a lot for GTA 5 but in RDR2 they're turned back up a bit just not quite as crazy as GTA 4. Gta doesn't run off of euphoria it runs off of RAGE as well which like I said has euphoria baked into it. You couldn't run a game using euphoria because it's not not engine.
    What's LCS got anything to do with them three?
        He most probably means EFLC.
        I meant the DLC for GTA:IV, Episode's of Liberty City.

My fault, my comment above can be confusing without the specification.
    You mean Episodes of Liberty City? Liberty City Stories is about Tony Cipriani from III.
    On the Apple store Chinatown Wars and Liberty City Stories are available but not GTA IV.. WTH?
    You can still buy the dlc just not as liberty city stories. I just bought them recently. You load BOGT and TLAD from the pause menu by going to load game or something.
    U mean episodes from liberty city lcs is the gta 3 prequel game that’s better than gta 3
    > I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

It is though?
    Johnny died bro
Why would they remove the physics engine? That would take more effort than its worth. They didn’t remove anything from the trilogy remasters except the same music that’s been removed on every version except the PS2 original copies.
    It wasn’t the RAGE engine they more prominently use now, it’s supposedly why it’s a mess on the PlayStation. Something about the ps not being able to handle the GPU, Idk.

Although I can’t say from experience, as I had a 360 back in those days (rip). But that’s just from what I’ve read.
        If they remade the game they’d get rid of it. But I really don’t see them doing that. If they remastered it (like the trilogy) they wouldn’t be able to remove the engine cause then it would be a full on remake and that would take a LOT more effort and resources and time

Also don’t understand the fuss about it supposedly not working on PlayStation. I played it on PS3 originally and it was my most played game, I finished it over and over again. Didn’t have any problems with it
Honestly at this point I’m thinking of just buying a cheap Xbox 360 so I can play it again
    If you do, Get the og Xbox. That’s the one you want. You can also make ur own radio station.
Took me way too long to understand what “pee snow” was hahaha
I think PS now is still a garbage service. It’s not worth the price that they pay for what you get. I’d rather just turn my PS3 on and off the disks in
The physics could actually get a little annoying sometimes, honestly, but even so I preferred 4 over 5 drastically. It was just completely unique to the series.

Plus nothing beats doing that heavy 180 turn backwards with your car.
    I loved doing that
        It's my main source of dopamine when playing the game.
    Especially while shooting at someone, capping them, and then whipping your car back around to speed away
Damn straight
> the most realistic ragdoll physics of any game ever

That’s a complete lie. Max Payne 3, Red 1 and 2 all have way more realistic ragdoll physics than IV does. And in some ways, V improves upon it, and makes it less exaggerated. IV’s still isn’t the most realistic, though.
Chicago in WD 1
In AC, it's Egypt and Venice for me.
    Egypt is just perfect, definitely one of the greatest settings in any videogame ever.

I adore that game and it's beauty
Syndicate has twice as many crowd animations and atmospheric details, if you liked Unity your mind will be blown.
    I've played both. Paris hits different imo due to the goings on and the setting in general.
...is shit and has nothing to do with GTA
I'll agree that's a badass environment I'm personally just more intrigued with a more modern setting and city that's just my opinion I love Red Dead though
I would probably say just the time period it takes place in really set the tone for the environment in GTA IV.
    I felt like they really nailed it.
        Yeah, it's that really cool sliver of time back in the mid 2000s that had one foot in the 20th century and another in the 21st. It's funny listening to the radio ads and talk shows and seeing how much about the future the got right and conversely how much they got wrong.
            Lazlow's rants about radio, the internet and other stuff like that is especially funny with a modern ear.
The dirty, grimey environment of Liberty City in IV provides a perfect backdrop to tell the story of a lonely, poor Middle-Eastern immigrant and war veteran who's trying to escape a shadowy past, but is destined to be thrown into dilemma after shitty dilemma trying to atone for his wicked behaviour by exacting revenge on a slave smuggling kingpin he chose to work for but who ended up betraying him and his family.

Or, you could just play V instead, where the story begins with two Americans and one Canadian who are in a sun-soaked modern paradise struggling to, get rich.
    Someone give this man a medal
    What a silly way to simplify a game about 3 characters with 3 different backgrounds compared to a game with just one, just for the sake of having a completely biased comparison for no reason.
It’s New York vs Los Angeles. On foot, walking from block to block, Liberty City wins. But in a car, I give the advantage to Los Santos.
From the setting the dark atmosphere the crimes to the protagonists who come from varied backgrounds and really give you that melting pot feeling. And the emotions the characters have to the many choices you have that actually have different outcomes no matter how small. It's a masterpiece. Even the voicework throughout is amazing
    Hm, I don't quite remember the game the same way. Maybe I should play it again some time, but I've only got the original PS3 version with the crappy resolution, blurry visuals and frame rate issues (with slight weird bouncy/elastic driving controls compared to GTA V). I have to imagine that the experience might be much better on PC with mods and customizations + better hardware.

What I do remember about the story was a lot of that eastern European cynicism and depressive thinking. :-p (which I think might be partly why the game tends to feel like the black sheep of the 3D GTA series that often gets forgotten or not mentioned so much. a shame though, despite the technical issues i mentioned, it was a really good game for the time)

Oh, and then Red Dead Redemption came out, which was just such an amazing game in comparison. That's probably the other reason GTA 4 kinda gets forgotten. Perhaps...
Same, I prefer GTA V's environment like about 10 times more.
    It was a question.
same here, i downloaded one that kept the same atmosphere/vibe but made it look better. i dont like the ones that change the sky or make the colors too bright, shit hurts my eyes tbh. i’ll link the mod if i can find the one i’m talking about it’s been a bit
    Dm me the link or name of the mod if you find it
        got you
            Post the name, if you will
                They're usually named something like 'Natural and Realistic ENB/lighting"
                    yeah something like. it’s simple and keeps the vibe but still has some good changes
            I’m confused, why PM .. just post it as a comment and let others know lol
                https://youtu.be/1o-ojTM6tCE link in the description
            me too please!
The neat thing with mods is that you can find what you want if you are will to look for it. 

I found iCEnhancer 3.0 Natural to be what I was looking for in keeping the tone of the city still gritty.  The only issue with it is that the game looks a bit too clean on 1.0.7.0 because fog/haze doesn't load properly compared to 1.0.4.0.   

This is noted problem with in the modders patch notes.
The only graphics mod I really recommend is CleanIV, basically its just the vanilla graphics with the color filter removed: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24247
    Ye I like the color filter tho
        Honestly so do I lol, but I understand if someone doesnt want their game to look like a noire film when its cloudy
            Yea it was a bit weird how it the entire game like turns into greyscale any time it rains
the mod worked with all the dlc too, it was just a diff experience other then playing it normal again
    oh wow, thats new. havent had too much luck with mods tho, many looked nauseating, discount gtaV i mean. Hope i can find one good mod soon.
        i’ve never modded gta 5 so idk much about that, but i have used some graphics mods for gta 4, i like the ones that keep the vibe of the game but just changes it up a bit, there some shit ones that make the game look too bright and it ruins the feel, but you can you find some good ones on youtube
            yep, YT helped a bunch but my ancient Vaio PC is kinda 🤪 rigna, 3 weeks till new arrival and i just want to have a good time with that old friend. Anyways thanks
                no problem enjoy the new pc!
        I like the original look with boosted graphics through NVIDIA Control Panel, like forced antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering.
True true. 

LS is a dead, soulless city. 
The behaviour of the AI, and cops are the biggest disappointments.

Why are the AI so generic, why are the cops only present in chases or near the police stations, and only attack the player for doing fuck all, in IV, the cops would arrest pedestrians beating Nico. In IV, pedestrians would use umbrellas in rainy weather, for me, these small details are huge. 

Kinda reminds me of Ubisoft titles.
    100%. Just doing a playthrough of IV at the moment (started after realising what a shambles TDE is), and you've just reminded me why V is such a letdown and why I shouldn't bother after I've finished this.
    Damn, totally. V does feel like a Ubisoft title
    This is just brainless. The AI in V is far better in V, and the cops are definitely way more advanced. And it’s definitely not dead, compared to IV. Your reasons are really stretching it. Of course the actual reasons are so small that you can only name examples like cops arresting people who fight you, and people with umbrellas in the rain, lol. As if peds don’t have certain actions/way more than the ones in IV did, by far. You put  nothing but bias, and zero thought into any of that.
Also lacking the "soul" the old games had. Vice city felt like you were actually in 80s Miami. San Andreas 90s LA. 4 Modern NYC. 5 was shiny and cool but completely lacked that feeling.
    Besides, there is no real attachment to the characters. In the previous games you have that connection or a thrill about the main characters of the game but in 5, you just don’t feel anything about anyone.
        For me Michael seemed like the most fleshed out character. I mean Trevor and Franklin are good too, but Michael just seemed more like the main character in my opinion. I mean he also has more missions if I'm not wrong
        I have lots of feelings for Trevor (and Lamar - but he didn’t get to become a main character.)
            Yes. Trevor did have his moments in the game (best of the 3) but yeah I personally didn’t get the main character vibe from him. Maybe it’s just me though.
                I felt pretty contempt about the story mode but I think it’s because it’s vastly different in that there are multiple main characters compared to all earlier games where we only had a single main protagonist.

But I really think for GTA V the real main character is ourselves with our online character.
                    Story mode sure was an experience. I did have a good time playing it, but when it comes to comparing with the older games, I just prefer it less that’s all. 

I’m more of a story mode fanboi than an online player, so I haven’t really spent much time there in the online world tbh.
                        Yeah I agree that it was way less immersive and I’m a bit of both. I love story mode as much as online, same for most games for me.
        Well yeah, but imo, this point doesn't apply to Michael and Trevor, only Franklin.
        Ummm i disagree. I found all of gtav protagonists really likeable. I loved Trevor's loyalty, I found franklin the most relatable, and i felt bad for Michael, and i loved how his character exposes our own hypocrisy. Like calling trevor crazy but running down 30 pedestrian as Michael at the same time.
            They are likeable and forgettable at the same time for me.
                And if trevor exposes Michaels hypocrisy, lamar exposes franklins hypocrisy. Franklin calls lamar's gang life crazy, telling him how he is going to die, etc. Yet if you look at story missions we do with him, there is no difference between the kife of lamar and the life of franklin.
    Yeah I think you’re just mistaking your opinion for fact here. GTA V captures and commentates on modern LA quite well.
        As you state your opinion as if it's fact. Lol
            You got me. But my opinion is a lot more reasonable than yours. Most people who plays GTA V would agree that it captures modern LA *very* well.

The way you put the previous games on a pedestal when GTA V is on the same level of quality in it’s world design makes me believe your opinion is based in bias towards the previous games.

I don’t know why there’s a hate train for  V on this sub, especially when you all love to applaud IV. 

When GTA IV came out, it arguably dropped the most from the GTA formula out of any game.
                You thinking your opinion is more reasonable than mine is yet another opinion. You're making a whole lot of assumptions. I never said I didn't enjoy five. In fact I called it cool. Your posts are filled with logical fallacies. I'm referring to the ambiance and atmosphere of the environment. It's a pretty common opinion in the community if you don't live under a rock.

In fact. For those who do live under a rock such as yourself. You can simply reference to the remaining comment thread and all of the up voters here to see how community members agree. Its not that deep.
                    Yeah I don’t think most GTA fans would agree that V is less ambient than the previous games.

And also to have the balls to say GTA V has no soul, when most open world games can’t even come close to what Los Santos achieved in open world design.
    V feels like modern Southern California. That’s the soul. You don’t know what you’re talking about
    Hard disagree. I love the setting and environment in GTA 5 more than any other GTA game, personally. Los Santos is just so beautiful and the mountains and the Blaine County desert is amazing, too. I just love the vibe of present day California.
    But also 2010’s LA is also just uninteresting. Maybe now they could do something with TikTok culture and whatever, but GTA V seriously struggled to find its theme
Agree.
Mission checkpoints too.
Maybe we get that in the definitive edition of GTA 4 along with other gamebreaking shit.
Man... I see what you're saying, but calling V an unambitious game, and a downgrade in gameplay is just crazy to me. If anything GTA IV was a step back in gameplay from SA, because they got rid of planes, stats, car modifications, parachutes, properties, clothing, diving, the varied setting, and wayy more that I can't remember. GTA V brought that all back, on the same hardware as IV, and ran and looked much better. 

When people compare IV and V, they always mention the atmosphere, story, and physics. But does any of that actually make the gameplay better? Most missions in GTA IV were chase missions or cover-shoot missions, and only really 3 (bank, museum, and hotel) had interesting settings. If you don't like the story, there's very little for you to enjoy during these missions.

This is coming from a huge IV fanboy too. This game and COD4 were the games I played when I had the most free time in my life, in late middle/early high school. Got nothing but love for IV. But it's not better than SA and V, unless you *really* like its specific offerings.

Sorry about the whole rant but it's just weird seeing EVERYONE on the internet have this opinion that IV is significantly better than V, in every possible way. Idk when that started, but I remember so many people calling it a step back from SA back in the day, and now no one says that.
    I love IV, but you're making some really good points. There were lots of stuff I missed going from SA to IV, and I always felt a little claustrofobic with no countryside.
Graphics, weapon wheel, weapons and the character switch were the only things that I felt were new/better. It’s probably just what I feel. Still, no hate for the game.
    And vehicle handling, parachutes, planes, map variety, etc.
        The vehicle handling is pretty generic compared to IV, they should've toned down the slipperiness of the cars, but not completely get rid of the physics, and the damage physics in V is garbage, + the NPCs and cops are pretty soulless compared to IV's, they're just buncha angry mindless bots waiting to attack you. + parachutes were added in the dlc.
            I usually don't care much about vehicle damage physics unless it's too bad like in San Andreas where the vehicle's rear end somehow gets damaged when you hit the front end of the car lol.

GTA V's vehicle damage physics weren't noticeably bad so I didn't really care.

What I look for, personally, in the vehicles is the vehicular handling, and I like V's vehicular handling a LOT more than IV's.

Can you go into more detail about why you think NPCs and cops are "soulless" because I don't see what you mean by that. In fact, mind you, I've seen cops carry the bodies of their dead comrades in GTA V during shootouts, which is quite realistic behaviour.
                Cuz as soon as you get close to them they start attacking, for no reason, and their behaviour makes you feel no sympathy for them at all.
I love this mod too. Only thing that bugs me is that my computer goes nuts when I play GTA IV with this mod sadly. So I have no choice but to play with the regular traffic, with the maximum setting.
I would burn down their corporate HQ.
    Start with T2.
        I might go after them anyway if they disallow modding in Kerbal Space Program 2.
lol is this a joke? They removed the originals when they released trilogy DE
    They didn't remove the originals completely. They just removed them from the store but if you already bought them and have them in your library you can play them without any issue.
        True true, good point
Yeah I had to do some digging on that. For a while, I only saw Steam guides that were broken but I eventually came across the DEP just a few moments ago. 

Thanks :)
Rockstar updated the game, when the licenses for the music in the game ran out - they had to remove the music
    Record labels are the greediest fucks...
        You could also just add those songs back along with some of your personal faves with MP3’s on independence FM on pc, that’s always a lot of fun I find.
        Try video game publishers
            Do you know anything about the music industry? Game devs are charities compared to the amount of greed those fuckers have. The music industry sues grandmas for millions. They will stop at no end in their pursuit of money.
                And they’ve been around for a lot longer than video game publishers, so they’ve had time to sharpen their greed
                "Oh 1 millisecond of our music in your video? your video's now ours."
    Wait didn't they add them back in? I remember the shicky schiky schweine song from the very first mission was removed, but I thought it was put back in.
    Was this on console versions, too?
PM me your xbox live handle and let’s knock em out
[deleted]
    But Crysis on switch doesn’t look anything like the graphical masterpiece it is/was on PC lol. The switch also runs the Witcher 3, but it looks like blurry ass
What patches fix performance?
    Cap the framerate at 59/60 and you shouldn't experience huge framedrops, also DXVK reduces stuttering by a lot. Again, this is on modern hardware, trying to play on low-end PCs is still pretty troublesome.

Edit: it's also important to keep the view/detail distance sliders below 50.

Honestly the original console versions are awful, slow, blurry and they barely run at 25 FPS. Definitely not the proper way to experience such a beautiful game.
they have been sending random copyright takedowns related to IV, a save file among other things, the pattern fits an imminent shitshow.
I mean, there's some pretty high-quality texture packs for the environment, characters, and vehicles, that make the game look significantly better while staying true to the original art style. [Here's what my current modded setup for the game looks like.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51675918282_a096c4a6df_o.png)
    What mods do you have?
        [I explained it all here a little while ago](https://reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/qt5gb8/managed_to_get_gta_iv_looking_about_as_close_to/hkhqnta/)
    Amazing
Have you actually played the game? It literally does not need a remaster. A graphical one, knowing rockstar, would require that the engine gets modified, ruining it.
    I've owned the original and subsequent PC release and just played it for several hours yesterday so yes.. I've 'played' the game. What a silly question.
    Just port everything over to the latest rage engine. Boom, actually good remaster accomplished
        The euphoria engine is the only thing that made gta 4 good. The rage engine is not as immersive. besides, you say that like porting stuff from one engine to the other is easy? Have you been living under a rock?
            I’d expect that porting an existing game to a slightly different internal game engine should be easy for a multi-billion dollar company, yes.
            Euphoria is not an engine the game runs on, it’s still RAGE, just using Euphoria physics.
                Whoops i meant euphoria physics, thats my bad. Its still outrageous to say that simply porting a game to a newer iteration of an engine can represent absolutely no drawbacks at all, there's like evidence you know... But its only my opinion.
That - yes. But I was referring to the idea of definitive edition like the bois from GSG did.
i didn't know that was an option. im gonna try it out thank you all
But not PS5 :/
    Sadly no :(
It’s the tone. In 5 is pretty inconsistent, sometimes it tries to be serious and realistic, and then everything is ridiculous like a Saints Row game. It’s like they couldn’t decide which way to go and that hurted the story a lot.
I’m on xbox one, would you recommend getting it? it’s been 10 years since I last played it
    GTA IV? It’s hella fun, I just replayed it

I loved it when it came out, it’s really fun now. The DLC is great too

I’d recommend playing it. It feels somewhere between GTA III & GTA V. The driving is the most realistic in the series
>Yusuf Amir is by far my favorite side character and the fact that he's the guy who owns the construction site where the World Trade Center used to be is fucking hilarious.

I never noticed that the construction site was where the twin towers used to be lmao that's pretty savage of them.

My internet is down for the past 2 days because of a storm and I'm dying to download it already...
Well, I did say Niko was one of the best, rather than THE best. He’s joint first with a few others of my personal favourites
    Well, sorry for sharing my opinion then.

EDIT: did you really just downvote me? Lmao
        No, I didn’t downvote you
That is the most outrageous shit I have ever heard anybody say.
I don't understand why people say that because the driving is way too cumbersome in IV. They improved it so much in V. If I wanted to play a driving simulator I'd pop in Forza or Gran Turismo. While driving is important in a city simulator it's not the primary focus.
    GTA V has literally the worst and most boring driving mechanics I have ever seen in any game, maybe, just maybe Watch Dogs is worse in this regard.
        I think it has the best driving mechanics of the series so far. It doesn't need to be hyper realistic but this game isn't a racing simulator. But it's ok I've seen this discussion before and people seem to be highly opinionated in favor or against both GTA IV and GTA V's driving mechanics.
            Every car in 5 has Stability Control that cuts power mid slide and stops on a dime.

Every car in 4 has shot shocks.

A little balance would be nice.
And there’s also a sub for gta 4, your point is?
    My point is that I don't comment on every GTA V post just to say that it's just another circle jerk.
If the leaks are anywhere near true, they’ll all be remastered with the RAGE engines of RDR2/GTAV. 
Which wouldn’t be as bad, although the Euphoria engine was pretty fun.
    that doesn't make any sense - they didn't even make a mobile port of GTA4, so, what the fuck are they going to base a whole remaster off of?
        Lmao
        I would love to see a phone run the physics engine of gta 4... i think it will fry the entire phone right when you launch it.
            that's the biggest reason why gta 4 runs like shit on a stick
        Wat
            oh, you haven't heard about the Definitive GTA Trilogy that just came out? you should look into that.
    I'll temper my expectations after the DE: Trilogy but I really hope they retain the ragdoll physics and car characteristics from GTA: IV.

I love how it feels so different from any other GTA.
        Exactly! The driving and physics were so fun. If they change that, they’re taking away a huge part of what makes that game great
            Personally, I liked how realistic it felt, but I remember people hating the driving back then. Motorcycles were practically useless until the Lost and Damned.
                I hated every motorcycle chase in IV.
    The physics in 4 still amaze me. It's one aspect that's seriously lacking in the newer games imo
    Euphoria Physics is built in part of the RAGE engine. The remaster should have it, even if it will be toned down like in V and RDR2. Speaking of the remaster, I think the leaks are true, because it's from the same sources and it'd make sense, plus they already started taking down GTA IV mods lol. I just hope they won't screw my favorite GTA up so much like they did with the Trilogy.
    Euphoria is baked into the rage engine by default. They just toned down the physics a lot for GTA 5 but in RDR2 they're turned back up a bit just not quite as crazy as GTA 4. Gta doesn't run off of euphoria it runs off of RAGE as well which like I said has euphoria baked into it. You couldn't run a game using euphoria because it's not not engine.
What's LCS got anything to do with them three?
    He most probably means EFLC.
    I meant the DLC for GTA:IV, Episode's of Liberty City.

My fault, my comment above can be confusing without the specification.
You mean Episodes of Liberty City? Liberty City Stories is about Tony Cipriani from III.
On the Apple store Chinatown Wars and Liberty City Stories are available but not GTA IV.. WTH?
You can still buy the dlc just not as liberty city stories. I just bought them recently. You load BOGT and TLAD from the pause menu by going to load game or something.
U mean episodes from liberty city lcs is the gta 3 prequel game that’s better than gta 3
> I'm pissed that Liberty City Stories isn't available with GTA IV on the marketplace right now.

It is though?
Johnny died bro
It wasn’t the RAGE engine they more prominently use now, it’s supposedly why it’s a mess on the PlayStation. Something about the ps not being able to handle the GPU, Idk.

Although I can’t say from experience, as I had a 360 back in those days (rip). But that’s just from what I’ve read.
    If they remade the game they’d get rid of it. But I really don’t see them doing that. If they remastered it (like the trilogy) they wouldn’t be able to remove the engine cause then it would be a full on remake and that would take a LOT more effort and resources and time

Also don’t understand the fuss about it supposedly not working on PlayStation. I played it on PS3 originally and it was my most played game, I finished it over and over again. Didn’t have any problems with it
If you do, Get the og Xbox. That’s the one you want. You can also make ur own radio station.
I loved doing that
    It's my main source of dopamine when playing the game.
Especially while shooting at someone, capping them, and then whipping your car back around to speed away
Egypt is just perfect, definitely one of the greatest settings in any videogame ever.

I adore that game and it's beauty
I've played both. Paris hits different imo due to the goings on and the setting in general.
I felt like they really nailed it.
    Yeah, it's that really cool sliver of time back in the mid 2000s that had one foot in the 20th century and another in the 21st. It's funny listening to the radio ads and talk shows and seeing how much about the future the got right and conversely how much they got wrong.
        Lazlow's rants about radio, the internet and other stuff like that is especially funny with a modern ear.
Someone give this man a medal
What a silly way to simplify a game about 3 characters with 3 different backgrounds compared to a game with just one, just for the sake of having a completely biased comparison for no reason.
Hm, I don't quite remember the game the same way. Maybe I should play it again some time, but I've only got the original PS3 version with the crappy resolution, blurry visuals and frame rate issues (with slight weird bouncy/elastic driving controls compared to GTA V). I have to imagine that the experience might be much better on PC with mods and customizations + better hardware.

What I do remember about the story was a lot of that eastern European cynicism and depressive thinking. :-p (which I think might be partly why the game tends to feel like the black sheep of the 3D GTA series that often gets forgotten or not mentioned so much. a shame though, despite the technical issues i mentioned, it was a really good game for the time)

Oh, and then Red Dead Redemption came out, which was just such an amazing game in comparison. That's probably the other reason GTA 4 kinda gets forgotten. Perhaps...
It was a question.
Dm me the link or name of the mod if you find it
    got you
        Post the name, if you will
            They're usually named something like 'Natural and Realistic ENB/lighting"
                yeah something like. it’s simple and keeps the vibe but still has some good changes
        I’m confused, why PM .. just post it as a comment and let others know lol
            https://youtu.be/1o-ojTM6tCE link in the description
        me too please!
Ye I like the color filter tho
    Honestly so do I lol, but I understand if someone doesnt want their game to look like a noire film when its cloudy
        Yea it was a bit weird how it the entire game like turns into greyscale any time it rains
oh wow, thats new. havent had too much luck with mods tho, many looked nauseating, discount gtaV i mean. Hope i can find one good mod soon.
    i’ve never modded gta 5 so idk much about that, but i have used some graphics mods for gta 4, i like the ones that keep the vibe of the game but just changes it up a bit, there some shit ones that make the game look too bright and it ruins the feel, but you can you find some good ones on youtube
        yep, YT helped a bunch but my ancient Vaio PC is kinda 🤪 rigna, 3 weeks till new arrival and i just want to have a good time with that old friend. Anyways thanks
            no problem enjoy the new pc!
    I like the original look with boosted graphics through NVIDIA Control Panel, like forced antialiasing, ambient occlusion, and texture filtering.
100%. Just doing a playthrough of IV at the moment (started after realising what a shambles TDE is), and you've just reminded me why V is such a letdown and why I shouldn't bother after I've finished this.
Damn, totally. V does feel like a Ubisoft title
This is just brainless. The AI in V is far better in V, and the cops are definitely way more advanced. And it’s definitely not dead, compared to IV. Your reasons are really stretching it. Of course the actual reasons are so small that you can only name examples like cops arresting people who fight you, and people with umbrellas in the rain, lol. As if peds don’t have certain actions/way more than the ones in IV did, by far. You put  nothing but bias, and zero thought into any of that.
Besides, there is no real attachment to the characters. In the previous games you have that connection or a thrill about the main characters of the game but in 5, you just don’t feel anything about anyone.
    For me Michael seemed like the most fleshed out character. I mean Trevor and Franklin are good too, but Michael just seemed more like the main character in my opinion. I mean he also has more missions if I'm not wrong
    I have lots of feelings for Trevor (and Lamar - but he didn’t get to become a main character.)
        Yes. Trevor did have his moments in the game (best of the 3) but yeah I personally didn’t get the main character vibe from him. Maybe it’s just me though.
            I felt pretty contempt about the story mode but I think it’s because it’s vastly different in that there are multiple main characters compared to all earlier games where we only had a single main protagonist.

But I really think for GTA V the real main character is ourselves with our online character.
                Story mode sure was an experience. I did have a good time playing it, but when it comes to comparing with the older games, I just prefer it less that’s all. 

I’m more of a story mode fanboi than an online player, so I haven’t really spent much time there in the online world tbh.
                    Yeah I agree that it was way less immersive and I’m a bit of both. I love story mode as much as online, same for most games for me.
    Well yeah, but imo, this point doesn't apply to Michael and Trevor, only Franklin.
    Ummm i disagree. I found all of gtav protagonists really likeable. I loved Trevor's loyalty, I found franklin the most relatable, and i felt bad for Michael, and i loved how his character exposes our own hypocrisy. Like calling trevor crazy but running down 30 pedestrian as Michael at the same time.
        They are likeable and forgettable at the same time for me.
            And if trevor exposes Michaels hypocrisy, lamar exposes franklins hypocrisy. Franklin calls lamar's gang life crazy, telling him how he is going to die, etc. Yet if you look at story missions we do with him, there is no difference between the kife of lamar and the life of franklin.
Yeah I think you’re just mistaking your opinion for fact here. GTA V captures and commentates on modern LA quite well.
    As you state your opinion as if it's fact. Lol
        You got me. But my opinion is a lot more reasonable than yours. Most people who plays GTA V would agree that it captures modern LA *very* well.

The way you put the previous games on a pedestal when GTA V is on the same level of quality in it’s world design makes me believe your opinion is based in bias towards the previous games.

I don’t know why there’s a hate train for  V on this sub, especially when you all love to applaud IV. 

When GTA IV came out, it arguably dropped the most from the GTA formula out of any game.
            You thinking your opinion is more reasonable than mine is yet another opinion. You're making a whole lot of assumptions. I never said I didn't enjoy five. In fact I called it cool. Your posts are filled with logical fallacies. I'm referring to the ambiance and atmosphere of the environment. It's a pretty common opinion in the community if you don't live under a rock.

In fact. For those who do live under a rock such as yourself. You can simply reference to the remaining comment thread and all of the up voters here to see how community members agree. Its not that deep.
                Yeah I don’t think most GTA fans would agree that V is less ambient than the previous games.

And also to have the balls to say GTA V has no soul, when most open world games can’t even come close to what Los Santos achieved in open world design.
V feels like modern Southern California. That’s the soul. You don’t know what you’re talking about
Hard disagree. I love the setting and environment in GTA 5 more than any other GTA game, personally. Los Santos is just so beautiful and the mountains and the Blaine County desert is amazing, too. I just love the vibe of present day California.
But also 2010’s LA is also just uninteresting. Maybe now they could do something with TikTok culture and whatever, but GTA V seriously struggled to find its theme
I love IV, but you're making some really good points. There were lots of stuff I missed going from SA to IV, and I always felt a little claustrofobic with no countryside.
And vehicle handling, parachutes, planes, map variety, etc.
    The vehicle handling is pretty generic compared to IV, they should've toned down the slipperiness of the cars, but not completely get rid of the physics, and the damage physics in V is garbage, + the NPCs and cops are pretty soulless compared to IV's, they're just buncha angry mindless bots waiting to attack you. + parachutes were added in the dlc.
        I usually don't care much about vehicle damage physics unless it's too bad like in San Andreas where the vehicle's rear end somehow gets damaged when you hit the front end of the car lol.

GTA V's vehicle damage physics weren't noticeably bad so I didn't really care.

What I look for, personally, in the vehicles is the vehicular handling, and I like V's vehicular handling a LOT more than IV's.

Can you go into more detail about why you think NPCs and cops are "soulless" because I don't see what you mean by that. In fact, mind you, I've seen cops carry the bodies of their dead comrades in GTA V during shootouts, which is quite realistic behaviour.
            Cuz as soon as you get close to them they start attacking, for no reason, and their behaviour makes you feel no sympathy for them at all.
Start with T2.
    I might go after them anyway if they disallow modding in Kerbal Space Program 2.
They didn't remove the originals completely. They just removed them from the store but if you already bought them and have them in your library you can play them without any issue.
    True true, good point
Record labels are the greediest fucks...
    You could also just add those songs back along with some of your personal faves with MP3’s on independence FM on pc, that’s always a lot of fun I find.
    Try video game publishers
        Do you know anything about the music industry? Game devs are charities compared to the amount of greed those fuckers have. The music industry sues grandmas for millions. They will stop at no end in their pursuit of money.
            And they’ve been around for a lot longer than video game publishers, so they’ve had time to sharpen their greed
            "Oh 1 millisecond of our music in your video? your video's now ours."
Wait didn't they add them back in? I remember the shicky schiky schweine song from the very first mission was removed, but I thought it was put back in.
Was this on console versions, too?
But Crysis on switch doesn’t look anything like the graphical masterpiece it is/was on PC lol. The switch also runs the Witcher 3, but it looks like blurry ass
Cap the framerate at 59/60 and you shouldn't experience huge framedrops, also DXVK reduces stuttering by a lot. Again, this is on modern hardware, trying to play on low-end PCs is still pretty troublesome.

Edit: it's also important to keep the view/detail distance sliders below 50.

Honestly the original console versions are awful, slow, blurry and they barely run at 25 FPS. Definitely not the proper way to experience such a beautiful game.
What mods do you have?
    [I explained it all here a little while ago](https://reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/qt5gb8/managed_to_get_gta_iv_looking_about_as_close_to/hkhqnta/)
Amazing
I've owned the original and subsequent PC release and just played it for several hours yesterday so yes.. I've 'played' the game. What a silly question.
Just port everything over to the latest rage engine. Boom, actually good remaster accomplished
    The euphoria engine is the only thing that made gta 4 good. The rage engine is not as immersive. besides, you say that like porting stuff from one engine to the other is easy? Have you been living under a rock?
        I’d expect that porting an existing game to a slightly different internal game engine should be easy for a multi-billion dollar company, yes.
        Euphoria is not an engine the game runs on, it’s still RAGE, just using Euphoria physics.
            Whoops i meant euphoria physics, thats my bad. Its still outrageous to say that simply porting a game to a newer iteration of an engine can represent absolutely no drawbacks at all, there's like evidence you know... But its only my opinion.
Sadly no :(
GTA IV? It’s hella fun, I just replayed it

I loved it when it came out, it’s really fun now. The DLC is great too

I’d recommend playing it. It feels somewhere between GTA III & GTA V. The driving is the most realistic in the series
Well, sorry for sharing my opinion then.

EDIT: did you really just downvote me? Lmao
    No, I didn’t downvote you
GTA V has literally the worst and most boring driving mechanics I have ever seen in any game, maybe, just maybe Watch Dogs is worse in this regard.
    I think it has the best driving mechanics of the series so far. It doesn't need to be hyper realistic but this game isn't a racing simulator. But it's ok I've seen this discussion before and people seem to be highly opinionated in favor or against both GTA IV and GTA V's driving mechanics.
        Every car in 5 has Stability Control that cuts power mid slide and stops on a dime.

Every car in 4 has shot shocks.

A little balance would be nice.
My point is that I don't comment on every GTA V post just to say that it's just another circle jerk.
that doesn't make any sense - they didn't even make a mobile port of GTA4, so, what the fuck are they going to base a whole remaster off of?
    Lmao

    And if trevor exposes Michaels hypocrisy, lamar exposes franklins hypocrisy. Franklin calls lamar's gang life crazy, telling him how he is going to die, etc. Yet if you look at story missions we do with him, there is no difference between the kife of lamar and the life of franklin.
You got me. But my opinion is a lot more reasonable than yours. Most people who plays GTA V would agree that it captures modern LA *very* well.

The way you put the previous games on a pedestal when GTA V is on the same level of quality in it’s world design makes me believe your opinion is based in bias towards the previous games.

I don’t know why there’s a hate train for  V on this sub, especially when you all love to applaud IV. 

When GTA IV came out, it arguably dropped the most from the GTA formula out of any game.
    You thinking your opinion is more reasonable than mine is yet another opinion. You're making a whole lot of assumptions. I never said I didn't enjoy five. In fact I called it cool. Your posts are filled with logical fallacies. I'm referring to the ambiance and atmosphere of the environment. It's a pretty common opinion in the community if you don't live under a rock.

In fact. For those who do live under a rock such as yourself. You can simply reference to the remaining comment thread and all of the up voters here to see how community members agree. Its not that deep.
        Yeah I don’t think most GTA fans would agree that V is less ambient than the previous games.

And also to have the balls to say GTA V has no soul, when most open world games can’t even come close to what Los Santos achieved in open world design.
I usually don't care much about vehicle damage physics unless it's too bad like in San Andreas where the vehicle's rear end somehow gets damaged when you hit the front end of the car lol.

GTA V's vehicle damage physics weren't noticeably bad so I didn't really care.

What I look for, personally, in the vehicles is the vehicular handling, and I like V's vehicular handling a LOT more than IV's.

Can you go into more detail about why you think NPCs and cops are "soulless" because I don't see what you mean by that. In fact, mind you, I've seen cops carry the bodies of their dead comrades in GTA V during shootouts, which is quite realistic behaviour.
    Cuz as soon as you get close to them they start attacking, for no reason, and their behaviour makes you feel no sympathy for them at all.
Do you know anything about the music industry? Game devs are charities compared to the amount of greed those fuckers have. The music industry sues grandmas for millions. They will stop at no end in their pursuit of money.
    And they’ve been around for a lot longer than video game publishers, so they’ve had time to sharpen their greed
    "Oh 1 millisecond of our music in your video? your video's now ours."
I’d expect that porting an existing game to a slightly different internal game engine should be easy for a multi-billion dollar company, yes.
Euphoria is not an engine the game runs on, it’s still RAGE, just using Euphoria physics.
    Whoops i meant euphoria physics, thats my bad. Its still outrageous to say that simply porting a game to a newer iteration of an engine can represent absolutely no drawbacks at all, there's like evidence you know... But its only my opinion.
Every car in 5 has Stability Control that cuts power mid slide and stops on a dime.

Every car in 4 has shot shocks.

A little balance would be nice.
that's the biggest reason why gta 4 runs like shit on a stick
oh, you haven't heard about the Definitive GTA Trilogy that just came out? you should look into that.
Personally, I liked how realistic it felt, but I remember people hating the driving back then. Motorcycles were practically useless until the Lost and Damned.
    I hated every motorcycle chase in IV.
They're usually named something like 'Natural and Realistic ENB/lighting"
    yeah something like. it’s simple and keeps the vibe but still has some good changes

no problem enjoy the new pc!
I felt pretty contempt about the story mode but I think it’s because it’s vastly different in that there are multiple main characters compared to all earlier games where we only had a single main protagonist.

But I really think for GTA V the real main character is ourselves with our online character.
    Story mode sure was an experience. I did have a good time playing it, but when it comes to comparing with the older games, I just prefer it less that’s all. 

I’m more of a story mode fanboi than an online player, so I haven’t really spent much time there in the online world tbh.
        Yeah I agree that it was way less immersive and I’m a bit of both. I love story mode as much as online, same for most games for me.
