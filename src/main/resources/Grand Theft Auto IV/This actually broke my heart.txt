[[This actually broke my heart]]


I've had GTA4 for years, but never bothered to play the story. Bought the Complete Edition for cheap on Steam last week so I could play it on the PC, so I finally decided to play through the story.

I went on so many dates with Michelle (or "Karen" I should say) in between various missions & other hobbies, so this part where she confesses she was a spy absolutely crushed me.

I felt so bad for Niko, but then I got over it like a man and used the Internet Cafe to get him a new date lmao. Fuck Michelle.


I kind of found it icky when she would keep pestering Niko with so many questions and she'd answer very vaguely whenever Niko asks her something. Didn't see the IAA connection coming tho.
    Dang, the only things I caught were in the apartment cutscene, where everything was brand new & the fact that she never drank at the bars. I was too engrossed in the game to pick up on the other signs.

Looking back, there were so many.

Her compliments when wearing shitty clothes, the sudden discussion of crimes, the questions, etc.

I feel played. Did I play the game or did the game play me? 😭
        Lol happens most of the time. Half of us are just there to shoot guns and drive cars that often times we tend not to listen or observe clues and when things like this happen we're taken aback. I kind of had a similar experience with farcry4 recently because I chose to do Amita missions because she simply seemed like she had better plans than Sabal who was just a religious predator. >!She then proceeded to forcefully take away all the kids of the place and forced them into the army and made it a drug state instead.!<
            See this is why you should enjoy the crab rangoon
                Its funny how I spent the whole game trying to kill the one guy who wasn't trying to kill me. Spared him at the end.
                    I honestly wished I could start helping him part way into the game. I started to really dislike the two Golden Path leaders, and wanted to just hang with Pagan Min.
                My ex was Burmese, you don’t just step away from a sweet crab Rangoon
            there was supposed to be a 3rd path where you side with Pagan Min and retake all the outposts and fight for his side but Ubisoft was under a crunch
                I can kind of see why they never did it because it just makes you feel like shit and basically all your work is pointless. My canon ending is waiting for 15 fucking minutes and enjoying that crab rangoon. Its literally what most people would do IRL.
                    I feel like that's kind of the point. The series kind of sticks with me as a great foil to the classic "you're a god-hero and can singlehandedly make the world better" trope. Your hard work is often for nothing, or even ends up making the situation worse than if you hadn't intervened at all, to the point that, in my head, the very title alludes to. This place is a far cry from proper civilization. It is a far cry from your comfort zone. You are a far cry from the typical hero.
            Amita was Toxic, Sabal was a nut job. But the crab rangoon was delicious.
                Pagan was a horrible man who in his old age realized how horrible of a man he had actually been. He realized that he had been a bad man from the start, and used his daughters death as an excuse to become an even more brutal tyrannical bastard. His plan since the beginning of the game was to abdicate the throne and give it to his kinda sorta step-son Ajay who he would teach to understand the truth about his mother and father, the flaws of the Golden Path, as well as the flaws of his own tyrannical rule. Amita is a monster with extremist views, Sabal is a monster with extremist views, and Pagan is a monster but he’s a monster thats self aware and wants to change. Hes a monster that could have been reasoned with if you had just sat down and enjoyed the crab rangoon. Amita and Sabal are 2 monsters who arent even self aware enough to believe they are monsters, they believe that everything they do no matter how heinous is justified by their idea of the greater good. Theyre monsters that believe they are heros and that anyone who doesnt follow their beliefs 100% is a traitor that must be deal with. Amita and Sabal are both just future Pagan Mins, just wrapped with a different flag
            Ah do love far cry 4 its called what bad ending do you want. Though I feel like the best ending honestly is when you can choose to replace the dictator but I would modify it so you change the rules to become a democracy and then set up an election to replace you.
            To be fair, choosing Sabal doesn't really give you a *better* ending, just a different but equally fucked up ending. I usually choose him because Amita kills Bhadra, but he still forces her into a life of slavery, living as a religious prop rather than a person. Amita creates a drug state, under Sabal they simply go broke instead due to his inability to evolve. Both are bad options, which is the point. Arguably the best ending is the one where you do nothing and chill with Pagan, considering the resistance you end up waging instead gets more people killed then it helps in the end. After all, surely some of those thousands of soldiers were just putting food on the table for their families.
                And there were plenty of notes and things on them that supported what you said. They were just regular dudes at the end of the day.
            Oh just a religious predator!
                He just looked like he had no bright ideas. At least in Amita's vision she had some direction and argued that they needed money somehow and she wanted to make use of the resources they had. Sabal was straight up ignorant of all that wants to continue the same path that caused them all that problems and thought religion is his only option.
            I chose sabal after Amita said she would keep the drugs
            Ahh yes, the half that are children and man children.
            Yes actually the right choice is to stay for 10 minutes in the first mission when he tells you to wait there, not to move, and to enjoy the crab rangoon. Interesting secret ending. But you have to wait exactly 10 minutes.
        She also never gets drunk when you take her out.
            Yeah, I forgot to mention that one. All the other friends get noticeably drunk too, but not Michelle. Plus, Niko asks "what's up with all these questions?"

Niko also says "why do you always have to get the drinks? I feel like you're trying to slip me the Mickey" 😂
                Yeah and I think you can drive drunk or something with her
        This is why gta 4 is the best gta and no one can change my mind
        That's why I love GTA 4.. this story was sooo well written. I also felt soooo sorry for Niko when Michelle showed up that way 😭😭💔
            I agree.

I realy wanted to punch a hole in my screen 😭
        Well... She has been asking Niko if he fought in the war so...
        She reappears again in GTA 5 as well
        lol yeah you fell in love with a narc’s inch deep cover persona.
        Still think story wise gta4 is the goat by far. Not the cousin though.. fuck that guy..
    When you know who she is, every interaction with her just hits entirely different...
        that second playthrough is where boys became men
        Oh yeah on my second playthrough everytime you go out with her it seemed so obvious. "So Michelle, what do you do for work?" "Oh don't worry about it? So Niko do you know any drugs or arms dealers? Just trying to get to know you!" Is basically how the conversations go.
    I thought she was off from the moment she got in the car, when it came out she was a double agent I was like no wonder you’re so weird. It was pretty obvious tbh
    The first time I was like "ok she's shifty."

On repeat playthroughs the connection becomes so obvious it hurts lol
She's also in GTA V as the fed threatening the middle eastern guy with a 12 inch flashlight up the ass lol
    Yehh and she was in one of the Online heists right?

And holy fuck, that mission where you gotta kidnap him & torture him was one of my favorite missions from GTAV. Everything from scaling the tower, pulling his teeth out, etc. Really fun mission to play.
        I have no idea about the online heists tbh. And the torture mission was brutal! I loved it for the sheer shock value!
            [She’s in the setup for the Humane Labs raid where you meet up at the parking lot but get ambushed by the feds](https://youtu.be/JComVZSbwsY?si=GRAlKodA8bCdGkfh)

I hope she returns in GTA VI, I would love to see her in online again
                I hope we get to kill her
                So in that specific cutscene from the gta v heist you posted, does Michelle set up the player again? lol
                    I think it’s more like they were ambushed without her knowing, since her bodyguard got shot and everything
                I want IAA/UL Paper guy tbh
        Yes she's in the humane labs raid
        i felt bad for the guy so i only waterboarded him instead of smashing his balls
            😭 nothing could prepare me for this comment.

Damn.. he really didn't have any good choices did he? 😂
                i mean i didn't want to leave him bloody and waterboarding just seemed to be the less painful it's more threatening to drown him ig
                    It’s legal for a reason… 😭
        I hated the torture mission. Glad it's semi-skippable
            How is it semi-skippable? You have to do it
                You can just shoot the guy as soon as you switch to Michael and that skips a lot of it
                    I thought the target is randomized
                        Nope, same dude every time. The dialogue is pretty humorous when you shoot him immediately, it basically amounts to Michael saying “I had a feeling that was the guy” and everyone else goes “welp we got him boys”
                            Lmao that's hilarious, I had no idea.
                If you know what the guy looks like, you can snipe him as soon as you have control of Michael. Speedrunners do it a lot.
                    Wait what? I played through the game three times and never knew that 😭 atleast the torturing is fun
                        wtf 😳
            One of the best GTA mission ever
        This mission was prolly one of the reason why I never completed GTA 5 story mode 😞😞😯 I have killed 1000000's of NPC prolly.. but torture is something me, I can't do that. 😕😕
    Oh my God that was her? I never noticed lol
        Yup!
    Pretty sure she’s with CIA
        *IAA
            Same thing, just censored.
                *parody
                    Whatever it is it ruined the series. Hearing FBI, CIA and SWAT is far better than hearing nonsense words like FIB, IAA and the stupid NOOSE.
                        Gotta have consistency of parodying company names
                        Yeah I agree with this one.. and having 5 starts is not just it. FIB is just nah man.. not it for me..
                        They just dont want to kill theirselves with 12 shots to the back, i see no issue with parodying it
                            No ones going to get 12 shots on the back for that lol if that was the case then most Hollywood directors and conspiracy theorists would had been dead.
    “Fuck the lube, lets dry dock him!”
        Yup that's it lol
    Wait that was her??!!
        Yup!
It was, in fact, a place for michelle😔
    ![gif](giphy|kcfb43I3N1GhspNQpj|downsized)
Michelle is the OG Karen and can go fuck herself. Kate’s death is the heartbreaking one. I’d say Roman if he didn’t annoy the shit out of me with his bowling obsession.
    I can still hear his overly-optmistic-ass voice asking me if I want to go. I dread in-game phone calls now & had to turn that shit on Do Not Disturb mode.
        That hangout mechanic is the most annoying part of GTAIV. I’m trying to get the Liberty City (5) trophy and keep getting screwed by arriving 3 seconds late or an unskippable mission starting from a phone call and then the hangout being cancelled.
            I would say GTA5 did it better, letting you initiate hangouts on your own terms, even though you can miss some story stuff by now doing them at all.
        “hey cousin!” lives rent free in my head
            "I am too busy for the strippers , another time cousin"
        Cousin, let’s go bowling
    Kate’s death was whatever she was barely a character. That’s why I like the ending where Roman dies more it hits harder and better fits the consequences of Niko’s actions
        Why did you get downvoted you're literally right Roman's character is infinitely better written and has waay more screentime so his death just hits harder and makes the ending more satisfying
            Yeah this sub hates when you even slightly criticize gta 4
                Unless you make a stupid ass bowling joke for some reason
        but … bowling …
YOU FUCKING BEEEEEETCH.
It's so funny how Michelle is able to win over most players and even Niko when in hindsight it's incredibly obvious that she's a fed, like, she basically glows in the dark. She is incredibly nosey and asks so many prying questions about Niko's involvement with crime. And yet, she manages to win the trust of most people and I remember how legitimately betrayed I felt when I first played and it was revealed she was undercover. It seriously surprised me and I was already somewhat suspicious of her because of all the questions and it still surprised me.
    My feelings exactly! It puts into perspective how easy it truly is to manipulate someone.

Such clever writing, I will admit.
        Yeah, I think a lot of it is that players put themselves in Niko's position and don't really see any of the red flags because they want the relationship to be authentic because they want Niko to have some happiness. Maybe we all knew deep down that she was lying but we didn't care because the idea that she wasn't was so appealing.
        I cant give Rockstar clever writing for that tbh. Its the opposite of subtle


Players simply want Niko do have a story tied partner and shes the first choice 
            That's the point. The clues are *not* subtle, but if you're invested, they go right over your head still.

It's the definition of "hiding in plain sight". Clever.
                ...no, not really
                    I may have misspoken when I said "clever". I don't mean "clever" as in "no one else could write this", I just mean in a general "that was a smart move".

I hope my feelings aren't misconstrued here.

Because they could've just said from the very start of the game that she's a spy, but they don't. They want the player to develop Niko's relationship with Michelle first, but not give away the secret too soon.

Then, when the player is fully invested in Niko's relationship with Michelle, they drop the masquerade. 

That's why the clues are 100x clearer in hindsight. They were written to be subtle at first, but then much more obvious when the player revisits those moments.
    Yeah, even on the second playthrough I sat there with a surprised pikachu face. (I played GTA IV when it came out, and replayed it last year)

Rockstar made something kinda great here, I think they really proved the "grey person" effect that actual agencies like CIA use. A disguise is best when she is rather, kinda uninteresting, not too attractive, but not ugly either-- gray or neutral just plays great into how most people view the world, I can't bother to remember every human or bird I see unless they have something outstanding.

She is one of the most interesting characters in the game thanks to this, but she is portrayed as this girl that I know nothing will come off.

But yeah, it was kinda easy to see the signs in hindsight.
    Everyone realizes shes a fed, its indeed pretty damn obvious


But everyone also wanted Niko do be happy and i personally thought they could stay a couple despite one being a criminal and the other a fed. That would make a good ass Love Story. Thats why she won many people over


But no she throws you away like an rotten apple lol
    Not to mention Niko mentions that everything in her apartment looks brand new.
    Yeah IIRC the first time you hang out with her she's like "are you hanging around with dangerous people??"
    An other reason not to be suspicious is that Niko just arrived in america and didn't even start criminal activities when you start dating Michelle. You don't see any reason for Niko to be spied on. Or at least I don't see any reasons, but maybe I'm missing something
        The iaa have his file of his previous criminal dealings, so when you have an illegal immigrant who gets off a boat into America, there is every reason for him to be spied on
            True. Now that you say it I remember UL paper saying this. But I find it a bit far fetched that the IAA would care about an ex soldier from Serbia working for a loanshark in his country. It's not like he was a general or something in the army, and it seems to me that he was a small criminal compared to warlord and druglord and the other kind of criminal the IAA usually deal with. And he is smuggled in the country. I get that the IAA has the means to know Niko is on their territory , but putting a spy on him the moment he gets out of the boat. I find it a bit too big to swallow. They have bigger fishes to catch and cheaper mean to spy on him imo. Anyway even if it's a plot hole, it's a tiny one.
"You...FACKIN' bitch!"
    Lol that came from Niko's core
Indeed, Niko’s love life was completely tragic. I’d probably go as far as to say it’s the saddest aspect of his life and it’s like he’s cursed to not be able to be with someone. Michelle was a liar and (spoiler alert) Kate dies in Revenge ending and I believe she leaves Niko in the Deal ending
    You're thinking of Kate, Karen was Michelle. Or rather, Michelle was Karen?
        Oops my mistake. I corrected it and thanks for the heads up
    If you go to that blog website you can date this rich chick named Alex. She likes Niko but their relationship is open and they have a lot of fun with eachother. Like Niko thinks she’s crazy but it’s the most he ever laughs when he’s with her. They are equally crazy in their different ways and are complete polar opposites and it’s fun to see that dynamic. She blogs about Niko after every date. And if you sleep with her she will blog about it… apparently Niko has a HOG and he stinks- which I could’ve guessed.
        If you get through enough dates with her Niko is actually willing to open up to her about his experiences in full. He gives a summary of his life, his war trauma, what he does for a living and his reason for being in Liberty City. Its actually pretty heartbreaking that she just shrugs it off as a joke, although I can't help but feel like someone as sharp as Niko might have seen it coming with how quickly he responded with his backup. 

He gets a similar experience with Kiki who pretends to understand Niko when he admits to being a criminal, but in the end just has some kind of weird control fetish for criminals, and which annoys Niko since he wants to take accountability for his actions and Kiki writes it all off as Niko being a victim of the system to play into her own savior complex.
            Kiki is nice on the surface but she’s the typical girl who thinks she can fix broken men.
    Niko's lovelife absolutely sucked, even his childhood crush was the town bike according to Roman lmao
Bro i was INVESTED in those dumbass romance missions with her because i thought it would lead to a happy ending.


You can see her being some sort of Fed a mile away given her weird ass questions and apartment, but i thought it would turn out a Romeo and Juliet story, 2 different Camps 1 Love - sort of thing


Nah bitch was cold af. 
    >but i thought it would turn out a Romeo and Juliet story, 2 different Camps 1 Love - sort of thing

This might be the plot of GTA 6.
Just don't give her a flashlight.
    Cuz she knows exactly where to put it
    Let alone 12 inch one
New ick unlocked
Bro bought brand spanking new furniture just to be a spy like get real bro was so unprepared
Even though it sucked for Niko that Karen was a spy all along, it did lead to him getting affiliated with the U.L Paper and when he was done helping them, they held up their end of the deal by helping him find Darko Brevic.
    That *is* true, it lead to a better situation for him.

Thanks for your optimism and perspective in these trying times 😭
Imo her betrayal was more shocking than dimitri (dimitri's was very obvious)
    Faustin literally says exactly what's going to happen, plus every gta game basically follows this formula
Playing the game, only focusing on the story, I got a ton of calls to go on a date with her. I never did any besides the first date mission. Eventually I told myself “fine, just one more mission and then I’ll go on a date”.

Guess which mission was my “one more mission”?
The dialogue on her dates make it so obvious lmao
I’ll be honest, this did nothing.

I only went on the required date, and so she just sort of came up out of nowhere. I forgot who she was tbh.

You can call me dumb but Rockstar only has one mission where you go out, the rest is optional. Yet the emotional weight is lost without that.
    Yeah, I think Rockstar should've made it like Catalina's missions in GTA:SA where all of her dates are mandatory and they somewhat feed into the story, rather than just optional hobbies that most players would gloss over.
        Catalina my favorite female GTA character. Haha
What also got me is that you can tell that she actually felt bad for it, and then fast forward to GTA V where she's become a completely different person
    Yeah, she came off as a bit of a twat in GTA5. Too much attitude. She was really sweet & "conscience-clear" in GTA4. She's just a bitch in GTA5
        I kind of like how it contrasts with Niko. She was an IAA asset who had to do things she wasn't proud of to get her life back (at least according to the IAA Contact who admittedly might just be manipulating Niko with that story), but instead of moving on from it like Niko does, she dives in and becomes a senior agent who loses the conscience and becomes willing to do things even Niko might give a second thought to.

Say what you will about Niko, when he's up against an innocent or unarmed person, the player generally gets a chance to spare them. He would definitely have some reservations about torturing an innocent man, and at least wouldn't be so excited to do so with a big flashlight.
            Nope niko is so far gone he definitely would, he never showed any real sort of hesitation or guilt for anything, he would just delude himself to think he did
Whatever tenderness was left in Karen/Michelle is long gone by the time she makes it to Los Santos for GTAV
    Yep, total bitch in GTA5
    Yeah, in GTA IV it seemed to me the newspaper guy had some dirt on her so he could coerce her. But in GTA V she tortures a guy without a care
        She was a fresh agent with her career in his hands. I don't blame her for doing it, but it definitely changed her.
This made me realize I never did much with her lmao
    I replayed it last year and I am mad I wasted many hours and thought I had 100% with her, which I had double checked before going to point of no return. Only to find out many missions laters it was at 99%. Really screwed up my goal to get 100%. Lol 
I fucking HATE Michelle. She's just a legal prostitute for the government and used Niko. Honestly, I have more affinity/like for even Dimitri or Francis Mcreary than I do for Michelle.
    This is what I said in my head when the betrayal scene happened 😂 I was so angry.

"Michelle.. government prostitute.. see, it rhymes".
    I dont see niko complaining before hand and calling her names? I'd rather her than a fucking hypocrite 
I was pretty young when I first played GTA IV's story, and Michelle's revelation shattered me. Literally went into a mini post-breakup depression for a few days, right down to listening to breakup music. I don't know what the Hell was wrong with me or why I was so invested in their "relationship". I guess back when I was younger and had more fun playing games and helping Niko have a life, things were more impacting. I was a strange kid.
    I feel that.

I don't think it was strange though, I also think games had much bigger impact on me as a kid.

San Andreas was the GTA game that I had that connection with. Finding out Ryder & Smoke were traitors actually made me mad. I found it exciting when I had the chance to kill Ryder & Smoke in the latter half of the game.

I guess you have a much stronger sense of nostalgia for the game now, looking back at the connections you made with the game.
        I'm glad I'm not alone in my experiences as a youth lol I always felt very personally connected to characters and stories as a kid when it came to gaming, something long-gone now as I'm well into my adulthood. I think the last game I truly felt that way with would have been RDR2, which I almost didn't even want to finish simply to avoid watching Arthur die.
BRO replaying the story and hearing her talk to to Niko on dates it's so fucking obvious. Like I'm replaying it currently and I'm kinda upset neither roman or Niko didn't at least SUSPECT something off with her.
    Because niko is a dumb immigrant 🤐
The moment you try your level best to get Niko laid and get some puss but this dumb Karen keeps on asking you questions 😞💔 The struggle is real brother  😭😅

![gif](giphy|xUOxf0EniRe3ll2u8U|downsized)
When I was 12/13 I played this. I remember running back and forth in my living room freaking out, feeling so betrayed. If you replay her missions now there definitely is some obvious foreshadowing.

(My parents didn't know I was playing this game so young)
Karen aka Michelle -"As It happens it is "
I could sense she was a cop or something from the beginning. The way she spoke with Niko. She seemed to be hiding something. So i never really bothered going on dates much.
I have a habit of hitting big GTA moments at like 2am so when this happened I was like:

![gif](giphy|RA8gXeMaTqXIc|downsized)
Fucking tragic lol
Why you guys depressed over a mid glowie bitch lmao
    Just like any movies, tv shows. People become invested in characters personalities etc. 
The lmao duck Michelle got me
"but then I got over it like a man and used the Internet Cafe to get him a new date lmao. Fuck Michelle."  


lol yeah i love that part hahaha
    Niko's such a ladies' man 😂
First time I played GTA 4 I was stunned when she was an agent
The coke, please.
She was a opp from the start
Honestly I love both Michelle and Kate as characters. I think Kate’s dates especially are well written as they delve into some deeper/fucked up topics that adds a lot more context for several characters. Sucks to see hate for them, cus I feel like a lot of players miss out on the extra dialogue on the dates. Hate for Michelle is kinda understandable cus like haha fuck that bitch for betraying Niko, but whenever I see people dog on Kate it’s because she “doesn’t put out” or is ugly. Like, there’s a reason why she isn’t like the other girlfriends who sleep with Niko. The ugly thing is just Rockstar’s fault, her concept art is a lot better then what her model is in game. Back to Michelle, I find her character interesting because it’s implied she is also being blackmailed or something into working for the ULP. Then later in GTA 5, we see that she stuck around with them.
Kind of funny how Ned Luke (The guy who voices Michael in GTA V) is playing thru GTA IV at the moment. He went on one date with "Michelle" which was the required mission and then never went on another date with her, citing that shes just "Too needy".
    I didn't know he was playing through IV, Ill have to check that out
She was definitely more interesting than Kate
I hope she makes a come back...
It was obvious to me from the start. She would keep asking the same questions.
Well, she wasn't trusting when you visit her apartment for the first time. But i don't blame Niko, he only wanted to have something honest with his life.
This should actually be posted in good reddit on twitter lmao
After the first time this happened to me, I made it my mission to never hook up with her or call her whatsoever in any new playthrough. I popped the trophy for hot coffee through Carmen, instead in later runs.
As a kid I played the starting few missions so many times, either because I was using other people's consoles or I was getting save glitches or I was simply bored, but I never progressed to her betrayal so for like a few months I just kept messing around with her never realising she was undercover lmao.

When I was even younger I ironically had the same thing with San Andreas I never progressed past the green sabre and always thought I had basically completed the game and never knew about the betrayal or anything.
This pissed me the fuck off
I hate how in 5 she’s just a cartoonish bitch
    A shell of her former self.

Or a 'chelle of her former self.. haha..
I think what really sells it so that no one is suspicious of her is that she is friends with Mallorie, so we never have a reason to think anything is up. If she met Niko and tried to be friends we would likely be suspicious, but Mallorie is the one that pushes for you to get more involved.
This part always makes me feel bad when Karen lied to niko about everything especially telling him that she's some sort of fed. She was never real with him at all and that's just messed up. Even tho she was still the same in gta 5 smh.
    She's in GTA 5?
        The break in IAA building mission, she's the female agent in yellow suit
        She's always been in it. But she looks a little different. Also....she's not all that pretty
im more surprised you could play GTA IV on pc, everytime i try to play my game hard freezes after 10 mins and requires a full pc restart
It never really bothered me all that much. I dunno. I guess I'm dead inside.
    You aren't the only one, friend. There have been a few people in the comments saying they didn't feel anything.

I guess it differs from person to person. I've always formed strong bonds with characters like the nerd I am, but I'd also wager that it depends on how you play the game. Idk, it's just one of those unexplainable things.

But you are definitely *not* dead inside, I think it just depends on how you choose to experience the game and its story.
        I form bonds with characters too but i never really felt anything for Michelle. Never had such a bond with her.

Kate on the other hand, man, i was crushed when she died at the end. It was the hardest choice ever choosing between her and Roman. 

But i had to choose roman because he's really part of the spirit of the game. Also i could never trust Dimitri and do that deal with him. Especially that he was served to me on a gold platter.

Btw on that mission when Pegorino asks you to do the deal with Dimitri, you get two options. Either do the deal or kill Dimitri. Many people didn't know but you can ask some of your contacts if you should take the deal or not.

Roman tells you to take the deal since there's a lot of money involved and it doesn't matter if it was coming from Dimitri since maybe Dimitri changed and wants to make amends. I don't trust that.

If you call kate and tell her, she's gonna tell you not to takee the deal. Dimitri is a treacherous snake and will always be that way.

If you call lil Jacob, he's going to tell you that it's a bad idea and that it doesn't sound right. I think u can call Dwayne too, but I'm not so sure. Since Dwayne is the kind of guy who gives advice. But he's also an optional character.

So, yeah. Gta 4 was the goat.
Was a good
Michelle is a spy I’m dating her rn on the game
So many of you are delusional on here,she is a cop,doing her job,not a bitch who betrayed Niko(who’s a killer)
    You can still have sympathy for a character. That's how stories work. This is all fiction, none of it happened in real life.

Niko is the main protagonist of the game. You spend the entire game living vicariously through this character.

If you're fully invested in the character of Niko Bellic and the game in which his story is told, you're absolutely going to be putting yourself in his shoes and emotionally connecting yourself to the story.

It's not delusional, it's an honest reaction to a good plot twist.

If you don't have the ability to connect to stories & characters, that's not something I can teach you, my friend, or have the right to tell you that you should have it.

But to call everyone else delusional because they *do* have the ability to engage & immerse themselves into the game just makes you look worse to us than we probably do to you.
        Not you in particular,the other comments are painting a bad picture .

And also yeah I sympathise with Niko,but on the other things like being in a war,losing his friends,not being able to find his role in the world. Not because his GF he didn’t really care about was actually an Undercover Agent
        Your missing the point, I don't care about being this so called war veteran character, I don't have to be emotionally connected to him to empathise with him or not. It doesn't change that she Michelle was just doing her job, it doesn't make her a bitch for doing what she did to a criminal scumbag
            No, the entire point of the game is to live through Niko's eyes. The entire point of the game is to be a criminal scumbag. That's why you steal cars, kill innocent civilians, rob banks, etc.

You're supposed to put yourself in the shoes of a broken & morally-neutral character. If you're playing the game properly & *don't* develop any sort of connection to Niko at any capacity, then I don't know what to tell you.

And let me guess, you also don't care about CJ, Tommy, Michael, Trevor or Franklin either do you?

Because they're all scumbags and deserve what's coming to them?? Yeah, I guess you don't.

Must be a boring way to play the game if you're stuck playing as characters who are criminal scumbags.

I guess you'd prefer a game where you play as the cops instead? That way, you don't have to feel guilty about feeling sorry for the protagonist because they're not criminals.
                I'm not "supposed " to do anything, it's a video game. You can't tell people what they should do lol simple as. If I don't develop any weird emotional fanboy connection to niko then don't say anything? I don't care what you personally think through your very scewed subjective pov of niko. Why do I have to sympathise with a criminal lol? Please give me one good reason? Your totally missing the point I'm making it's not about Wether I care about a character but whether I'm forced to emotionally connect to one and no I don't, don't complicate it your acting like it's some soap opera lmao.
Tbh they made it so obvious that she's a fed that I wasn't even surprised or sad when she revealed she's working for the IAA lol.

Like no shit you keep on thinking Niko has connection to the criminal world and you stay anyway and you keep prying for more info. 

I wonder why lmao.
I'm not sure if I ever recovered from this 😂. It's the fact that the red flags become very clear on story mode replay.
The tags on the furniture will always haunt me. Everything in that living room was new... 
“Fuck Michelle”

in which way tho![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face)
I remember when this game came out, my friend and I were playing this game and we were at about the same part of it. I listened to her talk and ask questions while she was dating niko and I said to him next day something is strange about Michelle.  About a day or two later he got further than me and told me I was right but didn't spoil it more than that
*“…………… You fucking bitch”*

All you could really say in that moment tbh.
I found it weird Niko was so bitter over Michelle lying to him. He's been working with scumbags for years, just in this game we have multiple people betray him and try to kill him or Roman, I would have thought he'd let it go after a day. Plus he had the in-game option of sleeping around on Michelle as well.
damn dude i forgot about this part. when i first got to it tho i wanted to press left + LT + RT
Damn, she broke your heart? Are you Trisha by any chance?
Nah this broke my heart too. I liked how gta gave us online dating options tho my boy niko was back in the game right after this😂hopefully they do the same concept with 6
+++
She was a very sweet girl, and when the truth came out, I realized what a scumbag she was. Although, when GTA IV started playing for the second time, I realized that at the beginning of the game she asked a lot of questions, so Nico was her informant.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
    Scumbag because of doing her job? Yeah no
        Because Niko was going through hard times and he trusted her, and she betrayed him. If your job is more important to you than the trust of a loved one, then fine...
            How did she betray him? In case you didn't notice but she was undercover from the very beginning to investigate this illegal immigrant who came off a boat into America. If anything niko is the scumbag, he is the dude who willingly commits crimes for money no matter what and how much he tries justifying it with his bullshit past childhood garbage. Don't put this on Michelle for simply doing her job in case you forgot, it's not her fault niko can't make good decisions in his own life besides she made it way easy for niko in the end?
                She didn't help him in any way. She took what she wanted, the information + the product, and that was it.
                    She got him out of serving time, she says "your just lucky I got to you first" considering all of the crimes nimo does in that game he is darn fucking lucky
tbf i think she did genuinely like Niko. She found it difficult to confess her IAA connections, and looked hurt when Niko called her a bitch lol. And flat out admits Niko is a good guy compared to the men she dated. She was also less vicious too, compared to V where she wouldve sodomozed Mr. K with a 12 inch flashlights and play shadow puppets with his tonsil if Michael hadn't busted through. 
I remembered this from my first playthrough back in the day, so when I picked up Complete Edition on PC I was very wary of her.

Sure enough, even within like, the first four dates with her, it's actually pretty obvious she's hiding something. All her stuff is brand new. She can't give you a direct answer. She keeps trying to deflect and redirect specifically to your past, and your potential involvement with certain groups. Like she's clearly hounding you for information. Nico as a character is pretty smart, so I'm surprised the character didn't figure it out.
    Because niko isn't smart lol
I also never finished this game on ps3 back in the day. If they released it on the switch I’d buy it day one. Just sayin… what’s the hold up?
She’s the epitome of RED flags, to the T. I’m with you, felt upset. Then I got a “new” girlfriend. Idk if you know, but Niko ends up talking to someone about Karen almost like a therapy session and we go inside their apartment and the rest is history
No seriously tho
My boy niko got backstabbed multiple times
I was in love with her, used to go on dates frequently dressing up nice for her. She gave compliments. It was all a lie. She broke me
#fuckkaren
The coke please.
I did love GTA 4 very much I promise you I do more than GTA 5 and GTA 6 is 2027 not 2025
I don't even bother with her when I replay the game now. She gets just enough Nico to get through bowling and never sees him again. It makes the cutscene that much funnier if they only had the one date
It did suck. Caught me off guard. I thought she was weird but I liked her quirkiness or so I thought. But there are more fish for Niko at some point
Spoiler alert
Dude get over it already
    Did you read the full thing? 😃
        Haha yes I did and by getting over it I meant, play a new game.... something else :)
            Ohhhh, yeah, my bad, I probably should. Thanks for the advice friend! 😄
The most obvious undercover agent in history
Say what you want but fuck niko lol, he is the criminal here not Michelle she was doing her job
    ![gif](giphy|V6twSKn6SZS133x1c7)
        Both of them are criminals. Karen does the government's illegal work including extraordinary rendition and torture.
            She is a government agent and this is before gta v, I don't think undercover work is being a criminal
                Yes, she wasn't a criminal in GTA IV, but in V she surely is - and has broken international law just like Niko.
        Oops did I make you cry 🤯
    People like you really need to separate video games and real life lol
        But people actually mean what they’re saying lol. Painting Niko as a good guy and Michelle as a bad person
        But what if I mention name of Sleeping Dogs?
Funny how the game makes you hate the good guys so much lol
    We’re playing as criminals, not liking cops comes with the package.
        I know
    What good guys?
        Stopping criminals
            The corrupt incompetent people? Very funny.
                Still
    Karen is a criminal herself - she does the government's illegal work.
        It’s not illegal
            As far as I know the CIA imprisonment and torture is only legal on foreign prisoners, Karimov is a US citizen and as far as I know the Unabomber (also US citizen) was imprisoned by the FBI and not tortured.
            Even if Karimov's torture is legal she is an evil person just like Niko working for her evil overlords evil just like Niko did in when he was in the army.
    Rockstar has always made the "good guys" just bad guys who hide behind authority. It's the whole theme of the GTA franchise they're all playing cops and robbers.
Dang, the only things I caught were in the apartment cutscene, where everything was brand new & the fact that she never drank at the bars. I was too engrossed in the game to pick up on the other signs.

Looking back, there were so many.

Her compliments when wearing shitty clothes, the sudden discussion of crimes, the questions, etc.

I feel played. Did I play the game or did the game play me? 😭
    Lol happens most of the time. Half of us are just there to shoot guns and drive cars that often times we tend not to listen or observe clues and when things like this happen we're taken aback. I kind of had a similar experience with farcry4 recently because I chose to do Amita missions because she simply seemed like she had better plans than Sabal who was just a religious predator. >!She then proceeded to forcefully take away all the kids of the place and forced them into the army and made it a drug state instead.!<
        See this is why you should enjoy the crab rangoon
            Its funny how I spent the whole game trying to kill the one guy who wasn't trying to kill me. Spared him at the end.
                I honestly wished I could start helping him part way into the game. I started to really dislike the two Golden Path leaders, and wanted to just hang with Pagan Min.
            My ex was Burmese, you don’t just step away from a sweet crab Rangoon
        there was supposed to be a 3rd path where you side with Pagan Min and retake all the outposts and fight for his side but Ubisoft was under a crunch
            I can kind of see why they never did it because it just makes you feel like shit and basically all your work is pointless. My canon ending is waiting for 15 fucking minutes and enjoying that crab rangoon. Its literally what most people would do IRL.
                I feel like that's kind of the point. The series kind of sticks with me as a great foil to the classic "you're a god-hero and can singlehandedly make the world better" trope. Your hard work is often for nothing, or even ends up making the situation worse than if you hadn't intervened at all, to the point that, in my head, the very title alludes to. This place is a far cry from proper civilization. It is a far cry from your comfort zone. You are a far cry from the typical hero.
        Amita was Toxic, Sabal was a nut job. But the crab rangoon was delicious.
            Pagan was a horrible man who in his old age realized how horrible of a man he had actually been. He realized that he had been a bad man from the start, and used his daughters death as an excuse to become an even more brutal tyrannical bastard. His plan since the beginning of the game was to abdicate the throne and give it to his kinda sorta step-son Ajay who he would teach to understand the truth about his mother and father, the flaws of the Golden Path, as well as the flaws of his own tyrannical rule. Amita is a monster with extremist views, Sabal is a monster with extremist views, and Pagan is a monster but he’s a monster thats self aware and wants to change. Hes a monster that could have been reasoned with if you had just sat down and enjoyed the crab rangoon. Amita and Sabal are 2 monsters who arent even self aware enough to believe they are monsters, they believe that everything they do no matter how heinous is justified by their idea of the greater good. Theyre monsters that believe they are heros and that anyone who doesnt follow their beliefs 100% is a traitor that must be deal with. Amita and Sabal are both just future Pagan Mins, just wrapped with a different flag
        Ah do love far cry 4 its called what bad ending do you want. Though I feel like the best ending honestly is when you can choose to replace the dictator but I would modify it so you change the rules to become a democracy and then set up an election to replace you.
        To be fair, choosing Sabal doesn't really give you a *better* ending, just a different but equally fucked up ending. I usually choose him because Amita kills Bhadra, but he still forces her into a life of slavery, living as a religious prop rather than a person. Amita creates a drug state, under Sabal they simply go broke instead due to his inability to evolve. Both are bad options, which is the point. Arguably the best ending is the one where you do nothing and chill with Pagan, considering the resistance you end up waging instead gets more people killed then it helps in the end. After all, surely some of those thousands of soldiers were just putting food on the table for their families.
            And there were plenty of notes and things on them that supported what you said. They were just regular dudes at the end of the day.
        Oh just a religious predator!
            He just looked like he had no bright ideas. At least in Amita's vision she had some direction and argued that they needed money somehow and she wanted to make use of the resources they had. Sabal was straight up ignorant of all that wants to continue the same path that caused them all that problems and thought religion is his only option.
        I chose sabal after Amita said she would keep the drugs
        Ahh yes, the half that are children and man children.
        Yes actually the right choice is to stay for 10 minutes in the first mission when he tells you to wait there, not to move, and to enjoy the crab rangoon. Interesting secret ending. But you have to wait exactly 10 minutes.
    She also never gets drunk when you take her out.
        Yeah, I forgot to mention that one. All the other friends get noticeably drunk too, but not Michelle. Plus, Niko asks "what's up with all these questions?"

Niko also says "why do you always have to get the drinks? I feel like you're trying to slip me the Mickey" 😂
            Yeah and I think you can drive drunk or something with her
    This is why gta 4 is the best gta and no one can change my mind
    That's why I love GTA 4.. this story was sooo well written. I also felt soooo sorry for Niko when Michelle showed up that way 😭😭💔
        I agree.

I realy wanted to punch a hole in my screen 😭
    Well... She has been asking Niko if he fought in the war so...
    She reappears again in GTA 5 as well
    lol yeah you fell in love with a narc’s inch deep cover persona.
    Still think story wise gta4 is the goat by far. Not the cousin though.. fuck that guy..
When you know who she is, every interaction with her just hits entirely different...
    that second playthrough is where boys became men
    Oh yeah on my second playthrough everytime you go out with her it seemed so obvious. "So Michelle, what do you do for work?" "Oh don't worry about it? So Niko do you know any drugs or arms dealers? Just trying to get to know you!" Is basically how the conversations go.
I thought she was off from the moment she got in the car, when it came out she was a double agent I was like no wonder you’re so weird. It was pretty obvious tbh
The first time I was like "ok she's shifty."

On repeat playthroughs the connection becomes so obvious it hurts lol
Yehh and she was in one of the Online heists right?

And holy fuck, that mission where you gotta kidnap him & torture him was one of my favorite missions from GTAV. Everything from scaling the tower, pulling his teeth out, etc. Really fun mission to play.
    I have no idea about the online heists tbh. And the torture mission was brutal! I loved it for the sheer shock value!
        [She’s in the setup for the Humane Labs raid where you meet up at the parking lot but get ambushed by the feds](https://youtu.be/JComVZSbwsY?si=GRAlKodA8bCdGkfh)

I hope she returns in GTA VI, I would love to see her in online again
            I hope we get to kill her
            So in that specific cutscene from the gta v heist you posted, does Michelle set up the player again? lol
                I think it’s more like they were ambushed without her knowing, since her bodyguard got shot and everything
            I want IAA/UL Paper guy tbh
    Yes she's in the humane labs raid
    i felt bad for the guy so i only waterboarded him instead of smashing his balls
        😭 nothing could prepare me for this comment.

Damn.. he really didn't have any good choices did he? 😂
            i mean i didn't want to leave him bloody and waterboarding just seemed to be the less painful it's more threatening to drown him ig
                It’s legal for a reason… 😭
    I hated the torture mission. Glad it's semi-skippable
        How is it semi-skippable? You have to do it
            You can just shoot the guy as soon as you switch to Michael and that skips a lot of it
                I thought the target is randomized
                    Nope, same dude every time. The dialogue is pretty humorous when you shoot him immediately, it basically amounts to Michael saying “I had a feeling that was the guy” and everyone else goes “welp we got him boys”
                        Lmao that's hilarious, I had no idea.
            If you know what the guy looks like, you can snipe him as soon as you have control of Michael. Speedrunners do it a lot.
                Wait what? I played through the game three times and never knew that 😭 atleast the torturing is fun
                    wtf 😳
        One of the best GTA mission ever
    This mission was prolly one of the reason why I never completed GTA 5 story mode 😞😞😯 I have killed 1000000's of NPC prolly.. but torture is something me, I can't do that. 😕😕
Oh my God that was her? I never noticed lol
    Yup!
Pretty sure she’s with CIA
    *IAA
        Same thing, just censored.
            *parody
                Whatever it is it ruined the series. Hearing FBI, CIA and SWAT is far better than hearing nonsense words like FIB, IAA and the stupid NOOSE.
                    Gotta have consistency of parodying company names
                    Yeah I agree with this one.. and having 5 starts is not just it. FIB is just nah man.. not it for me..
                    They just dont want to kill theirselves with 12 shots to the back, i see no issue with parodying it
                        No ones going to get 12 shots on the back for that lol if that was the case then most Hollywood directors and conspiracy theorists would had been dead.
“Fuck the lube, lets dry dock him!”
    Yup that's it lol
Wait that was her??!!
    Yup!
![gif](giphy|kcfb43I3N1GhspNQpj|downsized)
I can still hear his overly-optmistic-ass voice asking me if I want to go. I dread in-game phone calls now & had to turn that shit on Do Not Disturb mode.
    That hangout mechanic is the most annoying part of GTAIV. I’m trying to get the Liberty City (5) trophy and keep getting screwed by arriving 3 seconds late or an unskippable mission starting from a phone call and then the hangout being cancelled.
        I would say GTA5 did it better, letting you initiate hangouts on your own terms, even though you can miss some story stuff by now doing them at all.
    “hey cousin!” lives rent free in my head
        "I am too busy for the strippers , another time cousin"
    Cousin, let’s go bowling
Kate’s death was whatever she was barely a character. That’s why I like the ending where Roman dies more it hits harder and better fits the consequences of Niko’s actions
    Why did you get downvoted you're literally right Roman's character is infinitely better written and has waay more screentime so his death just hits harder and makes the ending more satisfying
        Yeah this sub hates when you even slightly criticize gta 4
            Unless you make a stupid ass bowling joke for some reason
    but … bowling …
My feelings exactly! It puts into perspective how easy it truly is to manipulate someone.

Such clever writing, I will admit.
    Yeah, I think a lot of it is that players put themselves in Niko's position and don't really see any of the red flags because they want the relationship to be authentic because they want Niko to have some happiness. Maybe we all knew deep down that she was lying but we didn't care because the idea that she wasn't was so appealing.
    I cant give Rockstar clever writing for that tbh. Its the opposite of subtle


Players simply want Niko do have a story tied partner and shes the first choice 
        That's the point. The clues are *not* subtle, but if you're invested, they go right over your head still.

It's the definition of "hiding in plain sight". Clever.
            ...no, not really
                I may have misspoken when I said "clever". I don't mean "clever" as in "no one else could write this", I just mean in a general "that was a smart move".

I hope my feelings aren't misconstrued here.

Because they could've just said from the very start of the game that she's a spy, but they don't. They want the player to develop Niko's relationship with Michelle first, but not give away the secret too soon.

Then, when the player is fully invested in Niko's relationship with Michelle, they drop the masquerade. 

That's why the clues are 100x clearer in hindsight. They were written to be subtle at first, but then much more obvious when the player revisits those moments.
Yeah, even on the second playthrough I sat there with a surprised pikachu face. (I played GTA IV when it came out, and replayed it last year)

Rockstar made something kinda great here, I think they really proved the "grey person" effect that actual agencies like CIA use. A disguise is best when she is rather, kinda uninteresting, not too attractive, but not ugly either-- gray or neutral just plays great into how most people view the world, I can't bother to remember every human or bird I see unless they have something outstanding.

She is one of the most interesting characters in the game thanks to this, but she is portrayed as this girl that I know nothing will come off.

But yeah, it was kinda easy to see the signs in hindsight.
Everyone realizes shes a fed, its indeed pretty damn obvious


But everyone also wanted Niko do be happy and i personally thought they could stay a couple despite one being a criminal and the other a fed. That would make a good ass Love Story. Thats why she won many people over


But no she throws you away like an rotten apple lol
Not to mention Niko mentions that everything in her apartment looks brand new.
Yeah IIRC the first time you hang out with her she's like "are you hanging around with dangerous people??"
An other reason not to be suspicious is that Niko just arrived in america and didn't even start criminal activities when you start dating Michelle. You don't see any reason for Niko to be spied on. Or at least I don't see any reasons, but maybe I'm missing something
    The iaa have his file of his previous criminal dealings, so when you have an illegal immigrant who gets off a boat into America, there is every reason for him to be spied on
        True. Now that you say it I remember UL paper saying this. But I find it a bit far fetched that the IAA would care about an ex soldier from Serbia working for a loanshark in his country. It's not like he was a general or something in the army, and it seems to me that he was a small criminal compared to warlord and druglord and the other kind of criminal the IAA usually deal with. And he is smuggled in the country. I get that the IAA has the means to know Niko is on their territory , but putting a spy on him the moment he gets out of the boat. I find it a bit too big to swallow. They have bigger fishes to catch and cheaper mean to spy on him imo. Anyway even if it's a plot hole, it's a tiny one.
Lol that came from Niko's core
You're thinking of Kate, Karen was Michelle. Or rather, Michelle was Karen?
    Oops my mistake. I corrected it and thanks for the heads up
If you go to that blog website you can date this rich chick named Alex. She likes Niko but their relationship is open and they have a lot of fun with eachother. Like Niko thinks she’s crazy but it’s the most he ever laughs when he’s with her. They are equally crazy in their different ways and are complete polar opposites and it’s fun to see that dynamic. She blogs about Niko after every date. And if you sleep with her she will blog about it… apparently Niko has a HOG and he stinks- which I could’ve guessed.
    If you get through enough dates with her Niko is actually willing to open up to her about his experiences in full. He gives a summary of his life, his war trauma, what he does for a living and his reason for being in Liberty City. Its actually pretty heartbreaking that she just shrugs it off as a joke, although I can't help but feel like someone as sharp as Niko might have seen it coming with how quickly he responded with his backup. 

He gets a similar experience with Kiki who pretends to understand Niko when he admits to being a criminal, but in the end just has some kind of weird control fetish for criminals, and which annoys Niko since he wants to take accountability for his actions and Kiki writes it all off as Niko being a victim of the system to play into her own savior complex.
        Kiki is nice on the surface but she’s the typical girl who thinks she can fix broken men.
Niko's lovelife absolutely sucked, even his childhood crush was the town bike according to Roman lmao
>but i thought it would turn out a Romeo and Juliet story, 2 different Camps 1 Love - sort of thing

This might be the plot of GTA 6.
Cuz she knows exactly where to put it
Let alone 12 inch one
That *is* true, it lead to a better situation for him.

Thanks for your optimism and perspective in these trying times 😭
Faustin literally says exactly what's going to happen, plus every gta game basically follows this formula
Yeah, I think Rockstar should've made it like Catalina's missions in GTA:SA where all of her dates are mandatory and they somewhat feed into the story, rather than just optional hobbies that most players would gloss over.
    Catalina my favorite female GTA character. Haha
Yeah, she came off as a bit of a twat in GTA5. Too much attitude. She was really sweet & "conscience-clear" in GTA4. She's just a bitch in GTA5
    I kind of like how it contrasts with Niko. She was an IAA asset who had to do things she wasn't proud of to get her life back (at least according to the IAA Contact who admittedly might just be manipulating Niko with that story), but instead of moving on from it like Niko does, she dives in and becomes a senior agent who loses the conscience and becomes willing to do things even Niko might give a second thought to.

Say what you will about Niko, when he's up against an innocent or unarmed person, the player generally gets a chance to spare them. He would definitely have some reservations about torturing an innocent man, and at least wouldn't be so excited to do so with a big flashlight.
        Nope niko is so far gone he definitely would, he never showed any real sort of hesitation or guilt for anything, he would just delude himself to think he did
Yep, total bitch in GTA5
Yeah, in GTA IV it seemed to me the newspaper guy had some dirt on her so he could coerce her. But in GTA V she tortures a guy without a care
    She was a fresh agent with her career in his hands. I don't blame her for doing it, but it definitely changed her.
I replayed it last year and I am mad I wasted many hours and thought I had 100% with her, which I had double checked before going to point of no return. Only to find out many missions laters it was at 99%. Really screwed up my goal to get 100%. Lol 
This is what I said in my head when the betrayal scene happened 😂 I was so angry.

"Michelle.. government prostitute.. see, it rhymes".
I dont see niko complaining before hand and calling her names? I'd rather her than a fucking hypocrite 
I feel that.

I don't think it was strange though, I also think games had much bigger impact on me as a kid.

San Andreas was the GTA game that I had that connection with. Finding out Ryder & Smoke were traitors actually made me mad. I found it exciting when I had the chance to kill Ryder & Smoke in the latter half of the game.

I guess you have a much stronger sense of nostalgia for the game now, looking back at the connections you made with the game.
    I'm glad I'm not alone in my experiences as a youth lol I always felt very personally connected to characters and stories as a kid when it came to gaming, something long-gone now as I'm well into my adulthood. I think the last game I truly felt that way with would have been RDR2, which I almost didn't even want to finish simply to avoid watching Arthur die.
Because niko is a dumb immigrant 🤐
Just like any movies, tv shows. People become invested in characters personalities etc. 
Niko's such a ladies' man 😂
I didn't know he was playing through IV, Ill have to check that out
A shell of her former self.

Or a 'chelle of her former self.. haha..
She's in GTA 5?
    The break in IAA building mission, she's the female agent in yellow suit
    She's always been in it. But she looks a little different. Also....she's not all that pretty
You aren't the only one, friend. There have been a few people in the comments saying they didn't feel anything.

I guess it differs from person to person. I've always formed strong bonds with characters like the nerd I am, but I'd also wager that it depends on how you play the game. Idk, it's just one of those unexplainable things.

But you are definitely *not* dead inside, I think it just depends on how you choose to experience the game and its story.
    I form bonds with characters too but i never really felt anything for Michelle. Never had such a bond with her.

Kate on the other hand, man, i was crushed when she died at the end. It was the hardest choice ever choosing between her and Roman. 

But i had to choose roman because he's really part of the spirit of the game. Also i could never trust Dimitri and do that deal with him. Especially that he was served to me on a gold platter.

Btw on that mission when Pegorino asks you to do the deal with Dimitri, you get two options. Either do the deal or kill Dimitri. Many people didn't know but you can ask some of your contacts if you should take the deal or not.

Roman tells you to take the deal since there's a lot of money involved and it doesn't matter if it was coming from Dimitri since maybe Dimitri changed and wants to make amends. I don't trust that.

If you call kate and tell her, she's gonna tell you not to takee the deal. Dimitri is a treacherous snake and will always be that way.

If you call lil Jacob, he's going to tell you that it's a bad idea and that it doesn't sound right. I think u can call Dwayne too, but I'm not so sure. Since Dwayne is the kind of guy who gives advice. But he's also an optional character.

So, yeah. Gta 4 was the goat.
You can still have sympathy for a character. That's how stories work. This is all fiction, none of it happened in real life.

Niko is the main protagonist of the game. You spend the entire game living vicariously through this character.

If you're fully invested in the character of Niko Bellic and the game in which his story is told, you're absolutely going to be putting yourself in his shoes and emotionally connecting yourself to the story.

It's not delusional, it's an honest reaction to a good plot twist.

If you don't have the ability to connect to stories & characters, that's not something I can teach you, my friend, or have the right to tell you that you should have it.

But to call everyone else delusional because they *do* have the ability to engage & immerse themselves into the game just makes you look worse to us than we probably do to you.
    Not you in particular,the other comments are painting a bad picture .

And also yeah I sympathise with Niko,but on the other things like being in a war,losing his friends,not being able to find his role in the world. Not because his GF he didn’t really care about was actually an Undercover Agent
    Your missing the point, I don't care about being this so called war veteran character, I don't have to be emotionally connected to him to empathise with him or not. It doesn't change that she Michelle was just doing her job, it doesn't make her a bitch for doing what she did to a criminal scumbag
        No, the entire point of the game is to live through Niko's eyes. The entire point of the game is to be a criminal scumbag. That's why you steal cars, kill innocent civilians, rob banks, etc.

You're supposed to put yourself in the shoes of a broken & morally-neutral character. If you're playing the game properly & *don't* develop any sort of connection to Niko at any capacity, then I don't know what to tell you.

And let me guess, you also don't care about CJ, Tommy, Michael, Trevor or Franklin either do you?

Because they're all scumbags and deserve what's coming to them?? Yeah, I guess you don't.

Must be a boring way to play the game if you're stuck playing as characters who are criminal scumbags.

I guess you'd prefer a game where you play as the cops instead? That way, you don't have to feel guilty about feeling sorry for the protagonist because they're not criminals.
            I'm not "supposed " to do anything, it's a video game. You can't tell people what they should do lol simple as. If I don't develop any weird emotional fanboy connection to niko then don't say anything? I don't care what you personally think through your very scewed subjective pov of niko. Why do I have to sympathise with a criminal lol? Please give me one good reason? Your totally missing the point I'm making it's not about Wether I care about a character but whether I'm forced to emotionally connect to one and no I don't, don't complicate it your acting like it's some soap opera lmao.
Scumbag because of doing her job? Yeah no
    Because Niko was going through hard times and he trusted her, and she betrayed him. If your job is more important to you than the trust of a loved one, then fine...
        How did she betray him? In case you didn't notice but she was undercover from the very beginning to investigate this illegal immigrant who came off a boat into America. If anything niko is the scumbag, he is the dude who willingly commits crimes for money no matter what and how much he tries justifying it with his bullshit past childhood garbage. Don't put this on Michelle for simply doing her job in case you forgot, it's not her fault niko can't make good decisions in his own life besides she made it way easy for niko in the end?
            She didn't help him in any way. She took what she wanted, the information + the product, and that was it.
                She got him out of serving time, she says "your just lucky I got to you first" considering all of the crimes nimo does in that game he is darn fucking lucky
Because niko isn't smart lol
Did you read the full thing? 😃
    Haha yes I did and by getting over it I meant, play a new game.... something else :)
        Ohhhh, yeah, my bad, I probably should. Thanks for the advice friend! 😄
![gif](giphy|V6twSKn6SZS133x1c7)
    Both of them are criminals. Karen does the government's illegal work including extraordinary rendition and torture.
        She is a government agent and this is before gta v, I don't think undercover work is being a criminal
            Yes, she wasn't a criminal in GTA IV, but in V she surely is - and has broken international law just like Niko.
    Oops did I make you cry 🤯
People like you really need to separate video games and real life lol
    But people actually mean what they’re saying lol. Painting Niko as a good guy and Michelle as a bad person
    But what if I mention name of Sleeping Dogs?
We’re playing as criminals, not liking cops comes with the package.
    I know
What good guys?
    Stopping criminals
        The corrupt incompetent people? Very funny.
            Still
Karen is a criminal herself - she does the government's illegal work.
    It’s not illegal
        As far as I know the CIA imprisonment and torture is only legal on foreign prisoners, Karimov is a US citizen and as far as I know the Unabomber (also US citizen) was imprisoned by the FBI and not tortured.
        Even if Karimov's torture is legal she is an evil person just like Niko working for her evil overlords evil just like Niko did in when he was in the army.
Rockstar has always made the "good guys" just bad guys who hide behind authority. It's the whole theme of the GTA franchise they're all playing cops and robbers.
Lol happens most of the time. Half of us are just there to shoot guns and drive cars that often times we tend not to listen or observe clues and when things like this happen we're taken aback. I kind of had a similar experience with farcry4 recently because I chose to do Amita missions because she simply seemed like she had better plans than Sabal who was just a religious predator. >!She then proceeded to forcefully take away all the kids of the place and forced them into the army and made it a drug state instead.!<
    See this is why you should enjoy the crab rangoon
        Its funny how I spent the whole game trying to kill the one guy who wasn't trying to kill me. Spared him at the end.
            I honestly wished I could start helping him part way into the game. I started to really dislike the two Golden Path leaders, and wanted to just hang with Pagan Min.
        My ex was Burmese, you don’t just step away from a sweet crab Rangoon
    there was supposed to be a 3rd path where you side with Pagan Min and retake all the outposts and fight for his side but Ubisoft was under a crunch
        I can kind of see why they never did it because it just makes you feel like shit and basically all your work is pointless. My canon ending is waiting for 15 fucking minutes and enjoying that crab rangoon. Its literally what most people would do IRL.
            I feel like that's kind of the point. The series kind of sticks with me as a great foil to the classic "you're a god-hero and can singlehandedly make the world better" trope. Your hard work is often for nothing, or even ends up making the situation worse than if you hadn't intervened at all, to the point that, in my head, the very title alludes to. This place is a far cry from proper civilization. It is a far cry from your comfort zone. You are a far cry from the typical hero.
    Amita was Toxic, Sabal was a nut job. But the crab rangoon was delicious.
        Pagan was a horrible man who in his old age realized how horrible of a man he had actually been. He realized that he had been a bad man from the start, and used his daughters death as an excuse to become an even more brutal tyrannical bastard. His plan since the beginning of the game was to abdicate the throne and give it to his kinda sorta step-son Ajay who he would teach to understand the truth about his mother and father, the flaws of the Golden Path, as well as the flaws of his own tyrannical rule. Amita is a monster with extremist views, Sabal is a monster with extremist views, and Pagan is a monster but he’s a monster thats self aware and wants to change. Hes a monster that could have been reasoned with if you had just sat down and enjoyed the crab rangoon. Amita and Sabal are 2 monsters who arent even self aware enough to believe they are monsters, they believe that everything they do no matter how heinous is justified by their idea of the greater good. Theyre monsters that believe they are heros and that anyone who doesnt follow their beliefs 100% is a traitor that must be deal with. Amita and Sabal are both just future Pagan Mins, just wrapped with a different flag
    Ah do love far cry 4 its called what bad ending do you want. Though I feel like the best ending honestly is when you can choose to replace the dictator but I would modify it so you change the rules to become a democracy and then set up an election to replace you.
    To be fair, choosing Sabal doesn't really give you a *better* ending, just a different but equally fucked up ending. I usually choose him because Amita kills Bhadra, but he still forces her into a life of slavery, living as a religious prop rather than a person. Amita creates a drug state, under Sabal they simply go broke instead due to his inability to evolve. Both are bad options, which is the point. Arguably the best ending is the one where you do nothing and chill with Pagan, considering the resistance you end up waging instead gets more people killed then it helps in the end. After all, surely some of those thousands of soldiers were just putting food on the table for their families.
        And there were plenty of notes and things on them that supported what you said. They were just regular dudes at the end of the day.
    Oh just a religious predator!
        He just looked like he had no bright ideas. At least in Amita's vision she had some direction and argued that they needed money somehow and she wanted to make use of the resources they had. Sabal was straight up ignorant of all that wants to continue the same path that caused them all that problems and thought religion is his only option.
    I chose sabal after Amita said she would keep the drugs
    Ahh yes, the half that are children and man children.
    Yes actually the right choice is to stay for 10 minutes in the first mission when he tells you to wait there, not to move, and to enjoy the crab rangoon. Interesting secret ending. But you have to wait exactly 10 minutes.
She also never gets drunk when you take her out.
    Yeah, I forgot to mention that one. All the other friends get noticeably drunk too, but not Michelle. Plus, Niko asks "what's up with all these questions?"

Niko also says "why do you always have to get the drinks? I feel like you're trying to slip me the Mickey" 😂
        Yeah and I think you can drive drunk or something with her
This is why gta 4 is the best gta and no one can change my mind
That's why I love GTA 4.. this story was sooo well written. I also felt soooo sorry for Niko when Michelle showed up that way 😭😭💔
    I agree.

I realy wanted to punch a hole in my screen 😭
Well... She has been asking Niko if he fought in the war so...
She reappears again in GTA 5 as well
lol yeah you fell in love with a narc’s inch deep cover persona.
Still think story wise gta4 is the goat by far. Not the cousin though.. fuck that guy..
that second playthrough is where boys became men
Oh yeah on my second playthrough everytime you go out with her it seemed so obvious. "So Michelle, what do you do for work?" "Oh don't worry about it? So Niko do you know any drugs or arms dealers? Just trying to get to know you!" Is basically how the conversations go.
I have no idea about the online heists tbh. And the torture mission was brutal! I loved it for the sheer shock value!
    [She’s in the setup for the Humane Labs raid where you meet up at the parking lot but get ambushed by the feds](https://youtu.be/JComVZSbwsY?si=GRAlKodA8bCdGkfh)

I hope she returns in GTA VI, I would love to see her in online again
        I hope we get to kill her
        So in that specific cutscene from the gta v heist you posted, does Michelle set up the player again? lol
            I think it’s more like they were ambushed without her knowing, since her bodyguard got shot and everything
        I want IAA/UL Paper guy tbh
Yes she's in the humane labs raid
i felt bad for the guy so i only waterboarded him instead of smashing his balls
    😭 nothing could prepare me for this comment.

Damn.. he really didn't have any good choices did he? 😂
        i mean i didn't want to leave him bloody and waterboarding just seemed to be the less painful it's more threatening to drown him ig
            It’s legal for a reason… 😭
I hated the torture mission. Glad it's semi-skippable
    How is it semi-skippable? You have to do it
        You can just shoot the guy as soon as you switch to Michael and that skips a lot of it
            I thought the target is randomized
                Nope, same dude every time. The dialogue is pretty humorous when you shoot him immediately, it basically amounts to Michael saying “I had a feeling that was the guy” and everyone else goes “welp we got him boys”
                    Lmao that's hilarious, I had no idea.
        If you know what the guy looks like, you can snipe him as soon as you have control of Michael. Speedrunners do it a lot.
            Wait what? I played through the game three times and never knew that 😭 atleast the torturing is fun
                wtf 😳
    One of the best GTA mission ever
This mission was prolly one of the reason why I never completed GTA 5 story mode 😞😞😯 I have killed 1000000's of NPC prolly.. but torture is something me, I can't do that. 😕😕
Yup!
*IAA
    Same thing, just censored.
        *parody
            Whatever it is it ruined the series. Hearing FBI, CIA and SWAT is far better than hearing nonsense words like FIB, IAA and the stupid NOOSE.
                Gotta have consistency of parodying company names
                Yeah I agree with this one.. and having 5 starts is not just it. FIB is just nah man.. not it for me..
                They just dont want to kill theirselves with 12 shots to the back, i see no issue with parodying it
                    No ones going to get 12 shots on the back for that lol if that was the case then most Hollywood directors and conspiracy theorists would had been dead.
Yup that's it lol
Yup!
That hangout mechanic is the most annoying part of GTAIV. I’m trying to get the Liberty City (5) trophy and keep getting screwed by arriving 3 seconds late or an unskippable mission starting from a phone call and then the hangout being cancelled.
    I would say GTA5 did it better, letting you initiate hangouts on your own terms, even though you can miss some story stuff by now doing them at all.
“hey cousin!” lives rent free in my head
    "I am too busy for the strippers , another time cousin"
Cousin, let’s go bowling
Why did you get downvoted you're literally right Roman's character is infinitely better written and has waay more screentime so his death just hits harder and makes the ending more satisfying
    Yeah this sub hates when you even slightly criticize gta 4
        Unless you make a stupid ass bowling joke for some reason
but … bowling …
Yeah, I think a lot of it is that players put themselves in Niko's position and don't really see any of the red flags because they want the relationship to be authentic because they want Niko to have some happiness. Maybe we all knew deep down that she was lying but we didn't care because the idea that she wasn't was so appealing.
I cant give Rockstar clever writing for that tbh. Its the opposite of subtle


Players simply want Niko do have a story tied partner and shes the first choice 
    That's the point. The clues are *not* subtle, but if you're invested, they go right over your head still.

It's the definition of "hiding in plain sight". Clever.
        ...no, not really
            I may have misspoken when I said "clever". I don't mean "clever" as in "no one else could write this", I just mean in a general "that was a smart move".

I hope my feelings aren't misconstrued here.

Because they could've just said from the very start of the game that she's a spy, but they don't. They want the player to develop Niko's relationship with Michelle first, but not give away the secret too soon.

Then, when the player is fully invested in Niko's relationship with Michelle, they drop the masquerade. 

That's why the clues are 100x clearer in hindsight. They were written to be subtle at first, but then much more obvious when the player revisits those moments.
The iaa have his file of his previous criminal dealings, so when you have an illegal immigrant who gets off a boat into America, there is every reason for him to be spied on
    True. Now that you say it I remember UL paper saying this. But I find it a bit far fetched that the IAA would care about an ex soldier from Serbia working for a loanshark in his country. It's not like he was a general or something in the army, and it seems to me that he was a small criminal compared to warlord and druglord and the other kind of criminal the IAA usually deal with. And he is smuggled in the country. I get that the IAA has the means to know Niko is on their territory , but putting a spy on him the moment he gets out of the boat. I find it a bit too big to swallow. They have bigger fishes to catch and cheaper mean to spy on him imo. Anyway even if it's a plot hole, it's a tiny one.
Oops my mistake. I corrected it and thanks for the heads up
If you get through enough dates with her Niko is actually willing to open up to her about his experiences in full. He gives a summary of his life, his war trauma, what he does for a living and his reason for being in Liberty City. Its actually pretty heartbreaking that she just shrugs it off as a joke, although I can't help but feel like someone as sharp as Niko might have seen it coming with how quickly he responded with his backup. 

He gets a similar experience with Kiki who pretends to understand Niko when he admits to being a criminal, but in the end just has some kind of weird control fetish for criminals, and which annoys Niko since he wants to take accountability for his actions and Kiki writes it all off as Niko being a victim of the system to play into her own savior complex.
    Kiki is nice on the surface but she’s the typical girl who thinks she can fix broken men.
Catalina my favorite female GTA character. Haha
I kind of like how it contrasts with Niko. She was an IAA asset who had to do things she wasn't proud of to get her life back (at least according to the IAA Contact who admittedly might just be manipulating Niko with that story), but instead of moving on from it like Niko does, she dives in and becomes a senior agent who loses the conscience and becomes willing to do things even Niko might give a second thought to.

Say what you will about Niko, when he's up against an innocent or unarmed person, the player generally gets a chance to spare them. He would definitely have some reservations about torturing an innocent man, and at least wouldn't be so excited to do so with a big flashlight.
    Nope niko is so far gone he definitely would, he never showed any real sort of hesitation or guilt for anything, he would just delude himself to think he did
She was a fresh agent with her career in his hands. I don't blame her for doing it, but it definitely changed her.
I'm glad I'm not alone in my experiences as a youth lol I always felt very personally connected to characters and stories as a kid when it came to gaming, something long-gone now as I'm well into my adulthood. I think the last game I truly felt that way with would have been RDR2, which I almost didn't even want to finish simply to avoid watching Arthur die.

    Its funny how I spent the whole game trying to kill the one guy who wasn't trying to kill me. Spared him at the end.
        I honestly wished I could start helping him part way into the game. I started to really dislike the two Golden Path leaders, and wanted to just hang with Pagan Min.
    My ex was Burmese, you don’t just step away from a sweet crab Rangoon
there was supposed to be a 3rd path where you side with Pagan Min and retake all the outposts and fight for his side but Ubisoft was under a crunch
    I can kind of see why they never did it because it just makes you feel like shit and basically all your work is pointless. My canon ending is waiting for 15 fucking minutes and enjoying that crab rangoon. Its literally what most people would do IRL.
        I feel like that's kind of the point. The series kind of sticks with me as a great foil to the classic "you're a god-hero and can singlehandedly make the world better" trope. Your hard work is often for nothing, or even ends up making the situation worse than if you hadn't intervened at all, to the point that, in my head, the very title alludes to. This place is a far cry from proper civilization. It is a far cry from your comfort zone. You are a far cry from the typical hero.
Amita was Toxic, Sabal was a nut job. But the crab rangoon was delicious.
    Pagan was a horrible man who in his old age realized how horrible of a man he had actually been. He realized that he had been a bad man from the start, and used his daughters death as an excuse to become an even more brutal tyrannical bastard. His plan since the beginning of the game was to abdicate the throne and give it to his kinda sorta step-son Ajay who he would teach to understand the truth about his mother and father, the flaws of the Golden Path, as well as the flaws of his own tyrannical rule. Amita is a monster with extremist views, Sabal is a monster with extremist views, and Pagan is a monster but he’s a monster thats self aware and wants to change. Hes a monster that could have been reasoned with if you had just sat down and enjoyed the crab rangoon. Amita and Sabal are 2 monsters who arent even self aware enough to believe they are monsters, they believe that everything they do no matter how heinous is justified by their idea of the greater good. Theyre monsters that believe they are heros and that anyone who doesnt follow their beliefs 100% is a traitor that must be deal with. Amita and Sabal are both just future Pagan Mins, just wrapped with a different flag
Ah do love far cry 4 its called what bad ending do you want. Though I feel like the best ending honestly is when you can choose to replace the dictator but I would modify it so you change the rules to become a democracy and then set up an election to replace you.
To be fair, choosing Sabal doesn't really give you a *better* ending, just a different but equally fucked up ending. I usually choose him because Amita kills Bhadra, but he still forces her into a life of slavery, living as a religious prop rather than a person. Amita creates a drug state, under Sabal they simply go broke instead due to his inability to evolve. Both are bad options, which is the point. Arguably the best ending is the one where you do nothing and chill with Pagan, considering the resistance you end up waging instead gets more people killed then it helps in the end. After all, surely some of those thousands of soldiers were just putting food on the table for their families.
    And there were plenty of notes and things on them that supported what you said. They were just regular dudes at the end of the day.
Oh just a religious predator!
    He just looked like he had no bright ideas. At least in Amita's vision she had some direction and argued that they needed money somehow and she wanted to make use of the resources they had. Sabal was straight up ignorant of all that wants to continue the same path that caused them all that problems and thought religion is his only option.
I chose sabal after Amita said she would keep the drugs
Ahh yes, the half that are children and man children.
Yes actually the right choice is to stay for 10 minutes in the first mission when he tells you to wait there, not to move, and to enjoy the crab rangoon. Interesting secret ending. But you have to wait exactly 10 minutes.
Yeah, I forgot to mention that one. All the other friends get noticeably drunk too, but not Michelle. Plus, Niko asks "what's up with all these questions?"

Niko also says "why do you always have to get the drinks? I feel like you're trying to slip me the Mickey" 😂
    Yeah and I think you can drive drunk or something with her
I agree.

I realy wanted to punch a hole in my screen 😭
[She’s in the setup for the Humane Labs raid where you meet up at the parking lot but get ambushed by the feds](https://youtu.be/JComVZSbwsY?si=GRAlKodA8bCdGkfh)

I hope she returns in GTA VI, I would love to see her in online again
    I hope we get to kill her
    So in that specific cutscene from the gta v heist you posted, does Michelle set up the player again? lol
        I think it’s more like they were ambushed without her knowing, since her bodyguard got shot and everything
    I want IAA/UL Paper guy tbh
😭 nothing could prepare me for this comment.

Damn.. he really didn't have any good choices did he? 😂
    i mean i didn't want to leave him bloody and waterboarding just seemed to be the less painful it's more threatening to drown him ig
        It’s legal for a reason… 😭
How is it semi-skippable? You have to do it
    You can just shoot the guy as soon as you switch to Michael and that skips a lot of it
        I thought the target is randomized
            Nope, same dude every time. The dialogue is pretty humorous when you shoot him immediately, it basically amounts to Michael saying “I had a feeling that was the guy” and everyone else goes “welp we got him boys”
                Lmao that's hilarious, I had no idea.
    If you know what the guy looks like, you can snipe him as soon as you have control of Michael. Speedrunners do it a lot.
        Wait what? I played through the game three times and never knew that 😭 atleast the torturing is fun
            wtf 😳
One of the best GTA mission ever
Same thing, just censored.
    *parody
        Whatever it is it ruined the series. Hearing FBI, CIA and SWAT is far better than hearing nonsense words like FIB, IAA and the stupid NOOSE.
            Gotta have consistency of parodying company names
            Yeah I agree with this one.. and having 5 starts is not just it. FIB is just nah man.. not it for me..
            They just dont want to kill theirselves with 12 shots to the back, i see no issue with parodying it
                No ones going to get 12 shots on the back for that lol if that was the case then most Hollywood directors and conspiracy theorists would had been dead.
I would say GTA5 did it better, letting you initiate hangouts on your own terms, even though you can miss some story stuff by now doing them at all.
"I am too busy for the strippers , another time cousin"
Yeah this sub hates when you even slightly criticize gta 4
    Unless you make a stupid ass bowling joke for some reason
That's the point. The clues are *not* subtle, but if you're invested, they go right over your head still.

It's the definition of "hiding in plain sight". Clever.
    ...no, not really
        I may have misspoken when I said "clever". I don't mean "clever" as in "no one else could write this", I just mean in a general "that was a smart move".

I hope my feelings aren't misconstrued here.

Because they could've just said from the very start of the game that she's a spy, but they don't. They want the player to develop Niko's relationship with Michelle first, but not give away the secret too soon.

Then, when the player is fully invested in Niko's relationship with Michelle, they drop the masquerade. 

That's why the clues are 100x clearer in hindsight. They were written to be subtle at first, but then much more obvious when the player revisits those moments.
True. Now that you say it I remember UL paper saying this. But I find it a bit far fetched that the IAA would care about an ex soldier from Serbia working for a loanshark in his country. It's not like he was a general or something in the army, and it seems to me that he was a small criminal compared to warlord and druglord and the other kind of criminal the IAA usually deal with. And he is smuggled in the country. I get that the IAA has the means to know Niko is on their territory , but putting a spy on him the moment he gets out of the boat. I find it a bit too big to swallow. They have bigger fishes to catch and cheaper mean to spy on him imo. Anyway even if it's a plot hole, it's a tiny one.
Kiki is nice on the surface but she’s the typical girl who thinks she can fix broken men.
Nope niko is so far gone he definitely would, he never showed any real sort of hesitation or guilt for anything, he would just delude himself to think he did
No, the entire point of the game is to live through Niko's eyes. The entire point of the game is to be a criminal scumbag. That's why you steal cars, kill innocent civilians, rob banks, etc.

You're supposed to put yourself in the shoes of a broken & morally-neutral character. If you're playing the game properly & *don't* develop any sort of connection to Niko at any capacity, then I don't know what to tell you.

And let me guess, you also don't care about CJ, Tommy, Michael, Trevor or Franklin either do you?

Because they're all scumbags and deserve what's coming to them?? Yeah, I guess you don't.

Must be a boring way to play the game if you're stuck playing as characters who are criminal scumbags.

I guess you'd prefer a game where you play as the cops instead? That way, you don't have to feel guilty about feeling sorry for the protagonist because they're not criminals.
    I'm not "supposed " to do anything, it's a video game. You can't tell people what they should do lol simple as. If I don't develop any weird emotional fanboy connection to niko then don't say anything? I don't care what you personally think through your very scewed subjective pov of niko. Why do I have to sympathise with a criminal lol? Please give me one good reason? Your totally missing the point I'm making it's not about Wether I care about a character but whether I'm forced to emotionally connect to one and no I don't, don't complicate it your acting like it's some soap opera lmao.
How did she betray him? In case you didn't notice but she was undercover from the very beginning to investigate this illegal immigrant who came off a boat into America. If anything niko is the scumbag, he is the dude who willingly commits crimes for money no matter what and how much he tries justifying it with his bullshit past childhood garbage. Don't put this on Michelle for simply doing her job in case you forgot, it's not her fault niko can't make good decisions in his own life besides she made it way easy for niko in the end?
    She didn't help him in any way. She took what she wanted, the information + the product, and that was it.
        She got him out of serving time, she says "your just lucky I got to you first" considering all of the crimes nimo does in that game he is darn fucking lucky
Ohhhh, yeah, my bad, I probably should. Thanks for the advice friend! 😄
She is a government agent and this is before gta v, I don't think undercover work is being a criminal
    Yes, she wasn't a criminal in GTA IV, but in V she surely is - and has broken international law just like Niko.
The corrupt incompetent people? Very funny.
    Still
As far as I know the CIA imprisonment and torture is only legal on foreign prisoners, Karimov is a US citizen and as far as I know the Unabomber (also US citizen) was imprisoned by the FBI and not tortured.
Even if Karimov's torture is legal she is an evil person just like Niko working for her evil overlords evil just like Niko did in when he was in the army.
Its funny how I spent the whole game trying to kill the one guy who wasn't trying to kill me. Spared him at the end.
    I honestly wished I could start helping him part way into the game. I started to really dislike the two Golden Path leaders, and wanted to just hang with Pagan Min.
My ex was Burmese, you don’t just step away from a sweet crab Rangoon
