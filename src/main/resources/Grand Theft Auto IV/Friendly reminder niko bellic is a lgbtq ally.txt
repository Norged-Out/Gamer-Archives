[[Friendly reminder niko bellic is a lgbtq ally]]





Killed six people to stop one hater 😂
    Collateral damage
        Worth it!
    They were bigots too. If you crank the volume really loud you can hear them yell some racist shit as they get hit.
    *commits mass genocide*
    Best part of gta lmao
    NOT CANON NOT CANON
I loved this. Also why does no one mention "The Ballad Of Gay Tony"?
    Bro, Gay Tony is probably the best gay character in a videogame.
        No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. That could've and probably was sort of "woke" to people back then. Rockstar has always been progressive or least made jokes about it is all my point was.
            People bring up Gay Tony in these conversations constantly idk where you been lol Reni from VCS too
                Haven't seen it brought up myself. Sorry I don't share your experiences.

Edit:Thank you for not getting shitty with me I'm sorry that I did initially. The holidays are a real ball buster but no excuses for me to get shitty with people.
                    People post it in the GTA subs a lot, dw not everybody can be ~~terminally online~~ cool like me lol
                        Wholesome encounter
                    Hope you’re doing okay mate
                And Asuka and Maria...

MARIA: Asuka and I are gonna have to talk, uh, why don't you go cruise around?  


MARIA: Oh, Asuka, you've got a massager!ASUKA: That's not a massager.

ASUKA: It's my handsome handyman! Maria's all tied up at the moment, but I'll tell her you called.  
MARIA: (Offscreen) Who's that, Asuka? You know, I've been a naughty girl, but I really need to pee, OK?

ASUKA: A reporter has been nosing around. Maria and I have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur...
                    They're teenagers
                But but but... Reni was born a woman who transitioned into a man, and then later became a woman, then transitioned once again into a man, before finally settling in to become a woman.
                I remember that game. The movie missions were actually quite fun.
            Rockstars a bit like Southpark, they make fun of everyone.
            Because no one really cared when it came out, they only get mad cus politicians have whipped them up into a frenzy over it.
            >No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. 

It doesn't work with their narrative. But also, "History Repeats itself" I was a teenager at this, I remember specifically the announcement of "Ballad of Gay Tony" being met with "PC" and Gay agenda and equivalent of what woke was back then. 

The reason it didn't pick up steam back then was because Those type of people were generally the proper weirdos. No one took those guys serious. So they complained to no one. Nowadays your average Joe is on that "Anti Woke Hivemind". It was a lot more discreet, but it was still there.

I remember a random conspiracy that we were going to play a Gay Latino Domincan Lover who's name is gay Tony. The conspiracies were just as silly as now, But it was kept in the basement of the internet.
            People brought it up back then but you’re right that for some reason, people seem to have way more reactionary takes nowadays. Somehow we are going backwards
                Seeing people get mad over Wolfenstein II and Far Cry 5 for being anti-Nazi, and anti-Christian Fascist Cult was pretty weird at the time. Seems to have been the tipping point from ordinary angry neckbeards, to rampage killer neckbeards.
                I agree with this sentiment. This is basically what I mean ☝️
            The woke panic is recent culture war bullshit from some American conservatives.  
Now they use the word “woke” in place of something they don't like. 
LGBT people, sexy women twerking, Black people, different body types in a game, etc everything is woke nowadays. 

It became a clown show.
            Woke is just the new term to describe people who want everyone to have the same personal freedoms as anyone else, there has always been haters who bashed the tolerant, but up until recently the bashers used to get away with killing "woke" people for defending others rights, the anti woke peeps are really pissed they can't take out their rage legally anymore.
            Nobody brings up any media prior to 2016 for "wok" 

At all.  Ever.  Isn't that strange?  What happened in 2016? 🤔
                2016 Presidential election, and it was one of the first campaigns that took advantage of social media to take advantage of the populace. Unfortunately, it opened up a Pandora's box that led to people getting mad over shit like this.
                Are you having a stroke? I don't understand your comment. Who mentioned woks?
                    On the off chance that you’re not joking, he missed the e in woke
            Because wokeness simply wasn’t an issue back then, or, not the type of issue it is today, or, not out in the open and in your face at all times type of issue. 2008 was a different world.
                They just didn’t call it “woke” yet.
                    Shout out to the "gay agenda".
                    Member when people complained about things being politically correct? I member
                They didn't use that term, but people were definitely complaining about "political correctness gone mad" and "the gay agenda" back then as well.

It's still the same niche group of screaming idiots, but the algorithms of the current web just makes sure the outrage spreads faster and wider than ever before these days.
                    I’m sure you’re right. I was 12 when GTA IV came out so was mostly unaware. I agree about the algorithms. Go out into the world and you may here about all that shit once in a blue moon. It’s really an internet thing.
            How dare Rockstar not be racist homophobic assholes!!
        Love tony. Bringing him to the GTA V nightclub scene was a great addition. I feel like him and Lonz or whatever his name is being the life to it haha
        Tony... you ARE this town
        One of the best DLCs of all time. Better than Lost and Dammed.
    Brooo I forgot about Gay Tony. One of the best GTA characters ever.
    And in GTAV, the immigration vigilantes. “Weazel News, confirming your prejudices?” Do they really think it’s parodying CNN?
        People actually do. I got an "anti-woke" co-worker that said Weazel News was making fun of CNN and MSNBC because "leftist are the most prejudice people." According to him.
            They really couldn’t get the reference from Weasel to Fox? It’s really not _that subtle.
                Those people have no media literacy.
    Luis is the closest LGBTQ ally. Having worked with Tony, he doesn't have problems with them and even helped several gay characters. He sees Tony as a business partner and the father he never had. The only gay dude he disliked is Evan Moss viewing him as a selfish "parasite" who is only interested in Tony's money and for getting Tony addicted to drugs.
    Yusuf amir was the wokeist of all woke characters if i remember correctly
        "WHAT'S UP MY NI**AS!"
    I got mad after I popped it in to discover I was playing yet another quite reserved tough guy instead of the gay dude, I had just played through TLAD, and was looking for something else.
    Definitely not a great example to use if you are trying to argue for gta having always been woke

Some of the missions in GTA 4 are hella fun than others gta games
    They put a lot of work into scripting these chase missions too, but most players probably never saw much of them because you can just shoot the guy you're chasing a few seconds after they start.
        My fav one was that one mission where niko was on the top of the truck (can’t remember the name of the mission)
            The one in Albany where Chinese mobsters are shipping drugs?  That's a great mission.

People say GTA IV has a lot of filler missions but I think it makes sense.  Niko is an illegal immigrant who is unfortunately thrust into a bad situation due to the lies of his cousin and only supporter in America.  He has to take odd jobs from the only contacts he has.

Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.
                >Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.


Out of all the GTA games, IV is the only one I can consistently play as peacefully and as Niko the person, drive slow and safe, drive Roman's car for spare cash, just trying to grind it like Niko is. 


And I see this as a reason. Niko is a true outsider with honest principles who is just as weirded out by IV's world as we can be. But he knows how to roll with it, he knows how to play by the rules and doesn't stray from his beliefs. I mean, he wakes up tied to a chair in a basement of a Russian mob boss and gleefully admits he killed Vlad because he was an asshole. He dossn't give a shit about the threat level his intended target may represent, he only cares if you're alright with his principles.
                That mission was honestly kinda goofy to me because the truck moves slow asf, but I missed it when you're supposed to get on and traffic doesn't spawn so I ended up chasing it for like 10 minutes lmao
                I actually liked that one because of how hard it was. So was the one where you got into a shootout with police after trying to get drugs back or something
            Truck Hustle
            Oh yeah that one fucks.
        Yeah there’s so many neat voice lines and tidbits in GTA IV that you miss if you kill the target right away. If you keep chasing this guy that attacks Bernie Crane for long enough, he eventually starts to get scared, tries to justify his hatred and begs for his life, he was just hiding his bigotry behind a tough guy facade the whole time.
        they really did! the motorcycle chase missions were really difficult cause bystanders were constantly getting in the way and trains were right on cue to be a hazard if you weren't careful.
    ![gif](giphy|8YsjVmpIpEjNKlrL3D)
    Tbh even the simple shootout missions, particularly the ones in the hotel and the apartment complex is fun for me, really scratch my action movies type itch
    GTA V had more variety, but it’s underrated how GTA IV makes doing the same three missions still fun
    Wut?
    GTA IV missions are not fun and repetitive as all hell.
        Skill issue
Heh, they're both on Faggios during the bike chase
    [deleted]
        It's about as subtle as a bat to a homophobe's kneecaps lol
            My kneecaps hurt
    I'm wondering whether they'll change the name of those or not for the next game.
        Doubt it
    Oh shit that's actually really funny
Called dude his friend.

Just steps on him in pursuit of the bigot.
    Niko is such a devoted ally he'll run down any man, woman, child, homosexual, transexual, or queer person that gets in the way of violently murdering a bigot with a machine gun!
        He’s a man of peace…
            Just like Tim from Exploder: Evacuator Part II?
                You taught me baseball. And how to laugh!
                    *He would have made a fine American! I'll cry when I'm done killin...*
                        Probably one of my top 10 3D universe radio ads.

“I wanna raise a family!”

“That’s just it, Tim! They’ve got your family!”

#”NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
                            "Tim, they've got your wife!"

"But I'm not married!"

"You are now... to America!"
                                I can hear it verbatim in my head.

Just like the entire 90 minute runtime of Vice City Public Radio.
    >bigot

Hater
One more reason to like Niko
    Common niko W
    If you like niko so much why don't you go bowling with him?
        I always ask him but then he calls back 2 minutes after agreeing saying “another time”, but can’t be too mad at least he agrees before before turning me down, and he’s always calling me when his car breaks down for 2 seconds.
        That's Roman's job
    I mean he’s a fun character but damn man he helped that crazy abuser and the serial killer. Between you and me, I’ve seen him murder people and go onto “Littlelacysurprisepageant.com” a little too often.
Despite being a cold blooded killer, Niko was surprisingly a compassionate man. 

Very interesting and complex character lol.
    Imagine all of the non cold blooded killers who are surprisingly not compassionate
Niko: you hurt my friend! I'm coming after you!

*\*continues to run over and shoot pedestrians in the process\**

Gotta love GTA logic.
[deleted]
    Also he was Niko's friend. You can see that Niko doesn't really understand Florian's choices, but he won't forget about his old friend.
    Being decent is "woke communist propaganda" to some

    Exactly
        [deleted]
            >Pandering to an agenda for no other reason than to get brownie points doesn't impress me. Rockstar wasn't doing that here. Florian happened to be gay. He wasn't gay to fill a quota. That's the right way to do it.

The problem is that people on the internet aren't very consistent with this point of view. Most the time instead it devolves into "if I like it, it's not woke" and "if I don't like it, it's woke" nonsense.
                Those people couldn’t even define Woke without having multiple come up with different definitions and then fall into anarchy over which version of Woke is correct.
                    thats the part that people always overlook man its just a buzz word at this point lmao
                        I think Big Joel's definition is the most accurate: "woke is anything that Liberals believe"
            If this mission appeared in GTA VI it would be labeled woke and "pandering"
            Name a single example of a character that was "gay to fill a quota" in any media.  I'll wait.

                                    Just do the fucking google search already
    Woke is just a word racists/homophobes like to use instead of just saying they are racist or homophobic
        This is how a hardcore leftist would define woke. It's just as ridiculous as hardcore right wingers who are obsessed with throwing the word around
            Nope. I’m not a hardcore left or right. Both sides are equally dumb.
    I mean generally being woke just means understanding context in the world and being a decent person.
        This is what it originally meant and was a compliment until it got co-opted by certain communities and it suddenly became a bad thing.
        Taken in its original AAVE form, I don't consider being "woke" to be a bad thing. Unfortunately, it has been divorced from that context and now serves as a boogeyman and is now used as shorthand for "anything conservatives don't like."
        It means being overtly vocal of social issues to the point of ad nauseum and at the sacrifice of artistic integrity.
            i.e, most movies nowadays that put being 'politically correct'  in front of the actual plot
    [deleted]
    Tell that to literally any right wing podcaster or YouTuber and they’ll disagree with you strongly
Wait until they learn there’s a DLC where you play as a Latino that has an homosexual business partner
    Wait till they learn you play as a Jewish man whose best friend is a black dude
        Vice City 1?
            Nah the lost and damned dlc for GTA 4. Johnny klebitz and his best biker friend (forgot his name)
                Jim!
gta 4 is so comical yet so dark at the same time
Chances are, these people never played V's single player either, the one where you play as a black man, a man with depression and a man with many mental illnesses
    plus said main with mental illnesses wears a dress when you switch to him sometimes and has canonically boned men too
People also forget all  about things like *Republican Space Rangers*

He trampled his friend
All the homies know niko is the best.
The fact the scooter is called Faggio makes it equal opportunity
Same people saying 

“It sucks that Rage Against the Machine got all political”
I always thought it was weird that Bernie couldn't handle this guy on his own, considering he and Niko have the same military combat training and all.
    Bernie either completely forgoes his military training in order to forget the terrible past that he had to let go, with his childhood friends being betrayed by one of them. Or he's just weak.
    Niko was a child conscript, I think people really overestimate his combat training based on Brucie's throwaway "Red Army shit" lines lol
        Yeah he has a lot of unexplained skills that Rockstar likes to write off as "cause he was in the military broo" such as flying helicopters and proficiency with a sniper. They don't teach you all that in the military, especially not in 90s Serbia lol.
        Niko literally manhandles everyone in hand to hand combat in the cutscenes. It’s not an overestimation it’s a fact that he has amazing combat skills
[deleted]
    Were some fragile kids mad about Nikko being an ally?
        Yes, because they’re edgelords that hate on others to feel like they have a purpose
            [deleted]
                What?
Honestly what's with this "hating the woke" in GTA VI? Vice City literally had some stuffs there,San Andreas too,that Vago guy...GTA had these forever,we even use Niko to be Gay,and he didn't have that much hesitation. GTA VI seems pretty "GTA" to me,totally captures the vibe of Florida and Vice City(just modernised) ...people need to get some sleep instead of sitting on a chair,drinking coffee all night with the lights off and commenting on banning GTA VI!
Niko regrets having dated and killed French Tom because Brucie told him to  now he’s an lgbtq ally or something like that lol
    "Niko, wanna go on a date?"

"Eh..."

"Come on, whats wrong with you?"

"Okay, who is she?"

"That's the thing, its a guy."

"Faak yu."
        His Lovemeet bio though...

"I am a vulnerable guy who needs to be held with big strong arms."
            "i knew we should have made him a giver, Brucie!"
    Brucie's closeted back story is hilarious.
*immediately mows down an innocent pedestrian*
The people that complain about GTAs subject matter (woke or not) are and have always been people who have never played the games.
    For real. They try so hard to nitpick things and look so deep into it to divide people. It’s just satirical humor of rockstar and they will make fun of anyone and anything
Who's complaining? I've seen tons of these memes but not a single person saying "i don't like it bc woman".
    Go to twitter 

Shits wild
        Twitter isnt “people”. They are mindless drones and should just be ignored. I’m so tired of the woke not woke bullshit, who fucking cares it’s a video game lol
            Calling them people is a stretch. I doubt that people complaining about “woke” things are human
                Sorry meant to put isn’t lol, and I’ve def complained about shit being “woke” but to me that’s just a term for a situation where I feel a political or social ideology is being shoved down my throat
                    I understand that but people complaining about it towards rockstar is ridiculous
                        100% people love to bitch and moan, and they are still gonna be buying it on release day
        get off Twitter

Shits wild
        > Go to twitter

no
    Go to YouTube. That's why you found one that is a breathing living meat.
Rockstar has always been pretty progressive, which is why it was funny when everybody started crying that GTAVI was going to be "woke."
    The whole series is a caricature of what’s wrong with the US, is super progressive and makes fun of the cons/right.  
The fact that so many cons/right people think it’s anti woke is just the cherry on top.
        Most people on either side of the political spectrum don't care or think gta is woke. Just because some journalists cherry picked some random twitter trolls that complained doesn't mean theres this vast amount of people that feel that way.
        Gta has never been "super progressive"
    I'm looking forward to what they'll have on Weasel News this time.
Disingenuous because Bernie isn't just some guy; Niko and him fought in the war together. 

That far outweighs Niko being an " LGBT ally".
    IIRC he also mentions somewhere in the game people should be left alone if they are happy with who they are or something like that, like don't attack people for being happy with themselves.
        I think it's also in one of Bernie's missions.
Kills 5 gay pedestrians on the way to kick bigots ass
Based
Niko LGBT ally
Well, Bernie/Florian was a parody of sterotypical gay guy from 2000s.
    Bernie's lover, Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins, is a parody of conservative politicians who claim to support family values and criticizing homosexuality but are actually closet homosexuals
    he's a stereotypical gay guy to YOU he's just any other gay guy to me, a gay guy
Yet another reason niko is one of my favourite protagonists in gta
So are Franklin and Trevor.
    Trevor will fuck anything alive or not so he's beyond pansexuality

franklin i seem him as a chill passive ally

he won't go to any parade but stills doesn't care about your sexuality 

if yo come out as gay to him he'd be like

"yeah ok i respect it"
gta was always woke
If GTA IV came out now people would complain that the depiction of Bernie is stereotypical.
\*bonk\*
Florian and bell were supposed to be friends like Roman, Jacob, Dwayne, packie and Brucie
Imma need a source on the music urgently pls
    Doom Eternal OST - The only thing they fear is you
        Thank you for this cuz I was fuckin GROOVING to that shit

People will make up a problem and then bitch about said problem. Only thing woke is me during the week when I'm running late for work!
I'm going to kick the shit out of you! "Paints his body with bullets."
I forgot how much Russia loves the lgbt community.
Niko was the best GTA protagonist. A tough, loyal, hardworking no-nonsense eastern European dude
that's not even being woke that's just standing up for your friend
I had no idea that defending your friend who just happens to be gay could make you an ally to multiple groups of people.
🔥🔥🔥
This mission was honestly dope. I’d love to chase down homophobes on motor scooters in real life.
GTA IV was the best IMHO. Cockstar, please do something similar once again.
That wasn't woke, that would never make it to actually woke game that pushes agendas on you.
    Hold on lemme put on my reactionary mask for a sec: This woke lgtvq game is forcing me to defend a gay person where is the personal freedom in that huh? i barely even know this guy! woke!
    https://youtu.be/DjyPqell7b0?si=H_AcVPu3L62tFOBV
Niko threw the first brick at stonewall actually
Niko would say trans rights
Bro imagine the outcry if gta san andreas was released today lmfao
A+ soundtrack
Those two committed all kinds of war crimes together. Why wouldn’t niko have his back no matter who he sleeps with?
Gta IV and its DLCs had some pretty progressive stuff but they also had a lot of F-bombs and N-words thrown around. Whether or not you think the latter was OK or not, GTA VI definitely has room to be more "woke", for good or for bad.
How the hell can a trailer b woke?
Omg I haven’t played this game since the first year it was released. I don’t remember the graphics looking this primitive OMG!!! lol
"ehghghg keep politics out of my games" gta literally being a social critique:  
ballad of gay tony being a fucking banger:
How about Bully and the fact that Jimmy Hopkins could kiss girls and boys? Or the fact that you can see other adults holding hands with the same sex throughout the town?
Song?
> Take down the Hater.

I feel attacked
Man if GTA VI were to have a mission where you defend a gay guy from a homophobe we would never hear the fucking end of it.
    we had that in TBoGT and nobody gave a shit. the  teenage snowflake homophobes were probably too young to have played through it though
I wouldn't say it's woke. It's just targeted at todays audience, much like GTA 3 was targeted at a 90s audience. It frustrates me when people call it "too woke"; I'd like to hear those people argue that a game based on the 80s should feature relationships between men and children because that's what 'happened back then'.
memories..
Icon. Thank you Niko.
I think there is a BIG difference in being an understading, rational peson and being woke. 

In this clip Niko is defending his friend from physical violence caused by homophobia. He's not parading the fact that he's gay throughout the streets.
What on Earth did people see in the GTA 6 trailer to make them say the game is "woke." did we watch the same trailer? Because the one I saw was ratchet AF lol
    Well yes exactly. Ratchet=woke. They know a large percentage of their base is black so they pander to that. That’s why half the npc’s are going to be black. Racists are actually going to love it because that’s a lot of target practice!
        I love how gta6 having some black people in Miami is woke…
Yet San Andreas: a game with an entire black cast, is ignored. They pretend it doesn’t exist 😂
            Maybe they didn’t play it because none of the other games are like that. Miami is only 15% black yet most of the people in the trailer were black. One can argue that it’s woke for purposefully doing that. And all the white people are very trashy. So I can understand why some are upset however, it’s a parody so they can get over it. It was created by two British guys who have capitalized tremendously on their, presumably, disdain for America lol
I love that mission and the ballad of gay Tony was an awesome fucking game.  GTA has always been progressive and inclusive.
    Yeah people sleep on the two dlcs to much, they were masterpieces. So glad to see stuff from tbogt in gta online.
This is the least woke game on the market 😂
I want to like this game SO badly but that camera while you’re driving doesn’t allow me to do so
    skill issue?
        Definitely
        Naw just not trying to constantly re center the camera the entire time I play

You probably never played Spintire/Mudrunner/Snowrunner
    You get used to it pretty quickly but it really threw me off too lol

Yeah I was talking to my brother about this the other day. Glad other people realize.
Why is he so attractive to me all of a sudden

    You mean before right wing media told you to be mad about it.
Niko protecting his friend and not caring about him being gay isn't woke, that's just basic decency. And the guy's whole character is joking on being gay, not exactly "woke"
    It’s extremely woke. Gay is woke. Period.

And you’re a fraud for accepting it back then, but not today.
Either you’re okay with gay people in your media, or you’re not. Stop fence sitting.
        Being gay is not “woke” gay marriage has been legal in the states for a while now. It’s not like this game was made in the 50’s where it would be considered progressive or something. And again, the character is a joke he’s meant to be funny and laughed at. This isn’t that supportive of the cause of being gay, it’s just that being an asshole and hating on gay people is not right. That’s all this clip says. If you think the bare minimum that it’s okay to laugh at someone being gay but not to attack them or call them slurs is “woke” you have lost all meaning.
            Gay marriage hasn’t even been legal for 20 years.
So stopping someone from beating someone else because they’re gay makes you an ally now?
    The mere fact niko is friends with him and not calling him a slur makes him an ally in my books
I don’t care… just leave the kids alone.
    What do you mean
        I wonder if they are afraid of drag queens
That "we are women, hear out cry!" Walk thing in gta 5 was pretty anti-feminist.
This is not woke wtf, Bernie being gay was the entire joke
    How is Bernie being gay the joke?
        He was a soldier in Niko’s unit and he’s searching for him for the first half of the game. Based on Niko’s personality and the tone of the story the player would likely assume Florian to be a similar hardened soldier, they would never guess him to be the way he is. That is where the humour comes from

Nothing to say back u/UnjustNation ? I know you were expecting something to get all offended by
    He ain't portrayed as a bad person for it tho, and also Niko accepts his new identity if you don't kill Darko
        Yeah but none of that is woke at all it’s clear Rockstar’s whole goal was humour not some representation politics
            It's clear the goal was, who cares if someone is gay it isn't a reason to treat them any different
Who fucking cares. Just don’t get preachy
    Why, people should preach important topics, if done tastefully.
He’s standing up for his friend. I wouldn’t label niko as an lgbt ally since he doesn’t understand bernie’s decisions and gta is neither a woke or anti-woke game. It makes satirical jokes on both left wing and right wing extremists. I think it’s a good mission to show that even if niko is the opposite of Bernie and doesn’t understand or agree with his choices, he still stands up for him because people shouldn’t hate each other for the way they live

        Where do I call him homophobic? Can you even read? Reading is pretty simple, actually. You should learn how to.
            [removed]
Don’t misinterpret or gaslight, activist sh_t. Niko was defending his **friend.**

**People** are….. friends, spouses, lovers, acquaintances, brothers, sisters, parents. Got it?
I like the fact that Niko says he will beat the guy up then proceeds to chase him on a bike around the city and shoot him.

I think Niko misunderstood the definition of beating someone up 😂
    He beat him up. With bullets.
LMFAO THE FUCKING HAT

If this is what people mean by woke I don't care, the mere inclusion of characters that aren't straight white dudes doesn't bother me and I don't think it bothers most people, but in GTA 6 the idea that an attractive woman like Lucia would turn to a life of crime in which she wouldn't only survive, but thrive in is forced as hell and it's annoying when it's done for the sake of catering to delusional people's notions of gender equality. Nobody is pissed off just because there's a female character, it's just such an unlikely character to come across given the circumstances.
Also, the way GTA IV portrayed a gay man is a bit stereotypical, like yeah, gay men all have feminine personalities and are eccentric, they're not like most men out there /s.
They did the same with Catalina in GTA 3 so maybe GTA was "woke" all along. I just hope Lucia isn't gonna be the token strong female character and she will have some depth. 
I wish all these people shaming people for not liking the idea of a female lead character in a gta game would at least consider the other side's point of view instead of acting like zealots.
    You just admitted to GTA 3 being woke.
Yet you love that game. 
What’s the issue with gta 6 then???? 
Youve changed. You’ve been brainwashed into thinking “white men” is the only acceptable form of media 


Where was your complaints in GTA 1? That allowed you to play as 4 diverse women? 
Where was your bitching with gta San Andreas? An all black cast. 


You’ve lost your damn mind dude.
        Dude are you on drugs right now or something? Yes I liked gta 3 and san andreas and no I don't think "white men are the only form of acceptable media" whatever that means lmao. It's funny you say that I'm brainwashed and lost my mind when you follow the same trend of hating on everyone who doesn't like Lucia and making assumptions that make no sense.
            You just wrote an entire book about how woke GTA6 is gonna be, JUST BECAUSE THERES A WOMAN IN IT! 

You haven’t even played the game yet! You got a simple 90 trailer and you’re already freaking out
                I didn't though, you didn't even read what I wrote. The reason I wrote so much isn't because of Lucia, it's because it annoys me at this point everybody on this sub bashes anybody that doesn't like Lucia. I think "woke" is a stupid and vague term anyway which is what I said. We didn't play the game, but we already know she's the main character and we all know what gta characters do. But she might be well written, I'm not saying and I didn't say GTA 6 is gonna be bad. You just read 1 or 2 sentences and assumed the rest lol

>Some of us just want to play the game we have waited a decade for without political messaging.

Ah yes, keep those nasty politics out of my game which consists entirely of a social critique of America. Gotta be able to mindlessly run people over without hearing about lgbtq folk existing, that "political stuff" that concerns you so much.

    Isn’t the woke movement a bunch of people crying because you’re offended by everything? Isn’t that what activism is? Public displays of crybaby? News flash, democrats are evil, and have zero chance of winning an election anytime soon. Your woke dystopia is coming to an end. America is the LEAST oppressive country in the world. How about…..you cry some more
    Be respectful of other users, do NOT insult or harass others. Racism, homophobia, transphobia, or hate speech of any kind is zero tolerance and will be met with a swift ban. Witch-hunting or targeting of specific users will also not be tolerated.
I like the mission title “take down the hater”
Honestly, I don’t think I’ve seen the chuds call GTAVI woke *yet*.
That’s not “woke” tho.  That’s just standing up for someone being harassed.  That’s not what Woke is. 

2023 rockstar wound NOT have them run like that.  And would be too scared to use the F word. 

They are too scared to offend protected classes.  They even updated old content to remove anything that may offend the protected classes.

    Humans progressing socially really is a problem for your kind. Odd.
woke is pushing your ideology to others, in school, education, women's sports and etc. you guys remove Christianity from school and even Christians accepted but now you guys pushing your ideology into kids and going against anyone who doesn't agree with your ideology. I believe LGBTQ is a sin, but if I saw them getting bullied, will stand up for them anyway, because I'll agree to disagree.
niko is a proud ally.
Yea but in 2008 we were still 100% Man and now idfk!!!!
It is woke

I dunno people don’t like gta4 because of this character, they say it’s too homophobic
What if the bat was just some guy misgendering him and Niko is actually a black pregnant woman that calls 5 of her girl friends to come twerk him to death while yelling about the patriarchy? Thats not far off from what happens in bad woke TV which is what people mean when they say woke.
    Was Lucia beating a guy misgendering someone with the power of twerk and pregnant minorities in the trailers?
        Of course not. GTA6 is gonna slap hard. Just that this isnt really an example of woke degradation. Back then it was gonzo violence humor that will still be in GTA in the future.
Well, Serbia and Greece have good relations IRL I guess...
He only helped him to get his help
bro actively tried to shoot and run over everyone 😭😭
Good guy Niko.
They just removed the Sewercide feature from the game, that's beyond woke... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) it's a game guys
    The suicide option is still there. It’s been moved in the pause menu.
My fav.
Go Niko Go
I should really replay gta4
I find it hard to believe Bernie never talked to Gay Tony
Niko will always be the best GTA protagonist.
Funny little fact. It's probably a coincidence, but in greek "φλωρος" (Floros) means a weak or scared man, a wimp, and is slang for "sissy". And they named the dude "Florian"
I literally brought up this exact point to my friend earlier using the same example. Crazy how you posted this on the same day.
Wait so Rockstar has a female protagonist and that’s “woke”? Despite Tomb Raider being one of the  forefathers  of 3rd person shooters?

YEAAAH!! GET HIM NIKO!
Of course.  Niko had seen real hardships in his life.  Identity politics doesn't hit so hard when you're used to things being life or death situations.  Just let people be people and treat them according to how they treat you.
Niko killed that guy because he attacked Florian, not because he saw him punching down on a gay guy but because he punched down on one of Niko’s oldest friends from the war.
Meanwhile, The Ballad of Gay Tony, just being one of the greatest pieces of DLC of all time.
mfw when there an entire dlc about gay tony
niko GIGACHAD
There is nothing woke about protecting your friend/ex-comrade
Everything’s better with Doom tracks
Niko is the best of us
The entire  point of every GTA game is to be one giant commentary on America’s perception of itself vs it’s actuality.
No cops at pride, only Niko Bellic
Trevor would beat people up for being anti LGBTQ lol
Anybody who has ever played the story and watched the full cutscenes would know that all GTAs ( never played 1&2) mostly respect progressive ideologies. 

Only media illiterate people would not be able to see that.
It makes sense too. Rockstar mostly hires college educated people which is a demographic that tends to lean left.
Watching this makes me want to play this wonderful game again.
And Trevor will fuck anything including men
Why luigi is gta games
Just further proves every idiot that complains of Wokeness, they haven’t a clue what it means, when really it’s a dogwhistle for “anything I hate and makes me uncomfortable”
I haven't heard anyone complain about GTA 6 being woke, except for people complaining that people are complaining about GTA 6 being woke. I follow a lot of right wing people and pages on X (formerly Twitter) and I haven't seen any of them say that GTA 6 is woke.
Except he didn't kill the guy because his friend was gay. Nico killed him because it's his friend.
Niko hands down the best GTA main character ever. We need another slavic foreigner fr, lol. I just love their accents.
Also Franklin is too. When he’s talking to the paparazzi guy for the first time he tells the guy “Who gives a fuck if he’s gay or not man, the man is not married, it’s his fucking business. Leave motherfuckers alone.”
Except the concept of “woke”, has really gone too far. Both sides are super extreme now lol.
Collateral damage
    Worth it!
They were bigots too. If you crank the volume really loud you can hear them yell some racist shit as they get hit.
*commits mass genocide*
Best part of gta lmao
NOT CANON NOT CANON
Bro, Gay Tony is probably the best gay character in a videogame.
    No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. That could've and probably was sort of "woke" to people back then. Rockstar has always been progressive or least made jokes about it is all my point was.
        People bring up Gay Tony in these conversations constantly idk where you been lol Reni from VCS too
            Haven't seen it brought up myself. Sorry I don't share your experiences.

Edit:Thank you for not getting shitty with me I'm sorry that I did initially. The holidays are a real ball buster but no excuses for me to get shitty with people.
                People post it in the GTA subs a lot, dw not everybody can be ~~terminally online~~ cool like me lol
                    Wholesome encounter
                Hope you’re doing okay mate
            And Asuka and Maria...

MARIA: Asuka and I are gonna have to talk, uh, why don't you go cruise around?  


MARIA: Oh, Asuka, you've got a massager!ASUKA: That's not a massager.

ASUKA: It's my handsome handyman! Maria's all tied up at the moment, but I'll tell her you called.  
MARIA: (Offscreen) Who's that, Asuka? You know, I've been a naughty girl, but I really need to pee, OK?

ASUKA: A reporter has been nosing around. Maria and I have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur...
                They're teenagers
            But but but... Reni was born a woman who transitioned into a man, and then later became a woman, then transitioned once again into a man, before finally settling in to become a woman.
            I remember that game. The movie missions were actually quite fun.
        Rockstars a bit like Southpark, they make fun of everyone.
        Because no one really cared when it came out, they only get mad cus politicians have whipped them up into a frenzy over it.
        >No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. 

It doesn't work with their narrative. But also, "History Repeats itself" I was a teenager at this, I remember specifically the announcement of "Ballad of Gay Tony" being met with "PC" and Gay agenda and equivalent of what woke was back then. 

The reason it didn't pick up steam back then was because Those type of people were generally the proper weirdos. No one took those guys serious. So they complained to no one. Nowadays your average Joe is on that "Anti Woke Hivemind". It was a lot more discreet, but it was still there.

I remember a random conspiracy that we were going to play a Gay Latino Domincan Lover who's name is gay Tony. The conspiracies were just as silly as now, But it was kept in the basement of the internet.
        People brought it up back then but you’re right that for some reason, people seem to have way more reactionary takes nowadays. Somehow we are going backwards
            Seeing people get mad over Wolfenstein II and Far Cry 5 for being anti-Nazi, and anti-Christian Fascist Cult was pretty weird at the time. Seems to have been the tipping point from ordinary angry neckbeards, to rampage killer neckbeards.
            I agree with this sentiment. This is basically what I mean ☝️
        The woke panic is recent culture war bullshit from some American conservatives.  
Now they use the word “woke” in place of something they don't like. 
LGBT people, sexy women twerking, Black people, different body types in a game, etc everything is woke nowadays. 

It became a clown show.
        Woke is just the new term to describe people who want everyone to have the same personal freedoms as anyone else, there has always been haters who bashed the tolerant, but up until recently the bashers used to get away with killing "woke" people for defending others rights, the anti woke peeps are really pissed they can't take out their rage legally anymore.
        Nobody brings up any media prior to 2016 for "wok" 

At all.  Ever.  Isn't that strange?  What happened in 2016? 🤔
            2016 Presidential election, and it was one of the first campaigns that took advantage of social media to take advantage of the populace. Unfortunately, it opened up a Pandora's box that led to people getting mad over shit like this.
            Are you having a stroke? I don't understand your comment. Who mentioned woks?
                On the off chance that you’re not joking, he missed the e in woke
        Because wokeness simply wasn’t an issue back then, or, not the type of issue it is today, or, not out in the open and in your face at all times type of issue. 2008 was a different world.
            They just didn’t call it “woke” yet.
                Shout out to the "gay agenda".
                Member when people complained about things being politically correct? I member
            They didn't use that term, but people were definitely complaining about "political correctness gone mad" and "the gay agenda" back then as well.

It's still the same niche group of screaming idiots, but the algorithms of the current web just makes sure the outrage spreads faster and wider than ever before these days.
                I’m sure you’re right. I was 12 when GTA IV came out so was mostly unaware. I agree about the algorithms. Go out into the world and you may here about all that shit once in a blue moon. It’s really an internet thing.
        How dare Rockstar not be racist homophobic assholes!!
    Love tony. Bringing him to the GTA V nightclub scene was a great addition. I feel like him and Lonz or whatever his name is being the life to it haha
    Tony... you ARE this town
    One of the best DLCs of all time. Better than Lost and Dammed.
Brooo I forgot about Gay Tony. One of the best GTA characters ever.
And in GTAV, the immigration vigilantes. “Weazel News, confirming your prejudices?” Do they really think it’s parodying CNN?
    People actually do. I got an "anti-woke" co-worker that said Weazel News was making fun of CNN and MSNBC because "leftist are the most prejudice people." According to him.
        They really couldn’t get the reference from Weasel to Fox? It’s really not _that subtle.
            Those people have no media literacy.
Luis is the closest LGBTQ ally. Having worked with Tony, he doesn't have problems with them and even helped several gay characters. He sees Tony as a business partner and the father he never had. The only gay dude he disliked is Evan Moss viewing him as a selfish "parasite" who is only interested in Tony's money and for getting Tony addicted to drugs.
Yusuf amir was the wokeist of all woke characters if i remember correctly
    "WHAT'S UP MY NI**AS!"
I got mad after I popped it in to discover I was playing yet another quite reserved tough guy instead of the gay dude, I had just played through TLAD, and was looking for something else.
Definitely not a great example to use if you are trying to argue for gta having always been woke
Fr
Inb4 "nah nah nah, he was just happy."
They put a lot of work into scripting these chase missions too, but most players probably never saw much of them because you can just shoot the guy you're chasing a few seconds after they start.
    My fav one was that one mission where niko was on the top of the truck (can’t remember the name of the mission)
        The one in Albany where Chinese mobsters are shipping drugs?  That's a great mission.

People say GTA IV has a lot of filler missions but I think it makes sense.  Niko is an illegal immigrant who is unfortunately thrust into a bad situation due to the lies of his cousin and only supporter in America.  He has to take odd jobs from the only contacts he has.

Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.
            >Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.


Out of all the GTA games, IV is the only one I can consistently play as peacefully and as Niko the person, drive slow and safe, drive Roman's car for spare cash, just trying to grind it like Niko is. 


And I see this as a reason. Niko is a true outsider with honest principles who is just as weirded out by IV's world as we can be. But he knows how to roll with it, he knows how to play by the rules and doesn't stray from his beliefs. I mean, he wakes up tied to a chair in a basement of a Russian mob boss and gleefully admits he killed Vlad because he was an asshole. He dossn't give a shit about the threat level his intended target may represent, he only cares if you're alright with his principles.
            That mission was honestly kinda goofy to me because the truck moves slow asf, but I missed it when you're supposed to get on and traffic doesn't spawn so I ended up chasing it for like 10 minutes lmao
            I actually liked that one because of how hard it was. So was the one where you got into a shootout with police after trying to get drugs back or something
        Truck Hustle
        Oh yeah that one fucks.
    Yeah there’s so many neat voice lines and tidbits in GTA IV that you miss if you kill the target right away. If you keep chasing this guy that attacks Bernie Crane for long enough, he eventually starts to get scared, tries to justify his hatred and begs for his life, he was just hiding his bigotry behind a tough guy facade the whole time.
    they really did! the motorcycle chase missions were really difficult cause bystanders were constantly getting in the way and trains were right on cue to be a hazard if you weren't careful.
![gif](giphy|8YsjVmpIpEjNKlrL3D)
Tbh even the simple shootout missions, particularly the ones in the hotel and the apartment complex is fun for me, really scratch my action movies type itch
GTA V had more variety, but it’s underrated how GTA IV makes doing the same three missions still fun
Wut?
GTA IV missions are not fun and repetitive as all hell.

    It's about as subtle as a bat to a homophobe's kneecaps lol
        My kneecaps hurt
I'm wondering whether they'll change the name of those or not for the next game.
    Doubt it
Oh shit that's actually really funny
Niko is such a devoted ally he'll run down any man, woman, child, homosexual, transexual, or queer person that gets in the way of violently murdering a bigot with a machine gun!
    He’s a man of peace…
        Just like Tim from Exploder: Evacuator Part II?
            You taught me baseball. And how to laugh!
                *He would have made a fine American! I'll cry when I'm done killin...*
                    Probably one of my top 10 3D universe radio ads.

“I wanna raise a family!”

“That’s just it, Tim! They’ve got your family!”

#”NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
                        "Tim, they've got your wife!"

"But I'm not married!"

"You are now... to America!"
                            I can hear it verbatim in my head.

Just like the entire 90 minute runtime of Vice City Public Radio.

Common niko W
If you like niko so much why don't you go bowling with him?
    I always ask him but then he calls back 2 minutes after agreeing saying “another time”, but can’t be too mad at least he agrees before before turning me down, and he’s always calling me when his car breaks down for 2 seconds.
    That's Roman's job
I mean he’s a fun character but damn man he helped that crazy abuser and the serial killer. Between you and me, I’ve seen him murder people and go onto “Littlelacysurprisepageant.com” a little too often.
Imagine all of the non cold blooded killers who are surprisingly not compassionate
Also he was Niko's friend. You can see that Niko doesn't really understand Florian's choices, but he won't forget about his old friend.

The problem is that people on the internet aren't very consistent with this point of view. Most the time instead it devolves into "if I like it, it's not woke" and "if I don't like it, it's woke" nonsense.
            Those people couldn’t even define Woke without having multiple come up with different definitions and then fall into anarchy over which version of Woke is correct.
                thats the part that people always overlook man its just a buzz word at this point lmao
                    I think Big Joel's definition is the most accurate: "woke is anything that Liberals believe"
        If this mission appeared in GTA VI it would be labeled woke and "pandering"
        Name a single example of a character that was "gay to fill a quota" in any media.  I'll wait.

Woke is just a word racists/homophobes like to use instead of just saying they are racist or homophobic
    This is how a hardcore leftist would define woke. It's just as ridiculous as hardcore right wingers who are obsessed with throwing the word around
        Nope. I’m not a hardcore left or right. Both sides are equally dumb.
I mean generally being woke just means understanding context in the world and being a decent person.
    This is what it originally meant and was a compliment until it got co-opted by certain communities and it suddenly became a bad thing.
    Taken in its original AAVE form, I don't consider being "woke" to be a bad thing. Unfortunately, it has been divorced from that context and now serves as a boogeyman and is now used as shorthand for "anything conservatives don't like."
    It means being overtly vocal of social issues to the point of ad nauseum and at the sacrifice of artistic integrity.
        i.e, most movies nowadays that put being 'politically correct'  in front of the actual plot

Tell that to literally any right wing podcaster or YouTuber and they’ll disagree with you strongly

Shoot First, Ask Questions NEVER!!!
Bernie either completely forgoes his military training in order to forget the terrible past that he had to let go, with his childhood friends being betrayed by one of them. Or he's just weak.
Niko was a child conscript, I think people really overestimate his combat training based on Brucie's throwaway "Red Army shit" lines lol
    Yeah he has a lot of unexplained skills that Rockstar likes to write off as "cause he was in the military broo" such as flying helicopters and proficiency with a sniper. They don't teach you all that in the military, especially not in 90s Serbia lol.
    Niko literally manhandles everyone in hand to hand combat in the cutscenes. It’s not an overestimation it’s a fact that he has amazing combat skills
Were some fragile kids mad about Nikko being an ally?
    Yes, because they’re edgelords that hate on others to feel like they have a purpose
        [deleted]
            What?
"Niko, wanna go on a date?"

"Eh..."

"Come on, whats wrong with you?"

"Okay, who is she?"

"That's the thing, its a guy."

"Faak yu."
    His Lovemeet bio though...

"I am a vulnerable guy who needs to be held with big strong arms."
        "i knew we should have made him a giver, Brucie!"
Brucie's closeted back story is hilarious.
For real. They try so hard to nitpick things and look so deep into it to divide people. It’s just satirical humor of rockstar and they will make fun of anyone and anything
Go to twitter 

Shits wild
    Twitter isnt “people”. They are mindless drones and should just be ignored. I’m so tired of the woke not woke bullshit, who fucking cares it’s a video game lol
        Calling them people is a stretch. I doubt that people complaining about “woke” things are human
            Sorry meant to put isn’t lol, and I’ve def complained about shit being “woke” but to me that’s just a term for a situation where I feel a political or social ideology is being shoved down my throat
                I understand that but people complaining about it towards rockstar is ridiculous
                    100% people love to bitch and moan, and they are still gonna be buying it on release day
    get off Twitter

Shits wild

no
Go to YouTube. That's why you found one that is a breathing living meat.
The whole series is a caricature of what’s wrong with the US, is super progressive and makes fun of the cons/right.  
The fact that so many cons/right people think it’s anti woke is just the cherry on top.
    Most people on either side of the political spectrum don't care or think gta is woke. Just because some journalists cherry picked some random twitter trolls that complained doesn't mean theres this vast amount of people that feel that way.
    Gta has never been "super progressive"
I'm looking forward to what they'll have on Weasel News this time.
IIRC he also mentions somewhere in the game people should be left alone if they are happy with who they are or something like that, like don't attack people for being happy with themselves.
    I think it's also in one of Bernie's missions.
Bernie's lover, Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins, is a parody of conservative politicians who claim to support family values and criticizing homosexuality but are actually closet homosexuals
he's a stereotypical gay guy to YOU he's just any other gay guy to me, a gay guy
Trevor will fuck anything alive or not so he's beyond pansexuality

franklin i seem him as a chill passive ally

he won't go to any parade but stills doesn't care about your sexuality 

if yo come out as gay to him he'd be like

"yeah ok i respect it"
Doom Eternal OST - The only thing they fear is you
    Thank you for this cuz I was fuckin GROOVING to that shit
Hold on lemme put on my reactionary mask for a sec: This woke lgtvq game is forcing me to defend a gay person where is the personal freedom in that huh? i barely even know this guy! woke!
https://youtu.be/DjyPqell7b0?si=H_AcVPu3L62tFOBV
we had that in TBoGT and nobody gave a shit. the  teenage snowflake homophobes were probably too young to have played through it though
Well yes exactly. Ratchet=woke. They know a large percentage of their base is black so they pander to that. That’s why half the npc’s are going to be black. Racists are actually going to love it because that’s a lot of target practice!
    I love how gta6 having some black people in Miami is woke…
Yet San Andreas: a game with an entire black cast, is ignored. They pretend it doesn’t exist 😂
        Maybe they didn’t play it because none of the other games are like that. Miami is only 15% black yet most of the people in the trailer were black. One can argue that it’s woke for purposefully doing that. And all the white people are very trashy. So I can understand why some are upset however, it’s a parody so they can get over it. It was created by two British guys who have capitalized tremendously on their, presumably, disdain for America lol
Yeah people sleep on the two dlcs to much, they were masterpieces. So glad to see stuff from tbogt in gta online.
skill issue?
    Definitely
    Naw just not trying to constantly re center the camera the entire time I play
The camera are not that bad, just take some time and it will be ok.

You probably never played Spintire/Mudrunner/Snowrunner
You get used to it pretty quickly but it really threw me off too lol
    I remember not being able to get past it back in the day

You mean before right wing media told you to be mad about it.
It’s extremely woke. Gay is woke. Period.

And you’re a fraud for accepting it back then, but not today.
Either you’re okay with gay people in your media, or you’re not. Stop fence sitting.
    Being gay is not “woke” gay marriage has been legal in the states for a while now. It’s not like this game was made in the 50’s where it would be considered progressive or something. And again, the character is a joke he’s meant to be funny and laughed at. This isn’t that supportive of the cause of being gay, it’s just that being an asshole and hating on gay people is not right. That’s all this clip says. If you think the bare minimum that it’s okay to laugh at someone being gay but not to attack them or call them slurs is “woke” you have lost all meaning.
        Gay marriage hasn’t even been legal for 20 years.
The mere fact niko is friends with him and not calling him a slur makes him an ally in my books
What do you mean
    I wonder if they are afraid of drag queens
How is Bernie being gay the joke?
    He was a soldier in Niko’s unit and he’s searching for him for the first half of the game. Based on Niko’s personality and the tone of the story the player would likely assume Florian to be a similar hardened soldier, they would never guess him to be the way he is. That is where the humour comes from

Nothing to say back u/UnjustNation ? I know you were expecting something to get all offended by
He ain't portrayed as a bad person for it tho, and also Niko accepts his new identity if you don't kill Darko
    Yeah but none of that is woke at all it’s clear Rockstar’s whole goal was humour not some representation politics
        It's clear the goal was, who cares if someone is gay it isn't a reason to treat them any different
Why, people should preach important topics, if done tastefully.

You just admitted to GTA 3 being woke.
Yet you love that game. 
What’s the issue with gta 6 then???? 
Youve changed. You’ve been brainwashed into thinking “white men” is the only acceptable form of media 


Where was your complaints in GTA 1? That allowed you to play as 4 diverse women? 
Where was your bitching with gta San Andreas? An all black cast. 


You’ve lost your damn mind dude.
    Dude are you on drugs right now or something? Yes I liked gta 3 and san andreas and no I don't think "white men are the only form of acceptable media" whatever that means lmao. It's funny you say that I'm brainwashed and lost my mind when you follow the same trend of hating on everyone who doesn't like Lucia and making assumptions that make no sense.
        You just wrote an entire book about how woke GTA6 is gonna be, JUST BECAUSE THERES A WOMAN IN IT! 

You haven’t even played the game yet! You got a simple 90 trailer and you’re already freaking out
            I didn't though, you didn't even read what I wrote. The reason I wrote so much isn't because of Lucia, it's because it annoys me at this point everybody on this sub bashes anybody that doesn't like Lucia. I think "woke" is a stupid and vague term anyway which is what I said. We didn't play the game, but we already know she's the main character and we all know what gta characters do. But she might be well written, I'm not saying and I didn't say GTA 6 is gonna be bad. You just read 1 or 2 sentences and assumed the rest lol
                [removed]
                    Is this dude for real
Women, notoriously famous for not having the ability to do crimes. Just don’t look at the actual Bonnie who existed IRL which is who Lucia is based on.
if you play video games to escape from gay or trans people you need to rethink your life
"Ohhh noo people are encouraging me to be a decent human being to others, I'm being indoctrinated save me from the woke 😭😭😭"

>Some of us just want to play the game we have waited a decade for without political messaging.

Ah yes, keep those nasty politics out of my game which consists entirely of a social critique of America. Gotta be able to mindlessly run people over without hearing about lgbtq folk existing, that "political stuff" that concerns you so much.

How about…..you cry some more
Be respectful of other users, do NOT insult or harass others. Racism, homophobia, transphobia, or hate speech of any kind is zero tolerance and will be met with a swift ban. Witch-hunting or targeting of specific users will also not be tolerated.

Was Lucia beating a guy misgendering someone with the power of twerk and pregnant minorities in the trailers?
    Of course not. GTA6 is gonna slap hard. Just that this isnt really an example of woke degradation. Back then it was gonzo violence humor that will still be in GTA in the future.
The suicide option is still there. It’s been moved in the pause menu.

Worth it!
No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. That could've and probably was sort of "woke" to people back then. Rockstar has always been progressive or least made jokes about it is all my point was.
    People bring up Gay Tony in these conversations constantly idk where you been lol Reni from VCS too
        Haven't seen it brought up myself. Sorry I don't share your experiences.

Edit:Thank you for not getting shitty with me I'm sorry that I did initially. The holidays are a real ball buster but no excuses for me to get shitty with people.
            People post it in the GTA subs a lot, dw not everybody can be ~~terminally online~~ cool like me lol
                Wholesome encounter
            Hope you’re doing okay mate
        And Asuka and Maria...

MARIA: Asuka and I are gonna have to talk, uh, why don't you go cruise around?  


MARIA: Oh, Asuka, you've got a massager!ASUKA: That's not a massager.

ASUKA: It's my handsome handyman! Maria's all tied up at the moment, but I'll tell her you called.  
MARIA: (Offscreen) Who's that, Asuka? You know, I've been a naughty girl, but I really need to pee, OK?

ASUKA: A reporter has been nosing around. Maria and I have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur...
            They're teenagers
        But but but... Reni was born a woman who transitioned into a man, and then later became a woman, then transitioned once again into a man, before finally settling in to become a woman.
        I remember that game. The movie missions were actually quite fun.
    Rockstars a bit like Southpark, they make fun of everyone.
    Because no one really cared when it came out, they only get mad cus politicians have whipped them up into a frenzy over it.
    >No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. 

It doesn't work with their narrative. But also, "History Repeats itself" I was a teenager at this, I remember specifically the announcement of "Ballad of Gay Tony" being met with "PC" and Gay agenda and equivalent of what woke was back then. 

The reason it didn't pick up steam back then was because Those type of people were generally the proper weirdos. No one took those guys serious. So they complained to no one. Nowadays your average Joe is on that "Anti Woke Hivemind". It was a lot more discreet, but it was still there.

I remember a random conspiracy that we were going to play a Gay Latino Domincan Lover who's name is gay Tony. The conspiracies were just as silly as now, But it was kept in the basement of the internet.
    People brought it up back then but you’re right that for some reason, people seem to have way more reactionary takes nowadays. Somehow we are going backwards
        Seeing people get mad over Wolfenstein II and Far Cry 5 for being anti-Nazi, and anti-Christian Fascist Cult was pretty weird at the time. Seems to have been the tipping point from ordinary angry neckbeards, to rampage killer neckbeards.
        I agree with this sentiment. This is basically what I mean ☝️
    The woke panic is recent culture war bullshit from some American conservatives.  
Now they use the word “woke” in place of something they don't like. 
LGBT people, sexy women twerking, Black people, different body types in a game, etc everything is woke nowadays. 

It became a clown show.
    Woke is just the new term to describe people who want everyone to have the same personal freedoms as anyone else, there has always been haters who bashed the tolerant, but up until recently the bashers used to get away with killing "woke" people for defending others rights, the anti woke peeps are really pissed they can't take out their rage legally anymore.
    Nobody brings up any media prior to 2016 for "wok" 

At all.  Ever.  Isn't that strange?  What happened in 2016? 🤔
        2016 Presidential election, and it was one of the first campaigns that took advantage of social media to take advantage of the populace. Unfortunately, it opened up a Pandora's box that led to people getting mad over shit like this.
        Are you having a stroke? I don't understand your comment. Who mentioned woks?
            On the off chance that you’re not joking, he missed the e in woke
    Because wokeness simply wasn’t an issue back then, or, not the type of issue it is today, or, not out in the open and in your face at all times type of issue. 2008 was a different world.
        They just didn’t call it “woke” yet.
            Shout out to the "gay agenda".
            Member when people complained about things being politically correct? I member
        They didn't use that term, but people were definitely complaining about "political correctness gone mad" and "the gay agenda" back then as well.

It's still the same niche group of screaming idiots, but the algorithms of the current web just makes sure the outrage spreads faster and wider than ever before these days.
            I’m sure you’re right. I was 12 when GTA IV came out so was mostly unaware. I agree about the algorithms. Go out into the world and you may here about all that shit once in a blue moon. It’s really an internet thing.
    How dare Rockstar not be racist homophobic assholes!!
Love tony. Bringing him to the GTA V nightclub scene was a great addition. I feel like him and Lonz or whatever his name is being the life to it haha
Tony... you ARE this town
One of the best DLCs of all time. Better than Lost and Dammed.
People actually do. I got an "anti-woke" co-worker that said Weazel News was making fun of CNN and MSNBC because "leftist are the most prejudice people." According to him.
    They really couldn’t get the reference from Weasel to Fox? It’s really not _that subtle.
        Those people have no media literacy.
"WHAT'S UP MY NI**AS!"
My fav one was that one mission where niko was on the top of the truck (can’t remember the name of the mission)
    The one in Albany where Chinese mobsters are shipping drugs?  That's a great mission.

People say GTA IV has a lot of filler missions but I think it makes sense.  Niko is an illegal immigrant who is unfortunately thrust into a bad situation due to the lies of his cousin and only supporter in America.  He has to take odd jobs from the only contacts he has.

Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.
        >Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.


Out of all the GTA games, IV is the only one I can consistently play as peacefully and as Niko the person, drive slow and safe, drive Roman's car for spare cash, just trying to grind it like Niko is. 


And I see this as a reason. Niko is a true outsider with honest principles who is just as weirded out by IV's world as we can be. But he knows how to roll with it, he knows how to play by the rules and doesn't stray from his beliefs. I mean, he wakes up tied to a chair in a basement of a Russian mob boss and gleefully admits he killed Vlad because he was an asshole. He dossn't give a shit about the threat level his intended target may represent, he only cares if you're alright with his principles.
        That mission was honestly kinda goofy to me because the truck moves slow asf, but I missed it when you're supposed to get on and traffic doesn't spawn so I ended up chasing it for like 10 minutes lmao
        I actually liked that one because of how hard it was. So was the one where you got into a shootout with police after trying to get drugs back or something
    Truck Hustle
    Oh yeah that one fucks.
Yeah there’s so many neat voice lines and tidbits in GTA IV that you miss if you kill the target right away. If you keep chasing this guy that attacks Bernie Crane for long enough, he eventually starts to get scared, tries to justify his hatred and begs for his life, he was just hiding his bigotry behind a tough guy facade the whole time.
they really did! the motorcycle chase missions were really difficult cause bystanders were constantly getting in the way and trains were right on cue to be a hazard if you weren't careful.
Skill issue
It's about as subtle as a bat to a homophobe's kneecaps lol
    My kneecaps hurt
Doubt it
He’s a man of peace…
    Just like Tim from Exploder: Evacuator Part II?
        You taught me baseball. And how to laugh!
            *He would have made a fine American! I'll cry when I'm done killin...*
                Probably one of my top 10 3D universe radio ads.

“I wanna raise a family!”

“That’s just it, Tim! They’ve got your family!”

#”NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
                    "Tim, they've got your wife!"

"But I'm not married!"

"You are now... to America!"
                        I can hear it verbatim in my head.

Just like the entire 90 minute runtime of Vice City Public Radio.
I always ask him but then he calls back 2 minutes after agreeing saying “another time”, but can’t be too mad at least he agrees before before turning me down, and he’s always calling me when his car breaks down for 2 seconds.
That's Roman's job

Yeah he has a lot of unexplained skills that Rockstar likes to write off as "cause he was in the military broo" such as flying helicopters and proficiency with a sniper. They don't teach you all that in the military, especially not in 90s Serbia lol.
Niko literally manhandles everyone in hand to hand combat in the cutscenes. It’s not an overestimation it’s a fact that he has amazing combat skills
Yes, because they’re edgelords that hate on others to feel like they have a purpose

    "i knew we should have made him a giver, Brucie!"
Twitter isnt “people”. They are mindless drones and should just be ignored. I’m so tired of the woke not woke bullshit, who fucking cares it’s a video game lol
    Calling them people is a stretch. I doubt that people complaining about “woke” things are human
        Sorry meant to put isn’t lol, and I’ve def complained about shit being “woke” but to me that’s just a term for a situation where I feel a political or social ideology is being shoved down my throat
            I understand that but people complaining about it towards rockstar is ridiculous
                100% people love to bitch and moan, and they are still gonna be buying it on release day
get off Twitter

Shits wild
> Go to twitter

no
Most people on either side of the political spectrum don't care or think gta is woke. Just because some journalists cherry picked some random twitter trolls that complained doesn't mean theres this vast amount of people that feel that way.
Gta has never been "super progressive"
I think it's also in one of Bernie's missions.
Thank you for this cuz I was fuckin GROOVING to that shit
I love how gta6 having some black people in Miami is woke…
Yet San Andreas: a game with an entire black cast, is ignored. They pretend it doesn’t exist 😂
    Maybe they didn’t play it because none of the other games are like that. Miami is only 15% black yet most of the people in the trailer were black. One can argue that it’s woke for purposefully doing that. And all the white people are very trashy. So I can understand why some are upset however, it’s a parody so they can get over it. It was created by two British guys who have capitalized tremendously on their, presumably, disdain for America lol
Definitely
Naw just not trying to constantly re center the camera the entire time I play
I remember not being able to get past it back in the day
Being gay is not “woke” gay marriage has been legal in the states for a while now. It’s not like this game was made in the 50’s where it would be considered progressive or something. And again, the character is a joke he’s meant to be funny and laughed at. This isn’t that supportive of the cause of being gay, it’s just that being an asshole and hating on gay people is not right. That’s all this clip says. If you think the bare minimum that it’s okay to laugh at someone being gay but not to attack them or call them slurs is “woke” you have lost all meaning.
    Gay marriage hasn’t even been legal for 20 years.
I wonder if they are afraid of drag queens
He was a soldier in Niko’s unit and he’s searching for him for the first half of the game. Based on Niko’s personality and the tone of the story the player would likely assume Florian to be a similar hardened soldier, they would never guess him to be the way he is. That is where the humour comes from

Nothing to say back u/UnjustNation ? I know you were expecting something to get all offended by
Yeah but none of that is woke at all it’s clear Rockstar’s whole goal was humour not some representation politics
    It's clear the goal was, who cares if someone is gay it isn't a reason to treat them any different
Where do I call him homophobic? Can you even read? Reading is pretty simple, actually. You should learn how to.

Dude are you on drugs right now or something? Yes I liked gta 3 and san andreas and no I don't think "white men are the only form of acceptable media" whatever that means lmao. It's funny you say that I'm brainwashed and lost my mind when you follow the same trend of hating on everyone who doesn't like Lucia and making assumptions that make no sense.
    You just wrote an entire book about how woke GTA6 is gonna be, JUST BECAUSE THERES A WOMAN IN IT! 

You haven’t even played the game yet! You got a simple 90 trailer and you’re already freaking out
        I didn't though, you didn't even read what I wrote. The reason I wrote so much isn't because of Lucia, it's because it annoys me at this point everybody on this sub bashes anybody that doesn't like Lucia. I think "woke" is a stupid and vague term anyway which is what I said. We didn't play the game, but we already know she's the main character and we all know what gta characters do. But she might be well written, I'm not saying and I didn't say GTA 6 is gonna be bad. You just read 1 or 2 sentences and assumed the rest lol

    So you’re black and gay. You’re a conservative pick me.
there's always NPCs like you that act all ignorant, you know exactly what he's talking about.
    I really don’t lol but think I found the **hater**
👶
    🖕
        Woah man calm down dont wanna get too angry
Of course not. GTA6 is gonna slap hard. Just that this isnt really an example of woke degradation. Back then it was gonzo violence humor that will still be in GTA in the future.
People bring up Gay Tony in these conversations constantly idk where you been lol Reni from VCS too
    Haven't seen it brought up myself. Sorry I don't share your experiences.

Edit:Thank you for not getting shitty with me I'm sorry that I did initially. The holidays are a real ball buster but no excuses for me to get shitty with people.
        People post it in the GTA subs a lot, dw not everybody can be ~~terminally online~~ cool like me lol
            Wholesome encounter
        Hope you’re doing okay mate
    And Asuka and Maria...

MARIA: Asuka and I are gonna have to talk, uh, why don't you go cruise around?  


MARIA: Oh, Asuka, you've got a massager!ASUKA: That's not a massager.

ASUKA: It's my handsome handyman! Maria's all tied up at the moment, but I'll tell her you called.  
MARIA: (Offscreen) Who's that, Asuka? You know, I've been a naughty girl, but I really need to pee, OK?

ASUKA: A reporter has been nosing around. Maria and I have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur...
        They're teenagers
    But but but... Reni was born a woman who transitioned into a man, and then later became a woman, then transitioned once again into a man, before finally settling in to become a woman.
    I remember that game. The movie missions were actually quite fun.
Rockstars a bit like Southpark, they make fun of everyone.
Because no one really cared when it came out, they only get mad cus politicians have whipped them up into a frenzy over it.
>No doubt about that, I just think it's weird that no one mentioned stuff like Gay Tony when they mention "Woke" stuff. 

It doesn't work with their narrative. But also, "History Repeats itself" I was a teenager at this, I remember specifically the announcement of "Ballad of Gay Tony" being met with "PC" and Gay agenda and equivalent of what woke was back then. 

The reason it didn't pick up steam back then was because Those type of people were generally the proper weirdos. No one took those guys serious. So they complained to no one. Nowadays your average Joe is on that "Anti Woke Hivemind". It was a lot more discreet, but it was still there.

I remember a random conspiracy that we were going to play a Gay Latino Domincan Lover who's name is gay Tony. The conspiracies were just as silly as now, But it was kept in the basement of the internet.
People brought it up back then but you’re right that for some reason, people seem to have way more reactionary takes nowadays. Somehow we are going backwards
    Seeing people get mad over Wolfenstein II and Far Cry 5 for being anti-Nazi, and anti-Christian Fascist Cult was pretty weird at the time. Seems to have been the tipping point from ordinary angry neckbeards, to rampage killer neckbeards.
    I agree with this sentiment. This is basically what I mean ☝️
The woke panic is recent culture war bullshit from some American conservatives.  
Now they use the word “woke” in place of something they don't like. 
LGBT people, sexy women twerking, Black people, different body types in a game, etc everything is woke nowadays. 

It became a clown show.
Woke is just the new term to describe people who want everyone to have the same personal freedoms as anyone else, there has always been haters who bashed the tolerant, but up until recently the bashers used to get away with killing "woke" people for defending others rights, the anti woke peeps are really pissed they can't take out their rage legally anymore.
Nobody brings up any media prior to 2016 for "wok" 

At all.  Ever.  Isn't that strange?  What happened in 2016? 🤔
    2016 Presidential election, and it was one of the first campaigns that took advantage of social media to take advantage of the populace. Unfortunately, it opened up a Pandora's box that led to people getting mad over shit like this.
    Are you having a stroke? I don't understand your comment. Who mentioned woks?
        On the off chance that you’re not joking, he missed the e in woke
Because wokeness simply wasn’t an issue back then, or, not the type of issue it is today, or, not out in the open and in your face at all times type of issue. 2008 was a different world.
    They just didn’t call it “woke” yet.
        Shout out to the "gay agenda".
        Member when people complained about things being politically correct? I member
    They didn't use that term, but people were definitely complaining about "political correctness gone mad" and "the gay agenda" back then as well.

It's still the same niche group of screaming idiots, but the algorithms of the current web just makes sure the outrage spreads faster and wider than ever before these days.
        I’m sure you’re right. I was 12 when GTA IV came out so was mostly unaware. I agree about the algorithms. Go out into the world and you may here about all that shit once in a blue moon. It’s really an internet thing.
How dare Rockstar not be racist homophobic assholes!!
They really couldn’t get the reference from Weasel to Fox? It’s really not _that subtle.
    Those people have no media literacy.
The one in Albany where Chinese mobsters are shipping drugs?  That's a great mission.

People say GTA IV has a lot of filler missions but I think it makes sense.  Niko is an illegal immigrant who is unfortunately thrust into a bad situation due to the lies of his cousin and only supporter in America.  He has to take odd jobs from the only contacts he has.

Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.
    >Niko actually has little agency over the narrative which I think only makes the story better.  I think it makes him more sympathetic.  There are many instances where Niko does a mission solely because the people he cares about are being impacted.


Out of all the GTA games, IV is the only one I can consistently play as peacefully and as Niko the person, drive slow and safe, drive Roman's car for spare cash, just trying to grind it like Niko is. 


And I see this as a reason. Niko is a true outsider with honest principles who is just as weirded out by IV's world as we can be. But he knows how to roll with it, he knows how to play by the rules and doesn't stray from his beliefs. I mean, he wakes up tied to a chair in a basement of a Russian mob boss and gleefully admits he killed Vlad because he was an asshole. He dossn't give a shit about the threat level his intended target may represent, he only cares if you're alright with his principles.
    That mission was honestly kinda goofy to me because the truck moves slow asf, but I missed it when you're supposed to get on and traffic doesn't spawn so I ended up chasing it for like 10 minutes lmao
    I actually liked that one because of how hard it was. So was the one where you got into a shootout with police after trying to get drugs back or something
Truck Hustle
Oh yeah that one fucks.
My kneecaps hurt
Just like Tim from Exploder: Evacuator Part II?
    You taught me baseball. And how to laugh!
        *He would have made a fine American! I'll cry when I'm done killin...*
            Probably one of my top 10 3D universe radio ads.

“I wanna raise a family!”

“That’s just it, Tim! They’ve got your family!”

#”NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
                "Tim, they've got your wife!"

"But I'm not married!"

"You are now... to America!"
                    I can hear it verbatim in my head.

Just like the entire 90 minute runtime of Vice City Public Radio.
Some people just see women, minorities, and gays existing in a story as driving a political agenda.
    [deleted]
        Do you feel enlightened?
>Pandering to an agenda for no other reason than to get brownie points doesn't impress me. Rockstar wasn't doing that here. Florian happened to be gay. He wasn't gay to fill a quota. That's the right way to do it.

The problem is that people on the internet aren't very consistent with this point of view. Most the time instead it devolves into "if I like it, it's not woke" and "if I don't like it, it's woke" nonsense.
    Those people couldn’t even define Woke without having multiple come up with different definitions and then fall into anarchy over which version of Woke is correct.
        thats the part that people always overlook man its just a buzz word at this point lmao
            I think Big Joel's definition is the most accurate: "woke is anything that Liberals believe"
If this mission appeared in GTA VI it would be labeled woke and "pandering"
Name a single example of a character that was "gay to fill a quota" in any media.  I'll wait.
