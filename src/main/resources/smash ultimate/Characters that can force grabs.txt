[[Characters that can force grabs]]

Post Content:
I'm still a beginner to smash and I've been looking for a main for quite some time. I've been playing mii gunner recently, and I really like to shoot a rocket or drop a bomb to force them to shield, then grabbing after that. However, gunner doesn't get too much off of a grab. Any other characters that can force grabs like this? Thank you!

Comments:
Diddy.

Throw banana at their shield, then run up and grab them, down throw or up throw and start your combo.

Pikachu/Pichu

They can run alongside their neutral b thundershock and grab the opponent easily. 

Mario & Luigi

Toss out a fireball to pressure the opponent to shield, then grab and goto town.
    Mewtwo shadow balls are great for this as well and he's fast.
        Gonna try mewtwo today, he seems super fun
            join the dark side
                wha... what does that mean? is my soul going to be sold to the devil
    That's my main game plan with Pichu. Chase the thunderjolt at roughly 80%, grab them, instantly up throw jump down b. Dead.
Ice Climbers if you learn the desyncs. 


 Diddy Kong if you're holding banana or juggling them and they're trying to land. You can use his side B if they shield or not. 


 Jigglypuff has an easy combo that ends in a grab and they're put in a terrible position with forward throw off stage.

I believe Kazuya can combo you and finish it off with Gates of Hell.

In general, anyone with a command grab can use it to catch people on platforms whether they're shielding or not if you're under them or if you read where they will end up after a roll or tech.
If you like mii gunner's playstlye why not try samus? She's got rockets and bombs to force grabs as well but gets combos and a kill throw off them.
GnW. Falling forward air can lead into grab and it's true if they try to shield it.
Might not be the best at it, but samus can pressure shields with charge shot/bombs to lead into grab. There is also some tech with not fully charged shot combo-ing into grab, so its a win win regardless of wether they shield or not. Plus, they are similar enough to mii gunner that the switch won't be too jarring

Rosalina luma, Diddy, characters with slow projectiles, dragdowns(joker, ness, shiek and others), ices
Universally every character can force a grab situation.

If you are looking for character that can force the merely act of grabbing regardless of their reward afterwards, you can pick whatever character you feel most comfortable with and learn their most basic set ups. 
Like landing with safe aerials for shields so you have time to shield/spotdoge/grab/attack/jump after yoi hit the shield of your opponent,
For example pit/cloud back air being safe on shield on most moves. Even if they don‚Äôt have a good grab, they can force a shield situation by the mere act of jumping towards someone backwards, fast fall, instant turn around then grabbing and winning advantage and stage control, this is called ‚Äútomahawk‚Äù 

So basically learn the data and your safest options, im sure you will find the best option for your char.

If you are looking grab reward-ratio, you can use characters like, kazuya, luigi, incineroar, bowser, DK etc. 

All this taking in consideration that in this game the grab is not universal and differ from character to character, the grab in this game have so many variants like grab distance, frame start up, active boxes, ending lag, command grabs
So even the best grabs some times its not the one on the ‚ÄúZ‚Äù button, it is an special attack with grab hitboxes (command grabs) like bowser,wario,incineroar,c.falcon etc.

In my opinion one of the most funny characters to use to force shield are the ones that can brake it like:
Sephiroth - he can side b the opponent to force shield, potentially lead to shield brake if timed correctly with down smash then proceed to delete stock with full charge neutral b

Byleth - can force shields with tech chases after landing nair, if landing hitboxes of nair pokes the opponent holding shield it can lead to a shield brake tech chase situation with down smash then proceed to delete stock

Lucina/Marth- well they have shield breaker, if you land with a well spaced aerial to your opponent it can lead to a shield brake with neutral b.

Etc. there are a lot of character with shield-break  setups just make a research of it.

There is a lot to experiment with, enjoy the process and keep the labbing.
Sephiroth's Shadow Flare is a decent one for this, though in his case it's usually more lucrative to just shieldbreak with Down Smash and then nuke them with Gigaflare.
K Rool's projectile pressure can force grabs pretty easily, and has amazing range in change for being slightly slow. You should ALWAYS get something good from them.
I main snake. All of the explosives have potential for this. Imo, when you get real good with nade placement (including b reversing, getting close and laying those nades down) people tend to shield. For instance you can cook a grenade, get close, grab and down/back/forward throw and go from there. Depending on timing your grenades, how long you cook them you can do a lot of different combo's. Also, combining this with other explosives can be fun. Snake is very good with this, especially when you have good movement, have good cqc and be creative (though this is true for every char :)

Also, regardless of the char you fight with; variety and creativity matters a lot. If you can condition your opponent one way, he might not expect you go for a grab if its a mix up. I also play ganon, and in close combat a lot of ppl tend to spot dodge in fear of side b or grab. That is the perfect moment for an up or down smash. Again, variety and mixups are key üîë
Mewtwo shadow balls are great for this as well and he's fast.
