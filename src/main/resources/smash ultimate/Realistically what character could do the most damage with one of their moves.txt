[[Realistically what character could do the most damage with one of their moves]]





Snake’s Rocket Launcher point blank at the legs is probably bad for everyone involved honestly.
    Um ackshually rockets fired from an RPG-7 need to travel a certain distance in order to arm the explosive, so shooting it point blank would realistically do nothing and just make it a glorified bullet 🤓
        Volunteering to get shot in the leg? I’m on it.
        Do you really think a projectile that size and speed impacting at your feet actually needs to explode to ruin the day of everyone involved?
        Um ackshually Solid Snake(not to be confused with Big Boss[not to be confused with Venom Snake]) uses a Nikita which is a fictional rocket launcher
            Correct, but that’s his side special. He uses the RPG-7 for his forward smash.
            [Not to be confused with Solidus Snake]
                No! That is NOT Solid Snake!

- Iroquois Pliskin.
                    *Monkey noises*  
\- Pipo Snake
                    Shame that snake died on that oil tanker.
        Um ackshually only some RPG7 rounds have an arming distance. Most common HE/frag rounds are just tip detonated. Look up horror stories of Taliban tripping with the tip cover off and going kablooey.
        I still wouldnt want to get hit in the shin with a high velocity foot long metal nerf dart
        No actually, I’m pretty sure rpg-7s are armed once you remove the pin.
    His c4 on the other hand would be devastating in real life.

Other than final smashes I'm not sure any other character is realistically on the level of "I'm bringing down that apartment complex with a button" in their basic moveset.

Maybe sephiroth.
        Sephiroth's final smash is so anime that I think we forget he basically destroys multiple worlds and let's that impact hit you.
            Yeah Lots of the cast have a world ending or stronger final smash which is why I excluded them
                How many of the cast have world ending final smashes? Kirby's is a maybe, K Rool's is island destroying, a lot of them get directed on destroying a ship, not a world. How many of them end a world, or get to Sephiroth's level of ending a galaxy?
                    as far as planet destroying and up at the least we have:

* Sephiroth

* Ridley if you are counting a small moon as world ending, but that ones a stretch i guess.

* palutena as its a blackhole. a blackhole that size would destroy the earth in no time, and would weigh more than the earth as it is. hell a blackhole the size of a tennis ball would destroy the earth if it didnt evaporate in a few seconds.

then you have a couple that could eventually destroy a world in the long term, like iceclimbers creating an ice age, and a few that could possibly destroy a world if it was focused on them like a few of the big giant laser attacks and such.
                        So, in the end, it's like 3, maybe, and the rest are long-term, maybe. Sephiroth's final smash would result in a mazzive blackhole. In the end, Sephiroth's is the most destructive, with an argument for Palutena's to be worse. Like, the Ice-Climber's summon a single mountain of ice, not an ice age. And the argument for those lasers depends on how long the laser can last, what the intensity of it is, where it gets focused, and so much more. They are potentially destructive, not fully galaxy destroying like Sephiroth's. Therefore, the worst is Sephiroth's.
                            either way, its why i excluded final smashes in the first place.
    Kid named Soldier:
    Ever seen that video of the RPG misfiring in the guy's hands? It's pretty bad but he lived
    It’s bad for Snake cuz he in the blast radius. Tho i think Ridley or Ganondorf could survive? idk cuz i dont play those fames but they look scary
I’ve heard guns are the high tier in real life
    Depends on the character. Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening. 

But Snake? Half of his moves would causes serious loss of life. Maybe he’d stop pointing his RPG at the ground lol
        > Half of his moves would cause serious loss of life. 

As opposed to funny loss of life?
            That would be a gun from a very cartoony game
                OMOCHAO GUN
            Lmao get fucked

                And then we shit ourselves.
            Idk man I think getting suplexed by a humanoid cat would be a funny way to go
                Yes
            https://preview.redd.it/dkkn8flrsmic1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49c1988849ea35b846c17ae67744191f4c870c65

Funny loss of life
                Ironic. Joker gun causes serious loss of life while Joker gun causes funny loss of life
        The odd thing with Joker's gun is that the only reason the thing works in his games is because the enemies think it's real.

This means either Mario and the others think it's real, or the more likely option, it's actually a real one in SSBU since you can make real ones that are very powerful, in Persona 5 but you need to increase your Confidant with the Airsoft shopkeeper.
            Ultimate is in Mementos confirmed
                Mementos is in Ultimate also confirmed

![gif](giphy|lXu72d4iKwqek)
        >Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

Depends on the Model gun. Satanael's for example...
        Snake using C4 to recover would send him way higher than in game, and in more directions at once
        But given that mementos is a stage and that he has the ability to use his persona, the entire game takes place in the metaverse where the gun is real because people believe it to be real.
            Not true persona's can be summoned in the realworld. It is just extremely difficult.
        I mean, Smash treats him like he's in the Metaverse, so his gun would function and hurt as much as a real one.

But yeah, Snake would solo Joker.
        >Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

*Sigh* So we have decided once again to strip Joker from his powers.

![gif](giphy|RGVqj8v6aoY2UFzWYa)
    Bayonetta would put most mass shooters to shame
    did somebody say gun?
    Robins neutral B tho.
If I remember correctly MatPat did an entire video on how Ridley’s side special would kill you extremely painfully
    A brief rundown: On asphalt, the assumed roadway of Big Blue, Ridley is going faster than 600 mph and dragging you with him, meaning your body leaves so much skin and other gore on the pavement you don’t exist anymore.
        also one of the thing he based it's intensity on was ridley's height, but he failed to calculate his taunt that makes him stand upright, meaning your gonna be injured way worse then MatPat said you would.
            Not to mention he can instantly stab you in the skull with his tail, so there's that too if you survive the first onslaught.
        *meat crayon
        What if you’re Steve and your back is a flat surface
            I guess the road would function like sandpaper
        basically, dont fuck with ridley. ever.
        Matpat theory alert
        Faster than even the Blue Hedgehog.
    An old execution method used to be dragging somebody behind a running horse. Or keel-hauling somebody (dragging them on the underside of a ship, which would have tough barnacles growing on it) 

Scraping/dragging is a very painful and not immediate way to die.
    Yeah, since it keeps up with Big Blue he scaled it to move at super sonic speed.
    It’s lessened if you’re not on big blue, because he drags you at a consistent relative speed
Sephiroth Gigaflare or Min Min Megawatt F-smash (when fully charged) for me
    I second this. Gigaflare canonically shreds entire teams of warriors and terraforms regions.
        And Wario can fucking eat it
            And kirby can eat Wario. Kirby suck is at the top then?
                Honestly yeah. Kirby shouldn't have to just pop out the fighter he eats. Canonically I believe they're just swallowed and basically put into a pocket dimension.

So effectively, Kirby just erases people
                    That would be a fun game

3

2

1

GO

(inhaling noises)

GAME
                    Canonically, what Kirby eats just pops out somewhere different around outside.
                    Nah, he can pop them out whenever he likes.
                    That's from a non canon anime
                Indeed
                Okay this has probably been asked before but can Kirby get sucked by Dedede or vice versa after already sucking someone else?
                    Can we just stop talking about characters sucking each other?
                        Dude the one who really sucks is me. I suck at the game.
            Wario literally can’t die. Why?  Because he doesn’t feel like it. It’s canon.
                Can confirm

https://preview.redd.it/shvpg0cyhmic1.jpeg?width=951&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9287fef3f4de69096e294b13367f4f8a615f024d
                    He’s just like me Fr
            Just like my ass, then
            Villager puts it in his pocket
        Even if you don't go by lore, just looking at the move is enough. It's a giant freaking explosion.
    What if incineroar revenged those? Twice.
        You don’t have any follow-up so it probably wouldn’t hurt that much
            Your view will change when you die at 15
                Via?
                    Super mega buffed side B. Or perhaps a different move if he has a stronger one.
                        Yeah now you might have a point, but I still disagree. Yes, the big supercharged cat slamming into a person and then vice versa would hurt like hell, but a full-charged Megawatt I think would hurt more and Gigaflare would evaporate you.
                            But that cat can gain the power of that. And stack it.
                                I get that but I still find there to be a distinct difference between a big cat slamming into you and a magic bomb going off right next to you
I think Dedede's Jet Hammer would probably just liquify anyone
    i dont see dedede jet hammer stacking up to the competition tbh. when things like gigaflare  and ike eruption are in the game its tough to match that with big hammer. 

also unrelated but your tangela pfp and layout are awesome
        no shot i just found two people with tangela pfps responding to each other in the smash sub
            peak pokemon pfps gotta meet
    His side smash would cave in your head.
Realistically, Bowser's D-air is an insta kill. 2000 pound spiked dragon crushing you into paste.
    In that case, his down-B also
        ![gif](giphy|4xa9DZ4kiC1YSlQoAz)
    ![gif](giphy|1G8jQehwWp9fy)
Bowsers forward smash would literally break a characters body lol
    counter argument sepiroth final smash
        I’ll get back to you in 4 minutes of final smash
            if sephiroth can destroy a universe in 4 minutes what could he do with his sw-
        Yeah but his attack is so strong it interger overflows and goes back one, making it super weak
            counter argument can you destroy a universe and break integer limit at the same time?
    double leg drop kicks are super inefficient he has way better moves
        I'm legit on team bowser, that dropkick is wtf, and his weight, that is overkill
    *BOWSA KICK*

*OVADORIVU*
Sephiroths final smash
    Nah, you hang on with 1/16 of your life remaining
        Not if it’s the Japanese version
            And he speaks Japanese so I guess it would. You win this round
            Does it just fucking kill you there?
                Yep, but it deals less damage, and I think it’s longer? Don’t quote me on that last bit.
    Ok but Palutenas final smash summons a literal black hole. Black holes typically beat everything, right?
        Counter to the counter, Sephiroth's move in game is called Supernova, where he blows up the sun. When a star of such size as the sun blows up, not only would you be subjected to that blast (as happens in game), but in it's aftermath a blackhold would be left, meaning anything that survives (if anything) would also then be subjected to the blackhole.
            The Sun's not even big enough to go supernova on its own, let alone form a black hole. Even if it did form a black hole, it would have the same gravity as the sun until you're ~650,000 km away.
    Sometimes, others it just gives you a nice flower or a nap. It's got some pretty big middle ground between extremes.
Ridley side special. That thing is brutal
yoshi chewing you up, digesting you, and turning you into an egg seems pretty brutal
    Don't forget shitting you directly off the side of a cliff.

Anyway, thanks for reading this essay
    >Joker has a FUCKING GUN

Jokers gun is actually a model gun, it only works if his opponent thinks its a real gun
        If a kid pulls up to me and the thing sprays a bullet, I'm assuming it's a gun. Even if he just threatens me, they canonically look real enough you can't really tell without close inspection
            That's assuming you're in the metaverse
        Well the more people you tell the less it’ll do so…
        Easy. Bring a real gun. Shoot it. Swap to model gun. Now they believe it's real.
             If i see you swap the gun, that doesn't work.
                But how would you know he's swapping to a model gun and not just using a second gun?
    i ain't reading all of that
        Yea I just gave an upvote for the effort 

Is this how teachers grade work?
        took me like half an hour, and some of it is wrong anyway
    Puff Rollout would probably pack a punch
        Only if fully charged. Otherwise it’s like a toddler rolling down a 3ft tall incline
            vroom
    Kazuya Dragon uppercut is meant to shatter someone’s jaw.
 But isn’t demon fist (or whatever, rising attack) meant to leave the person paralyzed?
        Demon god fist is an electric cloaked punch, similar to EWGF and DU. The move that would cause the most IRL damage would be Devil Beam, if we pull his actual lore power from Tekken. Devil beam easily rips through concrete and metal like it’s paper
            Truuuuuuue
    Hadoken is actually pretty tame, it's been stated that getting hit by it feels more like a punch

K.Rool's blunderbuss is likely more painful, you're getting compressed into the gun

Ridley's grab is the most excruciating move to get hit by, within seconds you're reduced to a red stain on the road
    Are you forgetting Ganondorfs smash attack’s which could probably split your skull in half vertically?
        Up tilt kind of has an explosion, so I think it would be up tilt
    Given that this is Wario we’re talking about...
    Miis aren't real was personal 💀
        I used to play all three of them, but then I played a quickplay gunner who played exactly like a samus that had never seen a controller in their life and now I rarely touch them  


although i would like to pick up brawler soon
    I contest icies. 
Their F-smash would do the most damage, and that's because their height makes it so that they are slamming your knees with heavy mallets, crippling you for life
    Assuming Humans are normal type, Mewtwo's shadow ball doesn't affect us 😜 I'd argue Mewtwo's Upsmash is worst. You're sent through a psychic vortex and go flying. 

So not only are you being sent flying by one of the strongest Psychic Pokémon, you also suffer the fall damage
        It's not a vortex it's a whole god damn spiral galaxy
I feel like Meta Knight’s Drill Rush would be nasty, imagine him drill through you, not only will the wounds be very deep, comparing to most other stabs like Ridley Skewer and Sephiroth Dair, Drill Rush is going to kill you in a much slower and much more painful way
People sleeping on the fact that Pyra’s sword is a massive fucking flamethrower
    Just toss some water on it and it stops working
        They tried that already in Xenoblade but because Pyra is an Aegis blade (super powerful) water doesn’t really affect her
            I’m sorry, but the image of them trying to stop pyra with water balloons and water guns only to get fucking eviscerated by her fucking flamethrower sword is quite humorous.
                "Quite humorous" 💀
                Now I can see that in my head and it’s hilarious 😭
            Did they use salt water or fresh water?
                Assuming fresh
                    Ah that explains it. Since pyra is a demon you need salt water to extinguish her.
                        Bro did not call Pyra a demon 😭
                            Is there anything wrong with what I said?
                                Yes

It’s incorrect
                                    I disagree.
Bayonetta because her wicked weaves' power are measured in megatons
    Some of her really over-the-top moves are measured in Gigatons, especially when her demons are involved.
        And then there is queen sheba with a fist as powerful as the big bang
Probably the fucking Supernova
    Can't even kill in the English version, although Sephiroth does exclusively speak Japanese.
Gannon? Idk what his move set is I’m bad at playing slow characters but point blank when he brings his sword down on you.
Snake grenade
Snake or Steve blowing you up into pieces with actual dynamite and military weaponry would probably not be a fun time
Not counting final smashes, it’d probably be Sonic spin dash. He runs around 750+ miles per hour and getting hit by him would be beyond painful

Counting final smashes, the probably sephiroth. He literally destroys the Earth
    I mean, I think Palu and Mega man summoning black holes beat it out if you consider the ramifications
Snake's f-smash, up smash, grenade, c4, and nikita are all weapons that actually kill irl so I'm pretty sure he wins this one
    Nikita is actually one of the few weapons in the MGS series that doesn't exist irl, and is quite unrealistic.
        Maybe not missiles but remote control explosive drones certainly exist now.
To keep it more intresting let’s just use physical moves. And yes Bowser F-Smash would literally kill someone upon contact
Incineroar's back throw is at least honorable mention
    I didn't need my spine anyway
Anything Kazuya has I feel would result in a broken bone at a minimum
Charizard Flare Blitz.
The I would love I if move did more damage to both precent and  sheild at the cost of. More recoil
I imagine Warlock/Falcon Punch would hurt like hell, with an already muscular character engulfing their entire fist in dark energy or fire before reeling back and punching you.
Doesn’t Sephiroth blow up a planet?
    the entire solar system, actually
    Several.  Supernova blows up the sun which consumes at least Earth, so Mercury and Venus are included.  The full animation from FF7 also includes the meteor crashing through other planets before it reaches the sun.
Imagine Kirby or Yoshi just eating you.
I’d say Gigaflare is the clear winner, however there are other big ones.

Any Sword Characters can do a lot of damage with a sword.

Snake has an army’s worth of explosives and other weaponry, he is probably only bested by Gigaflare.
    Love your profile pic

And my first thought for this post was Ganon F-smash, cleaving someone in two.  Doriyah indeed
        Thank you,

And yeah I agree.
I feel like Sephiroth's Final Smash takes out like. At least half the cast.
    honestly tho😭😭
Honestly Gabon’s sword would just turn you into a literal puddle of organs
![gif](giphy|fVzdQ7TK7hO5ViB2Pp|downsized)

I think um maybe Sephiroth’s FS would do some damage???
Most damage? Kirby consuming you whole. Completely destroys the body. 

Psychologically, Yoshi consuming and expelling you as an egg. Completely destroys the mind
Getting eaten alive and shat out in an egg
Sephiroth Neutral B maybe
Ridley, watch game theory
    Ridley’s side b will literally erase you into the ground
I mean what about Sephiroths final smash he literally destroyed the earth
Roy's fully charged neutral B is the strongest move in the game and kills at 0%
rosa fair slept on
Mewtwo rapid jab
Joker grappling hook because his knife and gun are not real.
Incineroar.
This might be a hot take but R.O.B. gyro. Damage depends on how fast it goes.
Shulk up air
Snake
Sonic or Bowser Jr's down throws.
Corrin’s Front Smash. It’s a Magical Chainsaw Sword. It should rip and tear limbs off, but even for Fire Emblem and other games for it’s rating, it is a bit brutal.
Robin shoots a beam of plasma.
Joker with his pistol

As long as his opponents thinks it’s a gun, intimidated or not (assuming if all the stages bear Mementos’s traits), everyone (save for Sephiroth imo and similar) is at risk.
Idk man I’m pretty sure all of them would have no problem actually killing me.
Christopher Nolan recently made a film about what would happen if two Falcon Punches collided. That would be my vote.
Ridley Down-B?
Little Mac's KO Punch looks pretty painful. Flames come out of his gloves and he punches faster than half a second; thats gotta at least make some of your bones crumble. Also Incineroar's revenge-boosted Side B would give anybody an instant concussion lol
I'd say hero full mana magic burst
    what hero move COULDNT kill a human?
Bowser Jr. Downthrow 😬
Bowser Down B and D-Air would do irreparable damage. Like he’s putting his whole weight into that.
For a melee attack with no magic or such.

Ridley's Skewer, pierces through even space birb armor right through your heart and out through your back.

Basically harpooned by a tail, Steve Irwin unfortunately knew how that felt (RIP)
If Final Smashes are included, Sephiroth's Supernova DESTROYS THE SUN and causes it to go supernova. In FF7, it takes out Pluto, Saturn and Jupiter for good measure, too.   


Besides that, probably Dedede's jet hammer or Bowser Jr's literal cannon
Snake F-Smash
I think any move involving fire. Like Fox and Falco's Up B.

Since they've all possessed the immunity to flames, it's scientifically proven that being set on Fire is the most Painful way to die.
any electric type moves.. hero's zap comes to mind. ya fried !
Ridleys move where he uses his tail to skewer others with. Think of it as a massive bayonet, that goes at ridiculous speeds along with bleeding out within a couple of seconds.
Palutena summons a black hole in her fsmash and I think that beats out gigaflare. Plus, the mega laser puts it over mega man’s plain black hole (or if you count the piltiple mega men firing their lasers it could be better)
Here's an unorganized list of random moves that would probably kill you

Little Mac's KO punch, Bowser's Side B, Ike's Eruption, Marth and Lucina's Critical Hit, Kazuya's Dragon Uppercut, Mii Brawler's Shot Put, Roy's Flare Blade, Villager's Axe
Sephiroth final smash blows up the entire solar system.
Bowser Jr’s Forward Smash just looks so painful to me.

Those 2 spinning drills clashing together could literally eviserate someone to a bloody, gory mess.
If we’re counting final smashes I’d say Sephiroth’s seems pretty powerful.
Sephiroth's gigaflare would send pieces of you flying everywhere
Cloud has a massive sword that a regular human can’t even lift. Anything with the buster sword
I imagine would be fatal
I believe that vore is pretty bad so kirby
If Matpat is to be believed, Ridley using Side B on Big Blue would grind someone down to the bone
Charizard up throw for me. While not the deadliest move, it certainly looks very painful
sonics spindash or maybe his spindash
If final smash is involved, same with logic, sephiroths final smash would be the most devastating
**Explosive flame**

:Palutena
Most Final Smashes
Kirby suck cuz... you die
I believe that Kirby’s neutral B sends the opponent to another dimension
Thunder, Shadow Ball and Flare Blitz are all turning the target into dust
sephiroth gigaflare, its just a mini nuke
If DK punched you, your ribcage would be broken at least. If Bowser Dropkicked you, you're going to a saturn
    I would prefer Saturn number 26
Roy and Chrom Neutral Special go brrrr.
I wouldn't want to get hit by Palutena's final smash. Sucked into a black hole AND hit with a giant laser? I'm good
Ike’s sword is blessed by a god and he, as a human, essentially kills a god with it.

So Eruption would deal a lot of damage to anyone on this roster, save for Sephiroth-but probably really hurt him too. (It cuts through divine wards)

Roy’s Binding Blade is the strongest weapon in the fire emblem universe (I believe) and basically is the living embodiment of “that’s a lot of damage.”
Not really a move but sephiroth can literally destroy the earth
Idk exactly what charge shot is made of but I don't want it anywhere near me, in Smash or irl
    Phazon. The fact how it’s a fictional source of energy makes it even more terrifying to think about wtf it would be like
Steve drops an anvill?
K. Rool up b would break someone’s spinal cord along with all of incineroar’s throws

Dedede down B, fsmash, and up b would turn a person into a pile of mangled meat

Snake would turn you into many little chunks of mangled meat as he has a rocket launcher

Ridley would fuse you to the pavement

Mythra, if we account for Xenoblade 2 blade combos, has a blade combo move called “Gamma Ray” that she can use as she is a light element blade. This means that Mythra or any other light element blade could give someone radiation poisoning

Pyra just burns you

Joker’s gun does absolutely nothing as it’s a fake gun and only works inside Facebook’s metaverse
    K. Rool up throw would break someone’s spinal cord along with all of incineroar’s throws

Dedede down B, fsmash, and up b would turn a person into a pile of mangled meat

Snake would turn you into many little chunks of mangled meat as he has a rocket launcher

Ridley would fuse you to the pavement

Mythra, if we account for Xenoblade 2 blade combos, has a blade combo move called “Gamma Ray” that she can use as she is a light element blade. This means that Mythra or any other light element blade could give someone radiation poisoning

Pyra just burns you

Joker’s gun does absolutely nothing as it’s a fake gun and only works inside Facebook’s metaverse
Y’all are forgetting that Palu up-smash is literally just a giant fucking laser like anybody that gets hit by that is just getting vaporized in an instant lmao
probably any Bayonetta attack, she hits in gigatons alone and with Madama she hits even more gigatons, not toention her guns can break through everything like it's nothing so she one shots everyone there
Bowser down special for sure
Ganondorf Side A or Warlock Punch
Dedede. He would jump on you and you’d die from the sheer velocity of his fall.
Game theory did a video on ridleys side special and how it would just disintegrate you into the pavement
Buster Wolf
Roy Neutral B kills every character at zero. Raw damage. Corin you can get infinite damage with the chainsaw hitbox
Um, samus's fully charged shot


Ganondorf punch due to dark magic
Ganon reverse neutral B
Incineroar darkest lariat after revenge
Link bomb

Charge Shot

Pika/chu's down B

Bowser/Charizard neutral B

G&W 9 (years in prison)

Meta Knight side B

Force Palm

Snake's f-smash

Ridley

Anvil 

EWGF

Ganon f-smash
The falcon punch hits so hard that the air in front of the punch combusts into the shape of a falcon
Ridley's side special would be one of the most painful for sure (you'd pretty much be shredded like cheese on the floor), but Sephiroth casually just hucks Supernovas and *Black Holes.*
Ridley Skewer and Side B, Ike Up B (along with those similar to him), Sephiroth Neutral B, Meta Knight Side B, Kazuya Up Throw, DK Forward Air, Ice Climbers Down B would be the most brutal ways to die in my eyes
jokers pistol deals like 1% per hit but one hit irl would def lead to death
Dedede jet hammer. A massive penguin swinging a jet propelled hammer at you would hurt
Peach frying pan
I don't think bower's forward smash would do that much. I mean, how much weight can you throw foward with your feet in the front?
As much as I'd join the crowd and say Snake grenades and RPG, I wanna mention Steve for two reasons. Anvil, and TNT. No matter how much TNT is placed, I'm sure one bundle will do just as much if not more than an RPG. Oh and anvil? Though looney, at high speed, just say goodbye already like
Bowser jr down grab 😭
You know wii fit does has the power of the sun so…
Ridley Side B literally turns the floor into sandpaper.
Going by like actual lore/feats it's probably one of the JRPG characters. Fire Emblem deep lore is NUTTY for example.
Reversed air warlock is the strongest move in the game
Excluding final smashes, any of the characters that literally eat you like wario Kirby DDD, also mega punches like ganon, falcon, DDD jet hammer, explosives like snakes entire kit, seph neutral B
Ike's f-smash looks very hurty
If we were being realistic I think Samus clears everyone

Energy shield on full body armor equipped with bombs, missiles, electric jumps, a gun that shoots basically lava, and a gun that shoots consolidated energy charged up to the point its bigger than a human
I mean... I think ness and Zelda down throws holding you down and burning you alive would hurt pretty bad...
Snake has a fucking mortar.
Ridley tearing people's faces off is probably up there
Hero's Whack or Thwack instakill so depends how you categorize that I guess
I think about how much it would suck to get hit by Byleth's down air.
I feel like I would be bisected by a few of ganondorf's moves
In terms of stuff that kills you, a lot, sword moves, fire moves, gun moves, explosives, arrows, being eaten alive. All typically very deadly.

But say you have like a titanium crash test dummy and want to put as much force into it as possible to wreck it? Well now we have options to consider. But it’s highly dependant on location too.

If you can shut someone in an unbreakable locker dropping a kamikaze in there where the energy will rebound instead of dissipating will be insane amounts of force.

If you’ve just got an unbreakable wall then het hammering someone into it is likely really devastating.

If your just on like FD or similar, something like pyras f smash pinning someone into the ground before exploding is a really good pick.

Then theres multi hit options which are harder to quantify, like ridleys side B is an extended application of force. Mii gunners f smash is an absolute barrage that are all realistically high damage.
If snakes is using the same grenades as military, it has an instant kill radius of 5 m and a blast radius of 35 m
Sephiroth's Gigaflare
Sephiroth neutral special fully charged or Olimar's white pikmin on somebody.
one swipe (with a lot of force) from cloud’s blade is probably enough to tear a humongous gash in your torso, (given that it’s sharp enough) letting all of your internal organs spill out
I dunno, Sepiroth's Final Smash. 

For funny, I would say Wii Fit Nuetral B. Your geting hit with the sun by a dude who just breathed a bunch.
double leg drop kick kinda sucks
Ridley Side-B
Honestly, a perfectly spaced Simon/richter side smash has always been the move that makes me say ouch
Define “realistically” please? As in, within the realm of realism? Or a move that someone could land in an actual match?
probably crazy hand's portal from smash bros wii u
Probably Byleth, the down B could crush a person’s skull, and that’s not even mentioning their other weapons.
Palutena makes a black hole.
joker has a gun
Psi flash would electrocute the person to death. Probably not the most damaging though.
Sephiroth's neutral B (mini nuke lol)
Captain Falcon. You do not want to be on the receiving end of a punch literally fueled by the divine power of Christ.
Kirby
To make it interesting I'm assuming I have to survive to feel the pain. The first painful probably non lethal move I can think of is Kirby smashing my side with that hammer, recovering from a bunch of crushed or fractured bones sounds like hell
Sephiroth Gigaflare just kills you
Rest
R.O.B’s side special? He spins his metal arms at like, 30rps (give or take).
![gif](giphy|w2crembGmOl8NXKfhK)
Waft in terms of emotional damage.
Bayonetta can shoot hee guns on almost all her moves if you hold down the attack button, she would definitely be the best in the game.
Incineroar after some down Bs
The links have literal bombs that are strong enough to break rock in their games
A literal cannonball from king k rool would fully dismember you
I’ve heard getting boxed up in a PK freeze could be detrimental
Sephiroth literally blows up a planet in his final smash, so probably that.
Piranha Plant's giant spiked ball
Maybe Plants Side b?
Kirby up-throw is a fun one cause it may noz be his potentially strongest move neutral-B it is still a really dangerous. 
Imagine the amount og Gs you'd recieve.
Probably Sephiroth's neutral b
I’m pretty sure that getting sliced with a sword is a OHKO in real life
REALISTICALLY— if Bayonetta were to witch time you, she can do whatever the fuck she wants. She can just gut you on the floor with her D-Smash. I would imagine the pain would be felt in slow motion.

RIDLEY’S DRAG MAN! Wasn’t there like a game theory on that?
bayonetta's final smash is definitely one of the most grotesque ways to die
Prya basically hits you with a 500km flamethrower
Kazuya laser, terry power geyser, palm up smash,  ridley side B, snakes whole moveset basically, mewtwo/Samus neutral b, and sonic side/down b (sonic can move up to mach 5)
People be talking about Sephiroth's finap smash, but be sleeping on PK Starstorm - like, if they were literal stars, probably one would be enough to obliterate the planet (and would be more accurate to describe it as Earth falling into the star), but even if it's just meteorites, it can cause frickin huge damage, like sending maybe all life in the planet to extinction dinosaur-style
Bowser and Charizard's fire can probably cause the most collateral damage if used right, because fire is awful
Any of snake’s military grade high explosives 

And Ganon’s smash attacks would cleave a person in half
After Cloud’s full power Omnislash you’d be able to fit in a tuna can
Snake RPG
I haven't seen anyone talk about Kirby neutral special. You get swallowed and either die instantly or get stored into a pocket dimension for the rest of eternity. Either way, you're done for.
Ganondorf’s forward smash. A 10 foot tall beast of a man swinging a massive sword vertically into your skull? Ouch
B&Ks granade would rip you apart
Mewtwo.  It's a telekinetic with more mental strength (special attack) than literal gods (Arceus: 120, Palkia/Dialga: 150, Mewtwo: 154).  It's mega Y pokedex entry says it can telekinetically crush skyscrapers, and that's a 25% increase in base power (194).  Base Mewtwo can easily crush every stage in the game, not to mention the other characters.
Do final smashes count?
Supernova. Next question.

Surprised not many people mention sephiroth's gigaflare

https://preview.redd.it/nrobfndw5ric1.jpeg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94bd81c3c5c55498082d413da898daf375b400e2
A lot of moves would kill you almost immediately. Like Snake’s explosives, any swing from the sword characters that hits your neck or vitals, etc.

If we’re looking at most painful, there’s stuff like Ridley’s side special, or Steve covering your feet in lava, which would both be agonizing
Samus down tilt and F smash will LITTERALY explode you. Side b and down b will do the same.
personally i think g&w hammer 1 wins /s
Kirby is the (cannonically) strongest in the game, but a drop k8ck is more about weight than raw strength. Imma honestly say bowser. His size and mass changing abilities. Ridley would probably be 2nd followed by Gannon
Just realized I missed "their" as "these"

I'd say kirby, he killed a multiversal god and an immediate of judgment

 so I think he could do some damage
Just realized I missed "their" as "these"

Ridley scrapes you harshly across the stage, you’d definitely die or have significant damage to your body
Sephiroth
Bruh if bowser dro kicked you irl you would be turned into a liquid
Sephiroth would just slice you in half and blow you up
PK FIYA! PK FIYA! PK FIYA! PK FIYA!
for his neutral special, he wields a *gun*.
Sephiroth final smash literally caused a supernova
Just gonna throw Gigaflare out there
Sephroths big Ahh meteor
Little Mac just setting you on fire with that nasty uppercut.
Ridley could turn you into a meat crayon and Snake would blow your limbs off, but I think, just damage wise, Charizard's side B is like getting hit by a flying, burning truck, turning your whole body to mush
Ganondorf would slice you in half with his sword
As much as I love Sephiroth, FFVII, and how much Gigaflare and Supernova can do realistically… (Gigaflare has been known to terraform entire areas)

I feel like everyone forgets that Palutena summons a fucking Black Hole.
Excluding final smashes (specifically Palu and Sephiroth): 

Sephiroth gigaflare is essentially a localized nuke going off next to you

Kirby suck would almost certainly kill you

Yoshi tongue / egg would push you through his entire digestive system, which would be excruciatingly painful

All of Snake's weapons, but especially C4

Ridley side special and down special would both kill you, and the side special would be extremely painful

Getting hit by any sword character's sword directly would also almost certainly kill you

Any of the moves that light you on fire (eg Charizard, Bowser, Simon/Richter, Roy, Pyra, and so on) 

Minecraft TNT going off next to you. A cubic meter of tnt is still only a small fraction of a nuke, but seeing as its basically detonated at your feet, you're still being disintegrated

Thunder from Pika or Pichu would be like being struck by lightning
If we count how much Steve can lift


Then a single punch from him is a guarantee galaxy explosion no doubt
If we count how much Steve can lift


Then a single punch from him is a guarantee galaxy explosion no doubt
WFT literally uses the sun
Riddlys command grab when it takes you off the stage of that one f zero map and he scrapes your face on the asphalt at 350mph
The heavies will pretty much shatter your entire skeleton with most of their moves... Bowser especially in my opinion. Even Joker and Bayo's guns won't do as much, though they will probably kill you in a quicker and cleaner way.

Depends what you ask for and if you consider the entire moveset. Snake could sneak in the podium either way.
Three words: Sephiroth Final Smash.
If final smashes can count as moves, then Sephiroth's final smash...
Gigaflare
Canon Gigaflare
Snake or Sephiroth. It’s just gonna be Hiroshima again. Snake with RPG f smash and Sephiroth with full charge neutral b
Duck Hunt can low key dangerous
Toon link of all things would literally just turn people into paste lmao. Like legit a Nintendo version of The Mask.
Sonic’s Down Throw. Sonic throws you down and spin dashes on top of you. Considering Sonic is as fast as sound, that would probably disintegrate anyone. Not to even mention those hedgehog spikes and mannnn.
Snake F-smash probably wouldn’t feel to good
JR’s Forward Smash and Down Throw would not be pleasant
We speaking irl? I would say either Palutena (legit making a blackhole) or Sephiroth being able to wipe out the solar system with one attack
Literally anything with a gun/rocket/cannon. I would say snake’s entire loadout would be really devastating.
Hero. Oomph, psych up, crit go hard
Steve with his anvil
Doesn’t Roslina create a black hole? (It’s been a minute since I’ve played)
Ridley, ju- just Ridley.
Kazuya’s rage drive (input version) enraged devil kazuya smashing your face into the ground? Oof…
Um ackshually rockets fired from an RPG-7 need to travel a certain distance in order to arm the explosive, so shooting it point blank would realistically do nothing and just make it a glorified bullet 🤓
    Volunteering to get shot in the leg? I’m on it.
    Do you really think a projectile that size and speed impacting at your feet actually needs to explode to ruin the day of everyone involved?
    Um ackshually Solid Snake(not to be confused with Big Boss[not to be confused with Venom Snake]) uses a Nikita which is a fictional rocket launcher
        Correct, but that’s his side special. He uses the RPG-7 for his forward smash.
        [Not to be confused with Solidus Snake]
            No! That is NOT Solid Snake!

- Iroquois Pliskin.
                *Monkey noises*  
\- Pipo Snake
                Shame that snake died on that oil tanker.
    Um ackshually only some RPG7 rounds have an arming distance. Most common HE/frag rounds are just tip detonated. Look up horror stories of Taliban tripping with the tip cover off and going kablooey.
    I still wouldnt want to get hit in the shin with a high velocity foot long metal nerf dart
    No actually, I’m pretty sure rpg-7s are armed once you remove the pin.
His c4 on the other hand would be devastating in real life.

Other than final smashes I'm not sure any other character is realistically on the level of "I'm bringing down that apartment complex with a button" in their basic moveset.

Maybe sephiroth.
    Sephiroth's final smash is so anime that I think we forget he basically destroys multiple worlds and let's that impact hit you.
        Yeah Lots of the cast have a world ending or stronger final smash which is why I excluded them
            How many of the cast have world ending final smashes? Kirby's is a maybe, K Rool's is island destroying, a lot of them get directed on destroying a ship, not a world. How many of them end a world, or get to Sephiroth's level of ending a galaxy?
                as far as planet destroying and up at the least we have:

* Sephiroth

* Ridley if you are counting a small moon as world ending, but that ones a stretch i guess.

* palutena as its a blackhole. a blackhole that size would destroy the earth in no time, and would weigh more than the earth as it is. hell a blackhole the size of a tennis ball would destroy the earth if it didnt evaporate in a few seconds.

then you have a couple that could eventually destroy a world in the long term, like iceclimbers creating an ice age, and a few that could possibly destroy a world if it was focused on them like a few of the big giant laser attacks and such.
                    So, in the end, it's like 3, maybe, and the rest are long-term, maybe. Sephiroth's final smash would result in a mazzive blackhole. In the end, Sephiroth's is the most destructive, with an argument for Palutena's to be worse. Like, the Ice-Climber's summon a single mountain of ice, not an ice age. And the argument for those lasers depends on how long the laser can last, what the intensity of it is, where it gets focused, and so much more. They are potentially destructive, not fully galaxy destroying like Sephiroth's. Therefore, the worst is Sephiroth's.
                        either way, its why i excluded final smashes in the first place.
Kid named Soldier:
Ever seen that video of the RPG misfiring in the guy's hands? It's pretty bad but he lived
It’s bad for Snake cuz he in the blast radius. Tho i think Ridley or Ganondorf could survive? idk cuz i dont play those fames but they look scary
Depends on the character. Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening. 

But Snake? Half of his moves would causes serious loss of life. Maybe he’d stop pointing his RPG at the ground lol
    > Half of his moves would cause serious loss of life. 

As opposed to funny loss of life?
        That would be a gun from a very cartoony game
            OMOCHAO GUN
        Lmao get fucked

            And then we shit ourselves.
        Idk man I think getting suplexed by a humanoid cat would be a funny way to go
            Yes
        https://preview.redd.it/dkkn8flrsmic1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49c1988849ea35b846c17ae67744191f4c870c65

Funny loss of life
            Ironic. Joker gun causes serious loss of life while Joker gun causes funny loss of life
    The odd thing with Joker's gun is that the only reason the thing works in his games is because the enemies think it's real.

This means either Mario and the others think it's real, or the more likely option, it's actually a real one in SSBU since you can make real ones that are very powerful, in Persona 5 but you need to increase your Confidant with the Airsoft shopkeeper.
        Ultimate is in Mementos confirmed
            Mementos is in Ultimate also confirmed

![gif](giphy|lXu72d4iKwqek)
    >Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

Depends on the Model gun. Satanael's for example...
    Snake using C4 to recover would send him way higher than in game, and in more directions at once
    But given that mementos is a stage and that he has the ability to use his persona, the entire game takes place in the metaverse where the gun is real because people believe it to be real.
        Not true persona's can be summoned in the realworld. It is just extremely difficult.
    I mean, Smash treats him like he's in the Metaverse, so his gun would function and hurt as much as a real one.

But yeah, Snake would solo Joker.
    >Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

*Sigh* So we have decided once again to strip Joker from his powers.

![gif](giphy|RGVqj8v6aoY2UFzWYa)
Bayonetta would put most mass shooters to shame
did somebody say gun?
Robins neutral B tho.
A brief rundown: On asphalt, the assumed roadway of Big Blue, Ridley is going faster than 600 mph and dragging you with him, meaning your body leaves so much skin and other gore on the pavement you don’t exist anymore.
    also one of the thing he based it's intensity on was ridley's height, but he failed to calculate his taunt that makes him stand upright, meaning your gonna be injured way worse then MatPat said you would.
        Not to mention he can instantly stab you in the skull with his tail, so there's that too if you survive the first onslaught.
    *meat crayon
    What if you’re Steve and your back is a flat surface
        I guess the road would function like sandpaper
    basically, dont fuck with ridley. ever.
    Matpat theory alert
    Faster than even the Blue Hedgehog.
An old execution method used to be dragging somebody behind a running horse. Or keel-hauling somebody (dragging them on the underside of a ship, which would have tough barnacles growing on it) 

Scraping/dragging is a very painful and not immediate way to die.
Yeah, since it keeps up with Big Blue he scaled it to move at super sonic speed.
It’s lessened if you’re not on big blue, because he drags you at a consistent relative speed
I second this. Gigaflare canonically shreds entire teams of warriors and terraforms regions.
    And Wario can fucking eat it
        And kirby can eat Wario. Kirby suck is at the top then?
            Honestly yeah. Kirby shouldn't have to just pop out the fighter he eats. Canonically I believe they're just swallowed and basically put into a pocket dimension.

So effectively, Kirby just erases people

                Nah, he can pop them out whenever he likes.
                That's from a non canon anime
            Indeed
            Okay this has probably been asked before but can Kirby get sucked by Dedede or vice versa after already sucking someone else?
                Can we just stop talking about characters sucking each other?
                    Dude the one who really sucks is me. I suck at the game.
        Wario literally can’t die. Why?  Because he doesn’t feel like it. It’s canon.
            Can confirm

        Just like my ass, then
        Villager puts it in his pocket
    Even if you don't go by lore, just looking at the move is enough. It's a giant freaking explosion.
What if incineroar revenged those? Twice.
    You don’t have any follow-up so it probably wouldn’t hurt that much
        Your view will change when you die at 15
            Via?
                Super mega buffed side B. Or perhaps a different move if he has a stronger one.
                    Yeah now you might have a point, but I still disagree. Yes, the big supercharged cat slamming into a person and then vice versa would hurt like hell, but a full-charged Megawatt I think would hurt more and Gigaflare would evaporate you.
                        But that cat can gain the power of that. And stack it.
                            I get that but I still find there to be a distinct difference between a big cat slamming into you and a magic bomb going off right next to you
i dont see dedede jet hammer stacking up to the competition tbh. when things like gigaflare  and ike eruption are in the game its tough to match that with big hammer. 

also unrelated but your tangela pfp and layout are awesome
    no shot i just found two people with tangela pfps responding to each other in the smash sub
        peak pokemon pfps gotta meet
His side smash would cave in your head.
In that case, his down-B also

counter argument sepiroth final smash
    I’ll get back to you in 4 minutes of final smash
        if sephiroth can destroy a universe in 4 minutes what could he do with his sw-
    Yeah but his attack is so strong it interger overflows and goes back one, making it super weak
        counter argument can you destroy a universe and break integer limit at the same time?
double leg drop kicks are super inefficient he has way better moves
    I'm legit on team bowser, that dropkick is wtf, and his weight, that is overkill
*BOWSA KICK*

*OVADORIVU*
Nah, you hang on with 1/16 of your life remaining
    Not if it’s the Japanese version
        And he speaks Japanese so I guess it would. You win this round
        Does it just fucking kill you there?
            Yep, but it deals less damage, and I think it’s longer? Don’t quote me on that last bit.
Ok but Palutenas final smash summons a literal black hole. Black holes typically beat everything, right?
    Counter to the counter, Sephiroth's move in game is called Supernova, where he blows up the sun. When a star of such size as the sun blows up, not only would you be subjected to that blast (as happens in game), but in it's aftermath a blackhold would be left, meaning anything that survives (if anything) would also then be subjected to the blackhole.
        The Sun's not even big enough to go supernova on its own, let alone form a black hole. Even if it did form a black hole, it would have the same gravity as the sun until you're ~650,000 km away.
Sometimes, others it just gives you a nice flower or a nap. It's got some pretty big middle ground between extremes.
Don't forget shitting you directly off the side of a cliff.
>Joker has a FUCKING GUN

Jokers gun is actually a model gun, it only works if his opponent thinks its a real gun
    If a kid pulls up to me and the thing sprays a bullet, I'm assuming it's a gun. Even if he just threatens me, they canonically look real enough you can't really tell without close inspection
        That's assuming you're in the metaverse
    Well the more people you tell the less it’ll do so…
    Easy. Bring a real gun. Shoot it. Swap to model gun. Now they believe it's real.
         If i see you swap the gun, that doesn't work.
            But how would you know he's swapping to a model gun and not just using a second gun?
i ain't reading all of that
    Yea I just gave an upvote for the effort 

Is this how teachers grade work?
    took me like half an hour, and some of it is wrong anyway
Puff Rollout would probably pack a punch
    Only if fully charged. Otherwise it’s like a toddler rolling down a 3ft tall incline
        vroom
Kazuya Dragon uppercut is meant to shatter someone’s jaw.
 But isn’t demon fist (or whatever, rising attack) meant to leave the person paralyzed?
    Demon god fist is an electric cloaked punch, similar to EWGF and DU. The move that would cause the most IRL damage would be Devil Beam, if we pull his actual lore power from Tekken. Devil beam easily rips through concrete and metal like it’s paper
        Truuuuuuue
Hadoken is actually pretty tame, it's been stated that getting hit by it feels more like a punch

K.Rool's blunderbuss is likely more painful, you're getting compressed into the gun

Ridley's grab is the most excruciating move to get hit by, within seconds you're reduced to a red stain on the road
Are you forgetting Ganondorfs smash attack’s which could probably split your skull in half vertically?
    Up tilt kind of has an explosion, so I think it would be up tilt
Given that this is Wario we’re talking about...
Miis aren't real was personal 💀
    I used to play all three of them, but then I played a quickplay gunner who played exactly like a samus that had never seen a controller in their life and now I rarely touch them  


although i would like to pick up brawler soon
I contest icies. 
Their F-smash would do the most damage, and that's because their height makes it so that they are slamming your knees with heavy mallets, crippling you for life
Assuming Humans are normal type, Mewtwo's shadow ball doesn't affect us 😜 I'd argue Mewtwo's Upsmash is worst. You're sent through a psychic vortex and go flying. 

So not only are you being sent flying by one of the strongest Psychic Pokémon, you also suffer the fall damage
    It's not a vortex it's a whole god damn spiral galaxy
Just toss some water on it and it stops working
    They tried that already in Xenoblade but because Pyra is an Aegis blade (super powerful) water doesn’t really affect her
        I’m sorry, but the image of them trying to stop pyra with water balloons and water guns only to get fucking eviscerated by her fucking flamethrower sword is quite humorous.
            "Quite humorous" 💀
            Now I can see that in my head and it’s hilarious 😭
        Did they use salt water or fresh water?
            Assuming fresh
                Ah that explains it. Since pyra is a demon you need salt water to extinguish her.
                    Bro did not call Pyra a demon 😭
                        Is there anything wrong with what I said?
                            Yes

It’s incorrect
                                I disagree.
Some of her really over-the-top moves are measured in Gigatons, especially when her demons are involved.
    And then there is queen sheba with a fist as powerful as the big bang
Can't even kill in the English version, although Sephiroth does exclusively speak Japanese.
I mean, I think Palu and Mega man summoning black holes beat it out if you consider the ramifications
Nikita is actually one of the few weapons in the MGS series that doesn't exist irl, and is quite unrealistic.
    Maybe not missiles but remote control explosive drones certainly exist now.
I didn't need my spine anyway
the entire solar system, actually
Several.  Supernova blows up the sun which consumes at least Earth, so Mercury and Venus are included.  The full animation from FF7 also includes the meteor crashing through other planets before it reaches the sun.
Love your profile pic

And my first thought for this post was Ganon F-smash, cleaving someone in two.  Doriyah indeed
    Thank you,

And yeah I agree.
honestly tho😭😭
Ridley’s side b will literally erase you into the ground
what hero move COULDNT kill a human?
I would prefer Saturn number 26
Phazon. The fact how it’s a fictional source of energy makes it even more terrifying to think about wtf it would be like
K. Rool up throw would break someone’s spinal cord along with all of incineroar’s throws

Dedede down B, fsmash, and up b would turn a person into a pile of mangled meat

Snake would turn you into many little chunks of mangled meat as he has a rocket launcher

Ridley would fuse you to the pavement

Mythra, if we account for Xenoblade 2 blade combos, has a blade combo move called “Gamma Ray” that she can use as she is a light element blade. This means that Mythra or any other light element blade could give someone radiation poisoning

Pyra just burns you

Joker’s gun does absolutely nothing as it’s a fake gun and only works inside Facebook’s metaverse
Volunteering to get shot in the leg? I’m on it.
Do you really think a projectile that size and speed impacting at your feet actually needs to explode to ruin the day of everyone involved?
Um ackshually Solid Snake(not to be confused with Big Boss[not to be confused with Venom Snake]) uses a Nikita which is a fictional rocket launcher
    Correct, but that’s his side special. He uses the RPG-7 for his forward smash.
    [Not to be confused with Solidus Snake]
        No! That is NOT Solid Snake!

            *Monkey noises*

            Shame that snake died on that oil tanker.
Um ackshually only some RPG7 rounds have an arming distance. Most common HE/frag rounds are just tip detonated. Look up horror stories of Taliban tripping with the tip cover off and going kablooey.
I still wouldnt want to get hit in the shin with a high velocity foot long metal nerf dart
No actually, I’m pretty sure rpg-7s are armed once you remove the pin.
Sephiroth's final smash is so anime that I think we forget he basically destroys multiple worlds and let's that impact hit you.
    Yeah Lots of the cast have a world ending or stronger final smash which is why I excluded them
        How many of the cast have world ending final smashes? Kirby's is a maybe, K Rool's is island destroying, a lot of them get directed on destroying a ship, not a world. How many of them end a world, or get to Sephiroth's level of ending a galaxy?
            as far as planet destroying and up at the least we have:

* Sephiroth

* Ridley if you are counting a small moon as world ending, but that ones a stretch i guess.

* palutena as its a blackhole. a blackhole that size would destroy the earth in no time, and would weigh more than the earth as it is. hell a blackhole the size of a tennis ball would destroy the earth if it didnt evaporate in a few seconds.

then you have a couple that could eventually destroy a world in the long term, like iceclimbers creating an ice age, and a few that could possibly destroy a world if it was focused on them like a few of the big giant laser attacks and such.
                So, in the end, it's like 3, maybe, and the rest are long-term, maybe. Sephiroth's final smash would result in a mazzive blackhole. In the end, Sephiroth's is the most destructive, with an argument for Palutena's to be worse. Like, the Ice-Climber's summon a single mountain of ice, not an ice age. And the argument for those lasers depends on how long the laser can last, what the intensity of it is, where it gets focused, and so much more. They are potentially destructive, not fully galaxy destroying like Sephiroth's. Therefore, the worst is Sephiroth's.
                    either way, its why i excluded final smashes in the first place.

Funny loss of life
        Ironic. Joker gun causes serious loss of life while Joker gun causes funny loss of life
The odd thing with Joker's gun is that the only reason the thing works in his games is because the enemies think it's real.

This means either Mario and the others think it's real, or the more likely option, it's actually a real one in SSBU since you can make real ones that are very powerful, in Persona 5 but you need to increase your Confidant with the Airsoft shopkeeper.
    Ultimate is in Mementos confirmed

>Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

Depends on the Model gun. Satanael's for example...
Snake using C4 to recover would send him way higher than in game, and in more directions at once
But given that mementos is a stage and that he has the ability to use his persona, the entire game takes place in the metaverse where the gun is real because people believe it to be real.
    Not true persona's can be summoned in the realworld. It is just extremely difficult.
I mean, Smash treats him like he's in the Metaverse, so his gun would function and hurt as much as a real one.

But yeah, Snake would solo Joker.
>Jokers model gun isn’t all that threatening.

*Sigh* So we have decided once again to strip Joker from his powers.

also one of the thing he based it's intensity on was ridley's height, but he failed to calculate his taunt that makes him stand upright, meaning your gonna be injured way worse then MatPat said you would.
    Not to mention he can instantly stab you in the skull with his tail, so there's that too if you survive the first onslaught.

        Super mega buffed side B. Or perhaps a different move if he has a stronger one.
            Yeah now you might have a point, but I still disagree. Yes, the big supercharged cat slamming into a person and then vice versa would hurt like hell, but a full-charged Megawatt I think would hurt more and Gigaflare would evaporate you.
                But that cat can gain the power of that. And stack it.
                    I get that but I still find there to be a distinct difference between a big cat slamming into you and a magic bomb going off right next to you
peak pokemon pfps gotta meet
if sephiroth can destroy a universe in 4 minutes what could he do with his sw-
counter argument can you destroy a universe and break integer limit at the same time?
And he speaks Japanese so I guess it would. You win this round
Does it just fucking kill you there?
    Yep, but it deals less damage, and I think it’s longer? Don’t quote me on that last bit.
The Sun's not even big enough to go supernova on its own, let alone form a black hole. Even if it did form a black hole, it would have the same gravity as the sun until you're ~650,000 km away.
That's assuming you're in the metaverse
 If i see you swap the gun, that doesn't work.
    But how would you know he's swapping to a model gun and not just using a second gun?

Truuuuuuue
I’m sorry, but the image of them trying to stop pyra with water balloons and water guns only to get fucking eviscerated by her fucking flamethrower sword is quite humorous.
    "Quite humorous" 💀
    Now I can see that in my head and it’s hilarious 😭
Did they use salt water or fresh water?
    Assuming fresh
        Ah that explains it. Since pyra is a demon you need salt water to extinguish her.
            Bro did not call Pyra a demon 😭
                Is there anything wrong with what I said?
                    Yes

It’s incorrect
                        I disagree.
No! That is NOT Solid Snake!

    Shame that snake died on that oil tanker.
How many of the cast have world ending final smashes? Kirby's is a maybe, K Rool's is island destroying, a lot of them get directed on destroying a ship, not a world. How many of them end a world, or get to Sephiroth's level of ending a galaxy?
    as far as planet destroying and up at the least we have:

* Sephiroth

* Ridley if you are counting a small moon as world ending, but that ones a stretch i guess.

* palutena as its a blackhole. a blackhole that size would destroy the earth in no time, and would weigh more than the earth as it is. hell a blackhole the size of a tennis ball would destroy the earth if it didnt evaporate in a few seconds.

then you have a couple that could eventually destroy a world in the long term, like iceclimbers creating an ice age, and a few that could possibly destroy a world if it was focused on them like a few of the big giant laser attacks and such.
        So, in the end, it's like 3, maybe, and the rest are long-term, maybe. Sephiroth's final smash would result in a mazzive blackhole. In the end, Sephiroth's is the most destructive, with an argument for Palutena's to be worse. Like, the Ice-Climber's summon a single mountain of ice, not an ice age. And the argument for those lasers depends on how long the laser can last, what the intensity of it is, where it gets focused, and so much more. They are potentially destructive, not fully galaxy destroying like Sephiroth's. Therefore, the worst is Sephiroth's.
            either way, its why i excluded final smashes in the first place.
OMOCHAO GUN
And then we shit ourselves.
Yes
Ironic. Joker gun causes serious loss of life while Joker gun causes funny loss of life
Mementos is in Ultimate also confirmed

Honestly yeah. Kirby shouldn't have to just pop out the fighter he eats. Canonically I believe they're just swallowed and basically put into a pocket dimension.

So effectively, Kirby just erases people
    That would be a fun game

    Canonically, what Kirby eats just pops out somewhere different around outside.
    Nah, he can pop them out whenever he likes.
    That's from a non canon anime
Indeed
Okay this has probably been asked before but can Kirby get sucked by Dedede or vice versa after already sucking someone else?
    Can we just stop talking about characters sucking each other?
        Dude the one who really sucks is me. I suck at the game.
Can confirm
