[[Who had the best reveal trailer]]


In my opinion, Sephiroth had the most badass one. The way he just cuts the god-like entity Galeem in half with no problem just to fight everyone himself was incredible


It’s said that Sephiroth wasn’t really invited to Smash. He just heard that Cloud was in and showed up.
    Well duh he can’t do 5 minutes without traumatizing Cloud
        I heard he was happy, so I came to change that
        Smh, just kiss already
        Sephi really said “Bitch,did I catch you having fun?!”
        And sora chased him down with the most wtf factor reveal of them all
        And then sora said “nuh uh”
    The abysmal representation of FF7 compared to every other 3rd party fighter before Sephiroth joined made his inclusion so unexpected. And the way they incorporated so many characters, even third-party ones, into the CGI portion of the trailer made it even better. The CGI was what was missing from Cloud's trailer and from all Smash 4 trailer DLC trailers, which gives it that extra flair.
    Cloud: “It’s nice fighting against an enemy not set on traumatizing me every 10 seconds.”

Sephiroth: “And I took that personally”
        Sephiroth heard Cloud was suffering to Galeem and was like: "I am the only one allowed to make Cloud suffer."
        “Why do I hear boss music??”
            #*SEPHIROTH*
                https://youtu.be/PwDPOxWyoXE?si=r8I-G0on6WXsdX2B
            Said Galeem
            That's was exactly the trailer
    And then Sora heard Sephiroth was in Smash and did the same thing.
        Cloud told Sora about Sephiroth because he knew he could take care of him, lvl 1 and no damage taken.
            SOOOORRRAAAAA SEPHIROTH IS BULLYING ME!

hold my keyblade
    As Sephiroth said ‘I will never be a memory’
    Why didn’t Waluigi do the same? :(
    And they let him in because they thought he was another silver haired main antagonist with a katana, the difference being one is shirtless, the other is Motivated.
    Then Sora heard Cloud and Sephiroth were in Smash so he crashed the party too
    The 6th fighter that was added was not actually Sora, it was Sephitroth showing up unannounced... (in his announcement trailer)
    lol, Cloud called Sora to vent and Sora just showed up to beat Sephiroth senseless again.
With bias, Steve.

Ignoring bias, probably Sephiroth.
    Steve broke twitter i think that makes it objective. Best overall reveal for me was Joker. Bias yes. But my mans havked TGA.

When Sora was revealed every member of the game club ran out of class to celebrate in my school tho so that was pretty impactful for me.
        Breaking Twitter hasn't happened since Michael Jackson's death.
        Breaking Twitter doesn’t mean the trailer was good 😭 it’s more just the fact Minecraft Steve was there. Sephiroth’s trailer is leagues ahead of Steve’s
        Maybe best reaction to a reveal trailer, but definitely not best trailer itself
        I mean to be fair, I think it was the internet dying over Minecraft Steve in Smash Bros, not the Steve reveal trailer. Minecraft *is* the most popular and best selling game in the world barring Tetris.
    I will admit as a minecrafter, Steve’s was really good, the music was epic
    Exactly how I feel but with Sora. I DIED when Sora was announced.  


But Sephiroth's trailer went *hard.*
        They really gave Sephiroth the full edge lord introduction that he deserved
            Not edgelord, new final boss introduction
                A little bit of both
                    Plus, he sensed Cloud was having fun with new friends and/or suffering without him.
        I died too when Sora was announced, but for a different reason
    Sephiroth's was insane and I don't know how anything equivalent could ever be repeated. All the build up to the reveal only for One Winged Angel to start and from the first bar everyone knows exactly who it is before they even see the character. One of the most iconic villains with one of the most iconic themes.  I'm not usually one for reaction videos, but watching streamers react to that trailer and hearing the first few notes of OWA is super fun.
        I think it’s because it might have originally been the final trailer since we know sora was added later. That’s why there’s tons of third party characters from other companies in this trailer.
King K. rool has a fairly funny reveal and Banjos was a funny homage to that trailer even including K. rool chilling with the kongs. It wasn’t the most hype trailer but it was a pretty good trailer, both of them for similar reason
    Dedede trolling was perfect.
        Especially since Sakurai voices Dedede
Ridley or K Rool
    K Rools was amazing. I loved they referenced again in Banjo and Kazooies
        I think K Rool and Ridley are both good for the reason that they leaned into the joke. For Ridley it was the “too big” joke, and for K Rool it was the “everybody knows it’s him, so lets do this Dedede gag.
        and then referenced them again in the banjo trailer
Joker was the most special event wise

Sephiroth coolest

Sora most impactful (didn’t make sense, I was like dark souls? But the music flood in with the end to smash is nice)

Aegis is the only good fake out one imo (Isabelle being the runner up). Plant would win this category but lack of cinematic and use of in game model made him easy to spot as surprising as his reveal was
    I was so hyped for Dark Souls just to end up getting Sora's goofy clown shoe ass
        I know the damn random campfire and forge sound as Mario went in was such a odd direction choice
            Literally the creation myth of the Dark Souls universe is that the world was dark and lifeless but then a fire spontaneously appeared and creatures came from the darkness and reached into the flame.

Sora reveal is the world is dark and lifeless but then a fire spontaneously appears and Mario comes from the darkness and reaches into the flame.
                I know they'd never admit to this being the case for obvious reasons, but I'd love to know that they did that intentionally. Just one massive troll move.
                Sora said this in KH1… “the heart may be weak, and sometimes, it may even give in. But I’ve learned, that deep down there’s a light that never goes out”
        glad i wasn't the only one
    Imagine Solair Joining smash
Ridley had a pretty good one
    After being Rekted in brawl TWICE he said not again when samus showed up. He really did hit the big time
    Yeah Ridley was the first character to kill Mario in these trailers. Funniest shit ever
Piranha Plant because it was funny…
    Piranha Plant because Plant...
    shit was mega hype too
    “They’d probably add Piranha Plant to smash before Waluigi…”
For my top 3

Sora hands down is number 1, even setting aside my love for KH, you can tell how much effort it incorporates of him being the final fighter, as well as capturing the magic of KH

Then it’s Sephiroth, just finish FF7 around that time and greatly wanted him in Smash, then when the trailer came I absolutely lost it. Also a really good trailer since you didn’t really know who it was until One Winged Angel played. 

Joker is number 3, really hyped character and love the aesthetic of the trailer. 

Honorable mention to Inkling since that also was the reveal of Ultimate as a whole.
    Idk if you’re actually setting aside your bias towards KH, if we even the playing field and ignore how heavily requested sora was, his trailer was pretty meh.  it’s just all the characters sitting in a black void, then mario picks up a flaming sword and it’s revealed to be sora’s sword.  If it were any other anime swordsman (like byleth for instance), it’d be a pretty boring trailer.  I don’t think it compares to sephiroth showing up and one shotting the final boss of the story mode, and then wiping the floor with the entire cast.
        As someone who wasn't a KH fan at the time till recently, I don't know what you're on to say the trailer was meh as it was very emotional for the people who did want him in. Sephiroth's was hype but a trailer doesn't need to be hype to be gud

Byleth's was boring cuz there wasn't a dang thing going on and was overall very bland, mainly just to promote Three Houses. That was pretty much it
            [deleted]
                Ok, ignoring the people then, as I said for someone who wasn't even a fan back then, it was still a great trailer. It's a last fighter trailer that's basically Disney-fied. I have no idea what u were expecting for it to be hype by your definition and even then, it was still hype but more in the emotional sense. 

And once again, a trailer not being hype does not mean it wasn't good. That makes no sense
                    [deleted]
                        >the trailer by itself is nothing special. 

Did we forget Sora was the literal last fighter? And thing is, I also personally think Sora's is the best trailer, and that's an opinion without bias. This was an opinion I had when I first saw the trailer but just in general, as we established, it's a great trailer. And thing is, to answer ur question, obviously Byleth being in Sephiroth's is gonna be more hype. But this entire argument is all about a matter of opinion. My point is both trailers serve a different emotion than the other. Just cuz one has more hype presentation doesn't take away from the other. U hold Sephiroth's trailer in higher regard but Sora's is also great for the momentous celebration of him being the final fighter. Ignoring that makes u look somewhat ignorant
                            [deleted]
                                I give up. Again, I don't know what u were expecting, it's a Disney-fied reveal trailer. To me, the trailer was beautiful. Which is why I like it more than Sephiroth's personally. But that wasn't the point I was trying to make and the bottom line is, the entire argument at the end of the day is a matter of opinion as u seem to hold Sephiroth's trailer in higher regard simply cuz more smashy, smashy stuff is happening but people simply like a more emotional trailer
        The trailer itself was minimal but not because it's easy but to sell the impact of the announcement. The trailer is just as much about Sora as it is on the final addition to ultimate. The symbolism in the trailer about the ending of this great crossover with a highly demanded character is brilliant and isn't ruined with any drawn-out scene. They were able to do something like this because of how popular and iconic Sora is, of course no one else could be reveal this way.

Sure they could've had an awesome fighting scene mixed in or a more faithful representation of the kh but I feel it was perfect for what it was meant to be. A short simple trailer made to reveal the last character for a smash direct. They already learnt from their mistakes with Byleth what not to do in a reveal during a smash direct.

Sora's reveal is like Sonic's where it will be remembered more for how incredible the reveal itself was than the actual cinematic and that will definitely never be forgotten. I'm just glad they finally learned how to properly end a smash roster.
            [deleted]
        When I first saw the sora trailer I got really hype because I thought it was gonna be a Dark Souls rep
    as someone who hasen't play KH, I think his trailer was very lame

its just all the characters standing there and then someone comes flying in.

I can see it being cool for the people that really wanted him, but as someone who had no idea who he was, it was just like, "oh cool, its that character people wanted" but the trailer wasn't cool at all.
    You definitely haven't taken your love of kingdom hearts out of your ranking if you aren't ranking it as one of the worst trailers in the series. Rewatch the trailer and you'll realise that any hype you got was out of excitement for the character itself, not because the trailer was any good. The first 45 seconds is spent just showing off the fighters standing completely still, doing nothing. Then later on there is 25 seconds where nothing is happening again other than Sora just slowly flying over people's heads. And even putting aside that over half the trailer was spent on 2 extremely long shots of nothing happening, it also lacks things that all the other trailers have such as interesting visuals due to taking place in a black void
Simon and Richter.  Classic Castlevania bosses + Luigi = perfection.
Kazuya.
My top three would be 

3. Pyra / Mythra: Mainly because how unique it was, for pretty much every other trailer we knew that it was a Smash Trailer, but their trailer honestly led me on thinking it was a Xenoblade 2 DLC or something. So I was happily surprised with the twist of it being a Smash Trailer. Rex (mainly for Pyra / Mythra) was one of my most requested pre-release characters and with them being a spirit I was so happy with the twist.

2. Banjo and Kazooie: I loved Rare trailers with the Rare characters chilling then the silhouette of a highly requested character would appear just for them to be revealed to be another character pulling a prank just for the character to wreck them. Banjo was a fun unexpected surprise and having the Rare characters cheer for him and the characters at the end posing was nice.

1. Steve: Sonic punching Mario into Minecraft will never get old.
Sephiroth really solved the plot of the game in one slice, almost Fucking killed mario and fought with cloud. Tell me there was a more badass trailer
My personal fav was sepiroths but another one that was really good was soras, it really managed to capture the feeling of the final fighter
My top 3 would be Sephiroth, Sora and Steve, Sephiroth had the best CGI hands down and Sora and Steve were just insane additions, the hype they generated is gonna be hard to replicate in future reveals
Sephiroth. It had everything. The hype. The action. The music. It was animated beautifully. Especially the segment of Cloud vs Sephiroth. It was even able to sneak in some comedy with Mario getting stabbed.
    Mario getting fakeout fucking murdered is the best moment in any reveal trailer lmao
    Seeing Bayonetta and Greninja take on Sephiroth was, for me, was kinda wild, too. I just love seeing characters that you never think would interact with each other in the same frame. I got the same kind of feeling with the World of Light trailer seeing Sonic and Pikachu running together.
My top 5 are 

1. Sora

2. Sephiroth

3. Hero

4. Kazuya

5. Ridley
Tie between inkling, sora and k rool, inkling revealed smash, k rool had the best visual trailer imo, and sora closed it out with another great trailer
Anyone who doesn't say Sephiroth is lying to themselves and everyone around them.

Dude cut Galeem in half and bodied a few characters on his way to fuck with Cloud *again*

I've never even played Finak Fantasy but that shit was so hype
Piranha Plant.

I will not comment any further.
Sephiroth.
Sephiroth.
Sephiroth 100%
Sora held the most tension within the trailer and that was iconic. Steve was a massive jumpscare and that was iconic as well.
My ordered top 3 trailers would be Simons, Ridleys, Kazuyas
joker fuckin hijacked the game awards s tier trailer too
Joker, and It's not even close. If anyone remembers, this was revealed at the game awards. The entire place "lost power" because the phantom thieves invaded it. We all thought it was a new persona thing, but the absolute crazy switch up when the smash letter was revealed was absolutely insane
In Ultimate?

1. Joker

2. Sephiroth

3. Inkling

4. Ridley

5. Ken and Incineroar

.

.

.


21. Byleth
    Literally the byleth reveal was like a slowburn reveal for what everyone knew immediately was a FE character. Didn't help how no one really expected the second pass to be released, and assumed that Byleth was going to be the last character. I don't really hate Byleth in the game though, but just a super soft reveal
        It sucks because it was clearly not made to be in a smash direct. The slow start would've worked perfectly if it had been in a regular Nintendo direct like Pyra/Mythra. The trailer's was meant to have people question what it's about but that's irrelevant since it's in a Smash direct.
banjo, he had BY FAR the most hype of anyone here
While Sora’s trailer was definitely the best way to bring Ultimate to a close, when you remove the context of when the reveal happened, Sephiroth’s trailer is absolutely the best.
- the reaction to Steve's trailer literally crashed Twitter for a couple hours

- Simon and Richter's was cool, and also the fact that Luigi literally died was hilarious 

- Sephiroth's was even cooler, and also had a good fake Mario death

- K Rool's and Banjo's went pretty hard as well
Joker’s reveal, hands down. I completely lost my shit and cried happy tears that night lol
    They did the style of P5 Justice, and the Arsène bit at the end was icing on the cake
I feel like Sephiroth's goes hardest, but I like Steve's the most just because of the real-world reaction. He broke Twitter.
    Sora has entered the chat
Where is steve
i missed the portion of the banjo reveal where the jiggy bounced across the screen and it made the reveal 100x better for me. i had 0 idea it was banjo until they showed his shadow and i nearly pissed myself.
Three way tie between Joker, Steve, and Sephiroth
Sephiroth, not because I was that excited for him to be added but he did have the coolest trailer
Sephiroth had the best reveal trailer of all of the Smash newcomers imo

I put Ridley very high too
1. Steve - simply because of bias. Minecraft is probably my favourite game at the moment.

2. Sora - because seeing a Disney character in Smash is still surreal, plus I can't get enough of seeing him shake hands with Mario.

3. Sephiroth - on the topic of Mario, the fact that Sephiroth almost killed him (despite Mario dying in nearly every trailer) on top of him slicing Galeem in half was so badass.
K rool or Ridley, just murdering people
    Krool was amazing as well as Ridley.
I think King K. Rool's is the best considering its goofiness. But besides that, Incineroar was awesome making a powerful entrance.
Joker easy
\#1 Terry

\#2 Ken/Incineroar

\#3 Belmonts

that's my top 3
Sephiroth’s was very fitting for him.

Sora definitely had a great one, considering he was the last fighter.

I think Joker takes the cake for me though.
Sephora and Sorry
In no particular order, Ridley, K. Rool, Sephiroth, and Joker
Joker and Steve are contenders for first place to me.
Terrance
It's not on here but personally I thought Terry's was great.
To me it’s between Sephiroth and Joker. Sephiroth showing up and one shoting Galeem to the special challenge was so cool. 

Joker’s was cool cause he literally took over the game awards like it was some shit in Mementos.
Ridley 100% that trailer was epic
I don't watch The Game Awards, or any award show for that matter. Also it's on very late for me and I have to get up for work. Anyway. When joker was announced for Smash, i had no idea who he was and saw people all over twitter talk about him and I just thought. Yeah right, like they'd put Joker in Smash. Thinking people were talking about DC Joker, as in Batman’s Joker.
Joker 100%

The game awards trailer seemingly just being a regular persona announcement only to pull the sickest 180 ever was some crazy hype shit

Sephiroth and K Rool’s trailers were also pretty cool too tho
I liked Lucia and Robins because of how badass Falcon is in it.
100% joker, there was no better way to show him off then that
    It could have been if the song was Last Surprize
    I love how it's **exactly** how they'd go about it.
Sans
Nothing will ever beat the Ridley reveal for me, expect maybe like bowser jr or Rosalina when I was 9 lol
Chrom for sure. I always love seeing more fire emblem
Sephiroth has the best reveal trailer of anything ever, not even just Smash.

My only problem with it is it uses the greatly inferior Advent Children design for Cloud.
The lady from arms or terry was cool
Imo: Hero

Objectively: Sora
Steve was my favorite I'm a huge Minecraft fan and knew it was him the second Mario broke through the wall just by the iconic Minecraft sound effects
Greninja in smash 4
I don’t think anything will rival the hype I felt watching Kazuya show up. Sephiroth comes damn close only because it becomes so much cooler if u recognize his theme
Shiek
Everyone is here/hard snake
5. Steve
4. Sephiroth
3. King K. Rool
2. Banjo & Kazooie
1. Sora
Steve literally broke twitter
I can’t pick one and it’s not based on fandom just the sheer shock that it happened. Banjo Kazooie, Sephiroth, and Sora.
Ridley was sick
I liked Ridley's and Sephitoth's a lot.
As a Minecraft fan, having him revealed in the trailer the moment Mario crashes through the wall was perfection
    Yeah I just KNEW where Mario went
I'm pretty sure both Steve and Sora took down Twitter when they were revealed (at least Steve did) so I have to go with them.

Steve is my bias, Sora is kinda just agreed upon.
Banjo and Sephiroth
Sephiroth>Mega Man>Steve=Sora
Banjo for pure shock value. My personal favorite was Incineroar though. Everybody thought it was just Ken, then Incin comes in and kicks EVERYBODY'S ass only to see the rest of the roster wanting to have a go at him
Sora and Sephiroth
I would say steve since he was predicted so early on and it was SO HYPE getting him in the game
In no particular order:

Ridley, Krool, Incineroar (loved how the fight theme was handled), Sepiroth and Steve.
Sephiroth by far. Ridley in second place
I didnt even play ff7 until recently and sephiroths is still the best. 

Bias tho pyra. The only character I wanted in smash
Bylethn't
Hands down, Ridley.
As much as I hate Steve in smash, his reveal was insane.
no bias, ridley, i love seeing characters get brutaly murdered
It's sephiroth and it's not close
Sephiroth

As a side note, Byleth had the worse reveal trailer imo
Joker, 2019 game awards, thee lights go off out of no where, no one knows what's going in, then boom, red screen, next thing you k ow you hear Morgana's voice and every one thinks it's a new personality game, but even better, joker and he's coming for the game awards cause he's been invited to smash
Steve just crazy, it was so unexpected
Objectively probably Sephiroth 

Subjectivity absolutely the Aegis
Banjo kazoie. They paid a lot of homage to the original character.
Piranha plants missed opportunity for "lay in pipe"
Ridley fucking killed Mario in his reveal. So he wins be default.
Sephiroth ofc, but im fisappointed you didnt include the byleth recruits byleth
Either ken (cause main) or joker because I was playing through P5 when he was announced and I went fucking FERAL for him.
Steve’s is the best! I honestly thought Steve’s was a joke or a fan made one when I woke up that morning, and OH BOY was I surprised!
Sephiroth cuz of the entire spectacle. Pythra cuz Monolith made the trailer.
I’d say for me it was banjo or Richter & Simon. The grim reaper killing Luigi was insane
Dude Sephiroth is way too cool
Inkling
Steve, Sora, Ridley and Sephiroth
Probably my top 3 are Sephiroth, Sora, and Joker.
Sephiroth had incredible callbacks to World of Light and great CGI (plus One Winged Angel). Sora had the callbacks to that Inkling trailer and just that aura kf "he's finally here). Finally, I love how Joker's defied expectations. Instead of knowing its a Smash trailer and wondering who the fighter was, you knew the video was about Joker from the start and you were wondering whether it was a new game, a spin off, or a Smash trailer (we all know what happened now.)
I really liked the Ken and Incineroar. It was a really good cross showing of what some interactions between these characters could look like.
K Rool and Piranha Plant by far had the best trailers in my opinion

They were funny and fitting for those characters really well.

Ik sora and seph have been said a lot, and those trailers are good, but I don’t think they were the best of the best
Only one reveal was so crazy twitter shut down because of it…

It’s Steve
Daisy
Bias: Plant

W/o bias: also Plant
Ridley
Sephiroth and Ridley
Ridley and Steve
I really love Rosalina & Luma Super Smash Bros trailer it is my number 1 favourite Super Smash Bros reveal trailer
Sephiroth at one, cause “play three notes and watch the fans go wild”

Banjo and Sora tied at 2.
I cant put into words how hype it was seeing the joker reveal at the game awards. everything pales in comparison and it isnt even close.
110% Sephiroth
Sephiroth
I think the funniest ever is the plant reveal
Joker or Sephiroth

Joker for the reveal, like no one had a damn clue it was smash

Sephiroth for Coolness, absolutely boss feeling moment
Sephiroth is probably the better answer objectively, but Little Mac will always hold a special place in my heart. Hearing that remixed running theme always gets me a little hype.
Mine personally is Joker
I’m caught between joker and sephiroth. Even tho I don’t play those games the reveal trailers were super cool in addition to Joker taking over the VGA BEFORE smash had officially released!
Sora Had The Best One, Ngl, Nobody Expected Him To Actually Make It To Smash
Sephiroth, Steve and Banjo for me. Sephiroth's reveal just went so hard. Steve was hilarious, and I just really enjoyed the gag from both the Rool and Banjo reveals. 

Honorable mentions go to Joker, Terry, Kazuya, Sora, Byleth (her flying with a big goofy smile she never sports in game made me laugh), Pyra (loved both the fakeout that it was Xenoblade DLC and not a Smash reveal and also Rex getting left out)
Piranha Plant. They knew what they were doing with it.
The Dark Samus trailer just went crazy!
The Belmont's trailer is still my absolute favorite. Crossing over Luigi's Mansion and Castlevania was an absolute stroke of genius. We didn't really get a lot of "worlds colliding" trailers like this one (or Rosalina connecting Mario Kart and Kirby in Smash 4, or Little Mac vs Ken vs Incineroar) where two games with common themes mesh together effortlessly like that. Getting us to believe that every video game world exists in the same universe and can be visited like that is something only Smash can really do. It's just so damn charming.

THAT BEING SAID, it's almost impossible to argue that Sephiroth's wasn't the most impressive of the bunch. Even if you didn't know a thing about him or FF7, his trailer made you _want_ to know. And if you _were_ familiar with him...yeah, it was a huge pop-off moment. And incorporating _so many characters_ in the first part of the trailer like that? Richter, Zelda, Mewtwo, Inkling, Banjo and Kazooie, and Bayonetta? Like, come on, the Sephiroth trailer was a fucking feast for the eyes, man.
me, i didnt expect them to put me in smash
I main Piranha Plant and the trailer is one of the reasons. Seeing how people reacted to the trailer will always be a fun thing to do. "NO WAY IT'S GENO" "WALUIGI"
love having this discussion for the 3rd time this week
I like that Pyra/Mythra was literally just a cutscene made by Monolith. I literally had no idea it was going to be a Smash reveal until it happened because it didn’t even open with the smash symbol. So I thoroughly enjoyed that. Joker was cool because it set the tone for the fighter pass and for me that tone was awesome. I didn’t end up liking Banjo as a fighter but the recycling of the K.Rool reveal to bait and switch Banjo and Kazooie was excellent. And while I literally have no attachment to Kingdom Hearts, Sora’s reveal just felt so emotional because it feels like his inclusion was decades in the making, and seeing him shake hands with Mario felt legendary. Also shoutouts to Snake showing up and just “Everybody is here” because I’m pretty sure the collective volume of the planet went up a few decibels in that moment.
Sephiroth’s is incredible; K. Rool and Banjo’s are also amazing
It’s between K Rool, Sephiroth, and Sora for me.
Sephiroth's trailer goes hard.
Steve's is just awesome as a Minecraft fan.
Sephiroth by miles (totally not biased)
My personal favorites are Steve, sephiroth, sora, king k rool, and joker . From favorite to least favorite
Sora. Perfect build up and INCREDIBLE payoff
Ridley for sure
Terry isn’t even on the list. Really????

It really depends on who or what you’re a fan of tbh. 

Ken’s was sick, inciniroar’s was eh? 

Terry’s was amazing, but not if you didn’t know who the characters were, 

Hero/Yuusha was fucking incredible, but not many westerners were impressed or noticed the references

Sephiroth was likewise incredible, let’s just recreate advent children.

I really liked Kazuya, his was also really good! Menacing and classic 

Unfortunately I have to give it up to the shitstain of a character, my least wanted entry into the game, possibly my most disliked character and franchise in all of gaming, Sora. 

It had a finale feel to it, everyone truly is here, they threw the kitchen sink out way in that trailer and it was awesome.
For me it has to be piranha plant. That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
Sephiroth had the most bad ass

King K. Rool had the funniest

Kazuya had the most surprising

And Sora had the most whimsical
Where Steve?
Joker or Sephiroth. Joker was so wild that you literally could not load any google, Twitter or YouTube hosted videos because it was being watched so much.
I really liked the Ridley reveal. I felt very menacing
kazuya is heavily underrated
Sephiroth for sure. I’m a huge Kingdom Hearts fan so Sora is second place.
1. Sephiroth
2. Steve
3. Inkling (+Game reveal)
4. Piranha Plant
5. K. Rool
6. Everyone is Here!
7. Ridley
8. Terry
9. Everything else, I don't care to order them from here
It will always be inkling/ultimate i can still feel the hype
Steve because I was shocked and I've seen people saying sephiroth but at the time I was just disappointed because I've never played ff
It has to be Sephiroth. There were so many people that had no clue about him that started loving him because of his trailer. It was nutty.
I’d say banjo
For me, it's a tie between Joker and Pyra/Mythra.
Joker was an amazing way to start off the dlc for Smash being at the game awards. And with Pyra/Mythra, xenoblade 2 is one of my top games of all time, so I'm a little biased for it
Not the best one, but Isabelle’s is underrated.
King K Rool. I nearly passed out from jumping of joy and hyperventilating. My mother came rushing to the kitchen asking what the hell was going on and my best bud said; “A fat video game crocodile has entered a fighting game and your son (my name) has been waiting on that for 17 years”. Wish I did reaction videos at the time.
oh Sora with no doubt, but i mean he was the very last character so one would figure they would end reveals with a blast.

Other than Sora, must be Sephiroth killing Mario
With bias as a big Persona fan, Joker.
Sephiroth is easily the one with the highest production value

But I gotta say, even if I didn't played P5, the Phantom Thieves "hijacking" the game awards and turn them into a surprise Smash reveal for Joker is probably one of the most original.
I liked Joker and Richter's the most
    you don’t belong in this world monster
        BEGONE!
K rool
King K Rool and Ridley for me. Arguably megaman if that counts
Definitely NOT Ken. 😂

[Man lost to Incineroar in a shared debut trailer.](https://youtu.be/7buEBe9YB9g?si=Y_5zIX7IrXXNQ-MS&t=1m44s)
What's with the Steve erasure?

I'd say best trailer cinematically was Simon and Richter, for my personal hype K Rool, and an honourable mention to Sora because it made me emotional despite not even caring about Sora myself, just because I knew how special it was for everyone and they really lent into that.
Sephiroth and it's not even fucking close. Sephiroth's trailer was perfect.
Inkling, Sephiroth or Sora. None of the others come close.
I still watch Sora and Banjo’s just to feel something, anything
Chrom reveal trailer contains Chrom.

Greater serotonin supply than all other trailers combined.
Not the best, but my favorite reveal trailer is the Byleth one. Just seeing all the salt and tears everywhere was something to see. Plus I was really into FETH when it came out. Personally would have preferred a house leader instead, but hey it said and done at this point.
![gif](giphy|5tamwFxY7PTW0)
Sephiroth or Joker.

Pyra and Mythra close though with the quality of the trailer, having monolithsoft animate it in the Xenoblade 2 engine was really unique.
Definitely Daisy's reveal. I mean, damn, man, the CGI they used for it, absolutely beautiful. Must've cost them a fortune.
Joker easily, I loved how they revealed him at the game awards
Personally, Banjo or K. Rool.

If I was speaking in terms of iconic, probably Sepharoth, Steve or Sora.
With a whole bunch of bias involved, banjo and kazooie. I was waiting for those doofuses since melee
Ridley and sephiroth were the coolest ones for me
Steve or Bayonetta
all the Square Enix trailers
King Bach
In no particular order, Daisy, Dark Samus, Piranha Plant, Banjo, Steve and Sora.
Sephiroth all the way, Mega Mans one was epic as hell
the plant.
Sephiroth easily has the best trailer. I'm saying this and I'm not even into Final Fantasy-- it was just a masterpiece from start to finish
My favorite is Sephiroth or Kazuya, but I really like Greninja & Charizard's from Sm4sh
I think sepiroth was the coolest, but mainly because the production value seemed much higher than the other fighters and being on the game awards they really made the trailer hype. 

I do think jokers was also great and super important - it really set the stage for the fighters pass, letting you know that they these new dlc characters are going to be very good. I don't think a lot of people saw it coming that joker was coming to smash until they saw the letter in the trailer. I had a feeling when they said, "we've been invited...", but seeing the envelope and hearing the crowd reaction was pretty memorable. 

Personally, I think Terry's was my favorite. I'm not the biggest king of fighters fan either, but just seeing old school arcade style and knowing Sakurai story boarded the whole thing himself, I thought it was very memorable and hilarious.
Joker the Way the Whole Location Cut out with power was amazing
the way this is organized is hurting my brain
Banjo and kazooie
Sans.

I will take no further questions.
definitely sora because everybody thought he could never become a fighter
joker
Easily banjo, Steve, and sans. People were hyped over the other characters, but *everyone* went catatonic over those 3
I can't believe I'm just now learning u can play as John dragonquest in new smash games
I’m not gonna sugarcoat it…

Kazuya was my favorite, though I loved Sephiroth’s trailer too
Daisy's trailer was hype af 🔥🔥
Well if I’m going by me and my friends it goes  Isabelle, banjo & kazooie and Steve 

Sora was 4th but closely almost tied to sephiroth being 5th
Sephiroth, and it's not close
Ridley easily for me
For me, it's Ridley. I'm a huge Metroid fan and I wanted him to be playable for years. I played bossrush in Brawl hundreds of times just to beat Ridley twice each time.
Incin, I'm biased
Sephiroth was amazing, but Sora, my boy, was the most emotional.
K Rool
Sora, Steve, Hero
I don’t even like arms but god I love min mins trailer. For some reason gives me chills
100% sora
I’m going to be honest. Joker had the best one
Ridley or sephiroth but I really like Ken/incineroar
I think banjo-Kazooie, K. Rool had a cool one, and Banjos was a parody of it that played off of it perfectly
Joker made a pretty big splash when it was announced at the Game Awards. I don’t think anyone saw that coming. Persona was PlayStation only at that point I think.
For me, Joker.
Putting my love of tekken aside its easily sephiroth, that being said i enjoyed kazuyas the most because im just that much of a tekken fan
Joker or Sephiroth
Megaman was hype as fuck.
As hype as all of the DLC trailers were ridleys trailer as well as the belmonts trailers were fun, kinda dark, and exciting which is exactly what I want. Not to mention seeing characters crossover is so much more fun than just having Mario somewhere in the trailer.
K rool’s
Nothing beats krool for me. It's just hilarious
My top 5 (in no particular order other than what order I remembered them in):

1. Sora

2. Sephiroth

3. kazuya

4. Steve

5. Simon/Richter (they share the same spot since they were in the same trailer).
Banjo, K. Rool & Sora are my top picks.
Isabelle purely because “Isabelle turns over a new leaf” is the single best “joins the battle” phrase
For me it was Ridley, ever since Melee I’ve wanted my big purple boi.
Byleth
Best reveal in all of Smash was Mega Man and I will hear no objections
K. Rool in terms of reaction watching people get fooled
Isabelle
Piranha plant because of the sheer randomness of it
Def joker or sora, they put so much heart into each one, especially sora’s
Hero
Sephiroth was awesome simply for acknowledging galeem
To this day I’m still pissed that ryu got leaked would have been more hype then Steve
Isabelle
I’d say inkling, purely carried by ultimates reveal and personal bias. Otherwise, I’d say k rool
100% Sephiroth
Steve because his crashed Twitter.
Joker. The style was just oozing into the screen!
Sephiroth's. Only way they could have made it better is if he'd been shirtless, nips out, the whole time
Sora. The one time I didn’t record my reaction. I should recreate the reaction… though a 2 week feed of me crying tears of joy would probably be bad in metrics
Ken objectively. Edit; if we are only talking about characters from the picture. If not then Sora, show me a video where people cry for any other reveal. I'll wait.
K rool or ridley
Joker because I screamed when I saw the trailer at the game awards. Sephiroth and Steve were also amazing.
Tie between Steve (feels like a shitpost in a good way) and Sephiroth (I screamed)
It’s sephiroth and it’s not even close
Inkling: Pretty much the first thing we saw of SSBU, iconic for the look of sheer fear. The trailer was post Splat2 and nowhere near 3, but its a character nobody would complain about getting into smash when the trailers weren't solid yet.  
Isabelle: Before the newest animal crossing game, the most recent one came out on the 3ds in 2012. So her being in new smash was pretty cool since im pretty sure the trailer also lead into a teaser for New Horizons.  


Banjo & Kazooie: Literally haven't seen these characters in a mainline game since the shitter 360 kart builder.  People have been wanting them in since like, Brawl, the only gripe is that they reused the same trailer for King K.Rool.

Joker would have probably been Hype as shit for me if I got into Persona 5/4 before SSBU
Definitely joker
it's a hard choice between k. rool, sephiroth, and joker, but i'm gonna have to go with sephiroth, especially considering they released him with the sephiroth challenge
Ridley for me, the dude just straight up took out Mario and MegaMan and his pose with the Mario's hat

Ridley: Hey Samus... Missed me?

Also yeah, I agree with OP too, Sephiroth reveal was great, slicing up a god in two isn't something that many can do (Also, love the fact that everyone agrees that Sephiroth is there just to torment poor Cloud even more than normal)
Sephiroth clears.
objectively: sora and joker

personally: sephiroth and krool
Joker's is my favorite cause I love how it got incorporated with the Game Awards
Joker 100%

Sora a close second for me because he was the last one and I had been wanting sooooo long for him to be added and had pretty much given up hope.
Joker
sora
Nothing comes close to how world shattering the reveals of Banjo and Steve were.
Steve or Sora. They definitely broke the internet the best with their reveals, lol
Everyone is here is still peak Smash trailer, the amount of hype created with those words is insane.
Sephiroth's trailer really cements him as a force of nature who follows Cloud to the ends of the earth
Sephiroth, Sora, and Joker
I have a lot of bias for “Dante” (Sephiroth). So him
Joker because the set-up was perfect, he was revealed I believe the day the game released and it was at the game awards and the reveal when he turns the envelope around was so unexpected and out of the blue it made everyone go nuts. it was perfection.
Pyra and Mythra.
Either Steve or inklings
Ridley or Sephiroth
Steve, Sephiroth, Sora. Character wise in that order, trailer wise Sephiroth before Steve
Sephiroth no contest. Dude wasn't invited, he just showed up, followed Cloud, and chose violence mentally and physically
Steve because I mean he’s fucking Steve Miencraft like wtf
K rool and banjo. We knew who they were but it was so hype.

The more surprising one def steve as it we didnt know till we knew if that makes sense
I think "draws near" is the best secondary line at least.
With bias: Sans Mii Skin(the reaction fall out was crazy)

Without:  Steve. (Same reason)
Objectively it was Steve which broke Twitter.
Subjectively, it would be Banjo - I couldn't believe that I saw a jiggy in the trailer at first.

Best reaction to a reveal trailer would probably be [this one](https://youtu.be/CK5gdf5cMPM?si=fkuXICZaLRIelMd0)
I'd say sephiroth or sora
Joker. He was revealed at the game awards and he was the introduction to the game's DLC, aside from Piranha Plant, who officially does not count. His reveal was staged brilliantly,in front of a live, captive audience. P5 is all about heists, so the fact that the trailer is presented like one works great.

He really showed just what was possible with Smash characters and DLC. There was no precedent at all for Joker, unlike, say, Ryu or Bayonetta in Smash 4. No Persona media was on Switch or any Nintendo console for that matter at all. It has always been Sony-exclusive. It's pretty much in the same level as Snake in Brawl, or Cloud in Smash 4, imo.

Joker's reveal in Smash opened the floodgates, both for Ultimate DLC hype and getting Persona on Switch. I don't doubt that demand for Persona on Nintendo systems skyrocketed following that event.
Byleth because it pissed the community off but they eventually grew to live them
Sephiroh was completely out of left field and hype all over, second place would be Joker also a big surprise and for ME personally Pyra and Mythra
Pyra and Mythra made me scream, but Sephiroth was the best one, and I'm not even a big FF7  fan. It has to really be because of One Winged Angel playing. Normally whenever a trailer plays they show the character the same time as the music, but with Sephiroth- they showed you that someone ONE SHOT GALEEM. Made you wonder who is overpowered to do that, then play his THEME, proceeded by zooming in on his blurry silhouette, and then show Cloud realizing that it's Sephiroth.
Out of the non-DLC, I gotta give props to Ken for making an Evo Moment 37 reference; JWong can NEVER live it down!

Out of the DLC, Steve and Sephiroth both made me audibly gasp while watching it in sheer shock, and while Sora is a cringelord, the amount of love put into that animation is palpable.
Terry Bogard!

I’m in the minority I’m sure, but growing up with SNK games, that trailer for Terry and all those SNK references and pixel graphics was just so good. So much love and care went into that. 

The most surprising and hype one for me though would be Cloud. Just the fact that he, my favorite game being FF7, was in smash just seemed unreal. Nowadays anyone can be in smash, that’s how crazy it is. But back then, I could only have dreamed that cloud would be in
Personally, Joker or Sephiroth.
Krools was my favorite, they did the double fake out and now if we get krool in a future game he might be working with dk like how ddd did
Your mom.
KING! KAPTAIN! KRUSHA! BARON! K! ROOL! ENSTIEN!
![gif](giphy|0UjR95FLrCP0vptcTh)

Sephiroth clears, no diff
Well *obviously* it's Byleth's
Isabelle lol
Joker. 

It's the opposite of most reveals as it wasn't a character reveal, it was a Smash reveal. Most trailers will try to build up the character, but that makes it easy to figure out who's being added and lessens the impact of the reveal moment. With Joker, we didn't know what it was (other than something to do with Persona 5) until the reveal. Add to that it being held at the Game Awards, we never saw it coming.
Sephiroth and it’s not even close. Sakurai literally gave us another Advent Children battle.
Sephiroth definitely
Megaman. 

Especially after playing all the MegaMan games.

Then Snake.
I honestly can't decide which one was better. Steve's was my personal favorite as he was my most wanted, but bias aside, Sephiroth's, Sora's, Ken/Incineroar's, Ridley's and the Belmonts' were all really good imo
I might be a little biased, but Joker’s was CLEAN
Sora!
Easily joker and sora. Joker being extremely well done and out of nowhere and soras being the highest requested and wrapped up the game with the best possible bow. Joker takes the cake for how dope it was.
Sonic :)
This image says it all

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eo6lBQ6UUAUQPHX.jpg:large
Non DLC? King K rool. I screamed when I saw him and have been maining him since day 1

DLC? Sephiroth, mans didnt get an invite, he just sniffed out cloud, killed the final boss like a badass and almost killed half the cast
Ridley
Like any other aspect of his inclusion, I think Joker's reveal was the best. The amount of love and faithfulness to the original game that went into every single little part of this character is beautiful. If all the DLC was done with such delicacy and passion, I think smash would be a completely different game.
Sephiroth obviously, worst one could be Banjo. Like I know it's a funny ref but it made everything too predictable.
Obviously Pirahna Plant's
SORA HANDS DOWN! I almost cried seeing his reveal
I love Pyra/Mythra's trailer a lot, but the winner for me has to be Piranha Plant. I never laughed so hard in my life.
Hero and Sephiroth
Either Ken, inkling, joker or SEPHIROTH
Loved joker’s. From what I’ve heard when his trailer was shown at the game awards they made it seem like bro just snuck in 😭 
I’m also a big persona fan tho so it may also just be bias on my end
Where’s Steve?
Inkling for me, seeing Etikas reaction was priceless!
"pipes up"
Ridley and King K Rool are my favoirites
Ridley. Nintendo had a lot of balls to fucking kill Mario on-screen, plus it was probably the most significant one to me as someone who's been hyped for Ridley since Brawl
Sephiroth 100%

Sora was a close second with how emotional it felt. It resonated with Disney Magic that Disney lost years ago.
Ridley n Seph definitely. Only ones I remember.
Personally, Ridley or Simon.
Ridley
Either Sephiroth or Sora.
Steve
Steve
Sephiroth and sora and banjo hands down in my opinion had the best trailers
Banjo 100%
Incineroar
Ridley because he's my favorite and I've wanted him since I was 7 years old 😊
What about banjo and kazooie?
Sora, nothing beats that instrumental track with sora gliding around
Ridley’s splash is because of the ridley is too big for smash meme
Mii Fighters
K Rool was hype. Seen the very classic showdown between him and DK was hype af.
Isabelle was pretty hype for the fact that it doubled as an announcement trailer for the at-the-time untitled Animal Crossing Switch game. That was an emotional rollercoaster.
I love inklings it’s so satisfying and inkling looks so confused
Banjo&Kazooie has one of the most iconic reveal trailers that has some of the biggest reactions.
K Rools trailer for the Dedede troll
Terry and that's with extreme bias
K rool's and banjo's

Loved how from the start of the trailer almost everyone knew Who It was, but the trailer was even then really enjoyable to watch with the DDD-Duck hunt duo thing.

Plus one references the other so thats cool too
Chrom!
To me it was Sora's reveal trailer - it was just beautiful, i was literally in tears.
Also it was so unexpected, because it seemed impossible to think that Disney, SE and Nintendo would ever agree to a deal to actually let Sora appear in Smash.
Joker and Sepiroth
Ridley because of the raw hype
Banjo and Inkling have great reveal trailers
Simon/Richter's is my favorite reveal trailer because Loogie
Sephiroth comes in uninvited and destroys the most powerful character in one sword slash
I’d say either Ridley or Sephiroth
Sephiroth, hands-down
I like Joker’s, his was very unique
Honestly Byleth. Not because of any its quality or anything like that, but because of how much I laughed knowing how many people were going to have steam pouring from their ears cartoon style lol. Same goes for Piranha Plant, but to a lesser degree
Well, for me there's only 3 real options.

&#x200B;

Inkling's introduction was massive, and practically announced the game.

K Rool's was hilarious, unexpected, and a great service to DK fans.

&#x200B;

But Sephiroth's was cool as f--k. He just kinda kills Galeem. Even as somebody who has NEVER played a Final Fantasy game, I think Sephiroth's was probably the best.

&#x200B;

As a minecraft fan, I loved Steve's, but it just wasn't as good as these other ones.

I guess Ridley's was cool too, but idk
Banjo and sora. Then they killed this game by making it a jrpg fighter with every fucking character having a sword 🙄 fuck the fire emblem series and im genuinely sure the world would have been fine without it being created honestly
Mega man never played mega man tho it just goes hard
none of these. it was easily K Rool
I believe Sephiroth had the best reveal trailer in the entire history of the series! I STILL love going back and watching it every now and then
I’m a huge KH fan so when I saw the Keyblade flying through the sky and opening the door to let Sora in to then have him cure everyone of the curse placed on them by Galeem while the KH theme was playing, THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED FOR THE KH1 TRAILER… ok I cried a little
Sephiroth and Banjo
Sans
Sephiroth, Banjo, K Rool, Ridley and Minecraft Steve impacted me a lot.

Also Incineroar's one was cool as hell.
Block man
Incineroar was great due to how it killed the grinch leak
If you count the smash ultimate trailer where it was still smash for switch, inkling
While Sephiroth's was pretty cool, I constantly find myself rewatching Incineroar, King K. Rool, and, as a sequel to Rool, Banjo and Kazooie
Hot take: megaman in smash 4. So fuckin hype, and so good for mega fans
Banjo
I'm incredibly biased so I have to say banjo and kazooie
K. Rool had the best one for giving us the nice fake out.

Honorable mention to Byleth. They have the worst trailer. Not even setting aside my bias for Chrom, why is Byleth’s trailer the scene where they’re trapped? That’s not a good story point to use, just use the scene with Kostas. It happens in every route, but you’re not just leaving whatever Byleth’s house is to face TWSITD alone. You know what happens if you leave these idiots to their own devices.
Banjo and Kazooie, hands down.
I swear I'm not biased, but Kazuya
Mostly the idea of him killing off characters is sick
Personally, the trailers that I love the most are those that drop a little hint before the big reveal that usually only those know that played the game.  
Trailers that did this were Banjo and Kazooie's with the Jiggie piece and Kazuya with the "dropping someone into a volcano" gig.  
Fans knew what was coming and the hype grew with every second the official name drop hasn't arrived.
Sephiroth 100%
"Ridley hits the big time" made me chuckle
Incineroar because of the shock factor of, "Oh shit really?" and it deconfirmed The Grinch Leak. Sephiroth for pure insanity that we got another FF rep and pure bias because I love this character, and the fucking trailer was absolutely by far the best
Joker, Sephiroth the best imo, Kazuya's is pretty cool, Ken's is underrated , his theme song gives me chills (They did my boy dirty tho, getting him beat up by incineroar 😭)
It’s obviously Minecraft, Steve
tie between Sora, Simon, Hero, Joker, and Sephiroth. they all have unmatched aura to them

Edit: oh my god I forgot Mega Man hes also in the tie
Deadass, Steve.

I got so hyped for Steve you have no idea
piranha plant
sephiroth and joker were both great trailers, but i'm also heavily biased. just to mention a good one that i had no bias towards, terry's was pretty cool.
    i also have to give an honorable mention to steve. his trailer was nothing to write home about but the reveal itself was crazy. i fell off of minecraft a long time ago but i played it a lot when it first released as a little kid so it meant a lot to me.
Banjo, Steve and Sephiroth in no particular order
I literally cried when b&k were announced so that one
As the biggest banjo fan ever i have to say: sephiroth wins.
Hero
Sephiroth without a doubt, though it technically doesn’t count, Joker literally taking over the game awards still holds a very special place in my heart.
With admittedly some pretty heavy bias: Sora.
Looking back on things; Joker’s reveal was unexpected and truly show stopping (and show*stealing*)
Byleth solos
Joker. The Game Awards thing was so cool.
Banjo easily. I know that we had a lot better, but when I saw that Jiggy, I shocked.
This gotta be on purpose where is his image 😭
bro forgot terry
Anyone but Daisy, dark samus and Chrom tbh
Joker probably the whole joker on the game awards was so cool and well done bit personal fav Is piranha plant just for the funny and suprise factor was so good
For me, I'd say sora
Imo sora because of how climactic it was, like truly that gives chills on smash bros being a representative of gaming legacy
Sephiroth's trailer was unmatched
Sephiroth 100%. The trailer was so well-edited. Got me extremely hyped despite not having played a single Final Fantasy game.
I think Joker (what happened during TGA) and Sephiroth were the best
incineroar's reveal forgot to include him intimidating every single character and taking every attack in the game, not an accurate portrayal of the main character
Sora.
Hero, but not because I thought Hero was cool in it as much as it was cool how BotW Link was getting owned by Marth and Meta Knight like the noob that he is.
I really loved sephiroths
    Kazuyahs was pretty cool too
SORA :D
King K Rool or Sephiroth
Banjo Kazuya
joker, prove me wrong
Banjo and the Belmonts are my favorites
Sephiroth: "I sawed this Galeem in half!"

Everyone else: "Now that's alotta damage!"
I like Sephiroth but the Internet literally broke with Steve and Sora despite me hating them as fighters
Sans. He made me excited for Mii costumes
The fact Steve isn’t here is a travesty
On like an objective scale definitely Steve since he quite literally broke Twitter

But my bias says Ken since they showed him in a great way even if I personally think Inceniroar ruins it a bit because I'm not a big Pokémon fan
Sora because it was the perfect way to conclude Smash and Fighters Pass 2.

As for Brawl, Sonic because come on Nintendo and Sega are homies now. 

As for Smash 4, Cloud because Final Fantasy needed to be in Smash.
Badassery wise, Sephiroth easily wins, but Steve came as such a surprise and became such a strange but popular character reveal that you just can't decide
P L A N T
Ridley my man
Where the hell is Minecraft STEVE
Well duh he can’t do 5 minutes without traumatizing Cloud
    I heard he was happy, so I came to change that
    Smh, just kiss already
    Sephi really said “Bitch,did I catch you having fun?!”
    And sora chased him down with the most wtf factor reveal of them all
    And then sora said “nuh uh”
The abysmal representation of FF7 compared to every other 3rd party fighter before Sephiroth joined made his inclusion so unexpected. And the way they incorporated so many characters, even third-party ones, into the CGI portion of the trailer made it even better. The CGI was what was missing from Cloud's trailer and from all Smash 4 trailer DLC trailers, which gives it that extra flair.
Cloud: “It’s nice fighting against an enemy not set on traumatizing me every 10 seconds.”

Sephiroth: “And I took that personally”
    Sephiroth heard Cloud was suffering to Galeem and was like: "I am the only one allowed to make Cloud suffer."
    “Why do I hear boss music??”
        #*SEPHIROTH*
            https://youtu.be/PwDPOxWyoXE?si=r8I-G0on6WXsdX2B
        Said Galeem
        That's was exactly the trailer
And then Sora heard Sephiroth was in Smash and did the same thing.
    Cloud told Sora about Sephiroth because he knew he could take care of him, lvl 1 and no damage taken.
        SOOOORRRAAAAA SEPHIROTH IS BULLYING ME!

hold my keyblade
As Sephiroth said ‘I will never be a memory’
Why didn’t Waluigi do the same? :(
And they let him in because they thought he was another silver haired main antagonist with a katana, the difference being one is shirtless, the other is Motivated.
Then Sora heard Cloud and Sephiroth were in Smash so he crashed the party too
The 6th fighter that was added was not actually Sora, it was Sephitroth showing up unannounced... (in his announcement trailer)
lol, Cloud called Sora to vent and Sora just showed up to beat Sephiroth senseless again.
Steve broke twitter i think that makes it objective. Best overall reveal for me was Joker. Bias yes. But my mans havked TGA.

When Sora was revealed every member of the game club ran out of class to celebrate in my school tho so that was pretty impactful for me.
    Breaking Twitter hasn't happened since Michael Jackson's death.
    Breaking Twitter doesn’t mean the trailer was good 😭 it’s more just the fact Minecraft Steve was there. Sephiroth’s trailer is leagues ahead of Steve’s
    Maybe best reaction to a reveal trailer, but definitely not best trailer itself
    I mean to be fair, I think it was the internet dying over Minecraft Steve in Smash Bros, not the Steve reveal trailer. Minecraft *is* the most popular and best selling game in the world barring Tetris.
I will admit as a minecrafter, Steve’s was really good, the music was epic
Exactly how I feel but with Sora. I DIED when Sora was announced.  


But Sephiroth's trailer went *hard.*
    They really gave Sephiroth the full edge lord introduction that he deserved
        Not edgelord, new final boss introduction
            A little bit of both
                Plus, he sensed Cloud was having fun with new friends and/or suffering without him.
    I died too when Sora was announced, but for a different reason
Sephiroth's was insane and I don't know how anything equivalent could ever be repeated. All the build up to the reveal only for One Winged Angel to start and from the first bar everyone knows exactly who it is before they even see the character. One of the most iconic villains with one of the most iconic themes.  I'm not usually one for reaction videos, but watching streamers react to that trailer and hearing the first few notes of OWA is super fun.
    I think it’s because it might have originally been the final trailer since we know sora was added later. That’s why there’s tons of third party characters from other companies in this trailer.
Dedede trolling was perfect.
    Especially since Sakurai voices Dedede
K Rools was amazing. I loved they referenced again in Banjo and Kazooies
    I think K Rool and Ridley are both good for the reason that they leaned into the joke. For Ridley it was the “too big” joke, and for K Rool it was the “everybody knows it’s him, so lets do this Dedede gag.
    and then referenced them again in the banjo trailer
I was so hyped for Dark Souls just to end up getting Sora's goofy clown shoe ass
    I know the damn random campfire and forge sound as Mario went in was such a odd direction choice
        Literally the creation myth of the Dark Souls universe is that the world was dark and lifeless but then a fire spontaneously appeared and creatures came from the darkness and reached into the flame.

Sora reveal is the world is dark and lifeless but then a fire spontaneously appears and Mario comes from the darkness and reaches into the flame.
            I know they'd never admit to this being the case for obvious reasons, but I'd love to know that they did that intentionally. Just one massive troll move.
            Sora said this in KH1… “the heart may be weak, and sometimes, it may even give in. But I’ve learned, that deep down there’s a light that never goes out”
    glad i wasn't the only one
Imagine Solair Joining smash
After being Rekted in brawl TWICE he said not again when samus showed up. He really did hit the big time
Yeah Ridley was the first character to kill Mario in these trailers. Funniest shit ever
Piranha Plant because Plant...
shit was mega hype too
“They’d probably add Piranha Plant to smash before Waluigi…”
Idk if you’re actually setting aside your bias towards KH, if we even the playing field and ignore how heavily requested sora was, his trailer was pretty meh.  it’s just all the characters sitting in a black void, then mario picks up a flaming sword and it’s revealed to be sora’s sword.  If it were any other anime swordsman (like byleth for instance), it’d be a pretty boring trailer.  I don’t think it compares to sephiroth showing up and one shotting the final boss of the story mode, and then wiping the floor with the entire cast.
    As someone who wasn't a KH fan at the time till recently, I don't know what you're on to say the trailer was meh as it was very emotional for the people who did want him in. Sephiroth's was hype but a trailer doesn't need to be hype to be gud

Byleth's was boring cuz there wasn't a dang thing going on and was overall very bland, mainly just to promote Three Houses. That was pretty much it
        [deleted]
            Ok, ignoring the people then, as I said for someone who wasn't even a fan back then, it was still a great trailer. It's a last fighter trailer that's basically Disney-fied. I have no idea what u were expecting for it to be hype by your definition and even then, it was still hype but more in the emotional sense. 

And once again, a trailer not being hype does not mean it wasn't good. That makes no sense
                [deleted]
                    >the trailer by itself is nothing special. 

Did we forget Sora was the literal last fighter? And thing is, I also personally think Sora's is the best trailer, and that's an opinion without bias. This was an opinion I had when I first saw the trailer but just in general, as we established, it's a great trailer. And thing is, to answer ur question, obviously Byleth being in Sephiroth's is gonna be more hype. But this entire argument is all about a matter of opinion. My point is both trailers serve a different emotion than the other. Just cuz one has more hype presentation doesn't take away from the other. U hold Sephiroth's trailer in higher regard but Sora's is also great for the momentous celebration of him being the final fighter. Ignoring that makes u look somewhat ignorant
                        [deleted]
                            I give up. Again, I don't know what u were expecting, it's a Disney-fied reveal trailer. To me, the trailer was beautiful. Which is why I like it more than Sephiroth's personally. But that wasn't the point I was trying to make and the bottom line is, the entire argument at the end of the day is a matter of opinion as u seem to hold Sephiroth's trailer in higher regard simply cuz more smashy, smashy stuff is happening but people simply like a more emotional trailer
    The trailer itself was minimal but not because it's easy but to sell the impact of the announcement. The trailer is just as much about Sora as it is on the final addition to ultimate. The symbolism in the trailer about the ending of this great crossover with a highly demanded character is brilliant and isn't ruined with any drawn-out scene. They were able to do something like this because of how popular and iconic Sora is, of course no one else could be reveal this way.

Sure they could've had an awesome fighting scene mixed in or a more faithful representation of the kh but I feel it was perfect for what it was meant to be. A short simple trailer made to reveal the last character for a smash direct. They already learnt from their mistakes with Byleth what not to do in a reveal during a smash direct.

Sora's reveal is like Sonic's where it will be remembered more for how incredible the reveal itself was than the actual cinematic and that will definitely never be forgotten. I'm just glad they finally learned how to properly end a smash roster.

    When I first saw the sora trailer I got really hype because I thought it was gonna be a Dark Souls rep
as someone who hasen't play KH, I think his trailer was very lame

its just all the characters standing there and then someone comes flying in.

I can see it being cool for the people that really wanted him, but as someone who had no idea who he was, it was just like, "oh cool, its that character people wanted" but the trailer wasn't cool at all.
You definitely haven't taken your love of kingdom hearts out of your ranking if you aren't ranking it as one of the worst trailers in the series. Rewatch the trailer and you'll realise that any hype you got was out of excitement for the character itself, not because the trailer was any good. The first 45 seconds is spent just showing off the fighters standing completely still, doing nothing. Then later on there is 25 seconds where nothing is happening again other than Sora just slowly flying over people's heads. And even putting aside that over half the trailer was spent on 2 extremely long shots of nothing happening, it also lacks things that all the other trailers have such as interesting visuals due to taking place in a black void
Mario getting fakeout fucking murdered is the best moment in any reveal trailer lmao
Seeing Bayonetta and Greninja take on Sephiroth was, for me, was kinda wild, too. I just love seeing characters that you never think would interact with each other in the same frame. I got the same kind of feeling with the World of Light trailer seeing Sonic and Pikachu running together.
Literally the byleth reveal was like a slowburn reveal for what everyone knew immediately was a FE character. Didn't help how no one really expected the second pass to be released, and assumed that Byleth was going to be the last character. I don't really hate Byleth in the game though, but just a super soft reveal
    It sucks because it was clearly not made to be in a smash direct. The slow start would've worked perfectly if it had been in a regular Nintendo direct like Pyra/Mythra. The trailer's was meant to have people question what it's about but that's irrelevant since it's in a Smash direct.
They did the style of P5 Justice, and the Arsène bit at the end was icing on the cake
Sora has entered the chat
Krool was amazing as well as Ridley.
It could have been if the song was Last Surprize
I love how it's **exactly** how they'd go about it.
Yeah I just KNEW where Mario went
you don’t belong in this world monster
    BEGONE!
i also have to give an honorable mention to steve. his trailer was nothing to write home about but the reveal itself was crazy. i fell off of minecraft a long time ago but i played it a lot when it first released as a little kid so it meant a lot to me.
Kazuyahs was pretty cool too
I heard he was happy, so I came to change that
Smh, just kiss already
Sephi really said “Bitch,did I catch you having fun?!”
And sora chased him down with the most wtf factor reveal of them all
And then sora said “nuh uh”
Sephiroth heard Cloud was suffering to Galeem and was like: "I am the only one allowed to make Cloud suffer."
“Why do I hear boss music??”
    #*SEPHIROTH*
        https://youtu.be/PwDPOxWyoXE?si=r8I-G0on6WXsdX2B
    Said Galeem
    That's was exactly the trailer
Cloud told Sora about Sephiroth because he knew he could take care of him, lvl 1 and no damage taken.
    SOOOORRRAAAAA SEPHIROTH IS BULLYING ME!

hold my keyblade
