[[What‚Äôs your favorite voice line from your main]]

I like how literally every single voice line peach has is toxic and so tilt-inducing lol

*blows you a kiss*

*sings and taunts you*

*awwww did I winnnnn*

*tHiS iS FuN!*
    She really is "that bitch".
    "This is fun!"
        Forgot THAT

Adding it
    "la lala lala, laaaa..."
    "HA CHA!!"
    she could kill a man with just speaking
    Every time I hear awwww did I winnn, I wanna gouge my fucking eyes out.

That's literally the ONLY reason why I'll NEVER play against peach, even if I win, I'm not gonna put myself through the physical and mental pain that is: fighting peach
        that voice line is the sole reason i mained peach in sm4sh. i used to hate all things girly but i gained a new appreciation for her
            Who knows maybe I'll turn to the dark side and use peach in the future, but that line is still gonna make my blood boil, even if I decide to pick her up as a pocket.




Peach in literally every other game:üòÑ

Peach in smash: üíÄüíÄüíÄüóø
    Daisy's are worse though

"Hi I'm Daisy!"

"Wooo hoo!" 

IMO those are both more annoying to be more toxic than Peach's combined.
        hI i'M dAiSy
            ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the best‚Äù
                That is Toad
                AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
        But imagine 

Peach 0-to-deaths you with a turnip combo, destroying your will to both live and to win the match 

And then she BLOWS YOU A KISS
            But-
        Daisy's loud and obnoxious, but she isn't nearly as toxic and condescending as Peach.
    It's the best part of being a Peach main for sure. Even my girlfriend has commented on how good her lines are
    look I mained peach very temporarily in the transition from inkling to mac main but ‚Äúawwwwww did I win?‚Äù Is still my favorite line in the game next to the announcer calling jokers name (same VA)
My favorite voice line is the fact that they decided to keep her silent despite using the armor design from the game where she never shuts up.
    give her the dread design in smash 6 frfr üíØ
        I kind of want her extra chonky Samus Returns armor in the next game, but I also want each alt to go beyond the simple color reference and change her armor model so we can get the full, proper Fusion, Dread, Dark, and Light suits.
            Imagine how sick it would be if Samus wore the >!Metroid Suit!< as an alt or transformed into it during her Final Smash.
                Finally, the green alt can actually be a reference.
        Technically ultimate *is* smash 6, as Wii U and 3ds are considered separate entries
            I mean, to be fair they didn't put ice climbers in the WiiU version due to not being able to implement Ice Climbers on 3ds
I'm particularly fond of Roy's shooting star KO voice line. Nothing like the screams of fear and death to brighten up your gaming session!
    I love it so much, back when I was co-maining Roy. It‚Äôd always put a smile on my face dying off the top lol
        Co-maiming. Hehe
            Poor Roy
                I hate auto correct. That is all
                This is smash, he's used to it.
        I used to use roy a bunch. I never really thought he had a definite combo game just kinda swinging around.
    Easily my favorite sound in the game. Makes me laugh every time.
        It makes me remember he‚Äôs just some teenager and it hurts hearing it personally. I can see why people find it funny though
    It is my headcannon that with the group of Fox, Ike, Roy and Chrom, the star KO voice line is the last line they recorded because it's just their voice actors getting brutally murdered.
    According to Ray Chase, that scream is similar to the one he made when he found out that the Final Fantasy XV DLC was canceled.
    Classic Roy voice line 14
    Roy has dope shouts, the down air _tsssAAAHH_ and the fully charged flare blade _TORRRYAAAAAAHHH_ are my two favorites
    You gotta give it to em, they murdered the voice actor to get that sound
        Now THAT'S dedication!
    Doesn‚Äôt pit scream like a deranged psychopath as well? I‚Äôm always like wtf??
        No. He goes: "I never learned how to read!" Which is a reference to when he says that in the most recent Kid Icarus game as he's falling to what he thinks is his death.
"I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO READ!!!!"
    *sigh*‚Ä¶I miss my wife, Tails.
        I miss her a lot, I'll be back
            *cue Ryan laughing hysterically in the background*
        "She took the fuckin kids, man."
        ‚ÄúI did you wife‚Äù- sans
            SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG IS A BITCH-ASS MOTHERFUCKER! HE PISSED ON MY FUCKING WIFE
                *Eggman proceeds to piss on the moon*
                    **YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS** ***DRRRROPLLLLETS*** **HIT THE FUCKING EARTH, NOW GET OUT OF MY FUCKING SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO** (I still can't believe Alfred came up with all of that and more all on the spot. What a legend.)
                        I saw a video a while back of them recording it live, Penny stopped EVERYTHING and made everyone stop their recording and save to make sure no one's audio was lost lol. She knew they struck gold. If I remember right Alfred just kinda went "I don't know what came over me there"
                        I‚Äôm still waiting for the next sonic video
                            Penny [announced](https://youtu.be/Rsx63Vu2b2M) they're doing Shadow the Hedgehog next!
                                Yeah Ik, im waiting
            [deleted]
                Kris says nothing
    tbh I thought he said "I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO LAND" but that's much better lol
        That's an actual quote from his game, by the way
            I'm sorry for my ignorance then
                Oh, I wasn't mocking you or anything, just thought more people needed to know.
                    I know, I'm just apologising for not knowing that
                        Kid Icarus Uprising is a treasure trove of iconic quotes, from the top of my head, I can remember:  


"It's like watching a chicken wearing roller skates"

"So you'd better not be thinking about anything... naughty"

"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

"G-FORCE IN MY FAAAAAACE"

"Who is this 'Icarus' character this game is named after? Can I meet him?"

"I think they used it in that one series, 'Super Bash Sisters'."

"Darn you, balanced game play!"

"Awww, Pit! We really need to get you some friends."
                            >"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

Love that one. Especially how Pit/Palutena respond with "Well how did you build a racetrack without hands?" and Pandora just responds with "Hard work and determination".

Also gotta love the 4th wall breaks. A personal fav of mine is when Pit and Viridi are climbing a super long tower and Pit is complaining about how long they've been climbing and says "I'm pretty sure there was a loading screen back there!".
                                The best 4th wall break that isn't Hades' speech at the end is Viridi going "THIS game universe and THAT game universe have NOTHING to do with each other!" When Pit mentions how Komaytos look like little metroids.

Man, I should really play that game again.
                                    Now that Ultimate is finally done, I really hope that Sakurai's next big project is a new Kid Icarus game.

A huge successful Switch game could really get this franchise going.
                            How could you leave out:

"Plus, chicken is much more economical!"

"What elegance! What Grace! What disturbing brutality!"

"I am now a Level Infinity Epic Super God Plus!"

"Big Monsters kill Pit, grrr!"

"Every dweeb has his day"

"I don't want to steam the sacred buns."

"When freaky aliens give you lemons, make freaky alien lemonade!"

And the classic, the iconic:

"Floor ice cream gives you health!"
                                Ahhhh, the sandwich tactic! How delectable!

_SHUT UP, HADES_
                                Thank you very much, how could I forget these
                            "This game universe and that game universe have NOTHING to do with each other!"
    I love spamming up taunt too.

‚ÄúThat all ya got? That all ya got? That all ya got? That all ya got? That all ya got?‚Ä¶‚Äù
    G-FORCE

IN MY FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
    That is up there with ness‚Äôs okay, everything flacon says, and Terry‚Äôs ‚Äúare you okay‚Äù with the best sounds in the game
    Shit legit made me lol first time I heard it ü§£
    I didn‚Äôt know this was real til I heard it in game. Saw it online and thought it was fake üòÇ
    This is the best one hands down
Dark Pit's smug "Can't help but feel sorry for ya!"

Captain Falcon's death scream sounds like he just hit his pinky toe on the edge of the bed

And the most destructive move in the game, Zelda's down taunt
    You are objectively wrong about Falcon. The answer is ‚ÄúSHOW ME YOUR MOVES‚Äù.
        "YES!"
            "COME ON!!"
            ‚ÄúIs that the crowd cheering in his head?‚Äù
            YHES
        FALKON PAWWWNCH!!!
    My favorite dark pit line is "Where's your Goddess Now?!'
    As a child my brother, sister, and I laughed at Cpt. Falcon's star KO scream every time because it reminded us of that one scene in ATLA when the Boulder made an unintentional full split while fighting Toph and just screamed, "Uuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!"
        Atla?
            Avatar the last airbender
        Now I can't unhear that lol
    Dark Pits is hilarious because he randomly sounds Australian when he says that lmao
    Sometimes, you just gotta send a fool off at a million miles an hour with a magical suit of armor and just laugh and wave at them.
    His Melee death scream or current one?
    def my favorite dark pit line but I cheated and just chose pit‚Äôs star KO
HANDS OFF MY COCK
    That's a good one
    Hands off my- COCK!
I WON'T LOSE! I WON'T LOSE! I WO- HUAAAAAAAAH! I WON'T LOSE! (I don't main roy but this is my fave to do)
    Up b in the middle?
        It's one of his taunts, where he just charges pure winner energy and yells while posing w/ fire
Puff: has a small chance of saying "Oof!" When doing a forward smash

Doc: his final smash: "Hoo Yea"

Wario: again his final smash: "Hee ha ha hoo!"

Ice Climbers: idk probably their side taunt

Terry: definitely "Are you okay?"
    How do you even pick a favorite voice line for Terry? 

Any time I play or watch(*mostly Riddles, since he‚Äôs the Terry god*) I catch my self repeating a lot of his lines. They‚Äôre just SO catchy and fun to say! I love Terry

As for Wario, I agree, but I do love his victory screen endless laugh while rolling on his back
        I feel the same about Terry's lines. His broken english is so good.

RRRRISING TACKOO

POWO WAVE

BEAT AHHHH

POWA GEYSAAAAA

BUSTA WALLLF
            POWAA DAANK
                POWA CHURGE
                    "HEURS DA BICK WON - ***BUSTER VVOLFF!***"
            I refuse to believe Terry Down-B is anything but "Howbout dat?" ever since I heard it that way.
                HOLY CRAP I'M NOT CRAZY AFTER ALL
            BARNACLE
    BUSTA WULRF
    Are you okay is definitely amazing,  but BUSSSSTTAAA WOOLF never gets old
Meta Knight‚Äôs down taunt

C0ME
    #COOM
    Gentle doms be like
    CUMMMM
    I love when theres complete silence and a meta knight suddenly says "COME"
*okay...*
     ok e y
You'd never guess.
    I'M REALLY FEELING IT
        *BACKSLASH!*
            *proceeds to miss the ledge and SD*
            #AIRSLASH!
        THIS IS THE MONADO'S POWER
    Why do I hear a kazoo in the distance?
    Now it's Shulk (Reyn) time!!
    This is a good result!
    NOW IT'S SHULK TIME!
    No because absolutely everything he says is perfection incarnate

                DORIYA
                    Dooryiah
                        DORIYA
                            Duh
    Thought this was Kaz at first. I‚Äôm more of a Tekken player than a Smash player, and I forget DORIYA is iconic in both communities.
        Theres a reason Ganon was the first person to get dropped when Kaz was revealed. He took it personally.
            I remember making this same joke the day the trailer dropped haha
        It‚Äôs both. Kazuya has the DORIYA as well
    TOYAAA

Ganondorf drives a Toyota confined
Cloud: "„Éü„Çπ„Å£„Åü..." (Missed it...) or ÈôêÁïå„ÇíË∂Ö„Åà„Çã (exceed the limit)

Unrelated but Lucario is the only Pok√©mon to actually speak in gameplay because he speaks in his counter and Final Smash
    Bro, how‚Äôd you get a Japanese keyboard? I needed that for Sephiroth
        I took the Japanese from Smash Wiki.
            I d on my speak a single word of Japanese but Cloud has one voice line that sounds like ‚ÄúA lot of Corona‚Äù and I found that pretty funny during the pandemic
                Or he's an alcoholic
                ÊÇ™„ÅèÊÄù„ÅÜ„Å™ 


(?) This might be it
        Just go into your keyboard settings. It's the Japanese IME.
    As a fellow Cloud player, same for me I think.
    If we count all cloud-noises then my favourite is the sound Finishing touch makes
    *Genkai wo koeru*
    For the longest time I thought Cloud was missing a KO line because I could never hear it over the sound of everything.
    Personally, my favourite of Cloud's has to be ËààÂë≥„Å™„ÅÑ„Å≠ (Not interested)
    I still think Mewtwo deserved voicelines for his gameplay.
*is that all?*
    was trying to find this, thx
*Yip yip*

But

*BRRRNNG PAA!*

Is excellent too

    Bro when did Aang join Smash? /s
    *mlem*
        The sound of getting pooped off a cliff
"Show 'em what you got, Mac baby!"

Little Mac doesn't really have voicelines, so Doc Louis lines are kind of my only choice.
Sora: The "Here we go!" from his down taunt. He sounds so excited.

Joker: When he says "Ravage them!" as he uses his final smash.

Byleth: "Let the lesson begin!" is a good callback to FE3H

Pit: Do I even need to say it?

K. Rool: His up taunt. It sounds like he's laughing at you.
    For me, it‚Äôs Byleth‚Äôs, ‚ÄúAIRPODS!‚Äù
        I spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure out what in god's name sounded like that in their moveset, I'm dumb
            Which one is that
                Both side B and f smash can have the "Areadbhar!" (why is it spelt like this) voice line
                    >why is it spelt like this

languages
        Lol my kid always tell me it sounds like "Air Stuff" and we both bust laughing out loud
        Lmao I always heard ‚ÄúBEAR CLAW!‚Äù
    Yea Sora's "Here we go" kinda makes the natch a little more exciting
        Whenever I play Sora offline or in a battle arena I always do the "Here we go!" when my opponent is on their last stock.
    I can never hear jokers ravage them I know it should be so but I can‚Äôt seem to hear that
    For Sora, I love 'Time!' Because if you use it right at the end of a match it's like Sora was speedrunning victory
    K. Rool sounds like he speaks some language nobody but the Kongs understand and I love it

‚ÄúAWOOOOOO‚Äù
    fair and Up air sound is soooo Good to hit but Up taunt is epic as well (all claw efect moves feel Good)
        Oh absolutely. I love all his claw moves, they‚Äôre so crisp and satisfying.
    Which one, the badass one or the puberty one?
    In this game it‚Äôs more ‚ÄúArOuGhHh‚Äù for his taunt and I find that funny
I like Ridley's Up-Taunt. Such an iconic and threatening voice line.

Can't decide for Steve. Every single one of them is so powerful and has so much emotion behind it. Gives him so much personality and character.
    For Ridley my favorite is the one where he screeches and flaps his wings. As Metroid fan imo it‚Äôs just perfect for who he is

Meta Knight- "Come back when you can put up a fight"  
Snake- "THERE!"
    Snakes eating sounds are better to me
        UINNN!
        Tasty
    Like you hear the voices out of context and you suddenly hear this extremely deep voice then you turn around and it's this round ball with comically large pointy shoes.
either TETRAKARN, YOUR MINE, or looking cool joker
    Maybe I‚Äôm basic but I love ‚ÄúARSENE!‚Äù
        Yes
    Lookin cool joker for the memes
Think you can take me? - Mythra
    The ardainian soldiers say it better.

"ThiNk You cAn tAke mE!!!"
        The only mistake Sakurai made was not having Pyra say "Don't forget me"
            Instead they gave her the most heartbreaking death voice line in "I'm sorry!"
*Gulp, Gulp*

Pfweh!
    Milk and cereal milk and cereal milk and cereal 

Cereal and milk?
    I don't like this for reasons that I find disturbing
DKs down taunt for sure
    _AAAOOOOUUUUUU??_
Ridley‚Äôs Up-Taunt
Both: "HAHAHA!" and "üé∂la la la la la laüé∂" have such sinister undertones to them...
Not my main but Corrin‚Äôs "I win!" is the best voice line in the game
    It's great they managed to fit all of his personality into two words
    Female Corrin's "good!" makes me laugh every time.
    Corn
    Based. This is why male Corrin is superior
        Especially Mint Morrin
Roy: *bloodcurling scream*
‚ÄúGo Charizard! Kick that little bitch‚Äôs ass‚Äù Pretty sure thats accurate. Might be paraphrasing
    "No no that's right"- a talking meowth
Woomy- Inkling
i'm really feeling it
    No, I think you mean

&#x200B;

I'M REALLY FEELING IT
        #I'M REALLY FEELING IT
I'm legally obligated to put all of Terry's voice lines here...



...but my heart belongs to One Winged Angel's activation. 

"Ë∫´„ÅÆÁ®ã„ÇíÁü•„Çå" ("Know your place") 
"ÁõÆÈöú„Çä„Å†" ("Annoying" / "Pathetic").
    I gotta play more sephiroth bro
"Minna, miteite kure" was pretty good, ultimate is the first smash game ive actually played but i somehow still have nostalgia for marths japanese lines
    They endured almost 4 games before deciding he needed to speak English too
How can i choose a favourite when they are all so good?
    "Bagel!"
        "Barnacle!"
            Whenever my brother hears Burn Knuckle he thinks Terry says "RUM AND COKE!"
LET'S TIP THE SCALES

Spam Robin's up taunt and he says it a lot and I think it's pretty funny, it's actually the main reason I play him
Sephiroth winning against cloud: i will never be a memory and when he laughs then looks over his shoulder then walks into the flames
Byleth: ‚ÄúEach Battle, a chance to grow‚Äù or ‚ÄúAllow me to demonstrate‚Äù 

Sephiroth: victory screen line

Snake: ‚Äúnot even close‚Äù

Marth: ‚ÄúI can not afford to lose‚Äù 

ZSS: ‚ÄúIs that all‚Äù
    I really wish they had included ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something to believe in‚Äù for Byleth
    Sephiroth: "[Victory screen line]"
    Kept You Waiting Huh?
    Marth: "I can not afford new shoes"
You‚Äôve much yet to learn
waka waka
I will never be a memory
I absolutely adore the fact that the taunts for inkling are the same as in the actual game, ‚Äúthis way!‚Äù And ‚Äúbooyah!‚Äù
I like Isabelles voicelines
    ***"bold of you to assume i fear death"***
The funny star KO that references chapter 17 of Kid Icarus: Uprising.

Also, Dark Pit‚Äôs ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm the last man standing.‚Äù
Byleth: NO HESITATION
Looking cool joker-morgana

Think you can take me-mythra

Are you ok-terry


- where‚Äôs your goddess now-dark. Pit
*japanese*
Marth's counter "Predictable !"
‚Äúsicko mode‚Äù ‚Äîincineroar probably
My mains don‚Äôt usually talk but ya gotta love links ‚ÄúHYAAA!‚Äù
For ganondorf the hearty sailors laugh victory screen and "Heh" of f tilt.
"Ruagruahrurugruahruahruhg!" - King K Rool
Hands off my prey
And CAA
Put them together and what do you get?

Also Roy's death screen makes me laugh all every single time
Steve: 

Piranha Plant:
    Honestly when Steve says " " is way better than when he says " "
    Based
"HET-HRRRRRNGH"

Yoshi double jump
Junen hayaindayo!
Any of Doc Louis's voicelines.
Not my main, but "I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO REEEEEEAD!!!!" is the best line in the game.
Let the lesson begin - Byleth side taunt
Let's do this!
    I love Corrin's win quote. "Good."
‚Äú‚†Ä‚Äù

I main Isabelle and Steve
    Such a crime Isabelle doesn't have her animalese voice.
I'm no Pyra/Mythra main but I can very much appreciate the "Think you can take me?"
My favorite is the one where he beeps
Whatever the hell Cloud says because I don‚Äôt understand Japanese
    Same
I don't know. Dedede and K rool don't really even have that much voice lines. They just sound like animals.
okay.
The sound Yoshi makes when you tech.
HEY CMON CMON
UOOOOOGGHHHH - Dedede, King
‚ÄúCome back when you can put up a fight‚Äù

*aight imma head out*
\*grunts and "HYAAAH"s\*

&#x200B;

Secondary (Mythra): *"Seriously?"*
Pit:Come on! 
Sora:here we go
Pyra/Mythra:This, is the power of the Aegis!
Shulk:THIS IS THE MONADO'S POWER.
ARE YOU OKAY? - Terry

EEEEEEEEEUUUUUAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH - Hero

Doriya - Kazuya 

Shin‚Ä¶Shoyruken! - Ryu

Zzz‚Ä¶ Dracula‚Ä¶. Zzzz - Richter 

Bonus -

GIGADEIN! - Y≈´usha
Show me your moves!
That sound yoshi makes when he gets killed up the top and you can see him falling in the background
- MK: _Come back when you can put up a fight!_ (D-pad left victory screen) Original: „ÇÇ„Å£„Å® „Å§„Çà„Åè „Å™„Å£„Å¶ „Åì„ÅÑ (Come back when you're stronger.)
- Pac-Man: The distorted _I'm your friend!_ when you get Baraduke from up-taunt. (Fun fact: that counts as a sound effect, not a voice clip. Same with King & Balloon's _Thank you!_)
- Not a main, but Byleth: _My battle ends heeeeeeere!_ In the original (as with Pit's), it's just a generic scream.
YEASS!!!
COME AWN!!!
BLUE FALCON!!!
FALCON KICK!!!
SHOW ME YOUR MOVES!!!
FALCON PAWNCH!!!
WHOOPS!!!
I like when he roars
Kirby after eating incineroar: Meow
"Mnlom bom" -Yoshi (neutral B)

"..." -Pacman

"..." -Piranha Plant
Hm! *Neutral b explosion.sfx*
‚ÄúBlarg‚Äù - Incineroar, a true poet
#IM REALLY FEELING IT
‚Ä¶
Take this! Or Here we go!
    Even reading the ‚Äútake this!‚Äù voice line annoys me lol
        Take this! Back off! Take this! Fire! Thunder! Take this!
*Absolute Silence*

Damn that's perfect
ROBERT star ko

gnw‚Ä¶ not sure, all his voice lines are *so* memorable
His up taunt.
Sakurai noises*
#
*laughs in Mega Man*
My favorite voice line is Pichu saying Pichu Pichu.... awesome üòé
For Meta Knight it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCome back when you can put up a fight!‚Äù
Kirby: Pretty much every copy move where he says it like the base character but derpier. 

Ex:
Ryu:  Hadoken!
Kirby:  DOO KEN!

Sora:  Freeze!
Kirby: Fweeze!
Mine is definitely hero going BLLLSHHGHKSHH.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the champ, baby‚Äù
I like when Steve says ""
Hoo ha he hey hoo
Yoshi: Yo! Yo! (Down taunt)

Palutena: too bad for you (victory screen)

Terry: Are you OK? (BUSTER WOLF)
*playtimes over, star fox >:)*
my main is mute :(
Hyaaaa! - Link
us Link mains trying to pick our favorite HYAAA

his Up-B is a good one
"HERE'S DA BIG ONE" (Terry's at his max engrish)
Arcthunder! (Using the move)
You're not ready yet! (Down taunt)
*rock transformation sound effect* followed by *loud thud*
‚Äú\*Cunning God of Death‚Äôs scream\*‚Äù 

\-Ridley
NO (his ko sound)
"Seriously?" I think it only happens when you SD. Feels completely on-brand and I think it's funny that my own character yells at me to play better
Is that all?
Bowser Jr./ the Koopalings: the little shout they do when using Up B. They all make different sounds, but it‚Äôs my favorite voice line from them.

Fox: his ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go‚Äù taunt. It just fires Fox up, literally and figuratively.

Mythra: ‚ÄúThink you can take me?‚Äù Such a classic Xenoblade Chronicles 2 meme, I‚Äôm so glad it got referenced.

Pyra: (with Rex) ‚ÄúBURNING SWORD!‚Äù

Lucario: Final Smash ‚ÄúMAX AURA!‚Äù Even though it has no canonical reference, it‚Äôs still a really cool Smash original voice line.
Grrninja doesn't talk so I guess up taunt because he's sassy lol
EASIRAEIGUGHEIEARUGHAAAAAAAA
I don‚Äôt think mega man has voice lines
*unintelligible monkey noise*
Doriyah
‚ÄúHe he he, they‚Äôre done for!‚Äù
Rawr
Pit:Come on! 
Sora:here we go
Pyra/Mythra:This, is the power of the Aegis!
Shulk:THIS IS THE MONADO'S POWER.

‚ÄúCHROM‚Äù -Robin

Alt answer:

Roy: *gets killed off the top 

Roy: *Deaths screams

Byleths off the top ‚ÄúMy battle ends here‚Äù is also good.
ROYS OUR BOI
Guh-huh!
Roy: Star KO
‚ÄúMy battle ends HEEEeEEeeeEre!!!!‚Äù
"PK Starstorm!"
r u o k?
Come On
"good" 

Also the classic "I never learned how to read!!" for my secondary main
Plant f-tilt is pretty satisfying.      
*chomp chomp*
"Guh Huh Guh Huh" Banjo
Beep beep.

*sits down, exhausted*
Falcon: Show me your moves!

Ganon: DORYAH

Terry: POWAH GEYSAH

Ken: whatever sound he makes during his proximity final smash

Roy: Star KO
Byleth : "My battle ends HEEEEEEEeeeeee^eeeeere"

Mythra : "Ray of PUNISHMENT" 

Terry : "Are you ok?" and "RRRRISING TACKLE"
The one where he says ‚ÄúPikachu‚Äù
"This is a good result!"

I mean, yeah, Shulk, this is a good bit more obvious than crafting an ether gem though...
Love how there are no Inklings in the comments
Not a voice line but the satisfying *ching* flare blitz makes on startup
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get burned‚Äù
GUH-HUH¬≤ is the best down-taunt in the game
Wii Fit's fitness instructions sound taunting during battle, especially "You're wobbling, try to keep your balance!"
THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?!
(Intense screaming)
"Talk is cheap."
"..." - Steve

"Looking Cool Joker!" - Joker

"POWER GEYSER!" - Terry

"*intense anime scream*" - Hero

"Try Me!" - Byleth
SIIAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!
Arc fire :)
Pit screaming when he gets hit off the top always makes me giggle.
I like how Roy just fucking screams
Let‚Äôs-a go üòñ
Mythra: seriously (death scream) 

Pyra: I‚Äôm sorry (death scream)

Female robin: I was careless (death scream)

Pit: I never learn how to read(sky KO idk what that‚Äôs called)

Female corrin: good (victory quote)
Back off

The nostalgia of using reaction commands in kh2 to finish off bosses hits so hard
‚ÄúPikachu‚Äù

-Pikachu
K. Rool taunt: ‚ÄúAAAAAR AAAAAR AAAAAR‚Äù
My favorite quote of my main is‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶
Definitely Lucas‚Äôs star ko sound
Anything Terry

Losing to Cloud hurts but I always find myself saying his voice lines

I also like Mythra's "You're done"
RAARRGH - Bowser
Dedede: **Sakurai noises**

Seph: „ÇÅ„Åñ„Çí„Çä„Çà„ÄÇ (Pathetic)
This is Snake, I‚Äôm done here
‚ÄúOh Kay!‚Äù
pikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah‚Ä¶
Young Link: *screaming and yelling uncontrollably*
PIKA
Corrin: ‚ÄúMy path is clear!‚Äù

Bowser: *grunt number 577*
okey
I use Male Voice 1 for my mii and I have to say that his Star K.O scream is the best, like you can hear the actual terror in his scream
*screeching purple space pterodactyl sounds*
Hands off my kawk
"You're wobbling, try to keep your balance."

Wise words indeed
Female PT when you win with Ivysaur: ‚ÄúEveryone did great!‚Äù when she praises Squirtle and Charizard individually. Like ‚ÄúOh yea, you‚Äôre here too‚Ä¶ uhhhhh‚Äù

Byleth‚Äôs star KO ‚ÄúMy battle ends heeEEreeee‚Äù is iconic. If it counts, the crowd chant saying ‚ÄúTeach! Teach! Teach!‚Äù takes the cake

Incineroar‚Äôs rawr when you use Revenge without getting hit is cute, the little chuckle when he does get hit with Revenge is nice, and the F-Smash ‚ÄúIIINcin‚Äù is iconic when you kill at 40
Villager: *rubs twig on the floor*
Chrom says ‚ÄúGet out of my way!‚Äù when he does his up-B move sometimes. I always mishear it as ‚ÄúGet off my wife!‚Äù üíÄ
"You're too slow" from previous iterations of smash.
King K Rool: Animal noises
Duck Hunt: Bark
Not my main, but Byleth's "Stay Focused" is brutal. I also like Palutena's Down Smash because it sounds like she's saying "Got his ass"
The up taunt scream is amazing
When Ridley does his down taunt, you can hear his back crack.

It‚Äôs technically a voice line
Steve: *dead silence*

Incineroar: rawr rawr! (Side taunt)

Sora: noh! (KO sound)
I‚Äôm just realizing only 3 of my mains have actual voice lines

Luigi: His dash attack

Sephiroth: Idk I don‚Äôt speak Japanese

Wii Fit: ‚ÄúLeT‚Äôs GeT a GoOD StReTch‚Äù
(*Galaga noises*)

King k rool - the satisfying sound of landing a counter in a fully charged samus charge shot 

Joker - You‚Äôre mine (also Morgana saying ‚Äútime for some brutality‚Äù in his final smash)

Min Min - I dunno

Samus - Silent in armor 

ROB - the sound of a fully charged laser

Lucaria - MAX AURA
"Talk is cheap"
Female Robin saying ‚Äúa good tactician has nothing to fear‚Äù is cool and applies to a lot of situations. ‚ÄúHow can you protect chrom when you can‚Äôt even protect yourself‚Äù is cool and just cold to lucina
"cum" - meta knight
I adore Mythra‚Äôs self-destruct. It‚Äôs just her sounding tired af of losing, like ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù It‚Äôs hilarious.
If Doc Louis counts with Little Mac: "I think I hear a chocolate bar callin'" 

If Doc Louis doesn't count then it's: "Huuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaa... Hea!!!!!" (Neutral B)

Falco: "Hands of my cock!"

Young Link: "Hyeaaaaaaa!" (Up B)
PICHU PI- CHUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuu‚Ä¶!
DORIYAH
the first 3 people i got in elite smash were k rool bowser and DK
Poyo! (Kirby)
Incineroar: grunts intensely 

K. Rool: also grunts intensely 

Plant: uhhhhhhhhh, does he make any sound?

Fox: *cries in no good voice in ultimate*
Snake's star ko sounds like his screams in his death screens in MGS, which I love
‚ÄúGuh-hah!‚Äù
Iiiiiinnnnncccciiiiinnnnneeeerrrrroooaaooaarrrr
...I don't speak Japanese :(
The fact my main is just straight up voiced by Goku
I like how sora says "Here we go!" for his down taunt, when Cloud says "Waruku omou na" for his victory screen and for Hero i kinda like his magic burst voiceline
Wii Fit voice lines are just so passive aggressive and I love them all
.......
Byleth: My battle ends heeeeeeere!!!

Steve: Oof

Sora: idk
Mine has probably got to be either ‚Äúyour mine‚Äù or Morgana yelling ‚Äúlookin cool joker‚Äù in his taunts
DORIYAH!
"Woomy" 

            -Schoolgirl Inkling


"Dreadful"

              -Bayonetta
Ridley: *screeching* ROOOAAARR 
Joker taunt: ‚Äûyou can do it joker!‚Äú
Terry: ‚ÄûAre you okay?‚Äú
WHAT?
Olimar: ....
SHORYUKEN
Have to pick:
Snake's "There!"
Nana's KO sounds (For some reason, they sound more comically violent than Popo's)
M Byleth's second KO sound "Not my best"
Ridley: \*loud screeching
"Plant Noises"
Kazuya: This will be your burial ground!
Byleth: AY-MR

Kirby: HA! (Fsmash)
Mario: Hoooo
What about Mythra saying "Seriously?"
GUH-HUH
"Guh huh!"
Roy's scream as he sets off a full charge Neutral B always gets to me a little. He sounds very angry
Marth‚Äôs victory screen

‚ÄúThe gay is mine‚Äù
Pika- psychotic death scream

Puff- pound sound

MK- Fight Me Taunt
Shulk: i CAN change the future! 

i can FEEL the POWER

Ness: eOUWCH-
*kirby after copying terry* POWWA WEH
All Monke noises from DK and the sassy mmhm from Rosa‚Äôs side taunt
Probably "are you o k a y?" Or the "power geyser", tbh Terry have the best voice lines in the game
Unholy screams from the abyss when he up taunts
"Monkey noise"

~Diddy kong
definitely gotta be "loud screech "
HOO HOO. Really hits close to home
*\*shadow boxes aggressively\**

\~Little Mac
"Never Gonna Give You Up"
*beep
Not much of a falco main but I appreciate the victory screen where he jumps up and says ‚ÄúHa‚Äù
Not my main, but All of Meta Knight‚Äôs voice lines are so cool and I‚Äôm glad they haven‚Äôt changed them since brawl.
‚ÄúI fight for my friends.‚Äù
Needs no introduction.
If morgana count for joker it's probably, " Looking cool, joker!" But if she doesnt its, "Not enough"
"Dorya"
Well, Pokemon Trainer doesn‚Äôt really have a lot to work with. So probably ‚Äúyou did great, Buddy!‚Äù From the victory screen
i like playing the doc - mario matchup with one of my friends and we both double jump at the same time and you hear a synced YAHOO!
Beep boop
IM REALLY FEELING IT
Ness used to say "Ouchie" when he died.
I‚Äôm just glad mewtwo has his old melee taunt where he spins and does that laugh.
The one where she goes:
Roar
"Pow Pow!"
#
Either down taunt or down B
‚ÄúAH YOU OH-KAY!?‚Äù
BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP RIIIIING
^(HADOKEN!!)
Corrin victory: I WON!!!!
Pit star KO: I never learned how to read!!!!
*"Seriously?"*
That was almost too easy, and the noises toon link down taunt makes
I like when mario climbs a ledge and he goes "YEUH"
HIT 'EM BABY! 

But if you want to get technical with Mac's voice himself, then his star ko yell
*Monkey sounds* - Diddy Kong
I can‚Äôt choose just one
Mewtwo laughing in his up taunt.
Gu-huh!
‚Äúlet the lesson begin!‚Äù ‚Äúback off!‚Äù
I love when Steve goes:
We're both on the same page. Right?
Mega Man doesn‚Äôt have any lines :(

My favorite line from my secondary, Pok√©mon Trainer is ‚ÄúDang it‚Äù
‚ÄúMy battle is here‚Äù Byleth meteor KO (Not a main.) ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get burned.‚Äù Pyra‚Äôs Side taunt. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the big one, Buster Wolf!‚Äù Terry‚Äôs Final Smash. ‚ÄúGuess again.‚Äù Mythra, Executing Forsight. ‚ÄúAhh, Shin, Shoryuken!‚Äù Ryu‚Äôs close Fish Smash. ‚ÄúMy friends are my power‚Äù Sora, oh wait wrong game. ‚ÄúHere we go‚Äù Sora, Up Taunt. ‚ÄúMy strength is yours.‚Äù Chrom, Robin victory screen.
Doriyah.
She really is "that bitch".
"This is fun!"
    Forgot THAT

Adding it
"la lala lala, laaaa..."
"HA CHA!!"
she could kill a man with just speaking
Every time I hear awwww did I winnn, I wanna gouge my fucking eyes out.

That's literally the ONLY reason why I'll NEVER play against peach, even if I win, I'm not gonna put myself through the physical and mental pain that is: fighting peach
    that voice line is the sole reason i mained peach in sm4sh. i used to hate all things girly but i gained a new appreciation for her
        Who knows maybe I'll turn to the dark side and use peach in the future, but that line is still gonna make my blood boil, even if I decide to pick her up as a pocket.




Peach in literally every other game:üòÑ

Peach in smash: üíÄüíÄüíÄüóø
Daisy's are worse though

"Hi I'm Daisy!"

"Wooo hoo!" 

IMO those are both more annoying to be more toxic than Peach's combined.
    hI i'M dAiSy
        ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the best‚Äù
            That is Toad
            AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    But imagine 

Peach 0-to-deaths you with a turnip combo, destroying your will to both live and to win the match 

And then she BLOWS YOU A KISS
        But-
    Daisy's loud and obnoxious, but she isn't nearly as toxic and condescending as Peach.
It's the best part of being a Peach main for sure. Even my girlfriend has commented on how good her lines are
look I mained peach very temporarily in the transition from inkling to mac main but ‚Äúawwwwww did I win?‚Äù Is still my favorite line in the game next to the announcer calling jokers name (same VA)
give her the dread design in smash 6 frfr üíØ
    I kind of want her extra chonky Samus Returns armor in the next game, but I also want each alt to go beyond the simple color reference and change her armor model so we can get the full, proper Fusion, Dread, Dark, and Light suits.
        Imagine how sick it would be if Samus wore the >!Metroid Suit!< as an alt or transformed into it during her Final Smash.
            Finally, the green alt can actually be a reference.
    Technically ultimate *is* smash 6, as Wii U and 3ds are considered separate entries
        I mean, to be fair they didn't put ice climbers in the WiiU version due to not being able to implement Ice Climbers on 3ds
I love it so much, back when I was co-maining Roy. It‚Äôd always put a smile on my face dying off the top lol
    Co-maiming. Hehe
        Poor Roy
            I hate auto correct. That is all
            This is smash, he's used to it.
    I used to use roy a bunch. I never really thought he had a definite combo game just kinda swinging around.
Easily my favorite sound in the game. Makes me laugh every time.
    It makes me remember he‚Äôs just some teenager and it hurts hearing it personally. I can see why people find it funny though
It is my headcannon that with the group of Fox, Ike, Roy and Chrom, the star KO voice line is the last line they recorded because it's just their voice actors getting brutally murdered.
According to Ray Chase, that scream is similar to the one he made when he found out that the Final Fantasy XV DLC was canceled.
Classic Roy voice line 14
Roy has dope shouts, the down air _tsssAAAHH_ and the fully charged flare blade _TORRRYAAAAAAHHH_ are my two favorites
You gotta give it to em, they murdered the voice actor to get that sound
    Now THAT'S dedication!
Doesn‚Äôt pit scream like a deranged psychopath as well? I‚Äôm always like wtf??
    No. He goes: "I never learned how to read!" Which is a reference to when he says that in the most recent Kid Icarus game as he's falling to what he thinks is his death.
*sigh*‚Ä¶I miss my wife, Tails.
    I miss her a lot, I'll be back
        *cue Ryan laughing hysterically in the background*
    "She took the fuckin kids, man."
    ‚ÄúI did you wife‚Äù- sans
        SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG IS A BITCH-ASS MOTHERFUCKER! HE PISSED ON MY FUCKING WIFE
            *Eggman proceeds to piss on the moon*
                **YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS** ***DRRRROPLLLLETS*** **HIT THE FUCKING EARTH, NOW GET OUT OF MY FUCKING SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO** (I still can't believe Alfred came up with all of that and more all on the spot. What a legend.)
                    I saw a video a while back of them recording it live, Penny stopped EVERYTHING and made everyone stop their recording and save to make sure no one's audio was lost lol. She knew they struck gold. If I remember right Alfred just kinda went "I don't know what came over me there"
                    I‚Äôm still waiting for the next sonic video
                        Penny [announced](https://youtu.be/Rsx63Vu2b2M) they're doing Shadow the Hedgehog next!
                            Yeah Ik, im waiting
        [deleted]
            Kris says nothing
tbh I thought he said "I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO LAND" but that's much better lol
    That's an actual quote from his game, by the way
        I'm sorry for my ignorance then
            Oh, I wasn't mocking you or anything, just thought more people needed to know.
                I know, I'm just apologising for not knowing that
                    Kid Icarus Uprising is a treasure trove of iconic quotes, from the top of my head, I can remember:  


"It's like watching a chicken wearing roller skates"

"So you'd better not be thinking about anything... naughty"

"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

"G-FORCE IN MY FAAAAAACE"

"Who is this 'Icarus' character this game is named after? Can I meet him?"

"I think they used it in that one series, 'Super Bash Sisters'."

"Darn you, balanced game play!"

"Awww, Pit! We really need to get you some friends."
                        >"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

Love that one. Especially how Pit/Palutena respond with "Well how did you build a racetrack without hands?" and Pandora just responds with "Hard work and determination".

Also gotta love the 4th wall breaks. A personal fav of mine is when Pit and Viridi are climbing a super long tower and Pit is complaining about how long they've been climbing and says "I'm pretty sure there was a loading screen back there!".
                            The best 4th wall break that isn't Hades' speech at the end is Viridi going "THIS game universe and THAT game universe have NOTHING to do with each other!" When Pit mentions how Komaytos look like little metroids.

Man, I should really play that game again.
                                Now that Ultimate is finally done, I really hope that Sakurai's next big project is a new Kid Icarus game.

A huge successful Switch game could really get this franchise going.
                        How could you leave out:

"Plus, chicken is much more economical!"

"What elegance! What Grace! What disturbing brutality!"

"I am now a Level Infinity Epic Super God Plus!"

"Big Monsters kill Pit, grrr!"

"Every dweeb has his day"

"I don't want to steam the sacred buns."

"When freaky aliens give you lemons, make freaky alien lemonade!"

And the classic, the iconic:

"Floor ice cream gives you health!"
                            Ahhhh, the sandwich tactic! How delectable!

That is up there with ness‚Äôs okay, everything flacon says, and Terry‚Äôs ‚Äúare you okay‚Äù with the best sounds in the game
Shit legit made me lol first time I heard it ü§£
I didn‚Äôt know this was real til I heard it in game. Saw it online and thought it was fake üòÇ
This is the best one hands down
You are objectively wrong about Falcon. The answer is ‚ÄúSHOW ME YOUR MOVES‚Äù.
    "YES!"
        "COME ON!!"
        ‚ÄúIs that the crowd cheering in his head?‚Äù
        YHES
    FALKON PAWWWNCH!!!
My favorite dark pit line is "Where's your Goddess Now?!'
As a child my brother, sister, and I laughed at Cpt. Falcon's star KO scream every time because it reminded us of that one scene in ATLA when the Boulder made an unintentional full split while fighting Toph and just screamed, "Uuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!"
    Atla?
        Avatar the last airbender
    Now I can't unhear that lol
Dark Pits is hilarious because he randomly sounds Australian when he says that lmao
Sometimes, you just gotta send a fool off at a million miles an hour with a magical suit of armor and just laugh and wave at them.
His Melee death scream or current one?
def my favorite dark pit line but I cheated and just chose pit‚Äôs star KO
That's a good one
Hands off my- COCK!
Up b in the middle?
    It's one of his taunts, where he just charges pure winner energy and yells while posing w/ fire
How do you even pick a favorite voice line for Terry? 

Any time I play or watch(*mostly Riddles, since he‚Äôs the Terry god*) I catch my self repeating a lot of his lines. They‚Äôre just SO catchy and fun to say! I love Terry

As for Wario, I agree, but I do love his victory screen endless laugh while rolling on his back
    I feel the same about Terry's lines. His broken english is so good.

Thought this was Kaz at first. I‚Äôm more of a Tekken player than a Smash player, and I forget DORIYA is iconic in both communities.
    Theres a reason Ganon was the first person to get dropped when Kaz was revealed. He took it personally.
        I remember making this same joke the day the trailer dropped haha
    It‚Äôs both. Kazuya has the DORIYA as well

Bro, how‚Äôd you get a Japanese keyboard? I needed that for Sephiroth
    I took the Japanese from Smash Wiki.
        I d on my speak a single word of Japanese but Cloud has one voice line that sounds like ‚ÄúA lot of Corona‚Äù and I found that pretty funny during the pandemic
            Or he's an alcoholic
            ÊÇ™„ÅèÊÄù„ÅÜ„Å™ 


(?) This might be it
    Just go into your keyboard settings. It's the Japanese IME.
As a fellow Cloud player, same for me I think.
If we count all cloud-noises then my favourite is the sound Finishing touch makes
*Genkai wo koeru*
For the longest time I thought Cloud was missing a KO line because I could never hear it over the sound of everything.
Personally, my favourite of Cloud's has to be ËààÂë≥„Å™„ÅÑ„Å≠ (Not interested)
I still think Mewtwo deserved voicelines for his gameplay.
was trying to find this, thx

        Which one is that
            Both side B and f smash can have the "Areadbhar!" (why is it spelt like this) voice line
                >why is it spelt like this

languages
    Lol my kid always tell me it sounds like "Air Stuff" and we both bust laughing out loud
    Lmao I always heard ‚ÄúBEAR CLAW!‚Äù
Yea Sora's "Here we go" kinda makes the natch a little more exciting
    Whenever I play Sora offline or in a battle arena I always do the "Here we go!" when my opponent is on their last stock.
I can never hear jokers ravage them I know it should be so but I can‚Äôt seem to hear that
For Sora, I love 'Time!' Because if you use it right at the end of a match it's like Sora was speedrunning victory
K. Rool sounds like he speaks some language nobody but the Kongs understand and I love it
And thus was told, the epic spam battle between Ness and Kirby...it was unrelenting, unyielding, and cheese.

Rex supports his gf no matter what
    Rip Nia
        Don‚Äôt be like that. He does love her, remember? He loves her‚Ä¶and aLl yOu gUyS!!!
fair and Up air sound is soooo Good to hit but Up taunt is epic as well (all claw efect moves feel Good)
    Oh absolutely. I love all his claw moves, they‚Äôre so crisp and satisfying.
Which one, the badass one or the puberty one?
In this game it‚Äôs more ‚ÄúArOuGhHh‚Äù for his taunt and I find that funny
For Ridley my favorite is the one where he screeches and flaps his wings. As Metroid fan imo it‚Äôs just perfect for who he is

*Inb4 that‚Äôs up-taunt lol. Sorry don‚Äôt know them by direction*
I prefer "boop" tbh
    I like ‚Äúblip‚Äù
        You *monster*
Either down taunt or down B for me
Snakes eating sounds are better to me

Like you hear the voices out of context and you suddenly hear this extremely deep voice then you turn around and it's this round ball with comically large pointy shoes.
Maybe I‚Äôm basic but I love ‚ÄúARSENE!‚Äù
    Yes
Lookin cool joker for the memes
The ardainian soldiers say it better.

"ThiNk You cAn tAke mE!!!"
    The only mistake Sakurai made was not having Pyra say "Don't forget me"
        Instead they gave her the most heartbreaking death voice line in "I'm sorry!"

They endured almost 4 games before deciding he needed to speak English too

        Whenever my brother hears Burn Knuckle he thinks Terry says "RUM AND COKE!"
I really wish they had included ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something to believe in‚Äù for Byleth
Sephiroth: "[Victory screen line]"
Kept You Waiting Huh?
Marth: "I can not afford new shoes"
***"bold of you to assume i fear death"***

I love Corrin's win quote. "Good."
Such a crime Isabelle doesn't have her animalese voice.
Same
Even reading the ‚Äútake this!‚Äù voice line annoys me lol
    Take this! Back off! Take this! Fire! Thunder! Take this!
Forgot THAT

Adding it
that voice line is the sole reason i mained peach in sm4sh. i used to hate all things girly but i gained a new appreciation for her
    Who knows maybe I'll turn to the dark side and use peach in the future, but that line is still gonna make my blood boil, even if I decide to pick her up as a pocket.




Peach in literally every other game:üòÑ

        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
But imagine 

Peach 0-to-deaths you with a turnip combo, destroying your will to both live and to win the match 

And then she BLOWS YOU A KISS
    But-
Daisy's loud and obnoxious, but she isn't nearly as toxic and condescending as Peach.
I kind of want her extra chonky Samus Returns armor in the next game, but I also want each alt to go beyond the simple color reference and change her armor model so we can get the full, proper Fusion, Dread, Dark, and Light suits.
    Imagine how sick it would be if Samus wore the >!Metroid Suit!< as an alt or transformed into it during her Final Smash.
        Finally, the green alt can actually be a reference.
Technically ultimate *is* smash 6, as Wii U and 3ds are considered separate entries
    I mean, to be fair they didn't put ice climbers in the WiiU version due to not being able to implement Ice Climbers on 3ds
Co-maiming. Hehe
    Poor Roy
        I hate auto correct. That is all
        This is smash, he's used to it.
I used to use roy a bunch. I never really thought he had a definite combo game just kinda swinging around.
It makes me remember he‚Äôs just some teenager and it hurts hearing it personally. I can see why people find it funny though
Now THAT'S dedication!
No. He goes: "I never learned how to read!" Which is a reference to when he says that in the most recent Kid Icarus game as he's falling to what he thinks is his death.
I miss her a lot, I'll be back

                I saw a video a while back of them recording it live, Penny stopped EVERYTHING and made everyone stop their recording and save to make sure no one's audio was lost lol. She knew they struck gold. If I remember right Alfred just kinda went "I don't know what came over me there"
                I‚Äôm still waiting for the next sonic video
                    Penny [announced](https://youtu.be/Rsx63Vu2b2M) they're doing Shadow the Hedgehog next!

SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG IS A BITCH-ASS MOTHERFUCKER! HE PISSED ON MY FUCKING WIFE
    *Eggman proceeds to piss on the moon*
        **YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS** ***DRRRROPLLLLETS*** **HIT THE FUCKING EARTH, NOW GET OUT OF MY FUCKING SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO** (I still can't believe Alfred came up with all of that and more all on the spot. What a legend.)
            I saw a video a while back of them recording it live, Penny stopped EVERYTHING and made everyone stop their recording and save to make sure no one's audio was lost lol. She knew they struck gold. If I remember right Alfred just kinda went "I don't know what came over me there"
            I‚Äôm still waiting for the next sonic video
                Penny [announced](https://youtu.be/Rsx63Vu2b2M) they're doing Shadow the Hedgehog next!

I'm sorry for my ignorance then
    Oh, I wasn't mocking you or anything, just thought more people needed to know.
        I know, I'm just apologising for not knowing that
            Kid Icarus Uprising is a treasure trove of iconic quotes, from the top of my head, I can remember:  


"It's like watching a chicken wearing roller skates"

"So you'd better not be thinking about anything... naughty"

"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

"G-FORCE IN MY FAAAAAACE"

"Who is this 'Icarus' character this game is named after? Can I meet him?"

"I think they used it in that one series, 'Super Bash Sisters'."

"Darn you, balanced game play!"

"Awww, Pit! We really need to get you some friends."
                >"Then it hit me. How am I supposed to drive without hands?"

Love that one. Especially how Pit/Palutena respond with "Well how did you build a racetrack without hands?" and Pandora just responds with "Hard work and determination".

Also gotta love the 4th wall breaks. A personal fav of mine is when Pit and Viridi are climbing a super long tower and Pit is complaining about how long they've been climbing and says "I'm pretty sure there was a loading screen back there!".
                    The best 4th wall break that isn't Hades' speech at the end is Viridi going "THIS game universe and THAT game universe have NOTHING to do with each other!" When Pit mentions how Komaytos look like little metroids.

Man, I should really play that game again.
                        Now that Ultimate is finally done, I really hope that Sakurai's next big project is a new Kid Icarus game.

A huge successful Switch game could really get this franchise going.
                How could you leave out:

"Plus, chicken is much more economical!"

"What elegance! What Grace! What disturbing brutality!"

"I am now a Level Infinity Epic Super God Plus!"

"Big Monsters kill Pit, grrr!"

"Every dweeb has his day"

"I don't want to steam the sacred buns."

"When freaky aliens give you lemons, make freaky alien lemonade!"

And the classic, the iconic:

"Floor ice cream gives you health!"
                    Ahhhh, the sandwich tactic! How delectable!

_SHUT UP, HADES_
                    Thank you very much, how could I forget these
                "This game universe and that game universe have NOTHING to do with each other!"
"COME ON!!"

I remember making this same joke the day the trailer dropped haha
I d on my speak a single word of Japanese but Cloud has one voice line that sounds like ‚ÄúA lot of Corona‚Äù and I found that pretty funny during the pandemic
    Or he's an alcoholic
    ÊÇ™„ÅèÊÄù„ÅÜ„Å™ 


(?) This might be it
Which one is that
    Both side B and f smash can have the "Areadbhar!" (why is it spelt like this) voice line
        >why is it spelt like this

Don‚Äôt be like that. He does love her, remember? He loves her‚Ä¶and aLl yOu gUyS!!!
You *monster*
Instead they gave her the most heartbreaking death voice line in "I'm sorry!"
Whenever my brother hears Burn Knuckle he thinks Terry says "RUM AND COKE!"
That is Toad
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Finally, the green alt can actually be a reference.
I hate auto correct. That is all
This is smash, he's used to it.
