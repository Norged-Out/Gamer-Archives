[[What does Heaven or Hell mean]]


I always wondered why we see this in a match. I know that the lore involves crazy shit like the backyard and other things but why heaven or hell?


To sound cool.
    It does sound epic
Gamma Ray (German Power Metal Band) has a song call Heaven or Hell. The founder of the band/guitarist/frontman is Kai Hansen, the man that Daisuke took first name for Ky Kiske.
    These are the real answers. GG is littered with metal/rock references
    Also, he took the second part of the name from Michael Kiske (Helloween). Kai Hansen also sang in Helloween.
    Wow that is awsome
someone told Daisuke about christianity in 1994 and he was like "SICK"
You want the honest truth? 

It’s the same reason why the main character is named Sol Badguy/Frederick Balsara, why Ky Kiske is named Ky Kiske, and why Ky’s super is named “Ride the Lightning” (A Metallica song)among TONS of other things. 

It’s metal as fuck. 

People joke about the fact that the Guilty Gear games are just rock albums that Daisuke (the main dude behind the franchise) makes and they just have to slap a fighting game on it to get you to pay 60 bucks for it. LOL 
Since Xrd, the joke is now that the series is just Daisuke sat around one day and decided he wanted to:
A: Make a badass metal as fuck fighting game
B: Make a badass metal as fuck album.
C: Make a badass metal as fuck anime. 
If you don’t know, Strive’s story mode is a legitimate 4 and a half hours of straight movie. No gameplay at all. It’s literally a 4 and a half hour long anime movie.
“Heaven or Hell”, “Live or Let Die”, “The Wheel of Fate is Turning”...it’s fighting game intros dude! 

You really wanna hear something boring like “The match is about start. Ready...go!”
    Isn’t ready go blaze blues round 2 intro
        No. It's Rebel 2. Action.

What a rebel is in this context idfk
            I suspect rebel is Engrish for level. B/V and L/R are both points of difficulty for native Japanese speakers.
                Would make sense but even on screen it says rebel.
Go watch Hurtboxtv's video on the musical references of Guilty Gear, he comes up with a few theories of what "Heaven or Hell" could be a reference to.
I never thought too hard about it.
In my brain I kinda just figured it meant that figuratively that’s where this match will take you.  
Heaven(Win) or Hell(lose).

It doesn’t seem to be related to any of the prior things said about mankind, society & the beasts.
