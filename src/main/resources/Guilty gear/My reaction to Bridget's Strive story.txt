[[My reaction to Bridget's Strive story]]





I mean I'm all for this revelation, but it also warms my heart seeing the 600lbs of steak and testosterone that is Goldlewis being like 'Right, girl, got it'.
    Who knew that being based was one of his behemoth typhoons?
        In this behemoth typhoon, we crack an egg
            in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis supports the trans community
                In this behemoth typhoon, trans rights are human rights
                    I should hope that's true for every behemoth typhoon!
                        Every Typhoon has a different purpose, he breaks that one out when he needs to. Just in case some chuds forget
        In this behemoth typhoons, Goldlewis supports LGBTQ+ rights and exports them in other countries
    In this Behemoth Typhoon...

Goldlewis hits you with acceptance and solid life advice.
    🤔 should someone edit Kor to be Goldlewis?
        So funny story, I had an earlier draft that had Goldlewis's face over Kor's, but it didn't really look right to me, cause the faces of Goldlewis I had were a bit too serious looking and it didn't really capture the feeling I was wanting.  
Ultimately went with "This was how \*I\* felt went with how Bridget's story went". I think it worked out
            Having seen this in other spaces, it's perhaps the best way for it to work out as a meme. Kor's joy is there and that's all we need.
    In this Behemoth Typhoon, Goldlewis earns the title of Best Dad. It isn't much in a post-apocalyptic shit hole world, but it's something
    I mean, Goldlewis probably doesn't care what you are as long as you aren't a cryptid.
        I thought the end goal of all LGBTQ+ people was to become a cryptid. It's mine, at least.
bridget has been promoted to femgirl now
    I can't be the only femboy who thinks being a femgirl sounds nice right? aha. Still cis though
        Mhm yeah very cis
        🥚
            ⛽💡
        If you want to be a girl, just be a girl.  <3
Bridget, boy or girl, I missed you. Call yourself what you like I'm going to play as you all the same. I'm just glad you're back.
Hello? Based department?
It's for you.
SHE IS SO PRETTT I REALLY CAN'T 😭😭
#Inhumanly based.

    I used to think I was gay for bridget, but now I'm gay for bridget.
        based
        Character development... Ah, and for Bridget as well ~u~
        Samesies.
        same
    Thank you. Like who cares if bridget is femboy or transgender girl. Bridget is cute anime char and that all that matters.
    Where there’s a hole, there’s a goal.
        Insert the 1000000th FBI joke here because Bridget totally isn't over the age of consent
            I thought she was 16 or so by the time of AC+, with Strive taking place six years later. Did I miss something?
        I choked on my coffee reading this
            You could be choking on something else~ /jk
                No jk just do it
    *slash*
        Anal fissures aren't funny son. They can make a ~~man~~  girl suicidal from pain and it might last 6 months or longer.
Bridget is now a girl? Someone explain me pls :c
    Basically due to the curse of having twins of the same sex being a bad omen or something Bridget was forced to dress up as a girl, however it's made clear in the pass games she was never forced to identify as a girl and she still clearly knew she was born male, just had to dress feminine 

She then set off to be a bounty hunter to become more masculine and prove the cruse was wrong and this whole time she still dressed feminine even though she wasn't being forced to, but she still chose to as she liked it

And now in strive she speaks to the other characters and does self reflection on who she really is and says outloud "cowgirl is fine, because I'm a girl!" As she discovered though her self reflection journey that she is a trans girl
        I didn't expect Guilty Gear to be a long-burn trans ally, but here we are. Good on her for figuring out who she was.
            Guilty Gear was always very subversive
                i thought that said submissive
            This does put us in the amusing position where using a pronoun for her is kind of a spoiler.
                Here's a handy tool to use for that ( ´・ω・\`)つ\[they/them\]
                    But I want to affirm the nice lady! :(
                        You, yeah you. That comment made me nearly tear up. What an awesome person you are. Hell yeah, supportive affirmation!  🤘🏿
            Right? Guilty Gear has two trans characters now, which is two more than what I'm used to in like, anything. I'm trans and starved for good trans characters, and while representation isn't the only deciding factor on if I find something enjoyable it's just nice that a character gets to have a similar moment of self discovery with their gender and not have it be treated like it's weird. The fact that she's in a fighting game that's sick as hell and uses yo-yos is icing on the cake.
                I'm a cishet white dude, and I'm psyched on the trans representation for this reason. I can't imagine going through life where you are either invisible in every piece of media or portrayed as a monster like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. I want my trans comrades to feel safer and more accepted. So whenever I see anyone doing a transphobia, I aggressively bully them. I've got your back friend.
                    Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
                    Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
                Uhh who is the second one?
                    Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
                        nonbinary =/= trans
                            It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
                            Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
                                Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                                    I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                                    Then you haven't been around trans people.
                            it literally does, dude
                            Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
                        Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
                            honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
                            No??????
            Theres a picture of bridget the creator drew in like 2019 that says "trans rights!" At the top. Guilty gear has always been for the gays 😩
                do you have a link, I would like to see that
                    https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkpartyqq/status/1556508738780946432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1556508738780946432%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b27cfc2adccee88694a34fd3efd680bf5d51e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamerbraves.com%2Fguilty-gear-strive-confirms-that-bridget-is-indeed-trans%2F

I may be mixing up events since the picture is actually from this year, but he did say trans rights in 2019, probably in an interview
                        They did say they got the drawing a few years ago
                            Oh shit then maybe I'm double lying lmfao
            I love character development
                Right? And this isn't some random shit, this is character development that completely makes sense considering the character's history.
            Why do they have to be an ally? Just because they make a character gay, trans, bi, asexual, etc.. doesn't mean they have to be your ally, it's just how these characters have been written, they don't have to belong to a community of their same gender identity just because you want them to do so.
        Ohhhhh thanks You:)
        > whole time she still dressed feminine even though she wasn't being forced to, but she still chose to as she liked it

slight correction, Bridget did it out of respect and love for her parents (who were still in the village), not because "she liked it".
            Then why did she still wear feminine clothes after leaving?

No one in the village would see her
                Because word would travel????

The whole point is Bridget leaving the village to gain a reputation as a successful bounty hunter and proving the superstition of the village false. Until Bridget achieves that goal they can't change their appearance. Their parents are still in the village and they are doing it out of love/protecting them.
                    She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.
                         (◔_◔)
            We all excuse it. I just grew my nails out because I liked to tap them on stuff. I painted them because keratin is a gross yellow. "I only grew my hair out because I couldn't get it cut." "I'm not trans, I'm just not like the others." Eventually they believe it could be a possibility, and it's so insanely possible, so grossly consistent that it can't be impossible. Not everyone is an egg, but there's an excuse for every euphoric choice.
                Makes me think of how I'm always painting my nails because I want to see my favourite colour more often.

    Edit: The strive arcade playthrough for Bridget where you lose a heart in stage 7, during stage 8.

In the strive arcade playtgrough for Bridget, Bridget explains to GoldLewis around the start that she’s a guy like she always has, but then later in arcade Goldlewis asks if Bridget is hiding something for someone else’s sake. Bridget goes “…! How do you know?” And goldlewis goes on about how he’s been hiding away a part of himself too and that it’s resulted in someone he loves (family or lover, he doesn’t clarify) living in separate homes. People believe Goldlewis is either taking about his feelings for his work (it’s already explained in his song that he extremely despised his job but does it as a necessary evil), or that he’s queer in some way but hasn’t come out about it.

Then Ky gets involved in a fight too and then they talk some more. Bridget mentions that she’s afraid about coming out about whatever she’s hiding but also feels awful hiding it still. They convince her to take a risk and come out and the arcade and decides to do that. In reply to something Goldlewis says Bridget says “because I’m a girl” at the very end.

I wish this sort of character arc could have happened in an Another Story because arcade story in strive sucks. But, this story does get the impression off that Bridget likes being a girl and feels wrong as a guy but for whatever reason very strongly asserted he/she was a guy for a long time. Probably a mixture of anger due their town’s superstition and uncertainty about being different from everyone else. That would be more than enough to make real people fight against how they feel about their gender, there’s stories of transgender people who went extra lengths to deny they felt anything different before realizing the feelings aren’t going away.
        Part of her journey to become a successful bounty hunter was to prove that she wasn't a curse because of how she was born and destroy the superstition, which she succeeded in. Identifying as male and expressing wanting to be more masculine despite never acting on it is more-or-less her flipping the bird at said superstition, which felt like an obligation to keep doing after she succeeded in destroying the superstition and saying it for so long. Or at least that's my take.
        The end portion is only in one arcade ending though remember strive arcade has multiple endings. Just throwing it out because it seems not many people know that endings change depending on how well you play. The other endings don't mention Bridget wanting to be called a girl so the canon on this is kinda loose until a sequel or story update confirms it.
            Yeah I wasn't aware of the arcade other endings until just recently.

The interpretation I got was that, at least, Bridget wants to explore their gender. Specifically these lines from the fawless run stage 8 and 9ending:

Bridget: Wow, what limitless power you have!

Ky: You flatter me, but I owe my power to the strength of Gears.

Bridget: Were you afraid about coming out about Gears?

Ky: No, I wasn't afraid, I didn't want to lie to myself or my family, that's all.

Bridget: I wish I could be like you.

(another battle with Dragon Install ky)

Ky: Have I convinced you yet? No matter what others think, I will not change. Not even if this body turns to gear.

Bridget: No matter what others think, huh? I admit that still scares me a little, But I want to live as my true self, at least that's how I feel after having watched you.

Then Ky invites Bridget to see his family (specifically Dizzy since they're friends) and Bridget says thanks.

GGST World lore in-game calls Bridget a she, her Starter Guide never mentions he/her pronouns (despite I-no, Sol, Goldlewis, Jack-O, Happy Chaos and Baiken all having he/her used. Testament's doesn't use any he/her and I didn't check other starter guides)... it seems a bit obvious either A: The english localization is mistaken/intentionally divergent or B: This is the intended interpretation. One of those two things.
            ~~It's been pretty firmly supported in their official Youtube in the stickied comment: https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8 They don't appear to be interested in the "Oh, she only comes out as trans in this one route" approach.~~

EDIT: I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.
            She mentions coming out to her village in the Flawless ending
    They made Bridget into a girl. That basically sums it up. The writers viewed Bridget's identity as a GNC male as groundwork for them to transition for some reason, so that's the direction they took it.

Maybe they were afraid that a GNC guy was too risqué or a poor representation or something.. we'll never know. Arc doesn't respond.
I don't care about Bridget's sexuality but it feels good to pot buster that tiny ass.
    Gender is meaningless next to the awe and glory of HEAVENLY! POTEMKIN! BUSTAAAAAAAA!
        Potemkin is an equal opportunity BUSTAH
        All genders get Pot Busted the same
        POTEKIMIN BUSTAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
        everyone is talking about how cool it is that guilty gear is supportive of the nonbinary and trans community and then the testosterone train rolls up and just hpb's its way to having 200 upvotes per comment
            This is simply the only way Pot mains know how to communicate, the only way in which we can express our love and welcoming to all peoples of every religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or other specifying feature is to gently take them up in our hands, fly them with love and grace into the heavens, *then shatter their bones to dust*.
    Who said anything about sexuality
        They're a little confused but they've got the spirit
        OK. I'll take note:   
Sexuality =! Gender identity   
I'm not an American nor an English native so these debates are quite confusing
            based learning and acceptance pilled.
            [deleted]
                not to be pedantic, but “sexuality refers to whom one experienced sexual attraction” and “i am sexually attracted neither to men nor to women”

grammar is epic 👍🏼
                    If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
                    Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.
                        for the sake of efficiently hammering this concept home, [here is a link to a study guide on keeping your conjunctions in a consistent syntax](https://study.com/academy/lesson/neither-nor-meaning-rule-examples.html).
                        you clearly skipped primary school english my friend
            based learning
        Bridget is sexy
    It's gender identity more so than sexuality, but tbh I don't really care either, they seem like a cool character and that's all that really matters to me personally
    As a Pot main I concur. I sniff too much glue to discriminate with who I HPB. Potemkin’s hands are Rated E for Everyone.
    no one mentioned sexuality dude
    Garuda Impact her prostate plz
    Also to hit a full churn DWTS on her and just obliterate her
Hey, what was the original context?
    Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. 

One character, Dax, is a worm-like symbiotic organism that bonds with a host species. But the worms lifespan is way longer than it's hosts, so it's had a whole bunch of different ones over several centuries. It keeps their memories and aspects of their personality and gives them to it's new hosts when the previous dies. 

The old Klingon in the picture was good friends with the male Curzon-Dax when he was younger, and 81 years later is reunited with Dax's new host Jadzia. He keeps identifying her as Curzon until she gently explains she's different now, and he quickly picks up her new identity.
        Huh, genderfluid(?) Worm symbiote. That seems cool.
            Star Trek has been incredibly based since the beginning.

Literally William Shatner and Nichel Nichols had the first interracial kiss on television.  When there were threats to pull the kiss from the episode Shatner (and other cast members) said they'd quit if it wasn't kept in.

Also Star Trek has been doing LGBT things forever.  TNG had an episode about a whole race of non-binary people (although it was a weird Riker-trys-to-bang-something episode.  The worm symbiote/trill thing was literally just a trans episode in 1993.  Polyamorous.  Very obvious gay/lesbian couples.

Like Star Trek gave no fucks
                “He was more than a hero, he was a union man”-Miles O’Brien
Very accurate
What? A wholsome meme?
I just hope it was her independent decision entirely is all.  
Though, I am tempted to use yo/yo pronouns just to say "yo Bridget".
    I think years of being independent from their village to think for themself is independent enough
        "I want to be a boy damn it! All my life I've wanted it!"

"Alright you can be a boy now."

*a few years and talking it out with friends later*

"...Wait. Guys, I might have realized something."

So now Bridget's lore is an ironic story where being raised as a girl *was* correct for her, turns out, but it was for the wrong reasons since she'd have been killed otherwise because Insert Anime Pulp. So she thought that being a girl was completely wrong until she was an adult and could take stock of things for herself.

Still no clue why they retconned her to have billionaire parents.
            You aren't a fighting game without a sprinkling of retcons.
                Yeah but like. They could just leave if the place they live in insists they have to *murder* one of their babies if they both are male. They probably own five other homes where the villagers don't say to do that.

If they were poor villagers the story works fine, especially since Bridget proves herself to the village by making a lot of money to send back home, but making them billionaires is just ???????
                    We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
            My point exactly.  
Had Bridget embraced being a femboy or perhaps made a metamorphosis to a tomboy or even a super metrosexual jojo character, noone would bat an eye. Trans just feels like a weird retcon.   
Not that I really care in the end, I find yo Bridget totes adorbs.
                trans girls fighting to be seen as men and wanting desperately to fit in as men and then completely turning a 180 when they realise they're trans is like THE trans girl timeline.
                You seem to be misunderstanding me. Bridget's trans story works, she decides to live as a girl after thinking on it away from home after living as a boy became available to her. She thought that's what she wanted and when it didn't make her happy, she thought about it outside of the context of her village where her gender has always been a loaded question. Decides to openly and willfully live as a girl and see how it goes, badabing trans rights.

The weird retcon is her parents being billionaires which doesn't feel like it makes sense with the "social pressure to kill your baby in a village" and "Bridget sends money back home which gains respect for her" aspect of her backstory.
                    I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
                    I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
            because the writing is really fucking dumb
    I played the arcade mode like 6 times for all the dialogue. It was very much Bridget's decision, and it came after a lot of fear and indecision. As someone whos struggled with the same thing, it was authentic.
        I just wish there was any indication to this in the past games so it feels more like a natural progression than a retcon.
            Tbh, i was extremely worried about how they might handle the character in this game. There wasnt a ton of lore on bridgets backstory, but it felt a lot like an uncomfortable trope from 20 years ago. I think they could have gone several directions, but proud femboy or trans girl are the only two that would go over well. "Being true to yourself" is a very common theme in guilty gear, its not like its out of left field or anything. Also i wouldnt say its a retcon: bridget grew to accept herself. Denial/repression is a bitch. If bridget was fighting to be more manly to live up to expectations in the previous game, coming to terms with her identity as trans is a completely natural progression of that in my experience. Its letting go of those expectations to move forward for yourself, realizing what you actually want. And thats exactly the story they told. Its fair if it feels forced to you, but it feels very organic to me.
                I suppose I can see why they found the retcon necessary; there's little ways the original backstory could have gone and made it look like she's her own free person, so might as well scrap that part and go for a purer identity.  
Still, F for the femboys.
                    Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
                        I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
                            Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
            Fighting to be seen as a manly man before your transition is one of the most naturally trans things possible. The story beat resonates so strongly with so many of us *because* that's our lived experience. No "indication" would ever be good enough for people complaining it's a retcon with no justification, short of Bridget's "I'm a boy!" intros in XX being followed by her mugging the camera and saying "but in 6 years, I'll be a girl!"

There is an ocean of difference between "retcon" and "character development."
            How you gonna have a natural progression with a six year time skip
    >I just hope it was her independent decision

I keep seeing people say stuff like this, which is super weird because that's literally the entire point of her Arcade Mode story arc.
    I think the whole "she was groomed to be that way" is a really bad faith argument anyway. Conversion therapy exists and doesn't work, being proof that you can't be changed to be a different sexuality or gender identity. It's all a part of you from birth, and you just kinda have to roll with the punches and figure it out yourself
        Right, but this is a fictional character, written however the creators choose regardless of if it's realistic or not.
    Bro tf u mean the writers can just write "she decided it" or " it wasn't her own decision" 🥱 don't forget it's not a real person
        Yes but lore that superficial makes characters boring for some of us. The same reason a character's clothing or voice acting can be interesting. Otherwise you're just making a bunch of ones and zeros jump around. Despite them not being a real person, if I was playing a faceless gray wire frame body, the game wouldn't be nearly as interesting to me
            I masturbate to porn. How that even works is beyond me.
    ~~So according to the GG official youtube [(see the stickied comment)](https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8), she wasn't raised as a girl. Her parents and the village just made her wear girl's clothes. In all other aspects, she was treated as a boy.~~

I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.
this is incredibly thoughtful and overwhelmingly nice. thank you.
Bridget is now waifu
Must protect at all cost
“BUT BRIDGET USED TO BE A BOY” she’s a girl now “BUT NOT SAME” yes in fact that is how transition works well done
    Thank you, this comment made me laugh a lot after seeing some of the other shit in the comments section here. I should probably stop scrolling through. Any other trans people or allies scrolling through: oi, stop that, digital self-harm isn't helping you.
    was in r/Kappa and saw a fucking political ass comic with Goldlewis brainwashing Bridget into being trans with a random ass dude with a T-Shirt saying "Bridget Respecters" (or some fuckshit like that) looking desolate as all hell.

only visited the subreddit once because of this situation and yeah, it is as bad as they say it is
        Kappa really turned to shit after they banned porn, but I think this kind of thing was always bubbling under the surface there sadly. Frustrates me that I used to spend time there until I saw that rot creeping in.
            they were all in harmony until the annoying virgins attacked
I’m confused. 

Wasn’t Bridget whole story about leaving home to become a man? If she admits that she’s a girl what would that imply about his curse and the destiny he was given? 

All in all I’m interested to see this story whatever the answer
    It doesn't imply anything about the curse. Mainly because if the curse was correct then Bridget would have been either killed as a child or an abandoned orphan. 

Bridget proved that the curse was bullshit and that she could live as a man if she wished. But years after that she discovered that she was actually uncomfortable with being a boy and decided to live her life as a girl.

And that's the important part. She made the decision for herself, without any outside influence beyond encouragement from Goldlewis and Ky to live true to herself and not to be afraid of what other's think of her.
        Yeah, important to remember that nobody's required her to present as a female in any context since the end of XX, which was six years ago.
    The curse is just a reflection of Societal Expectation.

It's as if her parents and the village are saying... 

Oh you're a twin boy? You must disguise yourself in girl clothes to survive. We don't think you're really a girl though. It is our disguise we made for you. 

Oh you want to prove the curse is bullshit? You must adhere to our highest standards of masculinity while being wildly and insanely successful.

Either way she can't really be happy, because she is just dancing along to other people's desires and expectations. The context of the curse puts her in a lose-lose situation in terms of self-actualisation: is she only a girl because she was raised that way to avoid the curse, or is she a boy because that's the only way she managed to break the concept of the curse and thus get the village's respect? 

Only when she is finally free of the burden of others' expectations does she come to terms with how she wants to be. That actually being a girl, rather than just hiding beneath the guise of a girl, really does make her happy and comfortable.
    The curse was never actually real, just superstition. Bridget set out to prove being born male didn’t define anything about her and she did so.

Realising she’s trans is a pretty natural extension of that story, I think. Being raised a girl wasn’t the issue, it’s that her identity was decided for her by circumstance. Breaking free of those circumstances means she can choose whatever makes her legitimately happy.
    Turns out the real man is the friends we made along the way
    My interpretation was, that when Bridget became a teen, they thought "I want to show I'm male to prove this superstition wrong. (Maybe to prevent other male twins in the future from having the same fate)". So they had all this pressure to prove that they were a man. And in the end, they succeeded, and the superstition was proven wrong.

But, in the ~6 years since XX, Bridget's had a lot of time to think, and with the burden of "I have to prove I'm male" gone, they've thought about their gender in a new light, and eventually decided they were more comfortable being a woman.
A character who represented who i was…. Is now gone…
    Oh no I'm sure there's literally no other femboys out there
        At this point there might as well not be with all this ugly retconning and woke changing of lore and history
            "woke changing" yeah just cope dumbass, femboys transition all the time, why don't you go play fate that has literally the single most famous femboy of all the whole complaining about how there's no femboys
    My entire problem with this change. If they explain it well enough, then fine, but it really feels like they just entirely betrayed the character. Their entire backstory was about escaping a forced identity that they didn't want and showing you can be cool by being whatever you want to be, no matter your identity. Up until it's explained, it's just promoting one discriminated community by taking them away from another.
        Exactly! And ontop of that if he does agree to become a girl then hes agreeing to his parents disturbing grooming which is a giant massive can of worms which nobody can justify at all without exposing themselves as absolute creeps
            Yuuuuuuup, it's actually a bad representation for the trans community too if they don't tread carefully and really drive home that it was Bridget and Bridget alone's motivation. Even then, still runs into the idea of grooming type motivations. There's a lot of people who think the same as us on this one, so you've got support bud!
                Definitely a creepy can of worms. Which i pray to god the devs realize how disturbing they have made their lore with this sudden drop
        > Their entire backstory was about escaping a forced identity that they didn't want and showing you can be cool by being whatever you want to be, no matter your identity.

Where are you getting this? Her backstory was about proving the villages superstitions wrong, not about feeling any kind of way about her gender being kept secret.
            The whole reason Bridget became a bounty hunter was to fight powerful foes to prove how manly they are. That's literally in the early games.
    I hear this a lot, but surely, with enough of us nerds here, we can find some positive crossdressing rep in some other fandom? I think everybody here’s already familiar with Felix from ReZero and Astolfo from Fate, but there has to be more.
        While I understand that you’re trying to help them find representation somewhere else, I feel like it’s less about representation as a whole and more about having a specific character they identified with “ripped away” in a sense.

I also want to add that I’m not trying to argue against the character change or anything.
            Absolutely; I’m also trying to test the waters a little since I’m sure that there’s an amount of people who are genuinely hurting a little, and not leading people on.

I’m not gonna deny that this is an imperfect solution to the problem, but it’s a more productive thing to do beyond mourning, and the faster we move on, the sooner we get back to being toxic about game balance and not real world issues.
        Ok but what about inside games?
            I still wouldn’t know much, but Amane from BlazBlue is just across the street.
                Imma be honest, i hate the face they gave amane 🤣
                    Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
                        Lol ya its so not a good look
        this is hilarious because one of those characters is a trans woman and the other is nonbinary
            I already did my homework more or less, right here. If we go strictly by canon, Felix has been claimed by the author as a guy. That said, if you have an actual source that points to Astolfo being non-binary, go for it. Who knows, maybe my five second wiki search isn’t complete.
                felix is said to be a closeted trans girl in a WN side story, idk as much about astolfo but i've heard that it's implied that they are non-binary
                    [some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
                    That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
        You could just keep calling Bridgette a femboy despite all the evidence to the contrary. Since you're doing that for ferris (who is trans fem, look at the source material) and astolfo (who's nonbinary). A much better example is Haku, from Naruto
            I did some digging, and Ferris is. Complicated. Going by author interviews and some other parts of the original works, Ferris isn’t trans fem, but there’s a small group from years ago who would gladly look past that given other parts of the light novels. I am not going to drag myself through headcanons in the name of rep.

Also, I’ve actually seen some NBs take up the mantle of femboy if you can believe it. I’m not going to examine Astolfo too closely to double-check if you’re correct about that, but I’ll gladly take calling Astolfo a femboy in stride.

Edit: Astolfo is *also* canonically just a guy. He’s bisexual for what it’s worth.
    Considering the vast amount of fem men that transition this seems like a fairly normal step in Bridgette's story. It stinks you lost a character that represented you but think of all the people she will now represent.
        Because they clearly couldn't create another character that did that exact thing...



/s
            Femboys transition all the time lol. There's no reason Bridgette can't. It's like getting upset at your favorite character for having characters progression. We aren't even sure if she transitioned or prefers she/her pronouns. Get over it
                I have nothing against character progression.

I have EVERYTHING against sloppily written character progression that leaves the audience (a good amount of them, anyhow) out in the cold, and undoing previously established lore.

I've said it before in another comment, but this is the same issue that I had with Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy: they repurposed the character to serve a slightly different purpose than their original, and expect the audience to take this "change" at face value, despite any previous characterization they may have had that contradicts the current characterization.
                    Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
                        > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
                            My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
                                >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                                    But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.

                            When did I say all? Stop projecting. The character chose to be called a girl. She LABELED herself. You're being a moron.

    I am right here with you. It hurts my heart. 

I was not as cute as b but I was very gender confused for a long time being in a place, I left to prove myself and I came back as a man. 

I related to b more then most
    now now, you can't criticize this you see, we care about representation, but only for some people.
    What was the representation? Bridget, pre strive, was just a guy that had to cross dress due to some cultural issues.  

Are you being forced to do so???    

Edit: I'm getting downvotes but no explanation?
        Uh cross dressing? Femboys?
            Are cross dressers and femboys not doing it voluntarily??
    Finding your only validation from a guilty gear character is pretty sad. You got other problems that need to be solved first bro.
        ur literally projecting something onto them that wasn't even implied. go be weird to your therapist bro lol
            Ok ya even imma say wtf about them 🤣
    mate, Jojo

        For Bridget? Yeah. For everybody who’s crossdressing? Not always.
            Real shit.  Androgyny is hot, dependency on titles is a whole separate deal and this mandatory labeling of all femboys/tomboys as the opposite gender is ironic AF.
                And even ignoring that, I’d say it’s at least fun on some level. I’m never going on OnlyFans. I’m never going out in public like that. Unless I get incredibly lucky, crossdressing to me is going to scratch the itch between cosplay and character creators and nothing else, and that’s okay.
                No, no it isnt. Im a femboy, a male only. Ill never be trans. And all this has done is insult an entire community in the lgbt
                    I think we're agreeing?
                    I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
                        It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
            My bad, sorry

YES LMFAO

That is me in the morning of yesterday lol
Tbh this is the only acceptable reaction to it. There's been WAY too many assholes coming out of the woodwork from the (frankly amazing) direction they took Bridget's character.
I think that Strive isn't canon. Just some people write fanfiction
Our King of Femboys may have stepped down. But we still have Best Girl!!
There’s a reason it’s in the bad ending. He was pressured by a bad superstition practice to dress like a girl and act feminine and at the end of his story he falls in line with what other people wanted for her
    yeah but if it was fine being a boy why she is still acting like a girl?
maybe she actually feels like a girl???
        The concept is it wasn’t fine being a boy she was forced to dress as a girl. ARE YOU IMPLYING ACTING LIKE A GIRL MEANS YOU ARE A GIRL THATS SO BINARY
            are you ok?
            She said she's a girl so she's a girl :)

While the character development feels forced, if she's down to bottom now then I'm cool with it
    The only reason you think it's forced is because you don't like it. The characters ENTIRE story is about figuring out who her true self is and carving an identity that isn't sculpted by other people
        You almost had it there, just flip it around; they don’t like it _because_ it’s forced. And there’s a lot more nuance to this topic I feel neither side, both intense supporters and radical transphobes, are willing to discuss.
            It's not forced at all though, did you not read my comment?
                I did, and it’s not untrue. Bridget’s story in their debut was finding the meaning of ‘manliness’ and that it wasn’t what society’s expectations of manliness was, it was something you decided for yourself. That you are not a girl (at the time they were a feminine male) for being feminine in clothing and demeanour, you are just as much of a man as any other guy is. 

Now some feel that Bridget’s total transition into identifying as female treads backwards on their whole gender-non-conforming-male arc by going ‘yes actually they were female the whole time, the village was right about the superstition after all’. 

If Guilty Gear wanted trans representation, which is still great mind you, just _make a whole new character._ It’d be even better if they were developed early so their transition could be properly depicted in story mode cutscene glory or something. 

Point is, trans rep is great, sure. But there is no need to seemingly overwrite already existing GNC representation (feminine men, who related to pre-change Bridget), just to have another (trans women). We can have _both._ 

This especially irks me since as you would know, there’s an ongoing issue with trans women being purposefully mislabeled as just ‘femboys’, and it’s true the other way around too. And I’ve seen some people who also have in issue with this writing be written off as transphobes when having valid critique. But anyway, to not go too far off on a tangent, that’s how I feel about the whole thing.
        It's your prerogative to be happy with what appears to be blatant pandering. I expect more.
            I really love that people think the character who has had a conflicting gender identity her whole existence being trans is like the most illogical curveball that makes no sense. The arc makes perfect sense, it's not forced, it's not pandering, cope
                There was no conflicting gender identity. Bridget was a male. Bridget identified as a male. Due to circumstances, Bridget dressed as a female, and one does not have to be trans to crossdress. There was no indication at all, through 20 years, that Bridget questioned her gender identity. Spontaneously deciding she is trans now is either bad writing or pandering. I don't really care which; either way my initial point stands.
This really wholesome.
Bi/pan gang stays winning either way 😎
    "winning"
HETEROSEXUALITY = P R O T E C T E D…. I think… I don’t know how genders work outside of M&F but LETS GOOOOOO
    She's a trans girl

Therefore if you are a guy then it's straight to like her
        Debatable, not completely at the very least
Wow, no femboys representation anymore.....someone who they looked up to with Bridget's story and ideals back then are just gone. Breaking gender norms and shit? And it's all fucking gone.
    ah yeah the so known femboy erasure we everyday hear about
    That's my conflict here personally. Just exchanging one form of representation for another, but this is a pretty unexpected change for this character too. You don't see a lot of femboy characters, and I feel that this just plays into the stereotype that men expressing femininity or feeling comfortable playing with gender norms just means they're secretly trans. Ultimately though, Bridget is still Bridget and I'm happy to see her back in Strive.
I think the best way to look at this is that Bridget was quite likely meant to be trans from the very beginning of her inception, but societal understanding and portrayal of transgender people was quite different at the time. It's possible Bridget's backstory and insistence on being male was only a way to make her more palatable to audiences. So they've updated the character to be more true to the original vision.
    They took a gender non conforming man and turned them into a gender conforming woman
Doesn’t this kind of ruin her character though? Her whole thing was that she wanted to prove that she was a man while everyone told her that she was a girl. Isn’t this the opposite of progress and accepting who you are? Idk if this is transphobic and I’m all for the testament changes but I really liked Bridget how she was, it was inspiring, even for someone that isn’t trans.
    She was only called a girl because her parents knew she would be killed if they didn’t do that. She started asserting she was a boy as a way to dispel the myths about the curse, and to become a strong bounty hunter to prove everyone wrong. She did that, she was able to bring back a lot of riches and break the stereotype/curse about twins, and so was now free to just be a guy. But in her arcade story and her character song she’s clearly not happy with the decision she made. Now that her goal was reached she lost the purpose that drove her and realized that she wasn’t really happy living like this. She had a “grey haze” inside her that “tastes like vegetables I don’t like”. So her arcade story (and her character song) are all about coming to terms with how she feels, exploring what would make her *actually* happy now that she isn’t living just to prove her hometown wrong, and the conclusion she comes up with after all that introspection is that she would just be happier living as a girl.

So its not ruining her character arc its actually building on it in a very realistic way. Haven’t we all had moments in life where we staked our whole identity on a goal, and put all our time and effort into achieving that goal, only to achieve it and realize it wasn’t actually what we wanted? It’s all about what you do after you’ve completed your goal and trying to figure out where to go next, and how to prioritize your own feelings rather than just trying to prove something to someone else. 

Thats also why she feels like she cant go home, because she’s worried that if shes honest about her identity then people will doubt the work she did to dispel the stereotype about twins
    That wasn't her story. Bridget was never told by everyone that she was a girl. She knew that she was AMAB, but she had to pretend that she wasn't. Her parents even regretted that. That is why she tried to prove that she was a man in the first place because she saw that her parents were sad about the situation, so she wanted to prove to the village that having twin boys was not a superstition by becoming a successful bounty hunter and making lots of money. She did that, it worked, so then she could live as a boy and get rid of her parents' pain. But then, Bridget realized that she actually didn't identify as male and was indeed a woman. So Bridget's arc is really about going from an ambiguous identity to a masculine one for the sake of others, and then to a feminine one for the sake of herself.
    Yes. Don't tell the tumblr crowd that though.
Wait I played through her arcade and Bridget never admitted to being a girl? Do i get that dialogue for beating Stage 9 Nago?
    Nah, it's supposedly the end of Arcade mode sub-flawless. If you beat it on flawless, you won't ever get this dialogue.
        It's still heavily implied, though. Her Bio also uses female pronouns, so it's not only in the sub-flawless "bad" ending.
            ...Why did you feel the need to add that? That's not what their question was about.
                Honestly? I've heard to many people say dumb things about this and I'm just half ranting. Apologies.
                    Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.
bridget will always be top tier, regardless

    Ok legit question - do you mean you don't get what being trans *is*?

If you want I can explain it to you over reddit chat, no worries whatsoever.
        Yes. I don’t get it. Is being trans a “choice”? Is it something you’re born with? Can it happen at any time? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women? How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

Possibly

>Can it happen at any time?

Possibly not.

>Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women?

It depends really. If she has a dick, I am just not into that...most of the time. 


>How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

Taste on video games. Or sometimes you don't and it doesn't matter.


Ok, let me try to explain it.

You were born a boy, correct? You might be a woman, I will edit the explanation later if I need to.

You are born and since you become old enough to have a sense of self, you always view yourself as the gender you are born. As you grow older you view yourself as a man. You get enjoyment of doing stuff that you view as being part of being a man. You may have doubts that the way you look, the way you act, the things you like aren't considered manly enough by your standards. So you change that, and get a nice feeling seeing the improvement on your body you did in the gym. Having clothes that make you look at the mirror and say "Behold! A man!"


And even if you didn't do all this and get euphoric about it, you will not stop viewing yourself as a man.

Even if I took your brain and put it in a robot's body, you will still look at yourself and see a man.


Because your mind tells you this is your gender. This is how you are comfortable. This is part of you, and you deserve to enjoy it.


Now...imagine you didn't. Every time you look at the mirror you feel like there is something wrong with your face. Your body. Your clothes. Even if you try to improve it and become closer to what you consider a man, it just doesn't work for you.

Because your mind is interpreting it as wrong. Your mind thing you should be a girl.

And so you carve your body more femininely, you put on your skirt, you put some make up on that face to make yourself pretty. And it feels correct. In place. Natural.


And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.
                >And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.

For it needs no explanation; it is a universal human experience.
                Blahaj is for everyone.
            It’s generally seen to be something you’re born with, and you discover at any given point in your life. It’s like being gay - you already were, but eventually figure out.

Not necessarily. If you’re grossed out by a notion of a woman being trans, then possibly so, but if you don’t find a trans woman attractive because she’s not pretty then that’s fine.

You usually can’t tell the difference, but the difference is that trans women weren’t “born women.” As in, when they were born, the doctor didn’t look and go “you have a daughter!”
                I always keep seeing that “Trans women are women”. So what’s the difference?   If Trans women are women then why call them “trans women” in the first place? That I don’t get. And going back to how can one tell the difference between a regular women and a trans women. It’s hard for me to tell and understand the actual difference. If trans women are just women why have a “category” for them?
                    Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
                        So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
                            ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
                                I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                                    I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
                            All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
                            Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
                    If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
                    The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
                [removed]
                    Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
            It's good of you to ask and learn! 

> How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

To further clarify on what others have said, "cis women" is the term, rather than "regular women". Cis means they identify as whichever sex they were born as, while trans means that they don't. Trans typically means transitioning to the opposite gender, but it can also refer to those who don't really identify as either gender, identify as both genders, etc. The way we identify and present can get complicated, especially when people are dissatisfied and experimenting.
            I know this is a bit old buuuuut let me (a trans girl) help you out.

>Is being trans a choice?
God I wish it was. The thing is is it’s the same with being gay, bi, straight, whatever you can’t choose to be trans.

>Can it happen any time?
Yes and no. Some people realize when they are trans eventually. Some people are late bloomers and realize late in life and others realize it when they are very young.

>Is it transphobic to not want to date a trans woman?
Ok so here is the thing if the reason why you don’t like them is that they are trans, then yes. But if it’s another factor like their personality or something else that is about their character then no.

>How do you tell the difference between a “regular” woman and a trans woman.
It’s not as simple as pointing to one area and it being a trans woman only thing. Estrogen (the hormone responsible for women being women) changes the body of whoever it comes into contact with, that also comes with changes to the body and (sometimes) the voice. Usually the big things that are noticeable in trans women is their voices and their demeanor. Usually trans women (and men) are more self aware of their voices and body then other people causing them to be more secluded. 
Now does that give you the right to ask someone if they are trans if they have these traits? 
Hell no, being trans (especially now) is a very vulnerable thing and some people want to keep it to themselves. And if someone tells you their trans then for the most part keep that to yourself and let them come out to other people. And when living your day to day life with them call them their preferred name and pronouns.

Hope this helped

                No way it’s transphobic to not like someone who’s trans, I don’t want to fuck someone who has a dick. Of course I’m going to think that anyone with a dick is unattractive, that’s how I feel
                    For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
                    I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
                    Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
                    Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
            Does not being attracted to a black woman make you racist? That is basically what you are asking.
            It's not transphobic to not be attracted to trans women, but it is rude if your *only* reason to not date a trans woman is because she isn't cis. Not transphobic, just kinda rude.
        As someone who is pan and identified a decent amount of time ago. I'm really out of touch due to the evolving state of sexualities. Im not sure if im allowed to call myself pan or if there is something better that describes me.
            Labels are just a way to put a name to what you feel, use the one that fits you better, you don't need software updates or anything lmao
                Thank you, i appreciate that a lot
            All-sexual aka "I don't discriminate, only penetrate"
                Thats my favourite sentence i've seen since a year and i will treasure it.
            Just define yourself however you feel is appropriate mate
            Pan is fine because it's all inclusive :D 

I use bi as shorthand but pan describes me too
        Don't bother trying to learn mate. All of this is seeped with insecurity and drama.
    I'm in the same boat. No matter how much research I do and listen to trans people explain it I just can't wrap my head around it.

        How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow? Would you act the same way you already do, would you feel the same, would you be comfortable having boobs, no dick, etc? For the rest of your life? You probably don't think about it much but you're probably comfortable with your body and how you're presenting, right?

Trans people don't feel comfortable, they feel like they're the wrong sex mentally or physically. There's a lot of gender roles and expectations at play, too. If you're physically a huge hairy man people treat you much different and expect different things from you than from a woman.

I don't know if this helps or not. If it doesn't, that's fine.
            \>How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow?

&#x200B;

I hate this question so much. Turning a impossible hypothetical to compare to real peoples struggle is treating being trans as if its just a "oh, this is how I am now?" kind of thing.

to answer your question, I'd move on with my life. weather or not I like it I continue to do as I see fit. will it be weird? yea, but there isn't an alternative. If I become a woman then I'll have to just deal with it and adapt.

when I've answered this before I usually get snide comments about how I wouldn't be able to. well, what else would I do? cry until its fixed? not gunna happen.

and I do want to stress that this hypothetical is nothing compared to being trans, that much I at least know.
                It's not impossible though. It would be gradual but if you took estrogen now your body would change extremely.

People coming to realize that they're trans can also be very gradual.

You don't have to "cry until it's fixed" but you could transition. Or not, maybe you'd be totally comfortable living as a woman with all the expectations of being a woman, who knows?
        Broadly speaking, there's sex (which is defined whether someone produce male or female gametes, though there is slight nuance to this since there are people who are hermaphrodites, but leaving them aside for simplicity). Then there is gender, which is archetypically defined as a set of traits one would associate with what females or males are perceived as, we take these archetypal traits for females to be what we call a 'woman' due to generally perceived social femininity traits, while for males what we call a 'man' due to generally perceived social masculine traits.

***TL;DR Here*** Someone is trans when they have feelings or behavior that is more in-line with what is socially perceived as the things done by said opposite sex. So if in your society most males do not wear skirts, and you're a male who wants to wear skirts because you wish to resemble and feel most comfortable looking like or behaving like the generalized female, that makes you a trans woman. Simply put your gender identity is that of being a woman. Your biological sex is still male (to deny this would be a false claim), but your gender (the thing that is ascribed by archetypal notions of what said sexes behave and feel like in society) is now that of a woman.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind this is why in some places, a man wearing a skirt-like clothing is seem as a feminine trait, while in other places a kilt (also  skirt like attire) is seen as masculine.

So what's a "trans person"? Well it's basically someone who has an amalgamation of a bunch of traits opposite to their biological sex, which we would consider opposite to. Lets say you live in a western nation, and wearing nail polish is something almost all females do, but rarely males. If your born a male, and don't consider yourself a woman (remember, male and female is the sex, and man and woman is the gender you take yourself to be due to fulfilling a mindset where you feel you satisfy enough traits of the archetypal notion of the opposite sex) then you are not necessarily a trans woman if for instance you like to wear nail polish as a male.

But given enough things.. Like imagine wearing nail polish, wearing high heels, feeling like you look like more of a female, have hair that's styled more the way females in your society typically style their hair, body shape more easily relatable to a female, etc... At some point when you satisfy enough of these sorts of traits opposite to what your sex usually identifies as, is when you become considered trans.

The current academic discourse over this whole ordeal is when does someone take someone to be trans actually? Is it enough to consider someone trans simply because they say the feel like the opposite of what their gender usually is for their biological sex, or do they have to demonstrate at least one facet beyond claiming they're trans as a declaration.

Like, if I as a male (biological sex), say I identify as a female (gender as thought of societally), but I can't demonstrate anything that makes this apparent, the trouble currently is that it may be seen as a delusion. But if said person explains perhaps they feel like they want to dress with the typical females and woman in society dress like, then that's one reason to believe me when I say I'm a trans woman.

Modern conservative/right-leaning folks can't understand, and many times flat out ignore what the distinction of gender, and biological sex is. They either think, or attempt to strawman people by saying there is no distinction even when the distinction is provided to them, and simply brute-force declare you're deluded if you think you're a female but are born a male (which is true, but trans people don't claim their biological sex is the opposite of what they were born with, they are simply telling people that they feel they are better represented because they have feelings/looks/behavior which we generally see common among the opposite sex). And that's what gender is.

If you also feel there is no difference between sex and gender, then to formally prove this as a sound idea, you're going to have to demonstrate a law of logic violation (so spell out what the contradiction is that trans people are making). Anyone that is unable to do this, can't formally and logically claim there is no difference between sex and gender.
    Same.
    There are some great comments already down the thread, but I think it would help to add some additional context. Biological Sex and Gender are two separate things, biological Sex is generally male or female depending on your genetic makeup, though there are some rare cases where where there is an extra Chromosome that makes that complicated.  
  
Gender is a social concept. Now when I say that I don't mean gender was decided in the 1950's and is held up by big gender, but rather when early humans were first starting to ook at each other and form tribes they constructed social dynamics based on biological Sex but not limited to it. Gender isn't a physical thing any more than depression or schizophrenia, creative drive, or love, it's all just chemicals.  
  
Where trans folk come in, is that they were born one biological Sex, but somehow their brain chemistry ended up taking on the social roll and needs of the other gender. This is called gender dysphoria, and the schools of thought surrounding it are "the brain is wrong and should be forced to conform with the body" and "Mistakes happen in nature all the time, but that is still a person, and should be treated as such.".  
  
Given we live in a world where ideally(I know there are still problems) an individual's gender doesn't matter for their role in society and their merit as an individual should be the most important factor, I'm inclined to side with the latter camp.I also can't help but look at "this trans stuff is in your head" the same way I see "Quit being depressed, just be happy".   
  
I also feel it's worth noting that, along with most LGBT stuff, we have records going back basically as long as people have been writing of these kinds of experiences. It's not terribly common, but if you know where to look you can find instances of trans, and non binary, those who do not fit into either gender role, sprinkled through ancient mythology and even a hand full of historical examples.

I love the fan reaction from everyone. I've seen almost no one dislike that Bridget is now trans, just a few comments in one post.  ^(porn artists will be mad though)
    Youtube comments tell a much different story, everyone is quite vile on there.
        Why did I not listen you. I listened to Bridget's new theme and saw the people who didn't like the change (but at least they had way less likes than the people explaining that Bridget is trans).
    Just wait till you read the Japanese reactions

And well, artists still draw Bridget as male, so nothing has changed much
And if people don't like it then well ... Cry about it I guess
        I mean, Bridget may be a girl now, but it's not like her entire biological body suddenly changed.

Artist draws her the way she looks and the way she is: a cute (now mtf) girl.
            Most of the people that like Bridget art disagree though
            I mean, with all the magic shit in GG, who's to say she didn't just ring up Faust for a magic transition surgery?
Is that the true outcome though?

From what I've seen, the culmination of dialogue that leads up to that doesn't happen if you go flawless, leaving the dialogue murky at best
    If you go flawless, she talks about [hiding a part of herself and not being sure if she's brave enough to come out](https://youtu.be/9W5ezv_xxOk) with Ky. It's a pretty sweet conversation.
        I've seen the video, that's not what I took away from stage 8 flawless and stage 9 win

He seems to not really directly acknowledge it

I took it as "true self" as dropping the femboy aspect used to confuse others into thinking he's a woman and living as how he wanted to live for so long: like the guy he was born as but pushed away from being
            She's always been pretty open about being a boy prior. In Strive the lines where she admits to being a boy she sounds really dejected now while the "I'm a girl!" line is really positive and comes after she's already told Goldlewis she's a boy before. I take that as trans, though I won't say your interpretation is wrong. It could be.
                I feel as though the true ending of arcade mode isn't as on the nose as the other endings by design, whether or not Bridget had said anything about him potentially leaning towards female would have culminated in something more direct. However, a flawless run has bridget be more confident in who he is.

When bridget got his ass beat in arcade, he seems like he's just kinda given in and that him being a girl is just what he's left with whereas in a flawless run, he seems confident and less wavering on what's bothering him (identity crisis)
                Have you heard the Japanese audio? She sounds pretty cool
FEMININE PENIS
    I’m straight, therefore anything that turns me on is a woman. QED
I'll start this off by saying at the end of the day, I really don't care that much, but did they retcon her story at least? If they changed her backstory, then I'm fine with it, but Bridget's whole thing was being raised as a girl, escaping that because she herself identified as a male, wearing what and acting how she wanted to, and still kicking ass as a bounty hunter. If they did change it so she's not all of the sudden changing her identity just like she was forced to before against her will, then at least in the new story it's not a betrayal of the character. Testament made total sense and fit the character, honestly I loved the change, this one goes against the character's backstory if it wasn't addressed.

EDIT: Another comment helped me put into words what I'm trying to say. They're promoting a discriminated and wronged community by ripping an icon away from another discriminated and wronged community. It's also a character whose whole motivations run counter to representing their new community.
    They don't need to retcon the backstory for a character when they were on their own for years to think to themselves and make a decision.
        I see your point, but if it goes against the character's previous identity and motivations at their very core, then I feel like they have to at least explain a bit. Bridget was a good feminine male icon who was forced into a situation that they, via their story, didn't want to be in. Bridget didn't WANT to be female, that was their whole thing and the reason they became a bounty hunter in the first place, but now they, with no explanation, want to go entirely against that with no prompting or development? Something generally has to happen for someone to do a complete 180 on their core values and motivations, something that I can see them making a decent explanation for if they do it right. To what your point was though, it could've happened "off screen" after heavy introspection, but without telling the viewer what happened it kinda just becomes making up your own canon.
            Were they trying to be manly because of their own sake or were they trying to be manly to prove their village wrong as external validation. They were raised a girl (or to present as one) purely for preservation reasons. Now independent they choose to identify as a girl separate from their village. Doesn't even sound like a 180. Kinda sounds like someone with a internal conflict trying to seek external validation and after time on their own and not caring about what others thought they made their own decision. Why is it seen as a loss instead of a character deciding their own identity?
                What I'm saying is that's one possible explanation, one that honestly did come to mind as a good way to address it, but it's not canon until it's explicitly addressed. For now, the canon change has no explanation. Also looking at it from a community standpoint, Bridget already represented a group that needed it and benefitted from having an icon in the games to identify with, crossdressers. If it's explicitly addressed story-wise, then fine, but until it is then it just feels forced instead of making a new, well-written trans character.
                    It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
                    Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
                        I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.

    I think you're completely off.

It's just her latest character development and it makes sense if you remove any headcanon filling in the vague bits prior.  
  
E.g. This is just Bridget, going from understandably identifying as a boy in a context of disproving an idiotic conservative-like faith belief that same sex twins = bad misfortune, and growing comfortable in the masculine part of her character in doing so, to, after accomplishing the goal of showing the village the belief was indeed foolish, being able to reflect on their self without the external pressures of her parents with their situation, the societal beliefs that were at the root of it, or the quest she put her all into, and in doing so, coming to the conclusion she is a girl completely on her own terms, having conquered her past.  
  
It's a beautiful story if you look at it in good faith without political or identity biases. It also ties into Strive's theme poetically while being as such, as it innately highlights the important nuance of freedom vs. force. This holding true even when what was forced lines up with something that ended up being true for the character. The nuance of coming to their realization on their own being what matters is an obvious fit for the narrative of the game as a whole. You see a similar theme with a character arc like Jack-O's in Strive.  
  
As someone who couldn't care less if a character identifies as either a femboy or trans, I'm perfectly fine with her latest character development. I liked this character prior and I like this character now. Those going off the deep end over this change are no better to me than those who treat their headcanon of Astolfo being trans as canonical and raging at anything that doesn't adhere to it. While it's fine to have headcanon, it's not fine to let it turn one's self into a raging child at canonical developments not lining up with what was assumed. Which, is what we've seen in excess from various people who all have their own personal political axe to grind over what Daisuke Ishiwatari has wanted to do with his character.
    Love how people are just disliking this and the people replying instead of attempting to open up a dialogue. If you disagree, then let's talk about it?
        Twitter is even worse. No one has a good argument, it’s just “you’re transphobic + ratio”
            Bet you $100 most of the people disliking it don't even know the backstory. I'm all for trans characters when they're well written, this is the polar opposite of that.
                so glad we have the loving all knowing cis to be the ultimate arbiters on what makes a good trans character
                    As if the trans community doesn't call basically every femboy trans
                    I mean, I'm pretty sure someone being groomed into being trans is a bad trans character. Sends a really toxic message for the community, but feel free to correct me and say that's exactly what you want the message trans characters send to be.
        [removed]
            So true. They just scream and call you names
                Valid arguments are wasted as soon as they pull the “transphobic” card
            Who are "these people" in this context?
I’m a bit confused. Which arcade mode ending is canon? Because one say’s this but the another one says the opposite?
    every arcade ending is canon tho
    It doesn't really say the opposite, it just takes a different journey to the same destination. Bridget is referred to by she/her pronouns in the in-game glossary so her transition is canon no matter what ending you get

Edit: now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that since Xrd every arcade ending is canon, they're just different dialogues about the same situation
I simply call Bridget, Bro-yos
Still a boy
Why did they change Bridget’s story like that anyway?
It’s nice to re-visit the grave of the GG community once in a while. And by nice, I mean miserable.
In the bad end where he's beaten so badly he gives away his character development from the previous games and proving the village right.   


Get better representation folks.
I dunno, i do find the implications of the plot line to be a little... weird , if other people don't and like it that's fine but it just doesn't really sit right with me.
Wait they changed the backstory?

God forbid I had a legit question.
    No, the story continued.
        Thanks, I couldnt play so all I read was people yelling at each other.

I thought they retcon the backstory.
            They did basically

Just means I'm still straight ig
Nice
How long till the Bridget posts stop
    What do you mean they just came out (in two ways) of course people are gonna be posting her
I'm pretty sure [retracted] said he's a boy after a flawless victory in stage 1
Considering the Guilty Gear world, a magical gender change surgery or an appointment with Faust would make Bridget into a biological girl (not sure if they have spells like that, but Faust can do it 100%). 

So basically transgender would canonically not exist in GG world, because if you want to, a magical doc throws a weird spell at ya and boom, you are a woman.

Going with all the story after Xrd, that arcade ending is a good choice for ArcSys.
I understood that reference!

    It's not "bad"
I just wanna thank Bridget for finally getting me into Celestial. 

I lost my first match to a Ky, he left cause he probably felt bad and then I won my next 5 against two Bridgets.


Thanks, Bridget! And also Ky for not rematching cause he would have wrecked me. I hate Ky.

    No one here cares why you stopped liking the thing they like, no one here wants to be told what you don't like about they thing they like.
Listen, I might not be the biggest Bridget fan in the world but even know that this goes entirely against his character cause the whole point of him becoming an bounty hunter in the first place was to prove that he can be a strong hints why he wanted to be more "manly" but now he accepts himself as a girl now? Which was something he wanted to get away from? That doesn't sound like progression to me.
    You don't understand the trans experience in any way shape or form huh?
    No the whole point of being the bounty hunter was to try to be masculine but she found out she never liked being masculine which is why she still dressed feminine 

And now her progressive comes to a end as she finally understands she is a trans girl, a choice she picked all on her own

And it's pretty similar to real trans experiences, quite a lot of us who are born male will try to become more masculine and find out we don't like that

the new story reads like a stone toss comic tho :skull:
I’m still not sold on this change. I just feel like it robs Bridget of what made them such a fan favorite character in the first place. But that’s just my opinion honestly
[deleted]
    Or was Bridget always trans but denied it?
Same
I'm just here for the deep space 9 reference. Great job Op!
I gotta say I'm kind of conflicted about this. 

Not because of Bridget being trans - Bridget will be Bridget - but because of her backstory. If I remember correctly, she was raised as a girl because of some stupid superstition in her village about same-sex twins. Then later, she left her village, and tried to live as a boy. In spite of all the hardship involved, she kept trying. 

And then in Strive she decides "You know what, I'm a girl and nothing's gonna change that because it's my decision". Which, true enough, it is. 

But it does raise the question: would Bridget have decided to assume herself as a girl had her parents not raised her as one her whole life? Does her newfound acceptance of her own identity come from a place of resignation, or of true desire? Has she come to terms or simply given up?

I feel like there's a lot of mixed signals in there. Not being a trans person myself, I can only ASSUME that there is a parallel with how difficult it is for one to define their gender identity. Yet, I somehow find that Bridget's original struggle was a bit more... appealing is not the word I want to use, but it's the closest I can find. 

This is a different case from when Testament was "confirmed as non-binary", because the answer was "Testament is neither a boy nor a girl, Testament is Testament". Which, in my eyes at least, confirms what I've always thought about Testament: Testament doesn't give a shit whether Testament is seen as male or female.
    there's a complication, in that her backstory, to those that loved her, Bridget wasn't fully socialized as a girl. Her parents were up-front and honest with her, saying she was a boy who had to pretend to be a girl because of the superstition. That's why she was so adamant about being a boy while building up her skills as a bounty hunter; when she became rich and famous, she proved the superstition about same-sex twins was false. Strive says that after that, she was unfulfilled, and a big thing in the trans community is "i'm not supposed to like this" being egg-cracking. Bridget got told by her closest loved ones growing up she was a boy who had to pretend to be a girl; eventually she realizes she loves being a girl. Hell, it's reflected in her clothing; back in the "i'm going to prove the superstition wrong!" phase, outfits were straightline dresses which de-emphasize any curves, and male symbol on the headdress. Strive? an empire-waist dress (which emphasizes the breasts), a hoodie that hides the shape of her shoulders (common on transgirls), and the androgyne symbol on said hoodie.
        As much sense as this makes, it still sends a bit of a strange message. It kind of feels like "parents know best". 

The fact that this mostly comes forward in the form of Arcade mode storytelling also hits in a weird way, because it's almost like there's no actual progress, if that makes sense. Like Bridget is still conflicted about her identity despite her initial affirmation.   
Ky exemplifies this in a weird way as well, because his comparison is about him turning into a Gear, which is something he has no control over, and assuring Bridget his heart remains the same. But Bridget deciding her identity IS something she has control over, however scary the perception of others would be.   
I.E. Ky doesn't have a choice, but Bridget does.
            well, in this case, her closest loved ones kept telling her "you're a boy". so yeah, Bridget is still coming to realize "i get to choose". The fear comes from the other parts; Ky says "even if i become a gear, i'll still be me" to correlate to Bridget's "if i come out, i might lose what i have now". Ky's telling her that what decision she'll make, she'll still get to be her, and find what happiness she can. they're analogous.
What was the original scene for the images?
Meh…
Makes me wonder if his actually story will continue on now. I may not have been the biggest fan of Bridget though I am surprised that they didnt continue the story of Bridget looking for his lost twin brother. Who Venom has once encountered

No penis? (Megamind face)
i love star trek so much

If anyone had a mental breakdown because their femboy is now a girl just a reminder it was only one femboy that is transfem no one else
I love it when artists/content creators inadvertently say that a girl got enormous, firm, round implants
In Guilty Gear Strive Bridget corrects Goldlewis and says I am a boy.
Who knew that being based was one of his behemoth typhoons?
    In this behemoth typhoon, we crack an egg
        in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis supports the trans community
            In this behemoth typhoon, trans rights are human rights
                I should hope that's true for every behemoth typhoon!
                    Every Typhoon has a different purpose, he breaks that one out when he needs to. Just in case some chuds forget
    In this behemoth typhoons, Goldlewis supports LGBTQ+ rights and exports them in other countries
In this Behemoth Typhoon...

Goldlewis hits you with acceptance and solid life advice.
🤔 should someone edit Kor to be Goldlewis?
    So funny story, I had an earlier draft that had Goldlewis's face over Kor's, but it didn't really look right to me, cause the faces of Goldlewis I had were a bit too serious looking and it didn't really capture the feeling I was wanting.  
Ultimately went with "This was how \*I\* felt went with how Bridget's story went". I think it worked out
        Having seen this in other spaces, it's perhaps the best way for it to work out as a meme. Kor's joy is there and that's all we need.
In this Behemoth Typhoon, Goldlewis earns the title of Best Dad. It isn't much in a post-apocalyptic shit hole world, but it's something
I mean, Goldlewis probably doesn't care what you are as long as you aren't a cryptid.
    I thought the end goal of all LGBTQ+ people was to become a cryptid. It's mine, at least.
I can't be the only femboy who thinks being a femgirl sounds nice right? aha. Still cis though

Thank you. Like who cares if bridget is femboy or transgender girl. Bridget is cute anime char and that all that matters.
Where there’s a hole, there’s a goal.
    Insert the 1000000th FBI joke here because Bridget totally isn't over the age of consent
        I thought she was 16 or so by the time of AC+, with Strive taking place six years later. Did I miss something?

    Anal fissures aren't funny son. They can make a ~~man~~  girl suicidal from pain and it might last 6 months or longer.
Basically due to the curse of having twins of the same sex being a bad omen or something Bridget was forced to dress up as a girl, however it's made clear in the pass games she was never forced to identify as a girl and she still clearly knew she was born male, just had to dress feminine 

She then set off to be a bounty hunter to become more masculine and prove the cruse was wrong and this whole time she still dressed feminine even though she wasn't being forced to, but she still chose to as she liked it

And now in strive she speaks to the other characters and does self reflection on who she really is and says outloud "cowgirl is fine, because I'm a girl!" As she discovered though her self reflection journey that she is a trans girl
    I didn't expect Guilty Gear to be a long-burn trans ally, but here we are. Good on her for figuring out who she was.
        Guilty Gear was always very subversive
            i thought that said submissive
        This does put us in the amusing position where using a pronoun for her is kind of a spoiler.
            Here's a handy tool to use for that ( ´・ω・\`)つ\[they/them\]
                But I want to affirm the nice lady! :(
                    You, yeah you. That comment made me nearly tear up. What an awesome person you are. Hell yeah, supportive affirmation!  🤘🏿
        Right? Guilty Gear has two trans characters now, which is two more than what I'm used to in like, anything. I'm trans and starved for good trans characters, and while representation isn't the only deciding factor on if I find something enjoyable it's just nice that a character gets to have a similar moment of self discovery with their gender and not have it be treated like it's weird. The fact that she's in a fighting game that's sick as hell and uses yo-yos is icing on the cake.
            I'm a cishet white dude, and I'm psyched on the trans representation for this reason. I can't imagine going through life where you are either invisible in every piece of media or portrayed as a monster like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. I want my trans comrades to feel safer and more accepted. So whenever I see anyone doing a transphobia, I aggressively bully them. I've got your back friend.
                Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
                Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
            Uhh who is the second one?
                Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
                    nonbinary =/= trans
                        It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
                        Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
                            Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                                I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                                Then you haven't been around trans people.
                        it literally does, dude
                        Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
                    Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
                        honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
                        No??????
        Theres a picture of bridget the creator drew in like 2019 that says "trans rights!" At the top. Guilty gear has always been for the gays 😩
            do you have a link, I would like to see that
                https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkpartyqq/status/1556508738780946432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1556508738780946432%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b27cfc2adccee88694a34fd3efd680bf5d51e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamerbraves.com%2Fguilty-gear-strive-confirms-that-bridget-is-indeed-trans%2F

I may be mixing up events since the picture is actually from this year, but he did say trans rights in 2019, probably in an interview
                    They did say they got the drawing a few years ago
                        Oh shit then maybe I'm double lying lmfao
        I love character development
            Right? And this isn't some random shit, this is character development that completely makes sense considering the character's history.
        Why do they have to be an ally? Just because they make a character gay, trans, bi, asexual, etc.. doesn't mean they have to be your ally, it's just how these characters have been written, they don't have to belong to a community of their same gender identity just because you want them to do so.
    Ohhhhh thanks You:)
    > whole time she still dressed feminine even though she wasn't being forced to, but she still chose to as she liked it

slight correction, Bridget did it out of respect and love for her parents (who were still in the village), not because "she liked it".
        Then why did she still wear feminine clothes after leaving?

No one in the village would see her
            Because word would travel????

The whole point is Bridget leaving the village to gain a reputation as a successful bounty hunter and proving the superstition of the village false. Until Bridget achieves that goal they can't change their appearance. Their parents are still in the village and they are doing it out of love/protecting them.
                She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.
                     (◔_◔)
        We all excuse it. I just grew my nails out because I liked to tap them on stuff. I painted them because keratin is a gross yellow. "I only grew my hair out because I couldn't get it cut." "I'm not trans, I'm just not like the others." Eventually they believe it could be a possibility, and it's so insanely possible, so grossly consistent that it can't be impossible. Not everyone is an egg, but there's an excuse for every euphoric choice.
            Makes me think of how I'm always painting my nails because I want to see my favourite colour more often.

Edit: The strive arcade playthrough for Bridget where you lose a heart in stage 7, during stage 8.

In the strive arcade playtgrough for Bridget, Bridget explains to GoldLewis around the start that she’s a guy like she always has, but then later in arcade Goldlewis asks if Bridget is hiding something for someone else’s sake. Bridget goes “…! How do you know?” And goldlewis goes on about how he’s been hiding away a part of himself too and that it’s resulted in someone he loves (family or lover, he doesn’t clarify) living in separate homes. People believe Goldlewis is either taking about his feelings for his work (it’s already explained in his song that he extremely despised his job but does it as a necessary evil), or that he’s queer in some way but hasn’t come out about it.

Then Ky gets involved in a fight too and then they talk some more. Bridget mentions that she’s afraid about coming out about whatever she’s hiding but also feels awful hiding it still. They convince her to take a risk and come out and the arcade and decides to do that. In reply to something Goldlewis says Bridget says “because I’m a girl” at the very end.

I wish this sort of character arc could have happened in an Another Story because arcade story in strive sucks. But, this story does get the impression off that Bridget likes being a girl and feels wrong as a guy but for whatever reason very strongly asserted he/she was a guy for a long time. Probably a mixture of anger due their town’s superstition and uncertainty about being different from everyone else. That would be more than enough to make real people fight against how they feel about their gender, there’s stories of transgender people who went extra lengths to deny they felt anything different before realizing the feelings aren’t going away.
    Part of her journey to become a successful bounty hunter was to prove that she wasn't a curse because of how she was born and destroy the superstition, which she succeeded in. Identifying as male and expressing wanting to be more masculine despite never acting on it is more-or-less her flipping the bird at said superstition, which felt like an obligation to keep doing after she succeeded in destroying the superstition and saying it for so long. Or at least that's my take.
    The end portion is only in one arcade ending though remember strive arcade has multiple endings. Just throwing it out because it seems not many people know that endings change depending on how well you play. The other endings don't mention Bridget wanting to be called a girl so the canon on this is kinda loose until a sequel or story update confirms it.
        Yeah I wasn't aware of the arcade other endings until just recently.

The interpretation I got was that, at least, Bridget wants to explore their gender. Specifically these lines from the fawless run stage 8 and 9ending:

Bridget: Wow, what limitless power you have!

Ky: You flatter me, but I owe my power to the strength of Gears.

Bridget: Were you afraid about coming out about Gears?

Ky: No, I wasn't afraid, I didn't want to lie to myself or my family, that's all.

Bridget: I wish I could be like you.

(another battle with Dragon Install ky)

Ky: Have I convinced you yet? No matter what others think, I will not change. Not even if this body turns to gear.

Bridget: No matter what others think, huh? I admit that still scares me a little, But I want to live as my true self, at least that's how I feel after having watched you.

Then Ky invites Bridget to see his family (specifically Dizzy since they're friends) and Bridget says thanks.

GGST World lore in-game calls Bridget a she, her Starter Guide never mentions he/her pronouns (despite I-no, Sol, Goldlewis, Jack-O, Happy Chaos and Baiken all having he/her used. Testament's doesn't use any he/her and I didn't check other starter guides)... it seems a bit obvious either A: The english localization is mistaken/intentionally divergent or B: This is the intended interpretation. One of those two things.
        ~~It's been pretty firmly supported in their official Youtube in the stickied comment: https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8 They don't appear to be interested in the "Oh, she only comes out as trans in this one route" approach.~~

EDIT: I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.
        She mentions coming out to her village in the Flawless ending
They made Bridget into a girl. That basically sums it up. The writers viewed Bridget's identity as a GNC male as groundwork for them to transition for some reason, so that's the direction they took it.

Maybe they were afraid that a GNC guy was too risqué or a poor representation or something.. we'll never know. Arc doesn't respond.

Who said anything about sexuality

    OK. I'll take note:

            not to be pedantic, but “sexuality refers to whom one experienced sexual attraction” and “i am sexually attracted neither to men nor to women”

grammar is epic 👍🏼
                If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
                Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.

It's gender identity more so than sexuality, but tbh I don't really care either, they seem like a cool character and that's all that really matters to me personally
As a Pot main I concur. I sniff too much glue to discriminate with who I HPB. Potemkin’s hands are Rated E for Everyone.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. 

One character, Dax, is a worm-like symbiotic organism that bonds with a host species. But the worms lifespan is way longer than it's hosts, so it's had a whole bunch of different ones over several centuries. It keeps their memories and aspects of their personality and gives them to it's new hosts when the previous dies. 

The old Klingon in the picture was good friends with the male Curzon-Dax when he was younger, and 81 years later is reunited with Dax's new host Jadzia. He keeps identifying her as Curzon until she gently explains she's different now, and he quickly picks up her new identity.
    Huh, genderfluid(?) Worm symbiote. That seems cool.
        Star Trek has been incredibly based since the beginning.

Literally William Shatner and Nichel Nichols had the first interracial kiss on television.  When there were threats to pull the kiss from the episode Shatner (and other cast members) said they'd quit if it wasn't kept in.

Also Star Trek has been doing LGBT things forever.  TNG had an episode about a whole race of non-binary people (although it was a weird Riker-trys-to-bang-something episode.  The worm symbiote/trill thing was literally just a trans episode in 1993.  Polyamorous.  Very obvious gay/lesbian couples.

Like Star Trek gave no fucks

I think years of being independent from their village to think for themself is independent enough
    "I want to be a boy damn it! All my life I've wanted it!"

"Alright you can be a boy now."

*a few years and talking it out with friends later*

"...Wait. Guys, I might have realized something."

So now Bridget's lore is an ironic story where being raised as a girl *was* correct for her, turns out, but it was for the wrong reasons since she'd have been killed otherwise because Insert Anime Pulp. So she thought that being a girl was completely wrong until she was an adult and could take stock of things for herself.

Still no clue why they retconned her to have billionaire parents.
        You aren't a fighting game without a sprinkling of retcons.
            Yeah but like. They could just leave if the place they live in insists they have to *murder* one of their babies if they both are male. They probably own five other homes where the villagers don't say to do that.

If they were poor villagers the story works fine, especially since Bridget proves herself to the village by making a lot of money to send back home, but making them billionaires is just ???????
                We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
        My point exactly.  
Had Bridget embraced being a femboy or perhaps made a metamorphosis to a tomboy or even a super metrosexual jojo character, noone would bat an eye. Trans just feels like a weird retcon.   
Not that I really care in the end, I find yo Bridget totes adorbs.
            trans girls fighting to be seen as men and wanting desperately to fit in as men and then completely turning a 180 when they realise they're trans is like THE trans girl timeline.
            You seem to be misunderstanding me. Bridget's trans story works, she decides to live as a girl after thinking on it away from home after living as a boy became available to her. She thought that's what she wanted and when it didn't make her happy, she thought about it outside of the context of her village where her gender has always been a loaded question. Decides to openly and willfully live as a girl and see how it goes, badabing trans rights.

The weird retcon is her parents being billionaires which doesn't feel like it makes sense with the "social pressure to kill your baby in a village" and "Bridget sends money back home which gains respect for her" aspect of her backstory.
                I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
                I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
        because the writing is really fucking dumb
I played the arcade mode like 6 times for all the dialogue. It was very much Bridget's decision, and it came after a lot of fear and indecision. As someone whos struggled with the same thing, it was authentic.
    I just wish there was any indication to this in the past games so it feels more like a natural progression than a retcon.
        Tbh, i was extremely worried about how they might handle the character in this game. There wasnt a ton of lore on bridgets backstory, but it felt a lot like an uncomfortable trope from 20 years ago. I think they could have gone several directions, but proud femboy or trans girl are the only two that would go over well. "Being true to yourself" is a very common theme in guilty gear, its not like its out of left field or anything. Also i wouldnt say its a retcon: bridget grew to accept herself. Denial/repression is a bitch. If bridget was fighting to be more manly to live up to expectations in the previous game, coming to terms with her identity as trans is a completely natural progression of that in my experience. Its letting go of those expectations to move forward for yourself, realizing what you actually want. And thats exactly the story they told. Its fair if it feels forced to you, but it feels very organic to me.
            I suppose I can see why they found the retcon necessary; there's little ways the original backstory could have gone and made it look like she's her own free person, so might as well scrap that part and go for a purer identity.  
Still, F for the femboys.
                Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
                    I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
                        Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
        Fighting to be seen as a manly man before your transition is one of the most naturally trans things possible. The story beat resonates so strongly with so many of us *because* that's our lived experience. No "indication" would ever be good enough for people complaining it's a retcon with no justification, short of Bridget's "I'm a boy!" intros in XX being followed by her mugging the camera and saying "but in 6 years, I'll be a girl!"

There is an ocean of difference between "retcon" and "character development."
        How you gonna have a natural progression with a six year time skip
>I just hope it was her independent decision

I keep seeing people say stuff like this, which is super weird because that's literally the entire point of her Arcade Mode story arc.
I think the whole "she was groomed to be that way" is a really bad faith argument anyway. Conversion therapy exists and doesn't work, being proof that you can't be changed to be a different sexuality or gender identity. It's all a part of you from birth, and you just kinda have to roll with the punches and figure it out yourself
    Right, but this is a fictional character, written however the creators choose regardless of if it's realistic or not.
Bro tf u mean the writers can just write "she decided it" or " it wasn't her own decision" 🥱 don't forget it's not a real person
    Yes but lore that superficial makes characters boring for some of us. The same reason a character's clothing or voice acting can be interesting. Otherwise you're just making a bunch of ones and zeros jump around. Despite them not being a real person, if I was playing a faceless gray wire frame body, the game wouldn't be nearly as interesting to me
        I masturbate to porn. How that even works is beyond me.
~~So according to the GG official youtube [(see the stickied comment)](https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8), she wasn't raised as a girl. Her parents and the village just made her wear girl's clothes. In all other aspects, she was treated as a boy.~~

I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.
Thank you, this comment made me laugh a lot after seeing some of the other shit in the comments section here. I should probably stop scrolling through. Any other trans people or allies scrolling through: oi, stop that, digital self-harm isn't helping you.
was in r/Kappa and saw a fucking political ass comic with Goldlewis brainwashing Bridget into being trans with a random ass dude with a T-Shirt saying "Bridget Respecters" (or some fuckshit like that) looking desolate as all hell.

only visited the subreddit once because of this situation and yeah, it is as bad as they say it is
    Kappa really turned to shit after they banned porn, but I think this kind of thing was always bubbling under the surface there sadly. Frustrates me that I used to spend time there until I saw that rot creeping in.
        they were all in harmony until the annoying virgins attacked
It doesn't imply anything about the curse. Mainly because if the curse was correct then Bridget would have been either killed as a child or an abandoned orphan. 

Bridget proved that the curse was bullshit and that she could live as a man if she wished. But years after that she discovered that she was actually uncomfortable with being a boy and decided to live her life as a girl.

And that's the important part. She made the decision for herself, without any outside influence beyond encouragement from Goldlewis and Ky to live true to herself and not to be afraid of what other's think of her.
    Yeah, important to remember that nobody's required her to present as a female in any context since the end of XX, which was six years ago.
The curse is just a reflection of Societal Expectation.

It's as if her parents and the village are saying... 

Oh you're a twin boy? You must disguise yourself in girl clothes to survive. We don't think you're really a girl though. It is our disguise we made for you. 

Oh you want to prove the curse is bullshit? You must adhere to our highest standards of masculinity while being wildly and insanely successful.

Either way she can't really be happy, because she is just dancing along to other people's desires and expectations. The context of the curse puts her in a lose-lose situation in terms of self-actualisation: is she only a girl because she was raised that way to avoid the curse, or is she a boy because that's the only way she managed to break the concept of the curse and thus get the village's respect? 

Only when she is finally free of the burden of others' expectations does she come to terms with how she wants to be. That actually being a girl, rather than just hiding beneath the guise of a girl, really does make her happy and comfortable.
The curse was never actually real, just superstition. Bridget set out to prove being born male didn’t define anything about her and she did so.

Realising she’s trans is a pretty natural extension of that story, I think. Being raised a girl wasn’t the issue, it’s that her identity was decided for her by circumstance. Breaking free of those circumstances means she can choose whatever makes her legitimately happy.
Turns out the real man is the friends we made along the way
My interpretation was, that when Bridget became a teen, they thought "I want to show I'm male to prove this superstition wrong. (Maybe to prevent other male twins in the future from having the same fate)". So they had all this pressure to prove that they were a man. And in the end, they succeeded, and the superstition was proven wrong.

But, in the ~6 years since XX, Bridget's had a lot of time to think, and with the burden of "I have to prove I'm male" gone, they've thought about their gender in a new light, and eventually decided they were more comfortable being a woman.
Oh no I'm sure there's literally no other femboys out there
    At this point there might as well not be with all this ugly retconning and woke changing of lore and history
        "woke changing" yeah just cope dumbass, femboys transition all the time, why don't you go play fate that has literally the single most famous femboy of all the whole complaining about how there's no femboys
My entire problem with this change. If they explain it well enough, then fine, but it really feels like they just entirely betrayed the character. Their entire backstory was about escaping a forced identity that they didn't want and showing you can be cool by being whatever you want to be, no matter your identity. Up until it's explained, it's just promoting one discriminated community by taking them away from another.
    Exactly! And ontop of that if he does agree to become a girl then hes agreeing to his parents disturbing grooming which is a giant massive can of worms which nobody can justify at all without exposing themselves as absolute creeps
        Yuuuuuuup, it's actually a bad representation for the trans community too if they don't tread carefully and really drive home that it was Bridget and Bridget alone's motivation. Even then, still runs into the idea of grooming type motivations. There's a lot of people who think the same as us on this one, so you've got support bud!
            Definitely a creepy can of worms. Which i pray to god the devs realize how disturbing they have made their lore with this sudden drop
    > Their entire backstory was about escaping a forced identity that they didn't want and showing you can be cool by being whatever you want to be, no matter your identity.

Where are you getting this? Her backstory was about proving the villages superstitions wrong, not about feeling any kind of way about her gender being kept secret.
        The whole reason Bridget became a bounty hunter was to fight powerful foes to prove how manly they are. That's literally in the early games.
I hear this a lot, but surely, with enough of us nerds here, we can find some positive crossdressing rep in some other fandom? I think everybody here’s already familiar with Felix from ReZero and Astolfo from Fate, but there has to be more.
    While I understand that you’re trying to help them find representation somewhere else, I feel like it’s less about representation as a whole and more about having a specific character they identified with “ripped away” in a sense.

I also want to add that I’m not trying to argue against the character change or anything.
        Absolutely; I’m also trying to test the waters a little since I’m sure that there’s an amount of people who are genuinely hurting a little, and not leading people on.

I’m not gonna deny that this is an imperfect solution to the problem, but it’s a more productive thing to do beyond mourning, and the faster we move on, the sooner we get back to being toxic about game balance and not real world issues.
    Ok but what about inside games?
        I still wouldn’t know much, but Amane from BlazBlue is just across the street.
            Imma be honest, i hate the face they gave amane 🤣
                Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
                    Lol ya its so not a good look
    this is hilarious because one of those characters is a trans woman and the other is nonbinary
        I already did my homework more or less, right here. If we go strictly by canon, Felix has been claimed by the author as a guy. That said, if you have an actual source that points to Astolfo being non-binary, go for it. Who knows, maybe my five second wiki search isn’t complete.
            felix is said to be a closeted trans girl in a WN side story, idk as much about astolfo but i've heard that it's implied that they are non-binary
                [some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
                That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
    You could just keep calling Bridgette a femboy despite all the evidence to the contrary. Since you're doing that for ferris (who is trans fem, look at the source material) and astolfo (who's nonbinary). A much better example is Haku, from Naruto
        I did some digging, and Ferris is. Complicated. Going by author interviews and some other parts of the original works, Ferris isn’t trans fem, but there’s a small group from years ago who would gladly look past that given other parts of the light novels. I am not going to drag myself through headcanons in the name of rep.

Also, I’ve actually seen some NBs take up the mantle of femboy if you can believe it. I’m not going to examine Astolfo too closely to double-check if you’re correct about that, but I’ll gladly take calling Astolfo a femboy in stride.

Edit: Astolfo is *also* canonically just a guy. He’s bisexual for what it’s worth.
Considering the vast amount of fem men that transition this seems like a fairly normal step in Bridgette's story. It stinks you lost a character that represented you but think of all the people she will now represent.
    Because they clearly couldn't create another character that did that exact thing...



/s
        Femboys transition all the time lol. There's no reason Bridgette can't. It's like getting upset at your favorite character for having characters progression. We aren't even sure if she transitioned or prefers she/her pronouns. Get over it
            I have nothing against character progression.

I have EVERYTHING against sloppily written character progression that leaves the audience (a good amount of them, anyhow) out in the cold, and undoing previously established lore.

I've said it before in another comment, but this is the same issue that I had with Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy: they repurposed the character to serve a slightly different purpose than their original, and expect the audience to take this "change" at face value, despite any previous characterization they may have had that contradicts the current characterization.
                Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
                    > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
                        My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
                            >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                                But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.

I am right here with you. It hurts my heart. 

I was not as cute as b but I was very gender confused for a long time being in a place, I left to prove myself and I came back as a man. 

I related to b more then most
now now, you can't criticize this you see, we care about representation, but only for some people.
What was the representation? Bridget, pre strive, was just a guy that had to cross dress due to some cultural issues.  

Are you being forced to do so???    

Edit: I'm getting downvotes but no explanation?
    Uh cross dressing? Femboys?
        Are cross dressers and femboys not doing it voluntarily??
Finding your only validation from a guilty gear character is pretty sad. You got other problems that need to be solved first bro.
    ur literally projecting something onto them that wasn't even implied. go be weird to your therapist bro lol
        Ok ya even imma say wtf about them 🤣
mate, Jojo
[removed]
    For Bridget? Yeah. For everybody who’s crossdressing? Not always.
        Real shit.  Androgyny is hot, dependency on titles is a whole separate deal and this mandatory labeling of all femboys/tomboys as the opposite gender is ironic AF.
            And even ignoring that, I’d say it’s at least fun on some level. I’m never going on OnlyFans. I’m never going out in public like that. Unless I get incredibly lucky, crossdressing to me is going to scratch the itch between cosplay and character creators and nothing else, and that’s okay.
            No, no it isnt. Im a femboy, a male only. Ill never be trans. And all this has done is insult an entire community in the lgbt
                I think we're agreeing?
                I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
                    It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
        My bad, sorry
She's a girl :)
    I wrote *she and *femboy in the same sentence im actually stupid
        Femboy transgirl, a fresh new gender adjacent to tomboy malewife
    Ah i fucking forgot about the new lore
Someone actually reported this comment as hate speech, wtf
yeah but if it was fine being a boy why she is still acting like a girl?
maybe she actually feels like a girl???
    The concept is it wasn’t fine being a boy she was forced to dress as a girl. ARE YOU IMPLYING ACTING LIKE A GIRL MEANS YOU ARE A GIRL THATS SO BINARY
        are you ok?
        She said she's a girl so she's a girl :)

The only reason you think it's forced is because you don't like it. The characters ENTIRE story is about figuring out who her true self is and carving an identity that isn't sculpted by other people
    You almost had it there, just flip it around; they don’t like it _because_ it’s forced. And there’s a lot more nuance to this topic I feel neither side, both intense supporters and radical transphobes, are willing to discuss.
        It's not forced at all though, did you not read my comment?
            I did, and it’s not untrue. Bridget’s story in their debut was finding the meaning of ‘manliness’ and that it wasn’t what society’s expectations of manliness was, it was something you decided for yourself. That you are not a girl (at the time they were a feminine male) for being feminine in clothing and demeanour, you are just as much of a man as any other guy is. 

Now some feel that Bridget’s total transition into identifying as female treads backwards on their whole gender-non-conforming-male arc by going ‘yes actually they were female the whole time, the village was right about the superstition after all’. 

If Guilty Gear wanted trans representation, which is still great mind you, just _make a whole new character._ It’d be even better if they were developed early so their transition could be properly depicted in story mode cutscene glory or something. 

Point is, trans rep is great, sure. But there is no need to seemingly overwrite already existing GNC representation (feminine men, who related to pre-change Bridget), just to have another (trans women). We can have _both._ 

This especially irks me since as you would know, there’s an ongoing issue with trans women being purposefully mislabeled as just ‘femboys’, and it’s true the other way around too. And I’ve seen some people who also have in issue with this writing be written off as transphobes when having valid critique. But anyway, to not go too far off on a tangent, that’s how I feel about the whole thing.
    It's your prerogative to be happy with what appears to be blatant pandering. I expect more.
        I really love that people think the character who has had a conflicting gender identity her whole existence being trans is like the most illogical curveball that makes no sense. The arc makes perfect sense, it's not forced, it's not pandering, cope
            There was no conflicting gender identity. Bridget was a male. Bridget identified as a male. Due to circumstances, Bridget dressed as a female, and one does not have to be trans to crossdress. There was no indication at all, through 20 years, that Bridget questioned her gender identity. Spontaneously deciding she is trans now is either bad writing or pandering. I don't really care which; either way my initial point stands.
"winning"
She's a trans girl

Therefore if you are a guy then it's straight to like her
    Debatable, not completely at the very least
ah yeah the so known femboy erasure we everyday hear about
That's my conflict here personally. Just exchanging one form of representation for another, but this is a pretty unexpected change for this character too. You don't see a lot of femboy characters, and I feel that this just plays into the stereotype that men expressing femininity or feeling comfortable playing with gender norms just means they're secretly trans. Ultimately though, Bridget is still Bridget and I'm happy to see her back in Strive.
I think the best way to look at this is that Bridget was quite likely meant to be trans from the very beginning of her inception, but societal understanding and portrayal of transgender people was quite different at the time. It's possible Bridget's backstory and insistence on being male was only a way to make her more palatable to audiences. So they've updated the character to be more true to the original vision.
They took a gender non conforming man and turned them into a gender conforming woman
She was only called a girl because her parents knew she would be killed if they didn’t do that. She started asserting she was a boy as a way to dispel the myths about the curse, and to become a strong bounty hunter to prove everyone wrong. She did that, she was able to bring back a lot of riches and break the stereotype/curse about twins, and so was now free to just be a guy. But in her arcade story and her character song she’s clearly not happy with the decision she made. Now that her goal was reached she lost the purpose that drove her and realized that she wasn’t really happy living like this. She had a “grey haze” inside her that “tastes like vegetables I don’t like”. So her arcade story (and her character song) are all about coming to terms with how she feels, exploring what would make her *actually* happy now that she isn’t living just to prove her hometown wrong, and the conclusion she comes up with after all that introspection is that she would just be happier living as a girl.

So its not ruining her character arc its actually building on it in a very realistic way. Haven’t we all had moments in life where we staked our whole identity on a goal, and put all our time and effort into achieving that goal, only to achieve it and realize it wasn’t actually what we wanted? It’s all about what you do after you’ve completed your goal and trying to figure out where to go next, and how to prioritize your own feelings rather than just trying to prove something to someone else. 

Thats also why she feels like she cant go home, because she’s worried that if shes honest about her identity then people will doubt the work she did to dispel the stereotype about twins
That wasn't her story. Bridget was never told by everyone that she was a girl. She knew that she was AMAB, but she had to pretend that she wasn't. Her parents even regretted that. That is why she tried to prove that she was a man in the first place because she saw that her parents were sad about the situation, so she wanted to prove to the village that having twin boys was not a superstition by becoming a successful bounty hunter and making lots of money. She did that, it worked, so then she could live as a boy and get rid of her parents' pain. But then, Bridget realized that she actually didn't identify as male and was indeed a woman. So Bridget's arc is really about going from an ambiguous identity to a masculine one for the sake of others, and then to a feminine one for the sake of herself.
Yes. Don't tell the tumblr crowd that though.
Nah, it's supposedly the end of Arcade mode sub-flawless. If you beat it on flawless, you won't ever get this dialogue.
    It's still heavily implied, though. Her Bio also uses female pronouns, so it's not only in the sub-flawless "bad" ending.
        ...Why did you feel the need to add that? That's not what their question was about.
            Honestly? I've heard to many people say dumb things about this and I'm just half ranting. Apologies.
                Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.

Ok legit question - do you mean you don't get what being trans *is*?

If you want I can explain it to you over reddit chat, no worries whatsoever.
    Yes. I don’t get it. Is being trans a “choice”? Is it something you’re born with? Can it happen at any time? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women? How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?
        > Is it something you’re born with?

Possibly

>Can it happen at any time?

Possibly not.

>Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women?

It depends really. If she has a dick, I am just not into that...most of the time. 


>How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

Taste on video games. Or sometimes you don't and it doesn't matter.


Ok, let me try to explain it.

You were born a boy, correct? You might be a woman, I will edit the explanation later if I need to.

You are born and since you become old enough to have a sense of self, you always view yourself as the gender you are born. As you grow older you view yourself as a man. You get enjoyment of doing stuff that you view as being part of being a man. You may have doubts that the way you look, the way you act, the things you like aren't considered manly enough by your standards. So you change that, and get a nice feeling seeing the improvement on your body you did in the gym. Having clothes that make you look at the mirror and say "Behold! A man!"


And even if you didn't do all this and get euphoric about it, you will not stop viewing yourself as a man.

Even if I took your brain and put it in a robot's body, you will still look at yourself and see a man.


Because your mind tells you this is your gender. This is how you are comfortable. This is part of you, and you deserve to enjoy it.


Now...imagine you didn't. Every time you look at the mirror you feel like there is something wrong with your face. Your body. Your clothes. Even if you try to improve it and become closer to what you consider a man, it just doesn't work for you.

Because your mind is interpreting it as wrong. Your mind thing you should be a girl.

And so you carve your body more femininely, you put on your skirt, you put some make up on that face to make yourself pretty. And it feels correct. In place. Natural.


And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.
            >And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.

For it needs no explanation; it is a universal human experience.
            Blahaj is for everyone.
        It’s generally seen to be something you’re born with, and you discover at any given point in your life. It’s like being gay - you already were, but eventually figure out.

Not necessarily. If you’re grossed out by a notion of a woman being trans, then possibly so, but if you don’t find a trans woman attractive because she’s not pretty then that’s fine.

You usually can’t tell the difference, but the difference is that trans women weren’t “born women.” As in, when they were born, the doctor didn’t look and go “you have a daughter!”
            I always keep seeing that “Trans women are women”. So what’s the difference?   If Trans women are women then why call them “trans women” in the first place? That I don’t get. And going back to how can one tell the difference between a regular women and a trans women. It’s hard for me to tell and understand the actual difference. If trans women are just women why have a “category” for them?
                Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
                    So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
                        ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
                            I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                                I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
                        All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
                        Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
                If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
                The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
            [removed]
                Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
        It's good of you to ask and learn! 

> How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

To further clarify on what others have said, "cis women" is the term, rather than "regular women". Cis means they identify as whichever sex they were born as, while trans means that they don't. Trans typically means transitioning to the opposite gender, but it can also refer to those who don't really identify as either gender, identify as both genders, etc. The way we identify and present can get complicated, especially when people are dissatisfied and experimenting.
        I know this is a bit old buuuuut let me (a trans girl) help you out.

>Is being trans a choice?
God I wish it was. The thing is is it’s the same with being gay, bi, straight, whatever you can’t choose to be trans.

>Can it happen any time?
Yes and no. Some people realize when they are trans eventually. Some people are late bloomers and realize late in life and others realize it when they are very young.

>Is it transphobic to not want to date a trans woman?
Ok so here is the thing if the reason why you don’t like them is that they are trans, then yes. But if it’s another factor like their personality or something else that is about their character then no.

>How do you tell the difference between a “regular” woman and a trans woman.
It’s not as simple as pointing to one area and it being a trans woman only thing. Estrogen (the hormone responsible for women being women) changes the body of whoever it comes into contact with, that also comes with changes to the body and (sometimes) the voice. Usually the big things that are noticeable in trans women is their voices and their demeanor. Usually trans women (and men) are more self aware of their voices and body then other people causing them to be more secluded. 
Now does that give you the right to ask someone if they are trans if they have these traits? 
Hell no, being trans (especially now) is a very vulnerable thing and some people want to keep it to themselves. And if someone tells you their trans then for the most part keep that to yourself and let them come out to other people. And when living your day to day life with them call them their preferred name and pronouns.

Hope this helped

            No way it’s transphobic to not like someone who’s trans, I don’t want to fuck someone who has a dick. Of course I’m going to think that anyone with a dick is unattractive, that’s how I feel
                For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
                I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
                Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
                Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
        Does not being attracted to a black woman make you racist? That is basically what you are asking.
        It's not transphobic to not be attracted to trans women, but it is rude if your *only* reason to not date a trans woman is because she isn't cis. Not transphobic, just kinda rude.
    As someone who is pan and identified a decent amount of time ago. I'm really out of touch due to the evolving state of sexualities. Im not sure if im allowed to call myself pan or if there is something better that describes me.
        Labels are just a way to put a name to what you feel, use the one that fits you better, you don't need software updates or anything lmao
            Thank you, i appreciate that a lot
        All-sexual aka "I don't discriminate, only penetrate"
            Thats my favourite sentence i've seen since a year and i will treasure it.
        Just define yourself however you feel is appropriate mate
        Pan is fine because it's all inclusive :D 

I use bi as shorthand but pan describes me too
    Don't bother trying to learn mate. All of this is seeped with insecurity and drama.
I'm in the same boat. No matter how much research I do and listen to trans people explain it I just can't wrap my head around it.
    deleted by editing. the only way to truly delete comments.
    How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow? Would you act the same way you already do, would you feel the same, would you be comfortable having boobs, no dick, etc? For the rest of your life? You probably don't think about it much but you're probably comfortable with your body and how you're presenting, right?

Trans people don't feel comfortable, they feel like they're the wrong sex mentally or physically. There's a lot of gender roles and expectations at play, too. If you're physically a huge hairy man people treat you much different and expect different things from you than from a woman.

I don't know if this helps or not. If it doesn't, that's fine.
        \>How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow?

&#x200B;

I hate this question so much. Turning a impossible hypothetical to compare to real peoples struggle is treating being trans as if its just a "oh, this is how I am now?" kind of thing.

to answer your question, I'd move on with my life. weather or not I like it I continue to do as I see fit. will it be weird? yea, but there isn't an alternative. If I become a woman then I'll have to just deal with it and adapt.

when I've answered this before I usually get snide comments about how I wouldn't be able to. well, what else would I do? cry until its fixed? not gunna happen.

and I do want to stress that this hypothetical is nothing compared to being trans, that much I at least know.
            It's not impossible though. It would be gradual but if you took estrogen now your body would change extremely.

People coming to realize that they're trans can also be very gradual.

You don't have to "cry until it's fixed" but you could transition. Or not, maybe you'd be totally comfortable living as a woman with all the expectations of being a woman, who knows?
    Broadly speaking, there's sex (which is defined whether someone produce male or female gametes, though there is slight nuance to this since there are people who are hermaphrodites, but leaving them aside for simplicity). Then there is gender, which is archetypically defined as a set of traits one would associate with what females or males are perceived as, we take these archetypal traits for females to be what we call a 'woman' due to generally perceived social femininity traits, while for males what we call a 'man' due to generally perceived social masculine traits.

***TL;DR Here*** Someone is trans when they have feelings or behavior that is more in-line with what is socially perceived as the things done by said opposite sex. So if in your society most males do not wear skirts, and you're a male who wants to wear skirts because you wish to resemble and feel most comfortable looking like or behaving like the generalized female, that makes you a trans woman. Simply put your gender identity is that of being a woman. Your biological sex is still male (to deny this would be a false claim), but your gender (the thing that is ascribed by archetypal notions of what said sexes behave and feel like in society) is now that of a woman.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind this is why in some places, a man wearing a skirt-like clothing is seem as a feminine trait, while in other places a kilt (also  skirt like attire) is seen as masculine.

So what's a "trans person"? Well it's basically someone who has an amalgamation of a bunch of traits opposite to their biological sex, which we would consider opposite to. Lets say you live in a western nation, and wearing nail polish is something almost all females do, but rarely males. If your born a male, and don't consider yourself a woman (remember, male and female is the sex, and man and woman is the gender you take yourself to be due to fulfilling a mindset where you feel you satisfy enough traits of the archetypal notion of the opposite sex) then you are not necessarily a trans woman if for instance you like to wear nail polish as a male.

But given enough things.. Like imagine wearing nail polish, wearing high heels, feeling like you look like more of a female, have hair that's styled more the way females in your society typically style their hair, body shape more easily relatable to a female, etc... At some point when you satisfy enough of these sorts of traits opposite to what your sex usually identifies as, is when you become considered trans.

The current academic discourse over this whole ordeal is when does someone take someone to be trans actually? Is it enough to consider someone trans simply because they say the feel like the opposite of what their gender usually is for their biological sex, or do they have to demonstrate at least one facet beyond claiming they're trans as a declaration.

Like, if I as a male (biological sex), say I identify as a female (gender as thought of societally), but I can't demonstrate anything that makes this apparent, the trouble currently is that it may be seen as a delusion. But if said person explains perhaps they feel like they want to dress with the typical females and woman in society dress like, then that's one reason to believe me when I say I'm a trans woman.

Modern conservative/right-leaning folks can't understand, and many times flat out ignore what the distinction of gender, and biological sex is. They either think, or attempt to strawman people by saying there is no distinction even when the distinction is provided to them, and simply brute-force declare you're deluded if you think you're a female but are born a male (which is true, but trans people don't claim their biological sex is the opposite of what they were born with, they are simply telling people that they feel they are better represented because they have feelings/looks/behavior which we generally see common among the opposite sex). And that's what gender is.

If you also feel there is no difference between sex and gender, then to formally prove this as a sound idea, you're going to have to demonstrate a law of logic violation (so spell out what the contradiction is that trans people are making). Anyone that is unable to do this, can't formally and logically claim there is no difference between sex and gender.
Same.
There are some great comments already down the thread, but I think it would help to add some additional context. Biological Sex and Gender are two separate things, biological Sex is generally male or female depending on your genetic makeup, though there are some rare cases where where there is an extra Chromosome that makes that complicated.  
  
Gender is a social concept. Now when I say that I don't mean gender was decided in the 1950's and is held up by big gender, but rather when early humans were first starting to ook at each other and form tribes they constructed social dynamics based on biological Sex but not limited to it. Gender isn't a physical thing any more than depression or schizophrenia, creative drive, or love, it's all just chemicals.  
  
Where trans folk come in, is that they were born one biological Sex, but somehow their brain chemistry ended up taking on the social roll and needs of the other gender. This is called gender dysphoria, and the schools of thought surrounding it are "the brain is wrong and should be forced to conform with the body" and "Mistakes happen in nature all the time, but that is still a person, and should be treated as such.".  
  
Given we live in a world where ideally(I know there are still problems) an individual's gender doesn't matter for their role in society and their merit as an individual should be the most important factor, I'm inclined to side with the latter camp.I also can't help but look at "this trans stuff is in your head" the same way I see "Quit being depressed, just be happy".   
  
I also feel it's worth noting that, along with most LGBT stuff, we have records going back basically as long as people have been writing of these kinds of experiences. It's not terribly common, but if you know where to look you can find instances of trans, and non binary, those who do not fit into either gender role, sprinkled through ancient mythology and even a hand full of historical examples.

\*her
They made it better
Youtube comments tell a much different story, everyone is quite vile on there.
    Why did I not listen you. I listened to Bridget's new theme and saw the people who didn't like the change (but at least they had way less likes than the people explaining that Bridget is trans).
Just wait till you read the Japanese reactions

And well, artists still draw Bridget as male, so nothing has changed much
And if people don't like it then well ... Cry about it I guess
    I mean, Bridget may be a girl now, but it's not like her entire biological body suddenly changed.

Artist draws her the way she looks and the way she is: a cute (now mtf) girl.
        Most of the people that like Bridget art disagree though
        I mean, with all the magic shit in GG, who's to say she didn't just ring up Faust for a magic transition surgery?
If you go flawless, she talks about [hiding a part of herself and not being sure if she's brave enough to come out](https://youtu.be/9W5ezv_xxOk) with Ky. It's a pretty sweet conversation.
    I've seen the video, that's not what I took away from stage 8 flawless and stage 9 win

He seems to not really directly acknowledge it

I took it as "true self" as dropping the femboy aspect used to confuse others into thinking he's a woman and living as how he wanted to live for so long: like the guy he was born as but pushed away from being
        She's always been pretty open about being a boy prior. In Strive the lines where she admits to being a boy she sounds really dejected now while the "I'm a girl!" line is really positive and comes after she's already told Goldlewis she's a boy before. I take that as trans, though I won't say your interpretation is wrong. It could be.
            I feel as though the true ending of arcade mode isn't as on the nose as the other endings by design, whether or not Bridget had said anything about him potentially leaning towards female would have culminated in something more direct. However, a flawless run has bridget be more confident in who he is.

When bridget got his ass beat in arcade, he seems like he's just kinda given in and that him being a girl is just what he's left with whereas in a flawless run, he seems confident and less wavering on what's bothering him (identity crisis)

I’m straight, therefore anything that turns me on is a woman. QED
They don't need to retcon the backstory for a character when they were on their own for years to think to themselves and make a decision.
    I see your point, but if it goes against the character's previous identity and motivations at their very core, then I feel like they have to at least explain a bit. Bridget was a good feminine male icon who was forced into a situation that they, via their story, didn't want to be in. Bridget didn't WANT to be female, that was their whole thing and the reason they became a bounty hunter in the first place, but now they, with no explanation, want to go entirely against that with no prompting or development? Something generally has to happen for someone to do a complete 180 on their core values and motivations, something that I can see them making a decent explanation for if they do it right. To what your point was though, it could've happened "off screen" after heavy introspection, but without telling the viewer what happened it kinda just becomes making up your own canon.
        Were they trying to be manly because of their own sake or were they trying to be manly to prove their village wrong as external validation. They were raised a girl (or to present as one) purely for preservation reasons. Now independent they choose to identify as a girl separate from their village. Doesn't even sound like a 180. Kinda sounds like someone with a internal conflict trying to seek external validation and after time on their own and not caring about what others thought they made their own decision. Why is it seen as a loss instead of a character deciding their own identity?
            What I'm saying is that's one possible explanation, one that honestly did come to mind as a good way to address it, but it's not canon until it's explicitly addressed. For now, the canon change has no explanation. Also looking at it from a community standpoint, Bridget already represented a group that needed it and benefitted from having an icon in the games to identify with, crossdressers. If it's explicitly addressed story-wise, then fine, but until it is then it just feels forced instead of making a new, well-written trans character.
                It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
                Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
                    I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.

I think you're completely off.

It's just her latest character development and it makes sense if you remove any headcanon filling in the vague bits prior.  
  
E.g. This is just Bridget, going from understandably identifying as a boy in a context of disproving an idiotic conservative-like faith belief that same sex twins = bad misfortune, and growing comfortable in the masculine part of her character in doing so, to, after accomplishing the goal of showing the village the belief was indeed foolish, being able to reflect on their self without the external pressures of her parents with their situation, the societal beliefs that were at the root of it, or the quest she put her all into, and in doing so, coming to the conclusion she is a girl completely on her own terms, having conquered her past.  
  
It's a beautiful story if you look at it in good faith without political or identity biases. It also ties into Strive's theme poetically while being as such, as it innately highlights the important nuance of freedom vs. force. This holding true even when what was forced lines up with something that ended up being true for the character. The nuance of coming to their realization on their own being what matters is an obvious fit for the narrative of the game as a whole. You see a similar theme with a character arc like Jack-O's in Strive.  
  
As someone who couldn't care less if a character identifies as either a femboy or trans, I'm perfectly fine with her latest character development. I liked this character prior and I like this character now. Those going off the deep end over this change are no better to me than those who treat their headcanon of Astolfo being trans as canonical and raging at anything that doesn't adhere to it. While it's fine to have headcanon, it's not fine to let it turn one's self into a raging child at canonical developments not lining up with what was assumed. Which, is what we've seen in excess from various people who all have their own personal political axe to grind over what Daisuke Ishiwatari has wanted to do with his character.
Love how people are just disliking this and the people replying instead of attempting to open up a dialogue. If you disagree, then let's talk about it?
    Twitter is even worse. No one has a good argument, it’s just “you’re transphobic + ratio”
        Bet you $100 most of the people disliking it don't even know the backstory. I'm all for trans characters when they're well written, this is the polar opposite of that.
            so glad we have the loving all knowing cis to be the ultimate arbiters on what makes a good trans character
                As if the trans community doesn't call basically every femboy trans
                I mean, I'm pretty sure someone being groomed into being trans is a bad trans character. Sends a really toxic message for the community, but feel free to correct me and say that's exactly what you want the message trans characters send to be.

        So true. They just scream and call you names
            Valid arguments are wasted as soon as they pull the “transphobic” card
        Who are "these people" in this context?
every arcade ending is canon tho
It doesn't really say the opposite, it just takes a different journey to the same destination. Bridget is referred to by she/her pronouns in the in-game glossary so her transition is canon no matter what ending you get

Edit: now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that since Xrd every arcade ending is canon, they're just different dialogues about the same situation
No, the story continued.
    Thanks, I couldnt play so all I read was people yelling at each other.

No one here cares why you stopped liking the thing they like, no one here wants to be told what you don't like about they thing they like.
You don't understand the trans experience in any way shape or form huh?
No the whole point of being the bounty hunter was to try to be masculine but she found out she never liked being masculine which is why she still dressed feminine 

And now her progressive comes to a end as she finally understands she is a trans girl, a choice she picked all on her own

And it's pretty similar to real trans experiences, quite a lot of us who are born male will try to become more masculine and find out we don't like that

Or was Bridget always trans but denied it?
there's a complication, in that her backstory, to those that loved her, Bridget wasn't fully socialized as a girl. Her parents were up-front and honest with her, saying she was a boy who had to pretend to be a girl because of the superstition. That's why she was so adamant about being a boy while building up her skills as a bounty hunter; when she became rich and famous, she proved the superstition about same-sex twins was false. Strive says that after that, she was unfulfilled, and a big thing in the trans community is "i'm not supposed to like this" being egg-cracking. Bridget got told by her closest loved ones growing up she was a boy who had to pretend to be a girl; eventually she realizes she loves being a girl. Hell, it's reflected in her clothing; back in the "i'm going to prove the superstition wrong!" phase, outfits were straightline dresses which de-emphasize any curves, and male symbol on the headdress. Strive? an empire-waist dress (which emphasizes the breasts), a hoodie that hides the shape of her shoulders (common on transgirls), and the androgyne symbol on said hoodie.
    As much sense as this makes, it still sends a bit of a strange message. It kind of feels like "parents know best". 

The fact that this mostly comes forward in the form of Arcade mode storytelling also hits in a weird way, because it's almost like there's no actual progress, if that makes sense. Like Bridget is still conflicted about her identity despite her initial affirmation.   
Ky exemplifies this in a weird way as well, because his comparison is about him turning into a Gear, which is something he has no control over, and assuring Bridget his heart remains the same. But Bridget deciding her identity IS something she has control over, however scary the perception of others would be.   
I.E. Ky doesn't have a choice, but Bridget does.
        well, in this case, her closest loved ones kept telling her "you're a boy". so yeah, Bridget is still coming to realize "i get to choose". The fear comes from the other parts; Ky says "even if i become a gear, i'll still be me" to correlate to Bridget's "if i come out, i might lose what i have now". Ky's telling her that what decision she'll make, she'll still get to be her, and find what happiness she can. they're analogous.

In this behemoth typhoon, we crack an egg
    in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis supports the trans community
        In this behemoth typhoon, trans rights are human rights
            I should hope that's true for every behemoth typhoon!
                Every Typhoon has a different purpose, he breaks that one out when he needs to. Just in case some chuds forget
In this behemoth typhoons, Goldlewis supports LGBTQ+ rights and exports them in other countries
So funny story, I had an earlier draft that had Goldlewis's face over Kor's, but it didn't really look right to me, cause the faces of Goldlewis I had were a bit too serious looking and it didn't really capture the feeling I was wanting.  
Ultimately went with "This was how \*I\* felt went with how Bridget's story went". I think it worked out
    Having seen this in other spaces, it's perhaps the best way for it to work out as a meme. Kor's joy is there and that's all we need.
I thought the end goal of all LGBTQ+ people was to become a cryptid. It's mine, at least.

I didn't expect Guilty Gear to be a long-burn trans ally, but here we are. Good on her for figuring out who she was.
    Guilty Gear was always very subversive
        i thought that said submissive
    This does put us in the amusing position where using a pronoun for her is kind of a spoiler.
        Here's a handy tool to use for that ( ´・ω・\`)つ\[they/them\]
            But I want to affirm the nice lady! :(
                You, yeah you. That comment made me nearly tear up. What an awesome person you are. Hell yeah, supportive affirmation!  🤘🏿
    Right? Guilty Gear has two trans characters now, which is two more than what I'm used to in like, anything. I'm trans and starved for good trans characters, and while representation isn't the only deciding factor on if I find something enjoyable it's just nice that a character gets to have a similar moment of self discovery with their gender and not have it be treated like it's weird. The fact that she's in a fighting game that's sick as hell and uses yo-yos is icing on the cake.
        I'm a cishet white dude, and I'm psyched on the trans representation for this reason. I can't imagine going through life where you are either invisible in every piece of media or portrayed as a monster like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. I want my trans comrades to feel safer and more accepted. So whenever I see anyone doing a transphobia, I aggressively bully them. I've got your back friend.
            Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
            Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
        Uhh who is the second one?
            Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
                nonbinary =/= trans
                    It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
                    Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
                        Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                            I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                            Then you haven't been around trans people.
                    it literally does, dude
                    Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
                Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
                    honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
                    No??????
    Theres a picture of bridget the creator drew in like 2019 that says "trans rights!" At the top. Guilty gear has always been for the gays 😩
        do you have a link, I would like to see that
            https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkpartyqq/status/1556508738780946432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1556508738780946432%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b27cfc2adccee88694a34fd3efd680bf5d51e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamerbraves.com%2Fguilty-gear-strive-confirms-that-bridget-is-indeed-trans%2F

I may be mixing up events since the picture is actually from this year, but he did say trans rights in 2019, probably in an interview
                They did say they got the drawing a few years ago
                    Oh shit then maybe I'm double lying lmfao
    I love character development
        Right? And this isn't some random shit, this is character development that completely makes sense considering the character's history.
    Why do they have to be an ally? Just because they make a character gay, trans, bi, asexual, etc.. doesn't mean they have to be your ally, it's just how these characters have been written, they don't have to belong to a community of their same gender identity just because you want them to do so.
Ohhhhh thanks You:)
> whole time she still dressed feminine even though she wasn't being forced to, but she still chose to as she liked it

slight correction, Bridget did it out of respect and love for her parents (who were still in the village), not because "she liked it".
    Then why did she still wear feminine clothes after leaving?

No one in the village would see her
        Because word would travel????

The whole point is Bridget leaving the village to gain a reputation as a successful bounty hunter and proving the superstition of the village false. Until Bridget achieves that goal they can't change their appearance. Their parents are still in the village and they are doing it out of love/protecting them.
            She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.

    We all excuse it. I just grew my nails out because I liked to tap them on stuff. I painted them because keratin is a gross yellow. "I only grew my hair out because I couldn't get it cut." "I'm not trans, I'm just not like the others." Eventually they believe it could be a possibility, and it's so insanely possible, so grossly consistent that it can't be impossible. Not everyone is an egg, but there's an excuse for every euphoric choice.
        Makes me think of how I'm always painting my nails because I want to see my favourite colour more often.

Part of her journey to become a successful bounty hunter was to prove that she wasn't a curse because of how she was born and destroy the superstition, which she succeeded in. Identifying as male and expressing wanting to be more masculine despite never acting on it is more-or-less her flipping the bird at said superstition, which felt like an obligation to keep doing after she succeeded in destroying the superstition and saying it for so long. Or at least that's my take.
The end portion is only in one arcade ending though remember strive arcade has multiple endings. Just throwing it out because it seems not many people know that endings change depending on how well you play. The other endings don't mention Bridget wanting to be called a girl so the canon on this is kinda loose until a sequel or story update confirms it.
    Yeah I wasn't aware of the arcade other endings until just recently.

The interpretation I got was that, at least, Bridget wants to explore their gender. Specifically these lines from the fawless run stage 8 and 9ending:

Bridget: Wow, what limitless power you have!

Ky: You flatter me, but I owe my power to the strength of Gears.

Bridget: Were you afraid about coming out about Gears?

Ky: No, I wasn't afraid, I didn't want to lie to myself or my family, that's all.

Bridget: I wish I could be like you.

(another battle with Dragon Install ky)

Ky: Have I convinced you yet? No matter what others think, I will not change. Not even if this body turns to gear.

Bridget: No matter what others think, huh? I admit that still scares me a little, But I want to live as my true self, at least that's how I feel after having watched you.

Then Ky invites Bridget to see his family (specifically Dizzy since they're friends) and Bridget says thanks.

GGST World lore in-game calls Bridget a she, her Starter Guide never mentions he/her pronouns (despite I-no, Sol, Goldlewis, Jack-O, Happy Chaos and Baiken all having he/her used. Testament's doesn't use any he/her and I didn't check other starter guides)... it seems a bit obvious either A: The english localization is mistaken/intentionally divergent or B: This is the intended interpretation. One of those two things.
    ~~It's been pretty firmly supported in their official Youtube in the stickied comment: https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8 They don't appear to be interested in the "Oh, she only comes out as trans in this one route" approach.~~

EDIT: I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.

            If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
            Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.

Bridget is sexy
Huh, genderfluid(?) Worm symbiote. That seems cool.
    Star Trek has been incredibly based since the beginning.

Literally William Shatner and Nichel Nichols had the first interracial kiss on television.  When there were threats to pull the kiss from the episode Shatner (and other cast members) said they'd quit if it wasn't kept in.

Also Star Trek has been doing LGBT things forever.  TNG had an episode about a whole race of non-binary people (although it was a weird Riker-trys-to-bang-something episode.  The worm symbiote/trill thing was literally just a trans episode in 1993.  Polyamorous.  Very obvious gay/lesbian couples.

Like Star Trek gave no fucks
        “He was more than a hero, he was a union man”-Miles O’Brien
"I want to be a boy damn it! All my life I've wanted it!"

"Alright you can be a boy now."

*a few years and talking it out with friends later*

"...Wait. Guys, I might have realized something."

So now Bridget's lore is an ironic story where being raised as a girl *was* correct for her, turns out, but it was for the wrong reasons since she'd have been killed otherwise because Insert Anime Pulp. So she thought that being a girl was completely wrong until she was an adult and could take stock of things for herself.

Still no clue why they retconned her to have billionaire parents.
    You aren't a fighting game without a sprinkling of retcons.
        Yeah but like. They could just leave if the place they live in insists they have to *murder* one of their babies if they both are male. They probably own five other homes where the villagers don't say to do that.

If they were poor villagers the story works fine, especially since Bridget proves herself to the village by making a lot of money to send back home, but making them billionaires is just ???????
            We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
    My point exactly.  
Had Bridget embraced being a femboy or perhaps made a metamorphosis to a tomboy or even a super metrosexual jojo character, noone would bat an eye. Trans just feels like a weird retcon.   
Not that I really care in the end, I find yo Bridget totes adorbs.
        trans girls fighting to be seen as men and wanting desperately to fit in as men and then completely turning a 180 when they realise they're trans is like THE trans girl timeline.
        You seem to be misunderstanding me. Bridget's trans story works, she decides to live as a girl after thinking on it away from home after living as a boy became available to her. She thought that's what she wanted and when it didn't make her happy, she thought about it outside of the context of her village where her gender has always been a loaded question. Decides to openly and willfully live as a girl and see how it goes, badabing trans rights.

The weird retcon is her parents being billionaires which doesn't feel like it makes sense with the "social pressure to kill your baby in a village" and "Bridget sends money back home which gains respect for her" aspect of her backstory.
            I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
            I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
    because the writing is really fucking dumb
I just wish there was any indication to this in the past games so it feels more like a natural progression than a retcon.
    Tbh, i was extremely worried about how they might handle the character in this game. There wasnt a ton of lore on bridgets backstory, but it felt a lot like an uncomfortable trope from 20 years ago. I think they could have gone several directions, but proud femboy or trans girl are the only two that would go over well. "Being true to yourself" is a very common theme in guilty gear, its not like its out of left field or anything. Also i wouldnt say its a retcon: bridget grew to accept herself. Denial/repression is a bitch. If bridget was fighting to be more manly to live up to expectations in the previous game, coming to terms with her identity as trans is a completely natural progression of that in my experience. Its letting go of those expectations to move forward for yourself, realizing what you actually want. And thats exactly the story they told. Its fair if it feels forced to you, but it feels very organic to me.
        I suppose I can see why they found the retcon necessary; there's little ways the original backstory could have gone and made it look like she's her own free person, so might as well scrap that part and go for a purer identity.  
Still, F for the femboys.
            Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
                I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
                    Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
    Fighting to be seen as a manly man before your transition is one of the most naturally trans things possible. The story beat resonates so strongly with so many of us *because* that's our lived experience. No "indication" would ever be good enough for people complaining it's a retcon with no justification, short of Bridget's "I'm a boy!" intros in XX being followed by her mugging the camera and saying "but in 6 years, I'll be a girl!"

There is an ocean of difference between "retcon" and "character development."
    How you gonna have a natural progression with a six year time skip
Right, but this is a fictional character, written however the creators choose regardless of if it's realistic or not.
Yes but lore that superficial makes characters boring for some of us. The same reason a character's clothing or voice acting can be interesting. Otherwise you're just making a bunch of ones and zeros jump around. Despite them not being a real person, if I was playing a faceless gray wire frame body, the game wouldn't be nearly as interesting to me
    I masturbate to porn. How that even works is beyond me.
Kappa really turned to shit after they banned porn, but I think this kind of thing was always bubbling under the surface there sadly. Frustrates me that I used to spend time there until I saw that rot creeping in.
    they were all in harmony until the annoying virgins attacked
Yeah, important to remember that nobody's required her to present as a female in any context since the end of XX, which was six years ago.
At this point there might as well not be with all this ugly retconning and woke changing of lore and history
    "woke changing" yeah just cope dumbass, femboys transition all the time, why don't you go play fate that has literally the single most famous femboy of all the whole complaining about how there's no femboys
Exactly! And ontop of that if he does agree to become a girl then hes agreeing to his parents disturbing grooming which is a giant massive can of worms which nobody can justify at all without exposing themselves as absolute creeps
    Yuuuuuuup, it's actually a bad representation for the trans community too if they don't tread carefully and really drive home that it was Bridget and Bridget alone's motivation. Even then, still runs into the idea of grooming type motivations. There's a lot of people who think the same as us on this one, so you've got support bud!
        Definitely a creepy can of worms. Which i pray to god the devs realize how disturbing they have made their lore with this sudden drop
> Their entire backstory was about escaping a forced identity that they didn't want and showing you can be cool by being whatever you want to be, no matter your identity.

Where are you getting this? Her backstory was about proving the villages superstitions wrong, not about feeling any kind of way about her gender being kept secret.
    The whole reason Bridget became a bounty hunter was to fight powerful foes to prove how manly they are. That's literally in the early games.
While I understand that you’re trying to help them find representation somewhere else, I feel like it’s less about representation as a whole and more about having a specific character they identified with “ripped away” in a sense.

I also want to add that I’m not trying to argue against the character change or anything.
    Absolutely; I’m also trying to test the waters a little since I’m sure that there’s an amount of people who are genuinely hurting a little, and not leading people on.

I’m not gonna deny that this is an imperfect solution to the problem, but it’s a more productive thing to do beyond mourning, and the faster we move on, the sooner we get back to being toxic about game balance and not real world issues.
Ok but what about inside games?
    I still wouldn’t know much, but Amane from BlazBlue is just across the street.
        Imma be honest, i hate the face they gave amane 🤣
            Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
                Lol ya its so not a good look
this is hilarious because one of those characters is a trans woman and the other is nonbinary
    I already did my homework more or less, right here. If we go strictly by canon, Felix has been claimed by the author as a guy. That said, if you have an actual source that points to Astolfo being non-binary, go for it. Who knows, maybe my five second wiki search isn’t complete.
        felix is said to be a closeted trans girl in a WN side story, idk as much about astolfo but i've heard that it's implied that they are non-binary
            [some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
            That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
You could just keep calling Bridgette a femboy despite all the evidence to the contrary. Since you're doing that for ferris (who is trans fem, look at the source material) and astolfo (who's nonbinary). A much better example is Haku, from Naruto
    I did some digging, and Ferris is. Complicated. Going by author interviews and some other parts of the original works, Ferris isn’t trans fem, but there’s a small group from years ago who would gladly look past that given other parts of the light novels. I am not going to drag myself through headcanons in the name of rep.

Also, I’ve actually seen some NBs take up the mantle of femboy if you can believe it. I’m not going to examine Astolfo too closely to double-check if you’re correct about that, but I’ll gladly take calling Astolfo a femboy in stride.

Edit: Astolfo is *also* canonically just a guy. He’s bisexual for what it’s worth.
Because they clearly couldn't create another character that did that exact thing...



/s
    Femboys transition all the time lol. There's no reason Bridgette can't. It's like getting upset at your favorite character for having characters progression. We aren't even sure if she transitioned or prefers she/her pronouns. Get over it
        I have nothing against character progression.

I have EVERYTHING against sloppily written character progression that leaves the audience (a good amount of them, anyhow) out in the cold, and undoing previously established lore.

I've said it before in another comment, but this is the same issue that I had with Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy: they repurposed the character to serve a slightly different purpose than their original, and expect the audience to take this "change" at face value, despite any previous characterization they may have had that contradicts the current characterization.
            Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
                > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
                    My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
                        >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                            But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.

Uh cross dressing? Femboys?
    Are cross dressers and femboys not doing it voluntarily??
ur literally projecting something onto them that wasn't even implied. go be weird to your therapist bro lol
    Ok ya even imma say wtf about them 🤣
For Bridget? Yeah. For everybody who’s crossdressing? Not always.
    Real shit.  Androgyny is hot, dependency on titles is a whole separate deal and this mandatory labeling of all femboys/tomboys as the opposite gender is ironic AF.
        And even ignoring that, I’d say it’s at least fun on some level. I’m never going on OnlyFans. I’m never going out in public like that. Unless I get incredibly lucky, crossdressing to me is going to scratch the itch between cosplay and character creators and nothing else, and that’s okay.
        No, no it isnt. Im a femboy, a male only. Ill never be trans. And all this has done is insult an entire community in the lgbt
            I think we're agreeing?
            I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
                It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
    My bad, sorry
I wrote *she and *femboy in the same sentence im actually stupid
    Femboy transgirl, a fresh new gender adjacent to tomboy malewife
Ah i fucking forgot about the new lore
The concept is it wasn’t fine being a boy she was forced to dress as a girl. ARE YOU IMPLYING ACTING LIKE A GIRL MEANS YOU ARE A GIRL THATS SO BINARY
    are you ok?
    She said she's a girl so she's a girl :)
Thank you!!!! So much🥰🏳️‍⚧️

You almost had it there, just flip it around; they don’t like it _because_ it’s forced. And there’s a lot more nuance to this topic I feel neither side, both intense supporters and radical transphobes, are willing to discuss.
    It's not forced at all though, did you not read my comment?
        I did, and it’s not untrue. Bridget’s story in their debut was finding the meaning of ‘manliness’ and that it wasn’t what society’s expectations of manliness was, it was something you decided for yourself. That you are not a girl (at the time they were a feminine male) for being feminine in clothing and demeanour, you are just as much of a man as any other guy is. 

Now some feel that Bridget’s total transition into identifying as female treads backwards on their whole gender-non-conforming-male arc by going ‘yes actually they were female the whole time, the village was right about the superstition after all’. 

If Guilty Gear wanted trans representation, which is still great mind you, just _make a whole new character._ It’d be even better if they were developed early so their transition could be properly depicted in story mode cutscene glory or something. 

Point is, trans rep is great, sure. But there is no need to seemingly overwrite already existing GNC representation (feminine men, who related to pre-change Bridget), just to have another (trans women). We can have _both._ 

This especially irks me since as you would know, there’s an ongoing issue with trans women being purposefully mislabeled as just ‘femboys’, and it’s true the other way around too. And I’ve seen some people who also have in issue with this writing be written off as transphobes when having valid critique. But anyway, to not go too far off on a tangent, that’s how I feel about the whole thing.
It's your prerogative to be happy with what appears to be blatant pandering. I expect more.
    I really love that people think the character who has had a conflicting gender identity her whole existence being trans is like the most illogical curveball that makes no sense. The arc makes perfect sense, it's not forced, it's not pandering, cope
        There was no conflicting gender identity. Bridget was a male. Bridget identified as a male. Due to circumstances, Bridget dressed as a female, and one does not have to be trans to crossdress. There was no indication at all, through 20 years, that Bridget questioned her gender identity. Spontaneously deciding she is trans now is either bad writing or pandering. I don't really care which; either way my initial point stands.
Debatable, not completely at the very least
It's still heavily implied, though. Her Bio also uses female pronouns, so it's not only in the sub-flawless "bad" ending.
    ...Why did you feel the need to add that? That's not what their question was about.
        Honestly? I've heard to many people say dumb things about this and I'm just half ranting. Apologies.
            Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.

Yes. I don’t get it. Is being trans a “choice”? Is it something you’re born with? Can it happen at any time? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women? How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?
    > Is it something you’re born with?

Possibly

>Can it happen at any time?

Possibly not.

>Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women?

It depends really. If she has a dick, I am just not into that...most of the time. 


>How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

Taste on video games. Or sometimes you don't and it doesn't matter.


Ok, let me try to explain it.

You were born a boy, correct? You might be a woman, I will edit the explanation later if I need to.

You are born and since you become old enough to have a sense of self, you always view yourself as the gender you are born. As you grow older you view yourself as a man. You get enjoyment of doing stuff that you view as being part of being a man. You may have doubts that the way you look, the way you act, the things you like aren't considered manly enough by your standards. So you change that, and get a nice feeling seeing the improvement on your body you did in the gym. Having clothes that make you look at the mirror and say "Behold! A man!"


And even if you didn't do all this and get euphoric about it, you will not stop viewing yourself as a man.

Even if I took your brain and put it in a robot's body, you will still look at yourself and see a man.


Because your mind tells you this is your gender. This is how you are comfortable. This is part of you, and you deserve to enjoy it.


Now...imagine you didn't. Every time you look at the mirror you feel like there is something wrong with your face. Your body. Your clothes. Even if you try to improve it and become closer to what you consider a man, it just doesn't work for you.

Because your mind is interpreting it as wrong. Your mind thing you should be a girl.

And so you carve your body more femininely, you put on your skirt, you put some make up on that face to make yourself pretty. And it feels correct. In place. Natural.


And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.
        >And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.

For it needs no explanation; it is a universal human experience.
        Blahaj is for everyone.
    It’s generally seen to be something you’re born with, and you discover at any given point in your life. It’s like being gay - you already were, but eventually figure out.

Not necessarily. If you’re grossed out by a notion of a woman being trans, then possibly so, but if you don’t find a trans woman attractive because she’s not pretty then that’s fine.

You usually can’t tell the difference, but the difference is that trans women weren’t “born women.” As in, when they were born, the doctor didn’t look and go “you have a daughter!”
        I always keep seeing that “Trans women are women”. So what’s the difference?   If Trans women are women then why call them “trans women” in the first place? That I don’t get. And going back to how can one tell the difference between a regular women and a trans women. It’s hard for me to tell and understand the actual difference. If trans women are just women why have a “category” for them?
            Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
                So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
                    ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
                        I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                            I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
                    All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
                    Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
            If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
            The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
        [removed]
            Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
    It's good of you to ask and learn! 

> How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

To further clarify on what others have said, "cis women" is the term, rather than "regular women". Cis means they identify as whichever sex they were born as, while trans means that they don't. Trans typically means transitioning to the opposite gender, but it can also refer to those who don't really identify as either gender, identify as both genders, etc. The way we identify and present can get complicated, especially when people are dissatisfied and experimenting.
    I know this is a bit old buuuuut let me (a trans girl) help you out.

>Is being trans a choice?
God I wish it was. The thing is is it’s the same with being gay, bi, straight, whatever you can’t choose to be trans.

>Can it happen any time?
Yes and no. Some people realize when they are trans eventually. Some people are late bloomers and realize late in life and others realize it when they are very young.

>Is it transphobic to not want to date a trans woman?
Ok so here is the thing if the reason why you don’t like them is that they are trans, then yes. But if it’s another factor like their personality or something else that is about their character then no.

>How do you tell the difference between a “regular” woman and a trans woman.
It’s not as simple as pointing to one area and it being a trans woman only thing. Estrogen (the hormone responsible for women being women) changes the body of whoever it comes into contact with, that also comes with changes to the body and (sometimes) the voice. Usually the big things that are noticeable in trans women is their voices and their demeanor. Usually trans women (and men) are more self aware of their voices and body then other people causing them to be more secluded. 
Now does that give you the right to ask someone if they are trans if they have these traits? 
Hell no, being trans (especially now) is a very vulnerable thing and some people want to keep it to themselves. And if someone tells you their trans then for the most part keep that to yourself and let them come out to other people. And when living your day to day life with them call them their preferred name and pronouns.

Hope this helped

        No way it’s transphobic to not like someone who’s trans, I don’t want to fuck someone who has a dick. Of course I’m going to think that anyone with a dick is unattractive, that’s how I feel
            For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
            I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
            Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
            Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
    Does not being attracted to a black woman make you racist? That is basically what you are asking.
    It's not transphobic to not be attracted to trans women, but it is rude if your *only* reason to not date a trans woman is because she isn't cis. Not transphobic, just kinda rude.
As someone who is pan and identified a decent amount of time ago. I'm really out of touch due to the evolving state of sexualities. Im not sure if im allowed to call myself pan or if there is something better that describes me.
    Labels are just a way to put a name to what you feel, use the one that fits you better, you don't need software updates or anything lmao
        Thank you, i appreciate that a lot
    All-sexual aka "I don't discriminate, only penetrate"
        Thats my favourite sentence i've seen since a year and i will treasure it.
    Just define yourself however you feel is appropriate mate
    Pan is fine because it's all inclusive :D 

I use bi as shorthand but pan describes me too
Don't bother trying to learn mate. All of this is seeped with insecurity and drama.

How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow? Would you act the same way you already do, would you feel the same, would you be comfortable having boobs, no dick, etc? For the rest of your life? You probably don't think about it much but you're probably comfortable with your body and how you're presenting, right?

Trans people don't feel comfortable, they feel like they're the wrong sex mentally or physically. There's a lot of gender roles and expectations at play, too. If you're physically a huge hairy man people treat you much different and expect different things from you than from a woman.

I don't know if this helps or not. If it doesn't, that's fine.
    \>How would you feel if you woke up as a woman tomorrow?

&#x200B;

I hate this question so much. Turning a impossible hypothetical to compare to real peoples struggle is treating being trans as if its just a "oh, this is how I am now?" kind of thing.

to answer your question, I'd move on with my life. weather or not I like it I continue to do as I see fit. will it be weird? yea, but there isn't an alternative. If I become a woman then I'll have to just deal with it and adapt.

when I've answered this before I usually get snide comments about how I wouldn't be able to. well, what else would I do? cry until its fixed? not gunna happen.

and I do want to stress that this hypothetical is nothing compared to being trans, that much I at least know.
        It's not impossible though. It would be gradual but if you took estrogen now your body would change extremely.

People coming to realize that they're trans can also be very gradual.

You don't have to "cry until it's fixed" but you could transition. Or not, maybe you'd be totally comfortable living as a woman with all the expectations of being a woman, who knows?
Broadly speaking, there's sex (which is defined whether someone produce male or female gametes, though there is slight nuance to this since there are people who are hermaphrodites, but leaving them aside for simplicity). Then there is gender, which is archetypically defined as a set of traits one would associate with what females or males are perceived as, we take these archetypal traits for females to be what we call a 'woman' due to generally perceived social femininity traits, while for males what we call a 'man' due to generally perceived social masculine traits.

***TL;DR Here*** Someone is trans when they have feelings or behavior that is more in-line with what is socially perceived as the things done by said opposite sex. So if in your society most males do not wear skirts, and you're a male who wants to wear skirts because you wish to resemble and feel most comfortable looking like or behaving like the generalized female, that makes you a trans woman. Simply put your gender identity is that of being a woman. Your biological sex is still male (to deny this would be a false claim), but your gender (the thing that is ascribed by archetypal notions of what said sexes behave and feel like in society) is now that of a woman.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind this is why in some places, a man wearing a skirt-like clothing is seem as a feminine trait, while in other places a kilt (also  skirt like attire) is seen as masculine.

So what's a "trans person"? Well it's basically someone who has an amalgamation of a bunch of traits opposite to their biological sex, which we would consider opposite to. Lets say you live in a western nation, and wearing nail polish is something almost all females do, but rarely males. If your born a male, and don't consider yourself a woman (remember, male and female is the sex, and man and woman is the gender you take yourself to be due to fulfilling a mindset where you feel you satisfy enough traits of the archetypal notion of the opposite sex) then you are not necessarily a trans woman if for instance you like to wear nail polish as a male.

But given enough things.. Like imagine wearing nail polish, wearing high heels, feeling like you look like more of a female, have hair that's styled more the way females in your society typically style their hair, body shape more easily relatable to a female, etc... At some point when you satisfy enough of these sorts of traits opposite to what your sex usually identifies as, is when you become considered trans.

The current academic discourse over this whole ordeal is when does someone take someone to be trans actually? Is it enough to consider someone trans simply because they say the feel like the opposite of what their gender usually is for their biological sex, or do they have to demonstrate at least one facet beyond claiming they're trans as a declaration.

Like, if I as a male (biological sex), say I identify as a female (gender as thought of societally), but I can't demonstrate anything that makes this apparent, the trouble currently is that it may be seen as a delusion. But if said person explains perhaps they feel like they want to dress with the typical females and woman in society dress like, then that's one reason to believe me when I say I'm a trans woman.

Modern conservative/right-leaning folks can't understand, and many times flat out ignore what the distinction of gender, and biological sex is. They either think, or attempt to strawman people by saying there is no distinction even when the distinction is provided to them, and simply brute-force declare you're deluded if you think you're a female but are born a male (which is true, but trans people don't claim their biological sex is the opposite of what they were born with, they are simply telling people that they feel they are better represented because they have feelings/looks/behavior which we generally see common among the opposite sex). And that's what gender is.

If you also feel there is no difference between sex and gender, then to formally prove this as a sound idea, you're going to have to demonstrate a law of logic violation (so spell out what the contradiction is that trans people are making). Anyone that is unable to do this, can't formally and logically claim there is no difference between sex and gender.
Why did I not listen you. I listened to Bridget's new theme and saw the people who didn't like the change (but at least they had way less likes than the people explaining that Bridget is trans).
I mean, Bridget may be a girl now, but it's not like her entire biological body suddenly changed.

Artist draws her the way she looks and the way she is: a cute (now mtf) girl.
    Most of the people that like Bridget art disagree though
    I mean, with all the magic shit in GG, who's to say she didn't just ring up Faust for a magic transition surgery?
I've seen the video, that's not what I took away from stage 8 flawless and stage 9 win

He seems to not really directly acknowledge it

I took it as "true self" as dropping the femboy aspect used to confuse others into thinking he's a woman and living as how he wanted to live for so long: like the guy he was born as but pushed away from being
    She's always been pretty open about being a boy prior. In Strive the lines where she admits to being a boy she sounds really dejected now while the "I'm a girl!" line is really positive and comes after she's already told Goldlewis she's a boy before. I take that as trans, though I won't say your interpretation is wrong. It could be.
        I feel as though the true ending of arcade mode isn't as on the nose as the other endings by design, whether or not Bridget had said anything about him potentially leaning towards female would have culminated in something more direct. However, a flawless run has bridget be more confident in who he is.

When bridget got his ass beat in arcade, he seems like he's just kinda given in and that him being a girl is just what he's left with whereas in a flawless run, he seems confident and less wavering on what's bothering him (identity crisis)
        Have you heard the Japanese audio? She sounds pretty cool
I see your point, but if it goes against the character's previous identity and motivations at their very core, then I feel like they have to at least explain a bit. Bridget was a good feminine male icon who was forced into a situation that they, via their story, didn't want to be in. Bridget didn't WANT to be female, that was their whole thing and the reason they became a bounty hunter in the first place, but now they, with no explanation, want to go entirely against that with no prompting or development? Something generally has to happen for someone to do a complete 180 on their core values and motivations, something that I can see them making a decent explanation for if they do it right. To what your point was though, it could've happened "off screen" after heavy introspection, but without telling the viewer what happened it kinda just becomes making up your own canon.
    Were they trying to be manly because of their own sake or were they trying to be manly to prove their village wrong as external validation. They were raised a girl (or to present as one) purely for preservation reasons. Now independent they choose to identify as a girl separate from their village. Doesn't even sound like a 180. Kinda sounds like someone with a internal conflict trying to seek external validation and after time on their own and not caring about what others thought they made their own decision. Why is it seen as a loss instead of a character deciding their own identity?
        What I'm saying is that's one possible explanation, one that honestly did come to mind as a good way to address it, but it's not canon until it's explicitly addressed. For now, the canon change has no explanation. Also looking at it from a community standpoint, Bridget already represented a group that needed it and benefitted from having an icon in the games to identify with, crossdressers. If it's explicitly addressed story-wise, then fine, but until it is then it just feels forced instead of making a new, well-written trans character.
            It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
            Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
                I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.

Twitter is even worse. No one has a good argument, it’s just “you’re transphobic + ratio”
    Bet you $100 most of the people disliking it don't even know the backstory. I'm all for trans characters when they're well written, this is the polar opposite of that.
        so glad we have the loving all knowing cis to be the ultimate arbiters on what makes a good trans character
            As if the trans community doesn't call basically every femboy trans
            I mean, I'm pretty sure someone being groomed into being trans is a bad trans character. Sends a really toxic message for the community, but feel free to correct me and say that's exactly what you want the message trans characters send to be.

As much sense as this makes, it still sends a bit of a strange message. It kind of feels like "parents know best". 

The fact that this mostly comes forward in the form of Arcade mode storytelling also hits in a weird way, because it's almost like there's no actual progress, if that makes sense. Like Bridget is still conflicted about her identity despite her initial affirmation.   
Ky exemplifies this in a weird way as well, because his comparison is about him turning into a Gear, which is something he has no control over, and assuring Bridget his heart remains the same. But Bridget deciding her identity IS something she has control over, however scary the perception of others would be.   
I.E. Ky doesn't have a choice, but Bridget does.
    well, in this case, her closest loved ones kept telling her "you're a boy". so yeah, Bridget is still coming to realize "i get to choose". The fear comes from the other parts; Ky says "even if i become a gear, i'll still be me" to correlate to Bridget's "if i come out, i might lose what i have now". Ky's telling her that what decision she'll make, she'll still get to be her, and find what happiness she can. they're analogous.
in this behemoth typhoon, goldlewis supports the trans community
    In this behemoth typhoon, trans rights are human rights
        I should hope that's true for every behemoth typhoon!
            Every Typhoon has a different purpose, he breaks that one out when he needs to. Just in case some chuds forget
Having seen this in other spaces, it's perhaps the best way for it to work out as a meme. Kor's joy is there and that's all we need.

Guilty Gear was always very subversive
    i thought that said submissive
This does put us in the amusing position where using a pronoun for her is kind of a spoiler.
    Here's a handy tool to use for that ( ´・ω・\`)つ\[they/them\]
        But I want to affirm the nice lady! :(
            You, yeah you. That comment made me nearly tear up. What an awesome person you are. Hell yeah, supportive affirmation!  🤘🏿
Right? Guilty Gear has two trans characters now, which is two more than what I'm used to in like, anything. I'm trans and starved for good trans characters, and while representation isn't the only deciding factor on if I find something enjoyable it's just nice that a character gets to have a similar moment of self discovery with their gender and not have it be treated like it's weird. The fact that she's in a fighting game that's sick as hell and uses yo-yos is icing on the cake.
    I'm a cishet white dude, and I'm psyched on the trans representation for this reason. I can't imagine going through life where you are either invisible in every piece of media or portrayed as a monster like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. I want my trans comrades to feel safer and more accepted. So whenever I see anyone doing a transphobia, I aggressively bully them. I've got your back friend.
        Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
        Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
    Uhh who is the second one?
        Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
            nonbinary =/= trans
                It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
                Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
                    Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                        I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                        Then you haven't been around trans people.
                it literally does, dude
                Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
            Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
                honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
                No??????
Theres a picture of bridget the creator drew in like 2019 that says "trans rights!" At the top. Guilty gear has always been for the gays 😩
    do you have a link, I would like to see that
        https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkpartyqq/status/1556508738780946432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1556508738780946432%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b27cfc2adccee88694a34fd3efd680bf5d51e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamerbraves.com%2Fguilty-gear-strive-confirms-that-bridget-is-indeed-trans%2F

I may be mixing up events since the picture is actually from this year, but he did say trans rights in 2019, probably in an interview
            They did say they got the drawing a few years ago
                Oh shit then maybe I'm double lying lmfao
I love character development
    Right? And this isn't some random shit, this is character development that completely makes sense considering the character's history.
Why do they have to be an ally? Just because they make a character gay, trans, bi, asexual, etc.. doesn't mean they have to be your ally, it's just how these characters have been written, they don't have to belong to a community of their same gender identity just because you want them to do so.
Then why did she still wear feminine clothes after leaving?

No one in the village would see her
    Because word would travel????

The whole point is Bridget leaving the village to gain a reputation as a successful bounty hunter and proving the superstition of the village false. Until Bridget achieves that goal they can't change their appearance. Their parents are still in the village and they are doing it out of love/protecting them.
        She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.
             (◔_◔)
We all excuse it. I just grew my nails out because I liked to tap them on stuff. I painted them because keratin is a gross yellow. "I only grew my hair out because I couldn't get it cut." "I'm not trans, I'm just not like the others." Eventually they believe it could be a possibility, and it's so insanely possible, so grossly consistent that it can't be impossible. Not everyone is an egg, but there's an excuse for every euphoric choice.
    Makes me think of how I'm always painting my nails because I want to see my favourite colour more often.

Yeah I wasn't aware of the arcade other endings until just recently.

The interpretation I got was that, at least, Bridget wants to explore their gender. Specifically these lines from the fawless run stage 8 and 9ending:

Bridget: Wow, what limitless power you have!

Ky: You flatter me, but I owe my power to the strength of Gears.

Bridget: Were you afraid about coming out about Gears?

Ky: No, I wasn't afraid, I didn't want to lie to myself or my family, that's all.

Bridget: I wish I could be like you.

(another battle with Dragon Install ky)

Ky: Have I convinced you yet? No matter what others think, I will not change. Not even if this body turns to gear.

Bridget: No matter what others think, huh? I admit that still scares me a little, But I want to live as my true self, at least that's how I feel after having watched you.

Then Ky invites Bridget to see his family (specifically Dizzy since they're friends) and Bridget says thanks.

GGST World lore in-game calls Bridget a she, her Starter Guide never mentions he/her pronouns (despite I-no, Sol, Goldlewis, Jack-O, Happy Chaos and Baiken all having he/her used. Testament's doesn't use any he/her and I didn't check other starter guides)... it seems a bit obvious either A: The english localization is mistaken/intentionally divergent or B: This is the intended interpretation. One of those two things.
~~It's been pretty firmly supported in their official Youtube in the stickied comment: https://youtu.be/1mJZR9MpIL8 They don't appear to be interested in the "Oh, she only comes out as trans in this one route" approach.~~

EDIT: I actually have to apologize, because despite the name it is pretty clear that channel is _not_ the official Guilty Gear channel. They're impersonating the main company.
She mentions coming out to her village in the Flawless ending
This is simply the only way Pot mains know how to communicate, the only way in which we can express our love and welcoming to all peoples of every religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or other specifying feature is to gently take them up in our hands, fly them with love and grace into the heavens, *then shatter their bones to dust*.

    not to be pedantic, but “sexuality refers to whom one experienced sexual attraction” and “i am sexually attracted neither to men nor to women”

grammar is epic 👍🏼
        If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
        Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.

Star Trek has been incredibly based since the beginning.

Literally William Shatner and Nichel Nichols had the first interracial kiss on television.  When there were threats to pull the kiss from the episode Shatner (and other cast members) said they'd quit if it wasn't kept in.

Also Star Trek has been doing LGBT things forever.  TNG had an episode about a whole race of non-binary people (although it was a weird Riker-trys-to-bang-something episode.  The worm symbiote/trill thing was literally just a trans episode in 1993.  Polyamorous.  Very obvious gay/lesbian couples.

Like Star Trek gave no fucks

You aren't a fighting game without a sprinkling of retcons.
    Yeah but like. They could just leave if the place they live in insists they have to *murder* one of their babies if they both are male. They probably own five other homes where the villagers don't say to do that.

If they were poor villagers the story works fine, especially since Bridget proves herself to the village by making a lot of money to send back home, but making them billionaires is just ???????
        We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
My point exactly.  
Had Bridget embraced being a femboy or perhaps made a metamorphosis to a tomboy or even a super metrosexual jojo character, noone would bat an eye. Trans just feels like a weird retcon.   
Not that I really care in the end, I find yo Bridget totes adorbs.
    trans girls fighting to be seen as men and wanting desperately to fit in as men and then completely turning a 180 when they realise they're trans is like THE trans girl timeline.
    You seem to be misunderstanding me. Bridget's trans story works, she decides to live as a girl after thinking on it away from home after living as a boy became available to her. She thought that's what she wanted and when it didn't make her happy, she thought about it outside of the context of her village where her gender has always been a loaded question. Decides to openly and willfully live as a girl and see how it goes, badabing trans rights.

The weird retcon is her parents being billionaires which doesn't feel like it makes sense with the "social pressure to kill your baby in a village" and "Bridget sends money back home which gains respect for her" aspect of her backstory.
        I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
        I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
because the writing is really fucking dumb
Tbh, i was extremely worried about how they might handle the character in this game. There wasnt a ton of lore on bridgets backstory, but it felt a lot like an uncomfortable trope from 20 years ago. I think they could have gone several directions, but proud femboy or trans girl are the only two that would go over well. "Being true to yourself" is a very common theme in guilty gear, its not like its out of left field or anything. Also i wouldnt say its a retcon: bridget grew to accept herself. Denial/repression is a bitch. If bridget was fighting to be more manly to live up to expectations in the previous game, coming to terms with her identity as trans is a completely natural progression of that in my experience. Its letting go of those expectations to move forward for yourself, realizing what you actually want. And thats exactly the story they told. Its fair if it feels forced to you, but it feels very organic to me.
    I suppose I can see why they found the retcon necessary; there's little ways the original backstory could have gone and made it look like she's her own free person, so might as well scrap that part and go for a purer identity.  
Still, F for the femboys.
        Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
            I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
                Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
Fighting to be seen as a manly man before your transition is one of the most naturally trans things possible. The story beat resonates so strongly with so many of us *because* that's our lived experience. No "indication" would ever be good enough for people complaining it's a retcon with no justification, short of Bridget's "I'm a boy!" intros in XX being followed by her mugging the camera and saying "but in 6 years, I'll be a girl!"

There is an ocean of difference between "retcon" and "character development."
How you gonna have a natural progression with a six year time skip
I masturbate to porn. How that even works is beyond me.
they were all in harmony until the annoying virgins attacked
"woke changing" yeah just cope dumbass, femboys transition all the time, why don't you go play fate that has literally the single most famous femboy of all the whole complaining about how there's no femboys
Yuuuuuuup, it's actually a bad representation for the trans community too if they don't tread carefully and really drive home that it was Bridget and Bridget alone's motivation. Even then, still runs into the idea of grooming type motivations. There's a lot of people who think the same as us on this one, so you've got support bud!
    Definitely a creepy can of worms. Which i pray to god the devs realize how disturbing they have made their lore with this sudden drop
The whole reason Bridget became a bounty hunter was to fight powerful foes to prove how manly they are. That's literally in the early games.
Absolutely; I’m also trying to test the waters a little since I’m sure that there’s an amount of people who are genuinely hurting a little, and not leading people on.

I’m not gonna deny that this is an imperfect solution to the problem, but it’s a more productive thing to do beyond mourning, and the faster we move on, the sooner we get back to being toxic about game balance and not real world issues.
I still wouldn’t know much, but Amane from BlazBlue is just across the street.
    Imma be honest, i hate the face they gave amane 🤣
        Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
            Lol ya its so not a good look
I already did my homework more or less, right here. If we go strictly by canon, Felix has been claimed by the author as a guy. That said, if you have an actual source that points to Astolfo being non-binary, go for it. Who knows, maybe my five second wiki search isn’t complete.
    felix is said to be a closeted trans girl in a WN side story, idk as much about astolfo but i've heard that it's implied that they are non-binary
        [some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
        That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
I did some digging, and Ferris is. Complicated. Going by author interviews and some other parts of the original works, Ferris isn’t trans fem, but there’s a small group from years ago who would gladly look past that given other parts of the light novels. I am not going to drag myself through headcanons in the name of rep.

Also, I’ve actually seen some NBs take up the mantle of femboy if you can believe it. I’m not going to examine Astolfo too closely to double-check if you’re correct about that, but I’ll gladly take calling Astolfo a femboy in stride.

Edit: Astolfo is *also* canonically just a guy. He’s bisexual for what it’s worth.
Femboys transition all the time lol. There's no reason Bridgette can't. It's like getting upset at your favorite character for having characters progression. We aren't even sure if she transitioned or prefers she/her pronouns. Get over it
    I have nothing against character progression.

I have EVERYTHING against sloppily written character progression that leaves the audience (a good amount of them, anyhow) out in the cold, and undoing previously established lore.

I've said it before in another comment, but this is the same issue that I had with Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy: they repurposed the character to serve a slightly different purpose than their original, and expect the audience to take this "change" at face value, despite any previous characterization they may have had that contradicts the current characterization.
        Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
            > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
                My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
                    >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                        But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.
            [deleted]
                When did I say all? Stop projecting. The character chose to be called a girl. She LABELED herself. You're being a moron.

Are cross dressers and femboys not doing it voluntarily??
Ok ya even imma say wtf about them 🤣
Real shit.  Androgyny is hot, dependency on titles is a whole separate deal and this mandatory labeling of all femboys/tomboys as the opposite gender is ironic AF.
    And even ignoring that, I’d say it’s at least fun on some level. I’m never going on OnlyFans. I’m never going out in public like that. Unless I get incredibly lucky, crossdressing to me is going to scratch the itch between cosplay and character creators and nothing else, and that’s okay.
    No, no it isnt. Im a femboy, a male only. Ill never be trans. And all this has done is insult an entire community in the lgbt
        I think we're agreeing?
        I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
            It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
My bad, sorry
Femboy transgirl, a fresh new gender adjacent to tomboy malewife
are you ok?
She said she's a girl so she's a girl :)
🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
It's not forced at all though, did you not read my comment?
    I did, and it’s not untrue. Bridget’s story in their debut was finding the meaning of ‘manliness’ and that it wasn’t what society’s expectations of manliness was, it was something you decided for yourself. That you are not a girl (at the time they were a feminine male) for being feminine in clothing and demeanour, you are just as much of a man as any other guy is. 

Now some feel that Bridget’s total transition into identifying as female treads backwards on their whole gender-non-conforming-male arc by going ‘yes actually they were female the whole time, the village was right about the superstition after all’. 

If Guilty Gear wanted trans representation, which is still great mind you, just _make a whole new character._ It’d be even better if they were developed early so their transition could be properly depicted in story mode cutscene glory or something. 

Point is, trans rep is great, sure. But there is no need to seemingly overwrite already existing GNC representation (feminine men, who related to pre-change Bridget), just to have another (trans women). We can have _both._ 

This especially irks me since as you would know, there’s an ongoing issue with trans women being purposefully mislabeled as just ‘femboys’, and it’s true the other way around too. And I’ve seen some people who also have in issue with this writing be written off as transphobes when having valid critique. But anyway, to not go too far off on a tangent, that’s how I feel about the whole thing.
I really love that people think the character who has had a conflicting gender identity her whole existence being trans is like the most illogical curveball that makes no sense. The arc makes perfect sense, it's not forced, it's not pandering, cope
    There was no conflicting gender identity. Bridget was a male. Bridget identified as a male. Due to circumstances, Bridget dressed as a female, and one does not have to be trans to crossdress. There was no indication at all, through 20 years, that Bridget questioned her gender identity. Spontaneously deciding she is trans now is either bad writing or pandering. I don't really care which; either way my initial point stands.
...Why did you feel the need to add that? That's not what their question was about.
    Honestly? I've heard to many people say dumb things about this and I'm just half ranting. Apologies.
        Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.

> Is it something you’re born with?

Possibly

>Can it happen at any time?

Possibly not.

>Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women?

It depends really. If she has a dick, I am just not into that...most of the time. 


>How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

Taste on video games. Or sometimes you don't and it doesn't matter.


Ok, let me try to explain it.

You were born a boy, correct? You might be a woman, I will edit the explanation later if I need to.

You are born and since you become old enough to have a sense of self, you always view yourself as the gender you are born. As you grow older you view yourself as a man. You get enjoyment of doing stuff that you view as being part of being a man. You may have doubts that the way you look, the way you act, the things you like aren't considered manly enough by your standards. So you change that, and get a nice feeling seeing the improvement on your body you did in the gym. Having clothes that make you look at the mirror and say "Behold! A man!"


And even if you didn't do all this and get euphoric about it, you will not stop viewing yourself as a man.

Even if I took your brain and put it in a robot's body, you will still look at yourself and see a man.


Because your mind tells you this is your gender. This is how you are comfortable. This is part of you, and you deserve to enjoy it.


Now...imagine you didn't. Every time you look at the mirror you feel like there is something wrong with your face. Your body. Your clothes. Even if you try to improve it and become closer to what you consider a man, it just doesn't work for you.

Because your mind is interpreting it as wrong. Your mind thing you should be a girl.

And so you carve your body more femininely, you put on your skirt, you put some make up on that face to make yourself pretty. And it feels correct. In place. Natural.


And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.
    >And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.

For it needs no explanation; it is a universal human experience.
    Blahaj is for everyone.
It’s generally seen to be something you’re born with, and you discover at any given point in your life. It’s like being gay - you already were, but eventually figure out.

Not necessarily. If you’re grossed out by a notion of a woman being trans, then possibly so, but if you don’t find a trans woman attractive because she’s not pretty then that’s fine.

You usually can’t tell the difference, but the difference is that trans women weren’t “born women.” As in, when they were born, the doctor didn’t look and go “you have a daughter!”
    I always keep seeing that “Trans women are women”. So what’s the difference?   If Trans women are women then why call them “trans women” in the first place? That I don’t get. And going back to how can one tell the difference between a regular women and a trans women. It’s hard for me to tell and understand the actual difference. If trans women are just women why have a “category” for them?
        Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
            So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
                ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
                    I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                        I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
                All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
                Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
        If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
        The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
    [removed]
        Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
It's good of you to ask and learn! 

> How does someone tell the difference between regular women and trans women?

To further clarify on what others have said, "cis women" is the term, rather than "regular women". Cis means they identify as whichever sex they were born as, while trans means that they don't. Trans typically means transitioning to the opposite gender, but it can also refer to those who don't really identify as either gender, identify as both genders, etc. The way we identify and present can get complicated, especially when people are dissatisfied and experimenting.
I know this is a bit old buuuuut let me (a trans girl) help you out.

>Is being trans a choice?
God I wish it was. The thing is is it’s the same with being gay, bi, straight, whatever you can’t choose to be trans.

>Can it happen any time?
Yes and no. Some people realize when they are trans eventually. Some people are late bloomers and realize late in life and others realize it when they are very young.

>Is it transphobic to not want to date a trans woman?
Ok so here is the thing if the reason why you don’t like them is that they are trans, then yes. But if it’s another factor like their personality or something else that is about their character then no.

>How do you tell the difference between a “regular” woman and a trans woman.
It’s not as simple as pointing to one area and it being a trans woman only thing. Estrogen (the hormone responsible for women being women) changes the body of whoever it comes into contact with, that also comes with changes to the body and (sometimes) the voice. Usually the big things that are noticeable in trans women is their voices and their demeanor. Usually trans women (and men) are more self aware of their voices and body then other people causing them to be more secluded. 
Now does that give you the right to ask someone if they are trans if they have these traits? 
Hell no, being trans (especially now) is a very vulnerable thing and some people want to keep it to themselves. And if someone tells you their trans then for the most part keep that to yourself and let them come out to other people. And when living your day to day life with them call them their preferred name and pronouns.

Hope this helped

    No way it’s transphobic to not like someone who’s trans, I don’t want to fuck someone who has a dick. Of course I’m going to think that anyone with a dick is unattractive, that’s how I feel
        For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
        I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
        Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
        Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
Does not being attracted to a black woman make you racist? That is basically what you are asking.
It's not transphobic to not be attracted to trans women, but it is rude if your *only* reason to not date a trans woman is because she isn't cis. Not transphobic, just kinda rude.
Labels are just a way to put a name to what you feel, use the one that fits you better, you don't need software updates or anything lmao
    Thank you, i appreciate that a lot

&#x200B;

I hate this question so much. Turning a impossible hypothetical to compare to real peoples struggle is treating being trans as if its just a "oh, this is how I am now?" kind of thing.

to answer your question, I'd move on with my life. weather or not I like it I continue to do as I see fit. will it be weird? yea, but there isn't an alternative. If I become a woman then I'll have to just deal with it and adapt.

when I've answered this before I usually get snide comments about how I wouldn't be able to. well, what else would I do? cry until its fixed? not gunna happen.

and I do want to stress that this hypothetical is nothing compared to being trans, that much I at least know.
    It's not impossible though. It would be gradual but if you took estrogen now your body would change extremely.

People coming to realize that they're trans can also be very gradual.

You don't have to "cry until it's fixed" but you could transition. Or not, maybe you'd be totally comfortable living as a woman with all the expectations of being a woman, who knows?
Most of the people that like Bridget art disagree though
I mean, with all the magic shit in GG, who's to say she didn't just ring up Faust for a magic transition surgery?
She's always been pretty open about being a boy prior. In Strive the lines where she admits to being a boy she sounds really dejected now while the "I'm a girl!" line is really positive and comes after she's already told Goldlewis she's a boy before. I take that as trans, though I won't say your interpretation is wrong. It could be.
    I feel as though the true ending of arcade mode isn't as on the nose as the other endings by design, whether or not Bridget had said anything about him potentially leaning towards female would have culminated in something more direct. However, a flawless run has bridget be more confident in who he is.

When bridget got his ass beat in arcade, he seems like he's just kinda given in and that him being a girl is just what he's left with whereas in a flawless run, he seems confident and less wavering on what's bothering him (identity crisis)
    Have you heard the Japanese audio? She sounds pretty cool
Were they trying to be manly because of their own sake or were they trying to be manly to prove their village wrong as external validation. They were raised a girl (or to present as one) purely for preservation reasons. Now independent they choose to identify as a girl separate from their village. Doesn't even sound like a 180. Kinda sounds like someone with a internal conflict trying to seek external validation and after time on their own and not caring about what others thought they made their own decision. Why is it seen as a loss instead of a character deciding their own identity?
    What I'm saying is that's one possible explanation, one that honestly did come to mind as a good way to address it, but it's not canon until it's explicitly addressed. For now, the canon change has no explanation. Also looking at it from a community standpoint, Bridget already represented a group that needed it and benefitted from having an icon in the games to identify with, crossdressers. If it's explicitly addressed story-wise, then fine, but until it is then it just feels forced instead of making a new, well-written trans character.
        It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
        Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
            I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.

Bet you $100 most of the people disliking it don't even know the backstory. I'm all for trans characters when they're well written, this is the polar opposite of that.
    so glad we have the loving all knowing cis to be the ultimate arbiters on what makes a good trans character
        As if the trans community doesn't call basically every femboy trans
        I mean, I'm pretty sure someone being groomed into being trans is a bad trans character. Sends a really toxic message for the community, but feel free to correct me and say that's exactly what you want the message trans characters send to be.
So true. They just scream and call you names

well, in this case, her closest loved ones kept telling her "you're a boy". so yeah, Bridget is still coming to realize "i get to choose". The fear comes from the other parts; Ky says "even if i become a gear, i'll still be me" to correlate to Bridget's "if i come out, i might lose what i have now". Ky's telling her that what decision she'll make, she'll still get to be her, and find what happiness she can. they're analogous.

I'm a cishet white dude, and I'm psyched on the trans representation for this reason. I can't imagine going through life where you are either invisible in every piece of media or portrayed as a monster like Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs. I want my trans comrades to feel safer and more accepted. So whenever I see anyone doing a transphobia, I aggressively bully them. I've got your back friend.
    Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
    Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
Uhh who is the second one?
    Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
        nonbinary =/= trans
            It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
            Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
                Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                    I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                    Then you haven't been around trans people.
            it literally does, dude
            Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
        Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
            honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
            No??????

Right? And this isn't some random shit, this is character development that completely makes sense considering the character's history.
Because word would travel????

The whole point is Bridget leaving the village to gain a reputation as a successful bounty hunter and proving the superstition of the village false. Until Bridget achieves that goal they can't change their appearance. Their parents are still in the village and they are doing it out of love/protecting them.
    She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.

not to be pedantic, but “sexuality refers to whom one experienced sexual attraction” and “i am sexually attracted neither to men nor to women”

grammar is epic 👍🏼
    If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
    Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.
        for the sake of efficiently hammering this concept home, [here is a link to a study guide on keeping your conjunctions in a consistent syntax](https://study.com/academy/lesson/neither-nor-meaning-rule-examples.html).
        you clearly skipped primary school english my friend
“He was more than a hero, he was a union man”-Miles O’Brien
Yeah but like. They could just leave if the place they live in insists they have to *murder* one of their babies if they both are male. They probably own five other homes where the villagers don't say to do that.

If they were poor villagers the story works fine, especially since Bridget proves herself to the village by making a lot of money to send back home, but making them billionaires is just ???????
    We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
trans girls fighting to be seen as men and wanting desperately to fit in as men and then completely turning a 180 when they realise they're trans is like THE trans girl timeline.
You seem to be misunderstanding me. Bridget's trans story works, she decides to live as a girl after thinking on it away from home after living as a boy became available to her. She thought that's what she wanted and when it didn't make her happy, she thought about it outside of the context of her village where her gender has always been a loaded question. Decides to openly and willfully live as a girl and see how it goes, badabing trans rights.

The weird retcon is her parents being billionaires which doesn't feel like it makes sense with the "social pressure to kill your baby in a village" and "Bridget sends money back home which gains respect for her" aspect of her backstory.
    I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
    I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
I suppose I can see why they found the retcon necessary; there's little ways the original backstory could have gone and made it look like she's her own free person, so might as well scrap that part and go for a purer identity.  
Still, F for the femboys.
    Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
        I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
            Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
Definitely a creepy can of worms. Which i pray to god the devs realize how disturbing they have made their lore with this sudden drop
Imma be honest, i hate the face they gave amane 🤣
    Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
        Lol ya its so not a good look
felix is said to be a closeted trans girl in a WN side story, idk as much about astolfo but i've heard that it's implied that they are non-binary
    [some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
    That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
I have nothing against character progression.

I have EVERYTHING against sloppily written character progression that leaves the audience (a good amount of them, anyhow) out in the cold, and undoing previously established lore.

I've said it before in another comment, but this is the same issue that I had with Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy: they repurposed the character to serve a slightly different purpose than their original, and expect the audience to take this "change" at face value, despite any previous characterization they may have had that contradicts the current characterization.
    Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
        > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
            My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
                >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                    But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.
        [deleted]
            When did I say all? Stop projecting. The character chose to be called a girl. She LABELED herself. You're being a moron.
And even ignoring that, I’d say it’s at least fun on some level. I’m never going on OnlyFans. I’m never going out in public like that. Unless I get incredibly lucky, crossdressing to me is going to scratch the itch between cosplay and character creators and nothing else, and that’s okay.
No, no it isnt. Im a femboy, a male only. Ill never be trans. And all this has done is insult an entire community in the lgbt
    I think we're agreeing?
    I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
        It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
I did, and it’s not untrue. Bridget’s story in their debut was finding the meaning of ‘manliness’ and that it wasn’t what society’s expectations of manliness was, it was something you decided for yourself. That you are not a girl (at the time they were a feminine male) for being feminine in clothing and demeanour, you are just as much of a man as any other guy is. 

Now some feel that Bridget’s total transition into identifying as female treads backwards on their whole gender-non-conforming-male arc by going ‘yes actually they were female the whole time, the village was right about the superstition after all’. 

If Guilty Gear wanted trans representation, which is still great mind you, just _make a whole new character._ It’d be even better if they were developed early so their transition could be properly depicted in story mode cutscene glory or something. 

Point is, trans rep is great, sure. But there is no need to seemingly overwrite already existing GNC representation (feminine men, who related to pre-change Bridget), just to have another (trans women). We can have _both._ 

This especially irks me since as you would know, there’s an ongoing issue with trans women being purposefully mislabeled as just ‘femboys’, and it’s true the other way around too. And I’ve seen some people who also have in issue with this writing be written off as transphobes when having valid critique. But anyway, to not go too far off on a tangent, that’s how I feel about the whole thing.
There was no conflicting gender identity. Bridget was a male. Bridget identified as a male. Due to circumstances, Bridget dressed as a female, and one does not have to be trans to crossdress. There was no indication at all, through 20 years, that Bridget questioned her gender identity. Spontaneously deciding she is trans now is either bad writing or pandering. I don't really care which; either way my initial point stands.
Honestly? I've heard to many people say dumb things about this and I'm just half ranting. Apologies.
    Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.

>And then Fallout New Vegas becomes your favorite game ever, and you buy yourself a plush shark from Ikea. This part, I cannot explain.

For it needs no explanation; it is a universal human experience.
Blahaj is for everyone.
I always keep seeing that “Trans women are women”. So what’s the difference?   If Trans women are women then why call them “trans women” in the first place? That I don’t get. And going back to how can one tell the difference between a regular women and a trans women. It’s hard for me to tell and understand the actual difference. If trans women are just women why have a “category” for them?
    Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
        So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
            ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
                I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                    I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
            All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
            Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
    If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
    The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
[removed]
    Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
No way it’s transphobic to not like someone who’s trans, I don’t want to fuck someone who has a dick. Of course I’m going to think that anyone with a dick is unattractive, that’s how I feel
    For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
    I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
    Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
    Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
Thank you, i appreciate that a lot
Thats my favourite sentence i've seen since a year and i will treasure it.
It's not impossible though. It would be gradual but if you took estrogen now your body would change extremely.

People coming to realize that they're trans can also be very gradual.

You don't have to "cry until it's fixed" but you could transition. Or not, maybe you'd be totally comfortable living as a woman with all the expectations of being a woman, who knows?
I feel as though the true ending of arcade mode isn't as on the nose as the other endings by design, whether or not Bridget had said anything about him potentially leaning towards female would have culminated in something more direct. However, a flawless run has bridget be more confident in who he is.

When bridget got his ass beat in arcade, he seems like he's just kinda given in and that him being a girl is just what he's left with whereas in a flawless run, he seems confident and less wavering on what's bothering him (identity crisis)
Have you heard the Japanese audio? She sounds pretty cool
What I'm saying is that's one possible explanation, one that honestly did come to mind as a good way to address it, but it's not canon until it's explicitly addressed. For now, the canon change has no explanation. Also looking at it from a community standpoint, Bridget already represented a group that needed it and benefitted from having an icon in the games to identify with, crossdressers. If it's explicitly addressed story-wise, then fine, but until it is then it just feels forced instead of making a new, well-written trans character.
    It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
    Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
        I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.

    You, yeah you. That comment made me nearly tear up. What an awesome person you are. Hell yeah, supportive affirmation!  🤘🏿
Hey thanks, it's genuinely appreciated! I used to be really and not make a fuss about it, but now that we're the hot target for bigots at the moment I'm no longer afraid of being who I am. And I got your back too, comrade. The grass isn't exactly much greener for anyone who isn't uber wealthy, so we gotta do what's worked for us in the past: solidarity and not letting bigotry divide and weaken us.
Luckily, I never watched Silence of the Lambs, but what little I've seen had me horrified, both before and after I figured out I was a trans woman. It felt like an even worse version of the "queer relationships always end up with Bad Endings" trope that was so prevalent in media until relatively recently and it's hard to imagine or quantify the real damage it's done to trans women.
Testament is nonbinary, uses they/them
    nonbinary =/= trans
        It does though.

A nonbinary person identifies as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. They literally are transgender, as in, a different gender than the one they started as.
        Nonbinary IS trans. Being trans means you dont identify with the gender you were given at birth, nonbinary fits into this category
            Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
                I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
                Then you haven't been around trans people.
        it literally does, dude
        Yeah it does, literally. Nobody's assigned nonbinary at birth, as far as I know, so all nonbinary people are a gender that differs from the one they were assigned at birth. That is, by definition, trans.

Transgender does not necessarily mean binary transgender.
    Isn't testament just a guy who was turned in to a gear, therefore he thinks of himself as nonhuman? A man turned in to a "monster" doesn't really constitute nonbinary/trans.
        honestly, in Strive, Testament seems like one of the more human characters, at least in attitude.

Also, all of the gears we've met so far have used standard she/her he/him pronouns and were referred to as male/female

and to finish, you kinda missed the whole point of what being trans means, if you're saying someone's physical nature definess what they can identify as as an actual argument here.
        No??????

I may be mixing up events since the picture is actually from this year, but he did say trans rights in 2019, probably in an interview
    They did say they got the drawing a few years ago
        Oh shit then maybe I'm double lying lmfao
She Still called herself a girl tho.
Like literally.
Hence, she a girl.
     (◔_◔)
If I were editing this I would prefer "towards whom" for clarity. 

"... neither to x nor to y" is nearly as correct as "... to neither x nor y" to my ear. This usage is changing.
Correction: "attracted to neither men or women" or "attracted to men nor women".

It's "neither or" or "nor". You only use one. Combining them would be a double negation.

    you clearly skipped primary school english my friend
We already know we can't understand Daisuke's vision in the end
I guess what I meant was the parental pressure set expectations for Bridget to evolve in a different direction. But now that part is retconned, they can be shrugged off for the most part.
I think what they were going for is something like this... With rich families the stakes are different. Sure they can just move away, but rich families tend to care about Their Reputation, and how their children Reflects On Them. They can't just leave the village, they're a Pillar of the Community, and really, What Would People Think? This puts a different kind of pressure on Bridget once the threat of being killed by villagers goes away.

Also it explains where she got the high tech yoyo and murder teddy.
Right, the character had to decide for themselves for it to not be uncomfy. Trans was probably easier for them. But I really dont think its a retcon: her egg just cracked. The character grew and learned more about herself. I dont of anything that was *changed* about her backstory.
    I guess I tunneled on the original parental pressure/upbringing too much.
        Its definitely unusual to be assigned male at birth, raised as a girl socially, still feel pressure to *secretly* be a boy, and then decide to actually be a girl after all. Valid, but unusual. According to her new bio, she thought getting money would make her town accept her as a man, so there was pressure both ways.
Valid. I’m not a huge fan of the weird fox face he’s got going on.
    Lol ya its so not a good look
[some further research later]

Okay, that’s a bit more understandable. The apparent context is Felix having suppressed testosterone through prayer, which is certainly neat, and you can certainly read “male in body and soul” as excluding someone’s mind. What’s being described is *this close* to confirming things, and the leap from canon to fan canon is incredibly short.

And then the book continues to use he/him, and the author responds to an interview question putting his foot down on that.

If we are going by canon as written, like we are with Bridget, Felix isn’t trans. I don’t like it either.

Anyway, onto Astolfo’s deep dive! This mercifully took way less time, and while the folks who collected the evidence are kind of unsavory, they do have a solid point against Astolfo being non-binary. The supposed smoking gun that mentions him being confronted about crossdressing with “some binaries don’t work for me” reads in the original Japanese as “This is more convenient for me.” There’s also a hell of a lot more canonical nonbinary Fate characters who aren’t memed to death, so not writing him as such was probably very, very intentional.

And for the sake of completeness, on Bridget’s end, JP and EN voicelines keep the pronouns consistent across the reveals, and the last I heard, the worst you can say about JP’s description of Bridget in-game is that it has no pronouns, compared to EN’s inclusion of a “her”. It’s more or less kept consistent across releases.
That "LN side story" is used with not enough context

And astolfo is a male who likes surprising people that he's a guy (and that's why his sex is hidden)
about as femboy as you can
Buddy it's a fighting game lol. Bridgette obviously struggled with her sexuality and for many fem men this is the obvious next step. This is pretty in line with her previous arc. Just because a handful of femboys are upset about representation (which is ridiculous) doesn't mean the character doesn't get to transition.
    > Buddy, it's a fighting game

> Buddy, it's a movie about space wizards

This is the same dismissive argument that people lobby at fans who criticize the work when they can't defend the content. I've seen it before, and I see it here now.

And I disagree that this change is in-line with the previous arc of Bridget's story; in fact, I would argue that it is a capitulation to Bridget's hometown if anything. It also undoes all of the lessons about discovering ideas of "manliness" and what that is, and proving that being a boy isn't a bad thing.

Everyone seems to forget that Bridget had a personal stake in their journey to become more "manly", and that ought to be central to their character. It really feels like a step back for that character.
        My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition? Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
            >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
                But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.
    [deleted]
        When did I say all? Stop projecting. The character chose to be called a girl. She LABELED herself. You're being a moron.
I think we're agreeing?
I said it elsewhere, but I’ve seen non-binary peeps identity as femboys fairly regularly, so the label is basically down to feminine non-women at this point. Language changes.
    It was always that way. Before it was fetishized on the internet femboy was just an androgynous fashion trend for any gender aimed at looking "feminine and boyish", as opposed to literally a feminine boy
Fair, big ups to you for being honest. I'm a little sensitive myself, with the activity of the past couple of days, haha.

Let me give you some other examples:

Asian women. Tall women. Busty women. Young women.

All of these are women, but we put an adjective at the start to signify a property they all share. Trans women are a group that’s inside of the group “women,” which also includes short women, white women, fast women, etc.
    So let me rephrase my questions and hopefully others on this subreddit will see them too.

Is being trans a choice? Let’s say you’re born a guy but you identify as a girl. Does one decide to be a guy or “transition” into being a girl entirely? That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans? 

Is it transphobic to not be attractive to trans women. Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic? Cause I don’t want to come off rude or horrible. But I’m not going to lie to the trans women. Cause lying about my true sexual preferences will cause just as much problems. Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? I keep seeing people say “trans women are women” but how? What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?
        ...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
            I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
                I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
        All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
        Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill
If black women are women why cal them black? If American women are women why call them American? It just a subset of women. Some women are trans, some women are cis, all are still women

Edit: ur a weirdo stop sealioning
The same exact reason we have "cathegory" of black women, white women, smart women, strong women, etc. they are just adjectives that define a trait about them, they are still women.
Bro I figured out I was trans around the same time I figured out I was bi, before being trans was a commonly talked about topic when I was 12. 

Your definition of muddying the waters is scientists looking into a poorly understood field, you don't know shit, I don't know shit and neither do they, but I can guarantee you those scientists and professionals looking into it know a lot more than any of us do.
For some simple perspective. You have most likely seen a trans person and been physically attracted to them. The caricature conservatives have made of trans women isn't really a thing, not normally anyway. There are countless trans women who are models, even underwear models that no one can really "clock". They're eeeeverywhere and the vast majority will never know. Also not all trans women have the peener.
I mean, not all trans women *have* a dick. 

If you find someone unattractive because they have unappealing features, sure, that’s one thing. If you find them unattractive solely because they’re trans? There’s more to unpack there.
Thats something different, thats genital preferenc, which is something different. Nobody will force you to suck dick if you don't want to, and you are not transphobic for not wanting to. 

But there is no real way to know what genitals a trans woman has other than getting to know her ;-)
Having genital preferences is *fine*  
Personally I subscribe to "Any hole's a goal" but your sex life is your sex life
It definitely should have had a bit more clarity and explanation in the game, I agree.
Like literally in the story mode? Kinda sounds more like you're trying to argue for any reason why it's bad and wrong. Guess we can't know a character until we have a full monologue on the justification of all their thoughts, values and decisions. Making sure nothing is ever left without direct cause/effect explanation.
    I just have multiple problems with it that could end up being addressed and yes, in story mode. When someone has that level of a core development change, yes it should have some explanation, that's part of good writing. Without that, it's akin to fans accepting fan theories as part of the story for key character development points.

Let's flip it, I'd be annoyed if they took a long-standing and well-liked trans character who, in their established story, broke away from being forced to identify as a different gender, strongly showing the audience who they truly are, and suddenly made them cis gendered and crossdressing without providing some explanation.
As if the trans community doesn't call basically every femboy trans
I mean, I'm pretty sure someone being groomed into being trans is a bad trans character. Sends a really toxic message for the community, but feel free to correct me and say that's exactly what you want the message trans characters send to be.
Talking about the story of a character doesn’t equal being terminally online. Ratio

Tons of fem men go through this and end up transitioning so why is their story less important to tell? Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men?
    >My point is fighting games don't really have the time to explain every little thing to you. 

Then why include a backstory detail like this for a legacy character at all?

>So Bridgette should be more manly? What exactly is wrong with her deciding that she prefers her more feminine features and wanted to transition?

That's the entire point of Bridget's earlier character arc: that it is possible to still be a boy while wearing feminine clothes and doing feminine things. That you don't have to abide by societal expectations of what constitutes a "man", that's something you can decide for yourself.

Again, it's a step back in storytelling.

>Could it just be you're transphobic and hiding behind feigned care for feminine men? 

And there it is. You need to get off Twitter.
        But if she feels more in touch with her feminine side and wants to transition then she more than allowed to do so lol. You're upset that a fictional character decides what was best for her which is just as ridiculous as getting upset over a normal person deciding what was best for them. Idk dude the transphobia is looking pretty clear from here.
When did I say all? Stop projecting. The character chose to be called a girl. She LABELED herself. You're being a moron.
...I think you know quite a bit about trans people and are just pretending not to know.
    I’m not pretending I just want insurance.
        I'm not really buying that, but sure let's be optimistic here.

>  That’s what I mean by a choice? If being trans is something you’re born with, can you make the choice to NOT be trans?

Not really. If you have it you have it, and you can choose to either accept it or deny it. It's kind of like being gay, I suppose - You could *pretend* to not have it, but you'd just be unhappy. 

> Let’s say I’m on a date with a women and we have a grand old time but then she tells me she’s trans but I tell her I’m not attractive to trans women. Is that seriously transphobic?

Kinda, yeah. Here's the thing - if we're assuming that, in this hypothetical, the trans woman is otherwise indistinguishable from a cisgendered ("born a woman") woman, then yes it would be. If it's because she has a penis and you're not into that, then no that's totally fine, that's a preference.

> Now let’s say she doesn’t tell me she’s trans, how can I TELL she IS trans without her saying it too me? 

You can't. Any "distinction" you'd make would end up categorizing a lot of cisgendered women as "secretly men." Their height? Tall women would be pissed. Body hair? Hairier women would have a word with you. Testosterone levels? *[The olympic sprinters would like to disagree](https://theconversation.com/olympics-namibias-sprinters-highlight-a-flawed-testosterone-testing-system-165676).*

> What’s the difference between a regular woman & a trans women?

By regular I'm assuming you mean cisgendered, and I said so in the comment above.
All right I'm going to be as clear as I can here for all your questions

1) if a binary trans person "chooses" to not transition, it's very likely they'll suffer in the long run, as their mind and body will very likely yearn to function or present themselves as their proper gender, although sometimes a trans person will just feel more unhappy, those cases happen a lot with trans people who only find out later in life

2) if you're not attracted due to genitalia, that's not a problem, if she's post-op she would probably just tell you she's infertile, because that would pretty much be the only certain difference physically between her and a cis woman

3) You don't need to be able to tell who's what, it's not your business, if we are interested in having a relationship with someone most of us will be open about our anatomical situation, so worry only when that happens
Dude just live your life. Your coming off less like you want to learn about trans women, and more like you want to learn how to avoid trans women. If you go on a date with someone, and they tell you they are trans, then just explain that you arnt interested. The world isn’t going to explode, and nobody can or will force you to be in a relationship. If they don’t tell you and you find out later in the relationship, literally no one will be forcing you to stay with her. Just chill

Never once in my life have I heard of someone who identifies as nonbinary being referred to as trans.
    I am a trans girl and im telling you. Non binary people are trans.
    Then you haven't been around trans people.
