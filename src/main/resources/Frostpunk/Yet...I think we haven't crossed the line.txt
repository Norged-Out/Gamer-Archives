[[Yet...I think we haven't crossed the line]]





Forceful Interrogation.
Turning people against each other
Public Execution
Prisons
    "Did you hit your brother? It's a yes or no question, I don't need a backstory! Go to your room!"
        Yes, and I did it publicly, he was a tyrant, and he needed punishment.
            I'm not hitting any one, it's just a forceful persuasions !
                I mean in game there litterally were kids playing and shouting "forceful persuasion" whilst beating a kid right? Yaal are making but that's exactly how it goes down lmfao
Tbf this is Victorian Britian. Children working in factories was the norm.
    Yeah I know some people really enjoy it, but I find the forced morality of the game really grates on my nerves. Like if you're basically the last of humanity alive, and then it starts giving you shit because your children were helping out gathering coal/cooking? Or god forbid you had a prison! Do the ends REALLY justify the means?

Like, if the alternative is we all freeze to death, yeah I think so?
        You don't actually cross the line for doing those things. You will *never* have an ending where you're said to cross the line if the worst thing you did was have children work, or operate a prison.
            I got shit just for getting people to rat out londoners. Like yeah I'm dismantling a cult that wants to send all the people of my city to die but god forbid I find out about them
                You used a crisis to justify creating a society in which people were no longer able to trust their own neighbors and were encouraged to turn against them.

In your eyes, that was justified - but many dictators see their actions as justified. It was never a necessary action, and this can be attested to by the many people who complete A New Home without signing the law.
                    >no longer able to trust their own neighbors

If your neighbour joined a suicide cult and wanted you to join, you're telling me the best thing to do is shrug and move on?
                        No, you could do what the many other players who didn't sign Righteous Denunciation or Pledge of Loyalty did, and manage the problem without sacrificing the basic tenets of trust between people.
                            I'd sell out a friend who is in a terrorist cell.
                                You would - but your law is more far-reaching than that.

There is a problem. A dictator uses problem as a justification to sign a law which would, theoretically, address the problem. However, the law in question is applied much more widely than the problem in question. The law remains long after the problem which allegedly made it necessary.

Once Londoners are gone, does your law go away? No - it does not. It stays.
                            When I played I already signed many of the hope invreasing laws before Winterhome was discovered. I personally think it was worth it to make people be able to confess their sins if that meant that no one would kill themselves trying to get back to London.
                                The biggest hope-increasing laws on signing, besides Cemetery (which is just awful), are all on the Purpose tree, which isn't unlocked until Winterhome is discovered.

Righteous Denunciation doesn't even influence hope, only discontent (increase on signing, occasional decrease through events).
            Yeah, but it gives you flak for things that aren't crossing the line either, such as putting children to work, extended shifts etc.
                The game doesn't give you flak for those things, it just notes them as things you did to adapt.
        You can get away with being an authoritarian police/religious state so long as you avoid the last three options on the tree. The bottom one glows evilly as a clue, so is pretty obvious, but the others aren't... I mean, you're trying to save the last vestige of humanity here, right?

Prisons/propaganda or religious police/forced prayers are the last authoritarian actions the game considers within the realm of grey morality when you're trying to run a post-apocalyptic city in the Arctic - the game will still complain about it, but only slightly.

Torture/forced informers or cultism/forced confessions will earn you the "evil" ending. Evidently even the apocalypse has standards.
    Well... *technically* you're not wrong, but it wasn't like everyone was hitting the assembly line right out of the womb.

At the time of Frostpunk, child labor was being phased out - strict child labor laws would have come into effect 4-5 decades prior, making it illegal for children under the age of 10 to do the sort of dangerous factory work you'd see in Frostpunk, and education became mandatory for children under the age of 10 in 1880, less than a decade before Frostpunk takes place.

Granted, those laws did little for children *over* the age of 10, and many of them from poorer families ended up having to work anyway (something the game itself actually comments on if you sign Child Shelters), but it was a start. Child labor becoming the norm would be seen as a regression compared to the direction England was headed in before.
Beatings will continue until moral improves!
Ah a wise choice
    Ah cheers, Iâ€™d call it a massage.
