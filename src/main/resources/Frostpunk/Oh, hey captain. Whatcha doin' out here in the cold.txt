[[Oh, hey captain. Whatcha doin' out here in the cold]]





this is spoiler btw  
ayo i just got a great idea for maybe new scenario  


the scouts meet the exiled captain and scouts go with him (the scouts have some recources) and go to winterhome and when they arive there they rebuild a lot of stuff and then send few people to new london so that some people who think the captain shall return go to winterhome (now called as NEW winterhome) and bassicly teh mission is to rebuild the generator, and i think its possible since in the the last autumn scenario there is a train to enw winterhome so they can find recources to fix the generator then try to survive the G R E A T winter and after that like 235 citizens of new witnerhome agaisnt new london 432 people fight    
(with recources or politicly) they can abotage stuff and try to get more people to winterhome and there are three endings:   
1) captain returns to new london after fightinh   
2) only new winterhome survives  
3) enw winterhome and new london become allies  


  
so what do u think of my idea?
    The scouts being loyal to the captain is cool and I like the idea of following the exiled captain.

Not such a fan of the war scenario. Part of the appeal of frostpunk (for me) is the emphasis that we can only survive if we come in unity and cooperate. War kinda goes against those concepts...
        I mean its just an idea and it can be fought like in the on the edge scenario
            I haven't got to the on the edge scenario yet... cool. Then yeah, neat idea. :)
        I mean you say that, but there's at least 2 endings in scenarios where you assist in the death of a civilization and promote class warfare
            If you go for bad endings, sure.
    Honestly I could see this being possible, though I think it should have some conditions 

Say the last time the scouts were in the city for over an hour (long enough to hear news and such) the hope was over 80% and discontent was less than 10%, then they would assume that the city is evil and help the captain since they wouldn't actually know the reason the captain was hit with the Your Time Has Come hammer.
    I think that's pretty dope they definitely should consider using the scouts more in the next game.
What movie is this from can someone finally tell me
    The Umbrella Academy.
Is it bad I read the title in the voice of Failsafe from Destiny 2?
    No. Its great
New captain reading reports of 10 more raw meat than previously reported.
    Alternative Food Sources is one helluva law
Just another day in the life of a scout!
Honestly the scouts and hunters should be separate from workers and engineers. They literally are separate from everyone else since they're never at New London. Like how engineers are the only ones that can work at the medical bays/infirmaries or factory/workshop, scouts/hunters should be in a class of their own. It'd be more convenient because like you wouldn't have to sacrifice workers to being scouts and hunters even though you can't play the game without them in the first place. Don't know if anyone else has thought about this.
    Plus scouts and outpost people can literally survive outside for weeks without heating, sleep, or food. Literal gods
        Yeah legit they're on a whole other level. In the new autumn dlc where you had the option of picking either technofascist engineers or an authoritarian syndicalist workers council, imagine like a separate section of labour laws devoted to the foragers/hunters and like it becomes some type of imperialist spartan like government with a draft and other colonies.
I always thought the captain and the scout teams would have radios to communicate the teams foundings and ETA's.  But this is still one of the best versions of this meme that I've seen lmao ü§£
    I just like to pretend that one day the scouts or outpost dudes are exploring and suddenly they come across the captain, sitting in a cave or maybe he wandered into an outpost. Regardless the idea of them just passing by is funny
