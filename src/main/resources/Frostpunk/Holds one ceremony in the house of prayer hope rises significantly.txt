[[Holds one ceremony in the house of prayer hope rises significantly]]





Frostpunk just solidified my position as “real life anti-authoritarian who loves fictional dictatorships”
    Yeah. You start out with the best of intentions. Then you're 5,000 coal behind some objective and thinking, "It would be unethical NOT to force people to work 24/7 while a guy screams at them the whole time in exchange for a cheeseburger"
        That is the best way I've ever heard Foreman described.
    Get into some of the well known dystopia fiction mate! 1984 while quite old is obviously one of the best. No human liberty, the government wield total power because they can, have the will, and none can stop them.
*hits londoners furiously with bible*
me irl: *atheist* 

me in frostpunk: my rhymes are fly, my beats are sick...
    My crew keeps getting bigger and bigger, that's because Jesus Christ is the generator.
        Lmfao that was great... 2 years ago huh anyways I had a good laugh
Low-level Faith tree laws aren't really "political gain". You're just giving your people a chance to meet and do something together as a community, and the people of Frostpunk are already religious so it makes sense for it to be religious rites. The same reason why morning gatherings build up hope - it's strengthening a sense of community and shared purpose, everyone feels like they're in this together.

If you go higher into the tree then yeah though, it becomes abuse. Both for Faith and Order.
    They aren't very religious actually. According to loading screen texts most religions died out with the cold and some people brought back forgotten pagan beliefs. 

You start a brand new religion to keep people calm basically.
        > You start a brand new religion to keep people calm basically. 

Show me where the game says that. Hint: it doesn't, it's a meme this subreddit repeated until it became reality.
            Then what is it? Game tells old religions died out and it doesn't seem to be any existing religion that exists with a brand new symbol and Captain decides what is god's will as his speaker. 

It's clearly a brand new religion.
                Your people mention God in their conversations plenty of times whether you sign any Faith laws or not. So much for old religions "dying out" - which the game doesn't say actually, it only says that pagan cults started to reappear and "many" (hint: not everyone) turned towards them. It's pretty obvious that what is happening is because earlier conditions (apocalypse and all) didn't really give people time nor possibility to pray in an organized manner, but establishing houses of prayer changes that.

It's only later, when you go up the faith tree, that the captain decides to take over the church and become its figurehead.

The ingame religion has a made up symbol instead of something used IRL because: 1. it's a a fictional world and 2. 11bitstudios didn't want to cause controversy by using RL religious imagery.
    Totally agree. I went with Order through most of my scenarios because I wanted to remain secular, but there's really only a couple of laws I could sign without making me feel like an ass. I gave Faith a shot once and the messages you get when you start opening churches were the most wholesome things I experienced in the game. I chose Faith for my city in endless and hearing the church bells ring is a lot nicer than the yelling you get with watchtowers.

    i thought this was a turkey jerky meme and then i realized
Yes... there is something in that
Welcome to the Emperium of Man
    In a world of hardship, blessed is the mind too small for doubt.
Oh, that's a fine joke here!
    thank you!^^
Shit, as a Turk, I hate seeing the man, but this is accurate af. Take your upvote!
Sudden Erdoğan is sudden
Talkin mad shit for someone in Faith Keeper distance
Same here. Yet again the other choice is even worse.
    It definitely is. When I played the game for the first time I went with discipline and things got out of hand very quickly.
        Both choices are okay given the circumstances, if you manage to stay behind the ethical event horizon, IMO. In the game the timespan doesn't allow for laws to be repealed, but there is the chance that they could be one day in the future, if you haven't crossed that line.
    The opposite here (discliamer: yeah the 1984’nessn of discipline is horrible af), I first went with discipline and said to myself “oh shit this is horrible, let me give faith a chance” and immidiately went “oh no...” when I saw the faith police. 

Tbh, both are totalitarian bullshit, I guess a good challange would be refusing to use that tree in an endless mode.
        that's why i avoided the Faith Keepers law in my "faithful good" run.
Me: *thinking that New Faith is extremist and immoral*
Me onse the storm stars being a thing: YOUR FAITH WILL BE ENOUGH TO FEED YOU, YOU DON'T NEED FOOD
Wolololo intensifies.
Order people let's spread more propaganda si these religious people see the true value in Order.
I love order 2000x more though
Me at the beginning: I'm gonna be as pure as possible, everyone is gonna live happy! Me at the end: You ungrateful fucks are gonna overthrow me after everything I've done for you even though all the half the houses are unlivable? Well enjoy 1/4 of the population getting steam roasted.
Is it just me or do I love hearing the lofi sorta staticky voice that tells everyone to get back to work when you build your first few watchtowers
Deus vult?
I totally support using religion for political gain IRL so... There's that. Wasn't a hard choice in-game for me.

EDIT: I will admit tho. By the time there were a bunch of cultists policing the city and a bunch of penitents repenting with flagellation, I knew I had fucked up. I wanted a religious society. But not like that.
    Put any religion in politics and it ends with some psychos harming themselves and others and the whole political unit they are in. There is a clear difference between a society that accepts the religious and the one that puts a crown over them.
        Stable societies require a religious (and religiously homogeneous) people. It doesn't mean that the religion needs to be in charge of the state, that will never end well.
            Stable societies need stable, hardworking people who can keep the system running. But I do agree that religion plays an integral role in making those people in most societies.
                >Stable societies need stable, hardworking people who can keep the system running.

Here's just my two cents. Not that we disagree or anything, but I always run at the mouth.

One of the most fundamental requirement for that which I just quoted to occur, is for the people in question to share common characteristics (a similar geographic environment, a similar language, a similar set of customs... Things that create a sentiment of unity and societal cohesion) and chief among those, because all others usually derive from or are subjected to, is a common moral compass. Which itself almost always originates from a shared philosophy about the nature of the world and its understanding of good and evil. 

If the law says "don't kill other people" it's because the society upon which that law is applied agrees that their common code must contain that limitation in accordance to their moral compass; in accordance to their set of moral beliefs. That's why a common religion is so important for stable societies.
                    What you are saying is trye, and religion’s role in that still stands, but there are alternatives to religion to construct a common moral compass: a shared experience in a definite space is the first thing that comes to my mind, like a metropolitan culture of the Italian city states or nationalism (even though both of which have been exposed to religious influence)
            Many RL societies are stable and neither religious nor religiously homogenous. Explain that.
                I already did. Read further below.

>neither religious

If you have a moral compass and an understanding of good and evil, you are by definition a religious person. It is a fundamental part of human nature to have a religion. Wether or not it aligns with one of the more established religions is another topic. The only source of wisdom is religion. A lot of things may make you knowledgeable, but not wise. Only your religious beliefs. What is good? What is evil? What is the path to arrive at what is good in harmony? Those are questions only answereable by religion.
                    That's both factually incorrect and hilariously wrong.
                        Denying a statement in a one-liner is not a counter-argument. So I'm still right on the basis that you haven't argued for your claim, nor against mine.
                            Lol.
                            It's called laws mate. There is no need to state obvious facts. There nothing to discuss from the moment you typed homogenous.
                                >It's called laws mate.

Oh, really? And why are laws the way they are, I wonder? I mean, some countries say that stoning gays to death is perfectly legal, and some other say that hate-crimes can be punishable by death.

Hmmm... It's almost as if the moral compass of the society in question dictates the customs and therefore the laws that a people wishes to be congregated under...
                                    Wonder no more. They were dictated by religion based states and mostly applied in societies like the ideal ones you describe.
                actually, they might be stable on the game's timescale. But not over generations. Predominantly atheist societies tend to lack children.
