[[All educated people learn the same shit right]]





Just sign abolishment of privileges a miner can be a surgeon
    Kid operating in House of Healing: "Now don't you worry chum twenty years of ditch digging was all my pappy needed to do brain surgery in a New Liverpool." *Kickstarts steam powered bonesaw*
        Just for what it's worth, surgeons did learn like that, not as 8 year olds obviously, but surgery was an apprenticeship thing while doctors went to university. That is why a surgeon was called Mr not Dr, a tradition they maintain today, ironically as their profession is arguably more highly skilled, or at least specialised than a doctor in many cases
            Yeah medicine used to be really backwards and shitty like washing your hands before and wearing gloves during surgery was just slightly recommended and even frowned upon in some places
                The guy who invented OR hygiene was insulted for it and died insane after having failed to convince his peers that it was a good idea.

                    And of course it was even worse than I thought I really can’t say enough how happy I am that modern medicine isn’t worse than no medicine
    what law is that? Is it like the cannibalism law that only shows up under certain circumstances?
        It’s in the workers path in last the last autumn dlc
            ohhh i have yet to play that
                Fair warning: this can have some rather predictable (at least in reality) results, with an event where a worker kills a bunch of patients by mixing up medicine.
                    A little spoilery, I've played TLA but haven't gone down the abolishment of privileges route yet
                        it's about as much of a spoiler as any other scripted event in the story based on actions you take and your application of laws, which we generally don't restrict.
                            That's understandable, but all those scripted events 'came out' a very long time ago compared to TLA.
                                The Last Autumn has been out a while now. Discussion of deaths that can be caused by certain mechanics - especially as such events don't require doing anything unusual to encounter - is in line with regular discussion about its gameplay.
                                    Fair enough.
Proceeds to have a flashback to Michael Reeves video.
I always figured it was because they had machines to do the surgery and stuff... Why learn how to take out an appendix when you can just put someone in a Steampunk horror-machine and it rips it out for you?
    You mean like medical Automatons
We have the technology
