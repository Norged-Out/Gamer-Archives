[[The Illusion of Free Choice]]





I choose soup
    So political fascism.
        No; soup fascism
            No, they are soupremacist!
                cursedpolitics.doc
    Soup Nazi: No soup for you!
    Soup is souperior dish
    Reminds me of Markiplier's soup rant with the storm music in background.
    I'm at soup!!
    Don‚Äôt forget your daily dose of sawdust
Thankfully, there's a third option.
    ...workers' union?
        Death.
        Death is preferable to communism
        Engineer caste
            ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
                better dead than red
    **Destroy the Captain.**
    third and also fourth in TLA, social segregation and communism
        I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not only segregation, but also slavery. And workers path similar to communism(no classes(everyone‚Äôs an engineer), no money), but the means of production are still owned by the state, also state still exists. So it‚Äôs not complete communism, it‚Äôs simple proletariat dictatorship.
        Well and there also is the golden path
    There is another one....
Im hoping the sequel will have a more varied path choice. Love the game and all but it was kind of disappointing to see the paths were basically the same with just tiny differences
    The Last Autumn showed they listened to community feedback and know how to make the ideologies substantially different now. I'm confident those lessons will carry over.
        Oh I am also, I didn‚Äôt want to go on a long rant but it was great to see last autumn make them unique. 

I‚Äôm curious to see what they might do in the sequel
        and then on the edge they threw it out the window
            On the edge didn't really deal with ideologies, it more so dealt with trust, duty, honor and, before all else, *hate*, both the hate that you feel towards new London and the hate that the other settlements potentially feel towards you.

Sure, they could have added ways of justifying said hate, but overall I think they did an okay job. Sure, it could have been way better, but even the stuff we got was good. Kinda like Fallout New Vegas.
                I just wished the warehouse had more significance to it beyond being a resource node. I was really expecting to dig up some old world secret that would change the frost land or allow the outpost to go full independent.
    Honestly, they felt decently varied to me. Religious had a heavier focus on medical and raising hope; order had a heavier focus on resources and reducing discontent. I might choose one over the other based on how much I‚Äôm screwing up my run.
        Oh yeah they have just enough things to make them varied. It‚Äôs a nitpick but I just wanted just a tad out more to differentiate the two of you get what I‚Äôm saying? 

Last autumn had the worker path which started out hopeful and then descended into communist terror, and, the engineers start with the promise of efficiency and safety and turn into a penal colony 

But as I said it‚Äôs a nitpick
            I definitely went full on authoritarian Engineer to build my generator. It‚Äôs one of those situations where you feel guilty reading r/antiWork tales for the next few days
                I went extreme communist my first time, not quite to the point where I had to pass terror, but i panicked with revolts from an event and got a bunch of engineers killed‚Ä¶
    That's the point, though. The fact they both lead to basically the same end if you let things go that far is the point. At least, that's how it seems to me.
        Yeah i imagine that‚Äôs what they were going for, but I still feel like you could accomplish that while allowing there to be a difference between the two

As I said to someone else though it‚Äôs a small nitpick to me
            That's fair I guess. I see them as being different in the middle, a bit before and a bit after the point where a just leader would stop, before becoming the same shit at the end if you keep pushing.

One thing I wish they'd gone harder on is the faithkeepers. Personally I see them as crossing the line, but I don't think the game agrees? Using them *might* disqualify you for the golden path achievement, or maybe not, it's been a long time since I got that and people didn't know for sure what was needed at the time. Regardless I never use them when going faith, and I think making them a line cross flag would add a little distinction between the paths.
                Ironically I didn‚Äôt see them as crossing the line, mostly because you need some form of guards to keep any city safe (thievery and all that) maybe they could have done a smaller reform before faith keepers before devolving into ‚Äúnobody expects the inquisition‚Äù
                    My issue with them is part the inquisition vibe they give off, but mainly the fact that they expressly are there to protect "the faithful". So faith is now mandated, basically.

I don't think you can have law in a faith-based society. Guards in a law-based society is fine.
    The two paths are subtly different, but the real choice is between moderation and extremism. Which I think is pretty trenchant. It manipulates the typical game mechanic of a tech tree where further along the tree is always an improvement and adds a hidden cost to it. The more you want to use the form of social cohesion--political solidarity or religious community--to force the people to behave in the way you want, the more nightmarish the civilization you're founding becomes. All these "emergency measures" have a way of becoming permanent in real life, so the game just embraces that reality.
New home I most times don't even need faith keepers so I give them a place to pray evening prayers from time to time and that temple festival so I think they got a pretty good life in my citie.
    I‚Äôm always so bad at actually setting up a faith city, I‚Äôll get to the point where I get a choice of purpose and be like ‚Äúhmm well not designing that bullshit again‚Äù
I really wish we could have bounced between the two trees to a certain point
    Same, honestly. But, I get where that might have been a little unfair.
But one has soup kitchen though
    True.
I think it's more like: totalitarianism and fundamentalism
    It‚Äôs just a meme
        Meh, true, but still
Fascism is cool when you are the dictator
    Lmao
Or you don't cross the line.

 This post is from "We didn't cross the line"-gang.
North korea or iran...
    I‚Äôd say more Soviet Russia or Middle Ages Catholicism, but yeah.
It‚Äôs bugging me that they should be swapped cause of color
    Fair enough
Both üòé
The choice is not the destination, but how far we follow the path.
I remember my first playthrough of this game choosing the "order" tree. When the game ended I remember my wife asking me what's wrong and me turning to tell her I "did a fascism" on accident.
    Sign the New Order law, Red banners go up all across the city.
‚ÄúOH GOD NO!‚Äù
I never like going full on for either side, i usually go with just enough religion that i have faith keepers for security but no further, of course i have the house of healing and all the benevolant stuff
Order is factually better choice. Also has nothing to do with fascism. 

So the choice is indeed free.
    Only better if u cross the line. Other than that, Faith is more reasonable.
        Nah. Guard stations, Foreman, Morning Gatherings are all you really need. That is totally fine and my favourite way to play. 

Faith is not death-free. Faith always kill someone, even if that death is scripted.
    It‚Äôs a meme, my man.
        Oh. Carry on then.

Both!
Burgundian System.
There is no hope under the Black Sun.
There‚Äôs another option, one that you haven‚Äôt discussed.
    I‚Äôve only played the New Home scenario
        I was thinking strategic genocide of your peoples using a system of overheating, outstretched resources, ageism, duelling, unsafe working conditions and poorly equipped medical centres.
            Oh.
Or you just don't go too far with either
I know, it felt so bad that I had to establish the moral police, although, I did get very close to winning without them. The last straw for me was when the chefs started stealing food and causing discomfort, I obviously couldn't banish them from the city as that would've been wrong.
Sadly theres two option. Maybe in Frostpunk 2 will be more options? Maybe being specializing the hospitals? xd
You can stop any time you want, and you do want to stop dont you?
Faith Keepers do be finding some free goodies
So political fascism.
    No; soup fascism
