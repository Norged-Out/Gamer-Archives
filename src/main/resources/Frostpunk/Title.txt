Back in January my southern town was snowed and iced over for a whole week with no salt on the roads and no means to de-ice my car unless I wanted to carry a gallon of water 5 minutes up 4 flights of stairs (live on a college campus). So you know I blasting that soundtrack as I walked for 15 minutes with inadequate winter clothes to the nearest food source. They even gave me a small portion of cold food for added immersion. I almost yelled "STEWARD!!" as I was eating it
     The city must survive.
        Brace yourselves, the storm approachs
Dude, do yall even have -30 winters in the states?
    -30?  Nah man it can be 60F and Hope will fall immensely.
    Yes, not where I am from, but up north, especially in Alaska, the temperature can drop to -80 F or -62 C.
    Ah, hello my fellow northerner
    Minnesota is the wild card. Usually more intense than Illinois/Chicago area, but it can get to those numbers in MN. Chicago less often. Probably in -20F’s for a week in the deepest part of winter and that’s about it.
me when its -10c outside (must overdrive the boiler)
I imagine people in Texas while seeing their first snow (its all melted during the day):

*Sir, most of our people have abandoned their workplaces to stay home with their families. Only the medical facilities are still functioning.*

The city holds its breath, waiting for whatever the end will bring.
I ordered the Vinyl Soundtrack von Frostpunkt. Cant wait for it to ship now in Q2
i feel seen
 Me, a Canadian when the sun stops shining for days on end through out the year and 2 foot piles of snow start to build up on every surface
I remember playing this game in winter and FEELING the storm ( it was like 8c we don’t experience any real winters here)
I know this is a meme, but living through Texas' snow apocalypse gave me a whole different view of the game. 

Texas is not built for winter. Obviously. Our infrastructure is made to trap cold and keep our heat. I can take some rain, but not really snow. Hearing on the news about people going hungry, mothers and their children dying from trying to stay warm, homeless people freezing to death, the sick, elderly, and young who just couldn't make it. Not to mention the road accidents because some people had never driven in snow their whole lives. 

Before the event I thought it was silly how discontent and hope would fall over, what I thought, would be silly things. Who cares if your home is chilly?? You're alive! However after living through that I learned just how the cold can suck the hope and life out of people just like how it sucks away their heat. 

Luckily we were okay since my family lived a long time in West Virginia where we can get some serious snow. Watching the people and animals die around us was definitely something I don't want to relive, though.
Most winters we get down to -40. It’s so cold that you run to the warm car and you are completely bundled up! That’s a mild FP day…
