[[scouts are just build different]]





I just pretend the scouts are hardy survivalists who have better clothes and know how to make it in the cold, and the rest of the population are civilians who don't have the experience or gear or constitution for it.
    Well you can disband your survivalist scout team and pick any arbitrary 15 workers you like to be your next scouts and they will do just as fine, so this does not explain it
        Just pretend that there are a few people in your general pop whose job it is to train and equip new scouts.
            Then I want all my citizens trained so I don‚Äôt need to hear about the complaints about cold anymore
        I like to think they also have a lot of equipment.
            True
            They‚Äôre shredding up all that wood I gave them and sticking it in their coats for insulation
"Sir! Its getting colder! People are freezing! What do we do?"

"I know just the thing seargent... make everybody scouts!"

"Excellent idea sir! So we're all scouts then?"

"Exactly!"

"Gosh, I feel warmer already!"
    I mean....we could also just move into the mines and close off the entrance to chill in 17¬∞C for the rest of our life, but that is appearently too complex thought for our freedom loving plebs
        Cave in says hi. ^^

That aside, if the sun is dimming as they say ingame the planet would inevitably freeze all the way to the core and all life would cease...
            I think I am ok with my home freezing in a few bilion years.....this planets molten core will probably live a lot longer than our sun.

That aside, if the aun is actually dimming than the gas oxygen and nitrogen will liquify in a few years making any life on the surface impossible
                You‚Äôll probably run out of coal before that happens
        The amount of times I‚Äôve thought ‚Äújust dig some fucking tunnels‚Äù is astronomical at this point

Yeah this always confused me so I just made some dead cannon like "well our scientist developed a way to make the reactor so small it can fit in a single person but we can only make enough for two scout teams and two outpost teams and that's it, no matter how many more resources we have stock piled that's the limit"
    Wasn't there a post about something like that a few weeks ago? I may be totally wrong, but I think someone took a piece of game or concept art and argued, that they (objects, not OP) may be portable heat sources or something along those lines
        Yes there‚Äôs concept art of portable heating suits that the scouts send out.
            I mean to research new scouts you only need wood
                True but the beacon requires steel to be built. A lot of of it - way more than you'd expect from what is basically a weather station with a balloon and a light on top.

My reasoning is that the advanced equipment - heating suits, radio, etc, is provided by the beacon already, while the wood required to outfit a scout team is used on sleds, shelters and other amenities. Probably even more, 40 is a lot of wood to spend on just 5 people.

As for researching additional scout teams, it's not about making more heating equipment but rather about improving your ability to coordinate and provide effective logistics to a larger group of scouts.
        Maybe, I don't remember seeing it or maybe I just blended it in my memory
        Well in game lore there is some kind of lamp that warms you but they don't have much of those, and the fact you must research scout team maybe means they do have some high grade suits that allow them to survive.
Just throwing it out there.
            Maybe there are some components in the generator that can be taken out to make those lamps more effective. The research for more scout teams would be finding ways to take out more of those things without ruining the generator.
                That neatly explains why they can't just develop the "mini generators" for the whole population. :D
    Maybe its more like it is to complex to make without special tools.
        That immediately break after the scouts get them lol?
            The tools no. I meant like the personal heating units where made back in London and the need tools are there. Kind of like with the steam cores you can't make them only find them.
From what I see in pictures, scouts seem to carry some special device on their back, and they covered their whole body with a special suit.

If game UI information is accurate, then a scout equipment roughly takes 8 wood per person. A city with 40 people would require 320 wood. You can... build or make a lot with this much wood. And generators or other building usually way cheaper to maintain even in the long run.

I assumed that, "scout equipment" is not a simple suit, but rather 5 different suits that require each other in order to protect people. Maybe each suit has a special mechanism that produces/cleans/recycles a special gas or material and has to be combined/connected together to sustain the suit mechanisms, or maybe each suit was made in a way that they heat each other. Kinda like multiple camp fires that heat each other.

Workers in the city requires flexibility. You can just yeet a worker from one side to other side of the city. If they require a team composition, than it will be hard to maintain. And if someone dies due to overwork, sickness, machinery or duels, or wants to run away, then rest of the team is f\*cked.  If you are willing to save other four by building heaters, you may as well build heaters everywhere and save some wood.

I would argue that gathering post guys can have scout equipment but, they don't. Probably because of game balancing. Or maybe there is something in the lore that I missed.
    Bruh
I like to think that scouts burn the wood we send them with to keep themselves warm; but people living near the generator can‚Äôt do that because then their buildings would be on fire.

Perhaps the reason why you meed scout upgrades for more scouts is that you also invent scout equipment (which is very limited) that keeps them warm.

I dunno. That‚Äôs just how I rationalise it.
Just surviving in sub zero temperature is one thing, but doing that and having five people dragging raw resources and multiple steam cores back is actually insane. One of those core can power an automaton or a mining structure, so it much be huge. Yet they can maintain the same steady speed with no problem.
You know what, this is an understandable reaction to sleeping in a tent at -20
    That‚Äôs why you have the clothes and a blanket!
    No, not really. Between that and immediate death via frostbite all people would choose that.
I never got how you can give them lighter sleds and boosters while they‚Äôre out in Frostland ü§î

        Sure thing

"Sir, the high-pressure air cannon is ready to launch the sleds to the scout team."

"Good, it should be very accurate, it took the engineers hours to aim this thing"

"Well, here goes nothing"

PSHHHEWWWWW

"That looked satisfying"

"Uh, Sir, we lost contact to the team. I think we aimed a little bit too accurate. Also, the air cannon exploded and some parts flew into the generator, crippling the generator core."

"Guess that means we are f*cked"

"Yes"

"Damn I hate air cannons. Who came up with that shit anyways... "
As a former scout IRL I agree with this message.
Scouts are legit gods in this game
These 40 Wood must really been doing magic
This is why I make as many scout teams as possible.

More people exploring Frostland = Less people whining at every possible inconvenience
Hunters and scouts are absolute gigachads

Yes,scouts are badly modeled in this game,you wouldnt be able to travel in -100c at all.
Hehehehhehe.
