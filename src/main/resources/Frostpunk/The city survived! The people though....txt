[[The city survived! The people though...]]





Yes! I love your content on grimdank. Keep the Frostpunk memes coming m8!
“ automaton one sounding off with a crash”
emwattnot making frostpunk art?

A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
    I smell heresy
    I am still looking for Alpharius in that picture
        Maybe the reason you can't find Alpharius in the picture is because he's right behind you.

HYDRA DOMINATUS!
        They're the one in the white-camo'd armour hiding behind the snowbank.
            I hope you know that you are causing me mental anguish because my sleep-deprived brain cannot figure out if you are fucking with me or not >:(
The violin players made it for sure
I’m surprised to see your art here I would love to see more frostpunk stuff
YOOOOOO You do frostpunk too! A new law has passed and I am 100% here for it!
    Hope rises, discontent drops
A more than pleasant suprise seeing you here
Frostpunk Earth would make a nice Deathworld in 40k.
    It's all in all a normal day on Valhalla, seems like.
    40k everywhere
    I could totally see it, IIRC the capsule with Rogal Dorn landed on a frozen planet.
*Seven hundred and five souls.*

*Not a single one lost to hunger, sickness, frostbite or the storm.*

*And more importantly...* **we didn't cross the line.**

New London, 1887, -30c
    Me omw to have 5 cripples and 3 kids surviving (it's a large amount)
who else started to instinctively look for the hidden alpharus
Thank you for reminding me of that movie.
My favorite comic artist getting into another IP that I love, it’s a good day
Why did nobody said that this is Vinny from Atlantis
    Rourke
        Damn, you are right, strange
Did not expect warhammer comic man here.
On my first run I kinda did not think to turn off the jobs at mines etc. Thought they would automatically disable themselves.

Cue tens of tens sick people...
    Even better when the hunters walk to the hunter huts and stand around doing fuck all, freezing to death, while the hunters huts are disabled due to the storm. That mechanic is annoying
“All right! Back to work!”
Reminds of that scene from Zulu

They do a roll call after the battle between British and zulu forces at the end of the movie. Brutal but Great film.

Colour Sergeant Bourne: Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.

Pvt. Hitch: I am? Oh, thanks very much
Where is Alpharius? Is he safe?
For me 300 people died, I started that storm with 900

A third of my city gone
    First playthrough from 900 down to 5
        I can imagine the captain looking at the five people and going "Celebrate people, the city survived!"
        Fucking how?
Dang Automatons dun bit me on my sit-upon!
-280 degrees. How anyone lived through that is absurd
An Atlantis meme for Frostpunk drawn by someone who’s got a well deserved reputation from their incredible Warhammer artwork?!?!

This is like the ultimate crossover. I love it
Atlantis fuckin classic. Good MEME
King, you’re here too?
