[[Research is tough I know]]





Seems legit for a city that needs a special law to make soup.
    They complain about eating a soup... I would kill for a bowl of soup after a day of work outside.
        Think 1800's famine soup... which is much closer to hot water with some ground veggies in it, than what we would recognize as soup.  Plus the food gets stretched out the easiest way possible:  adding more water.
        I assume its famine grade soup, so basically just boiled water with some chunks of mystery blobs in it.
        Yea never understood why people living in constant cold get mad about a nice hot bowl of soup, especially if it has some moonshine to go with it
            You're using soup to stretch rations out. So it's going to be thin and watery. Still nice to have a hot bowl, but definitely a downgrade from whatever they were getting before.
                Better than starving. This is one of my problems with the game. We're all about to freeze to death, and people are bitching about having to work.
                    working in -120 degrees C, that's like your lungs instantly turn to ice as you inhale levels of cold.

anyway, working in cold means big hunger
                    That’s Human nature though. You really think people would be pleasant and united in a situation like this? Discontent would spread rapidly, people would give up in the face of such misery, tensions would flare, etc. 

I definitely think the population should present more of a united front initially, however. It is pretty ridiculous to see people complaining about getting up for work 3 days in lol.
            Isn't the soup half sawdust or something?
                They're mutually exclusive.

And with a name like that you must have been assigned the public house. 3.5 hr workday...
                I never used that law
        I love soup. But i believe their soup was more water than anything else.
    Seems legit for a city that needs a special law to make overtime legal.
        It's strangely optimistic about labour relations.
    “Hear yer, hear yee, there is a new law in the city, get it while it’s hot”
TBF, they only take a day to do it. I imagine it's more along the lines of them figuring out how to overhaul the insulation and connecting the residence to the generator, or something along those lines.
    Okay guys. We figured out how to build a bunkhouse. If only we could figure out a way to make a similar building, but less cramped...
        If only we could figure out a technology to force five more people to spend a week walking in the snow.
            With that it's more logistical than technical
    This is how I look at any research in a video game. They've already got the basic theories down, the research is figuring out the practical application, and how to do it efficiently.
        Like Civ6 - I know how to make airplanes, but somehow my civilization can't figure out a crossbow or how to make stronger walls?

As an engineer, this works for me actually. The Archives show that the blueprints for things are already out there; it's a matter of setitng up the right tools, building jigs for wooden parts, adapting the design for the particular type of wood and steel that happens to be available, etc.
    As an engineer, making anything takes forever. Tony Stark bugs the hell out of me with his constructing massively complex things in trivial amounts of time
        And with a box of scraps, no less.
            IN A CAVE!
It’s probably more of the manual labor part of it that they aren’t trained to do. The engineers design the houses in the workshop and a bunch of workers have to use hand tools to work with raw materials and put everything together.
They probably need to make the blueprints for it. You don't know how to build a house just because you can make cars.
Like, its sort of like a tent, but with walls that are hard, and straight up and down. Then they have to figure out what goes on top. Like in a tent, the walls had the roof built-in
    We already have a horizontal wall though, we're walking in it, I think we'll call it a "floor". Surely 4 walls and this floor is all we need, right?
        But then if we dont have a wall on top of those 4 walls, all the snow will fall onto our floor!
What movie is that from?
    The Rain Man.

EDIT: Correction, it seems to be from The Hangover.
        Isn't it about that movie with the author that drinks some sort of chemical and aquires superhuman powers?
Forget bunkhouses, they need more than a day to make *drawing boards*
