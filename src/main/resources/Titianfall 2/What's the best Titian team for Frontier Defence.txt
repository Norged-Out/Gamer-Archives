[[What's the best Titian team for Frontier Defence]]


Tital


Scorch, ronin and Northstar with piercing shot are the meta frontier defense titans.
Scorch, legion, monarch, and northstar in my opinion. Defensive with enough offense
Entire team of legions

Nothing a shit ton of bullets wont fix
Scorch, Legion, Monarch, and any 4th Titan. You get Area Denial DPS and a Titan who can ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù Perhaps a 4th like Ronin, Tone, or Northstar to pick off line threats. Ion can provide some bonus firepower if needed
    Tone with the splash trackers and double sonar or extra rockets can create a near infinite stream of rockets against enemy titans (if there‚Äôs lots of enemies)
I usually go for range most maps, but ones where there are lanes I go for an area denial titan
The titan reading this üòâ
A Squad of Legion's can do some serious damage
Especially if you know how to use a drill shot properly!
Monarch dont die, so as long as you got one of those you're pretty much guaranteed constant firepower in some form. Scorch is pretty busted in FD, so that's a must. Ronin can be good, but the low health is sometimes bad.
    tell that the crackhead ronin pilot on my squad who sword cores the entire fucking wave long while yelling racial slurs.
