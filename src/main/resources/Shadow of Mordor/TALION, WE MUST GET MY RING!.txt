Talion: *walks one step*

Celebrimbor: "TALION, WE MUST RETRIEVE MY RING!"

Talion: *opens mouth to respond*

Celebrimbor: "Talion, we're wasting time, we must get my ring NOW!"

Talion: "Bu-"

Celebrimbor: "Talion, Minas Ithil is a just some dumbass human city, and Idril is just some dumb human woman. Just like your wi-"

Talion: "What?"

Celebrimbor: "Wha- GET THE RING TALION!"
    WE MUST SECURE THE PALAAAAAAAANTEYAAAAAAAAAAH
        Lmfao

Happy cake day
            thank yu sir
Dude honestly. And when Talion mentions that you could've stopped something Celebrimbor always goes "We could've prevented it with my ring"
    And then you get the ring and there's virtually no difference in power
        It does alow ya to dominate orcs
            Yes, that is a significant difference. I love dominating orcs.
                It is kind of the point of the game.
                    This entire thread made me play the game at 5 AM this morning :). I love the unpredictability of this game, and got ambushed by 2 orcs while trying to clear out an outpost. Got killed, but enjoyed every bit.
Celebrimbor: We must secure the Palantir!

Talion: we must help the Gondorians first

Celebrimbor: hmmf! Fine

Also Celebrimbor 2 seconds later: We must get my ring!

Talion: And we will

Celebrimbor right after: WE MUST SECURE THE PALANTIR!

    I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/shadowofmordor. 

It might be OC, it might not. Things such as JPEG artifacts and cropping may impact the results.

 I did find [this post](https://redd.it/fnqqr6) that is 54.69% similar.  It might be a match but I cannot be certain.
