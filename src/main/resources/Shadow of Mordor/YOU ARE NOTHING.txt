[[YOU ARE NOTHING]]





*BECAME DERANGED*
    AAAAAaaaGhhGhGHggHh

For some reason this reminds me of the time I shamed an overlord and all he said was “YOU CAN KEEP THE FORT!!”

Think I made him an ally
        That's Bruz
            I was gonna ask since you can take other players war chiefs during online conquests does that mean you can potentially take an infinite number of Bruz’ or does the game not allow that?
                Infinite bruz. Some people make a game of getting whole forts of bruz
                    whole region of bruz
                        Long ago, the four forts lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Bruz Region attacked.
                        Well you can put a whole region into a fort
                    Well know I know what I'm doing
Recently got the shaming ability, been shaming almost everything.
    feels good when the orc who used to be your nemesis gets defeated instantly
    Up the difficulty to brutal and then do this you’ll have ambushes for your ambushes
        I'm getting more ambushes than a 10 year old boy in the vatican

Motherfucker doesn’t mince words anymore lol
    You DISGUST me
He mind is gone now to mush but worst of all, he's heart has been Bruz-ed

**YOU DON'T DESERVE MY BLADE**
Am I the only one who still plays shadow of mordor instead of shadow of war
    How big is it and what do you play in? I've been planning to buy it but I'm afraid my laptop won't handle it and since my storage is low...i would have to delete Dota to install it
        Shadow of Mordor or Shadow of War specifically? Both are fantastic, though Shadow of War has about 2.5x the content of Shadow of Mordor as it came out 3 years after.
You should ask if they have a sliding scale
Yikes lol
Tricky Escape
This should have more upvotes
