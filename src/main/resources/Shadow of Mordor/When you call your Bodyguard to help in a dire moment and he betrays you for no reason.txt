[[When you call your Bodyguard to help in a dire moment and he betrays you for no reason]]





My bodyguard betrayed me because I accidentaly gave him the slightest love tap during a fight. This caused his blood brother in the nearby area to aggro on me. Thus causing my bodyguard to aggro on me. 

Good times.
    I can't tell if I love or hate the blood brother mechanic. Its frustrating as hell sometimes but can make for one helluva fun fight. 
        It's good but feels a bit overdone (for me). Like every god damn time one of my Uruk's level now I am checking to see if they got the blood brother trait. So many times I recruited an Uruk that didn't have it then bam. He levels. I hit his blood brother. Betrayal.
            Totally agree with it being overdone. I had two different orcs getting revenge for their bb, and they  both said something along the lines of, "You're lucky if you get one blood brother in a lifetime." And I thought to myself, "Bull...shit."
                It's like they are all related somehow. Inbreeding probably.
                    Hell, when they are all born of the same mud pit, they are ALL technically blood brothers.. Well, more like mud brothers
                        Where the women at?
                            Lol unfortunately for the Tolkien uruk race, there are no female uruk. They don't reproduce, they are grown in a magic mud pit.
                                That's a movie thing. Tolkien stated that orcs reproduced "in a manner similar to elves and men". So yes, there are orcs bumping literal uglies.
                                    Lol I seriously hope they are at least slightly more attractive than the males. If not, uruk must go though paper bags like they are going out of style
                                I watched Lord of the rings and beat the snot out of the ps2 games. Love it. The Uruks are my favourite characters though. Can't stand filthy hobbits.
                                    Lol hobbits do suck. I find them to be the most uninteresting race ever made.

                                    Lol these days, lore varies depending on the media. It's definitely not canon from the source material, but I don't know if I could read the books
                                No, I'm pretty sure there were female orcs, and they mated and grew like normal beings. I believe the magic mud pits were for aging them quickly. 
                                    Tolkien never settled on an explanation for how Orcs multiply, the latest one was that they breed like anyone else.

The corrupted elves theory was something he moved away from pretty quickly I think.

As for the vats, I believe that's an invention of the movies for the Uruk-Hai of Saruman, but it stands to reason that would be how Orcs are bred in general in movie canon.

Shadow of Mordor/War is rooted in the movies for a lot of things, so that's likely how they settled on the pits, it's also a good way to explain why there are no female orcs around.
                                    If there are female versions, it sucks that they didn't have them in game. 
            Yep. It happens way too often. They need to tone this down a bit. They also need to tone down Iron Will in the final act. These traits should be a lot rarer. 
                Everytime an Uruk's blood brother gets killed they automatically get iron will. Means I have to risk shaming them like 3 times down to level 5. Then re-level. Bleh.
                    Yep. You don't even need anything special to happen in Act IV. I'd say probably 40% of newly spawned Captains come with Iron Will by default. It's actually kinda annoying.
                        Guess I will be making use of the market then lol. It's probably to balance players who want to own every Uruk in the game. I get the balancing in this game honestly as SoM did get very easy as you grow in power but let us play our way dangit lol.

With me I'm pretty fair. I give the enemies a chance and don't just ownify them. I don't just recruit the OP captains or everything in sight. Just the ones I like the personality of. Makes it more interesting when they die etc.

But when the game goes puposefully out of it's way to screw me I will cheese it back. Fair is fair.
            I feel like it should be a kind of trait that they either have when generated or don't. 

Like did they just get back on speaking terms or something now that Gr8mbults is a fancy bright lord war chief or what? 
                Lol yeah, I think so too. At least that way they could have like Uruk's that look like each other or compliment each others abilities in battle or have similar mindset or goals or anything that makes sense honestly.
        The biggest problem is it's a pure negative. There's literally no upside to having the skill.

The biggest source of betrayal, at least for me, is Blood Brother related.

Uruks are *very* quick to betray you over harming their Blood Brother. The opposite however, the idea of an Uruk leaving Sauron's forces to join the Bright Lord, doesn't happen - or if it does it's so rare it may as well not. A big change in followers from SoM and SoW is that Uruks have self anatomy more or less now compared to being braindead Thralls like before.
            It can be helpful to get an orc you dislike to kill some orc you like's blood brother. Then that murderer becomes the blood brother's rival and becomes enraged at the sight of them. So maybe you can recruit them then send them to avenge their brother 
        I love it I just wish it wasn't as common on all of my orcs. 
        Ive played on xbox for 27hours. And I haven't been attacked by one blood brother :(
I had a captain with the trait. And I attacked the warcheif he brother with and made sure he wasn't my body guard when I went. But I've have no surprises 
    The blood brother trait really should be counted as a weakness trait not a positive one because i literally hate when my guys get it
        I think it's classed as like an aggro trait. Like enraged traits etc. There are things you can do about it but risky.
        It counts as a strength because if you brand both brothers and one is warchief and the other is his bodyguard they will get pissed during an online siege on your base when one dies.
    It seems a bit excessive for combat hits to cause betrayal effects. 

"Gruz, you literally stuck your face in front of my sword, you have no one to blame but yourself."
        Even worst considering I hit my own bodyguard. Surely that is to be expected considering all the bs we get caught up in.

My bodyguard betrayed me because I ended up attacking a radom uruk that happened to be his blood brother.

I don't tolerate traitors, so I shamed him down to level one, branded his blood brother, and ordered him to kill my ex-bodyguard.

That'll teach you to value friendship over your loyalty to the bright lord.
    That probably will make the remaining blood brother resent you and eventually betray you, though.

You can't be sure, you can never be sure.
        He was actually ugly as hell, so I killed him right after he killed my ex-bodyguard.

But yeah, I was worried he was going to betray me right then and there, like the other one did. 
    The first guy I shamed tried to resist it by making himself proud of it. He had painted white hands all over his body. So I kept hunting him and shaming him until he broke down to a giggling deranged mess. His title went from ''The Proud'' to ''The Ruined''. 
        I had a guy like that. He just kept repeating "I tried, I tried, I really, really did! I tried so hard!"
            Fuck me this game is dark sometimes
                Unless you enjoy torturing orcs
            I don't want the fort
                I never wanted the fort
        I had an Olog warchief who was called the pain loving or something and I shamed him because he was too high of a level to dominate and he turned into the painless and kept saying stuff like “I don’t feel it”
    Holy shit that’s dark
        *The Dark Lord....
            "dark Lord bright Lord  same thing really."
                *pop*
Orcs are just tools. Don’t build relationships with them. Use and abuse and destroy when their purpose is no longer required. I’m not mad at all, why do you ask?
    Celebrimbor? Is that you? 
        Couldn't be, none of those words were ring or palantir. 
            Needs more sneering and a feeling of Elvish superiority 
            I understood his reason for wanting the ring back, but I knew he'd become twisted, even more so, the moment he said MY ring. 
            M Y R I N G T A L I O N

T H E P A L A N T I R
        Suffer him now.
I’ve been using my bodyguard to kill every captain I find and only step in if he needs help. I’m just waiting for the day that he feels powerful enough to betray me :(
    It feels like Orcs are Sith, ready to betray their masters when they feel they've learned enough...

And their masters are waiting for that moment every day...
        There you go, next Shadow of ______ game needs to be starwars based. Shadow of The Empire or something.
            That's it. Monolith must make a star wars games with the nemesis system implemented. 
            An Old Republic version of Shadow of War would be awesome.
    In my current campaign, my first recruit was an Olog who betrayed me literally minutes later, as he gained one level.

His excuse was that he had grown stronger and outgrown me, unfortunately for him, he hadn't grown *that* much stronger.

I imagine his skull is some Caragor's chew toy by now, as I haven't seen him again.
Okay, this is a dumb question, but how do you activate your bodyguards? I always thought you just had to have one assigned and they save you random periodic times?
    Make sure you have the bodyguard upgrade for the Call Followers ability active, then press right on the dpad. You can call them whenever you like(except during most/all story quests).
        I mean, the moment you’re about to be executed do I activate it to save my life or is that based off of luck for them to save me?
            The saves are based on luck and unrelated to bodyguards I think. 
            The saves are based on a mixture of luck and how much the orc in question likes you. If he's loyal enough, he'll save you but lose a little bit of his loyalty because he'll see you as weak, so he'll then have a higher chance of betraying you.

The chance of a save also increases if the orc is nearby (i.e. currently in the fray with you) so it just happens to be your bodyguard a lot because you summon him the most out of any orc to be in the fight with you.
                Are there ways to increase their loyalty?
                    The game calculates the loyalty of followers almost the same way it calculates the worthiness of your nemesis

Basically, the more you interact with them (help them in missions, fight in battles with them, etc.), the more they'll like you and be less likely to betray you. That's why lots of people get betrayed very often, as they don't spend time to develop a meaningful relationship with the orc.

Plus, and I could be wrong on this one, I think that if they were a very formidable foe that killed you a lot before being branded, they might have a higher chance of betraying you. I could be wrong, but I'd imagine their past resentment of you could easily resurface.

Also, saving them from bleeding out gets them to like you a *lot* more. I've never been betrayed by someone who I've saved from losing blood as of yet. It can definitely happen, but they're much more likely to want to save you if you do.
    If you play on PC, press 2. If you have a bodyguard in that part of the map, he'll come to help you. If you don't, you'll just get like 4ish basic uruks.
Legitimately chuckled.... fuck it here's an upvote.
I’ve never had my bodyguard betray me yet, but I have had THREE captains betray me in a row and cut my bodyguards throat every time I save him. 

I doubt this particular bodyguard will ever betray me because I’ve saved his ass so much.
Literally just happened to me right now, his final words where "betraying you really got to you, worth it just for that" killed him on the spot even though he was my favorite orc 
I just got betrayed by 4 orcs in the same exact place in a span of like 10 seconds 
I murdered one of my captains blood brothers.  He was too high of a level to recruit and since he was a legendary I wanted his drop.  Still waiting on the betrayal.  I should probably just murder him now.
    Dew it

    One per region. Only that one will show up in that region.
So far only the bodyguard I had to recruit for the story has betrayed me. I didn't mind cuz I didn't really like him so I didn't feel bad about killing him
This was a great laugh, luckily I have only been betrayed once (blood brother related).
Story time. 

So I just branded my second captain and make him my body guard doing the tutorial.  Branded another captain, did some missions with him and he's pretty powerful.

Immediately during my second mission with my 3rd branded captain, my body guard betrays me and nearly kills my 3rd captain.  I didn't even use him as a bodyguard since I assigned him to it. 

So I rez my guy, killed another random captain and was fighting the guy who just betrayed me.   So in my mind I'm thinking, "everyone deserves a second chance" and try to recruit him again, only to get refused.  As I'm about to finish the guy he's goes on about being a traitor to both the armies but not being ashamed.

Its sucks cause he looked pretty cool and seemed a bit honorable for an Orc.  Also he had no reason to betray me unless he was jealous or something.
Has anyone else hit a group betrayal? Twice between beginning and full completion of the game I randomly had 4-5 captains all spontaneously betray me and try and jump me, like it would show one speech after the other. Bitch of a fight both times.

Was while I was trying to gather strong warchiefs for the shadow wars, too, so it meant I had to go hunt down a ton of replacements even though I succeeded.
For some reason mine beats the ever living hell out of everyone he crosses to the point its hard to recruit because he is a murder machine. But for some reason i habe no trouble putting him in his place.
I dunno, they have the most enjoyable life out of all the Middle Earth inhabitants. They just just tend their lovely fields, eat multiple meals a day, smoke, and spend their nights at the pub. They don't gotta worry bout no Dark Lord.
My bodyguard betrayed me while I was fighting two other captains😂 needless to say, I emerged with two more captains in my army, but one less bodyguard.
Turns out he had actually overleveled me, so logically, he felt stronger and like he could take me on. He was ultimately wrong, but put up a decent fight.
Don't you mean A-Ahole?
Just had my first betrayal. I sent this guy to go kill another captain, not realizing it was his blood brother. Anyways he goes there and I help him kill the dude, then immediately after betrays me for it. Like wtf man? You took at least half his health 
 I don’t even know what happened with mine I didn’t even realize I had this captain in my forces but out of nowhere this cheeky fuck runs up to me saying “this is a betrayal!” No context other then that. I try repossessing him but he’s got strong will now and is done with my wraith ways. So I decide to kill him and his last words are “I should’ve know better then to betray you boss.” I still have no idea what I did to make this regular orc captain to just decide “them bright lord sucks”

Quality shitpost.
I have to hear this alot, it's extremely fucking annoying...

(I get where it's from but it's over-used so much that it's become stale and boring to me and I fucking love Key and Peele...)
    There's no point in complaining about memes, just accept that this is a new annoying thing on the internet alongside "could of" and "loose" and all the other dumb shit people do.
        I know...
        I absolutely love memes in general, but beating a dead horse is never funny...
            Let me rephrase that: no sense in complaining about memes being beaten to death. It's like complaining about having the runs after eating Taco Bell. We knew what we were signing up for.
                True, but even so... I don't really find a whole lot of them funny and the one shown has made me hate that episode when I used to think it was hilarious...
Time to wrathgiver his ass out the window
This happened to me. I shamed him until he was level one, and then I absolutely refused to kill him whenever we met, even if he asked for it
I can't tell if I love or hate the blood brother mechanic. Its frustrating as hell sometimes but can make for one helluva fun fight. 
    It's good but feels a bit overdone (for me). Like every god damn time one of my Uruk's level now I am checking to see if they got the blood brother trait. So many times I recruited an Uruk that didn't have it then bam. He levels. I hit his blood brother. Betrayal.

        Let me rephrase that: no sense in complaining about memes being beaten to death. It's like complaining about having the runs after eating Taco Bell. We knew what we were signing up for.
            True, but even so... I don't really find a whole lot of them funny and the one shown has made me hate that episode when I used to think it was hilarious...
It's good but feels a bit overdone (for me). Like every god damn time one of my Uruk's level now I am checking to see if they got the blood brother trait. So many times I recruited an Uruk that didn't have it then bam. He levels. I hit his blood brother. Betrayal.
    Totally agree with it being overdone. I had two different orcs getting revenge for their bb, and they  both said something along the lines of, "You're lucky if you get one blood brother in a lifetime." And I thought to myself, "Bull...shit."
        It's like they are all related somehow. Inbreeding probably.
            Hell, when they are all born of the same mud pit, they are ALL technically blood brothers.. Well, more like mud brothers
                Where the women at?
                    Lol unfortunately for the Tolkien uruk race, there are no female uruk. They don't reproduce, they are grown in a magic mud pit.
                        That's a movie thing. Tolkien stated that orcs reproduced "in a manner similar to elves and men". So yes, there are orcs bumping literal uglies.
                            Lol I seriously hope they are at least slightly more attractive than the males. If not, uruk must go though paper bags like they are going out of style
                        I watched Lord of the rings and beat the snot out of the ps2 games. Love it. The Uruks are my favourite characters though. Can't stand filthy hobbits.
                            Lol hobbits do suck. I find them to be the most uninteresting race ever made.

                            Lol these days, lore varies depending on the media. It's definitely not canon from the source material, but I don't know if I could read the books
                        No, I'm pretty sure there were female orcs, and they mated and grew like normal beings. I believe the magic mud pits were for aging them quickly. 
                            Tolkien never settled on an explanation for how Orcs multiply, the latest one was that they breed like anyone else.

The corrupted elves theory was something he moved away from pretty quickly I think.

As for the vats, I believe that's an invention of the movies for the Uruk-Hai of Saruman, but it stands to reason that would be how Orcs are bred in general in movie canon.

Shadow of Mordor/War is rooted in the movies for a lot of things, so that's likely how they settled on the pits, it's also a good way to explain why there are no female orcs around.
                            If there are female versions, it sucks that they didn't have them in game. 
    Yep. It happens way too often. They need to tone this down a bit. They also need to tone down Iron Will in the final act. These traits should be a lot rarer. 
        Everytime an Uruk's blood brother gets killed they automatically get iron will. Means I have to risk shaming them like 3 times down to level 5. Then re-level. Bleh.
            Yep. You don't even need anything special to happen in Act IV. I'd say probably 40% of newly spawned Captains come with Iron Will by default. It's actually kinda annoying.
                Guess I will be making use of the market then lol. It's probably to balance players who want to own every Uruk in the game. I get the balancing in this game honestly as SoM did get very easy as you grow in power but let us play our way dangit lol.

With me I'm pretty fair. I give the enemies a chance and don't just ownify them. I don't just recruit the OP captains or everything in sight. Just the ones I like the personality of. Makes it more interesting when they die etc.

But when the game goes puposefully out of it's way to screw me I will cheese it back. Fair is fair.
    I feel like it should be a kind of trait that they either have when generated or don't. 

Like did they just get back on speaking terms or something now that Gr8mbults is a fancy bright lord war chief or what? 
        Lol yeah, I think so too. At least that way they could have like Uruk's that look like each other or compliment each others abilities in battle or have similar mindset or goals or anything that makes sense honestly.
The biggest problem is it's a pure negative. There's literally no upside to having the skill.

The biggest source of betrayal, at least for me, is Blood Brother related.

Uruks are *very* quick to betray you over harming their Blood Brother. The opposite however, the idea of an Uruk leaving Sauron's forces to join the Bright Lord, doesn't happen - or if it does it's so rare it may as well not. A big change in followers from SoM and SoW is that Uruks have self anatomy more or less now compared to being braindead Thralls like before.
    It can be helpful to get an orc you dislike to kill some orc you like's blood brother. Then that murderer becomes the blood brother's rival and becomes enraged at the sight of them. So maybe you can recruit them then send them to avenge their brother 
I love it I just wish it wasn't as common on all of my orcs. 
Ive played on xbox for 27hours. And I haven't been attacked by one blood brother :(
I had a captain with the trait. And I attacked the warcheif he brother with and made sure he wasn't my body guard when I went. But I've have no surprises 
I think it's classed as like an aggro trait. Like enraged traits etc. There are things you can do about it but risky.
It counts as a strength because if you brand both brothers and one is warchief and the other is his bodyguard they will get pissed during an online siege on your base when one dies.
Even worst considering I hit my own bodyguard. Surely that is to be expected considering all the bs we get caught up in.
Lel
He was actually ugly as hell, so I killed him right after he killed my ex-bodyguard.

But yeah, I was worried he was going to betray me right then and there, like the other one did. 
I had a guy like that. He just kept repeating "I tried, I tried, I really, really did! I tried so hard!"
    Fuck me this game is dark sometimes
        Unless you enjoy torturing orcs
    I don't want the fort
        I never wanted the fort
I had an Olog warchief who was called the pain loving or something and I shamed him because he was too high of a level to dominate and he turned into the painless and kept saying stuff like “I don’t feel it”
*The Dark Lord....
    "dark Lord bright Lord  same thing really."
        *pop*
Couldn't be, none of those words were ring or palantir. 
    Needs more sneering and a feeling of Elvish superiority 
    I understood his reason for wanting the ring back, but I knew he'd become twisted, even more so, the moment he said MY ring.

Suffer him now.
There you go, next Shadow of ______ game needs to be starwars based. Shadow of The Empire or something.
    That's it. Monolith must make a star wars games with the nemesis system implemented. 
    An Old Republic version of Shadow of War would be awesome.
I mean, the moment you’re about to be executed do I activate it to save my life or is that based off of luck for them to save me?
    The saves are based on luck and unrelated to bodyguards I think. 
    The saves are based on a mixture of luck and how much the orc in question likes you. If he's loyal enough, he'll save you but lose a little bit of his loyalty because he'll see you as weak, so he'll then have a higher chance of betraying you.

The chance of a save also increases if the orc is nearby (i.e. currently in the fray with you) so it just happens to be your bodyguard a lot because you summon him the most out of any orc to be in the fight with you.
        Are there ways to increase their loyalty?
            The game calculates the loyalty of followers almost the same way it calculates the worthiness of your nemesis

Basically, the more you interact with them (help them in missions, fight in battles with them, etc.), the more they'll like you and be less likely to betray you. That's why lots of people get betrayed very often, as they don't spend time to develop a meaningful relationship with the orc.

Plus, and I could be wrong on this one, I think that if they were a very formidable foe that killed you a lot before being branded, they might have a higher chance of betraying you. I could be wrong, but I'd imagine their past resentment of you could easily resurface.

Also, saving them from bleeding out gets them to like you a *lot* more. I've never been betrayed by someone who I've saved from losing blood as of yet. It can definitely happen, but they're much more likely to want to save you if you do.

    Lol these days, lore varies depending on the media. It's definitely not canon from the source material, but I don't know if I could read the books
No, I'm pretty sure there were female orcs, and they mated and grew like normal beings. I believe the magic mud pits were for aging them quickly. 
    Tolkien never settled on an explanation for how Orcs multiply, the latest one was that they breed like anyone else.

The corrupted elves theory was something he moved away from pretty quickly I think.

As for the vats, I believe that's an invention of the movies for the Uruk-Hai of Saruman, but it stands to reason that would be how Orcs are bred in general in movie canon.

Shadow of Mordor/War is rooted in the movies for a lot of things, so that's likely how they settled on the pits, it's also a good way to explain why there are no female orcs around.
    If there are female versions, it sucks that they didn't have them in game. 
Lol I seriously hope they are at least slightly more attractive than the males. If not, uruk must go though paper bags like they are going out of style
