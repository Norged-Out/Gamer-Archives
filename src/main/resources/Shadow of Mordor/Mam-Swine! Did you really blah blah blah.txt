[[Mam-Swine! Did you really blah blah blah]]





It's even better if they don't say anything at all and just stare at you for like 20 seconds while making some weird noises
    Ah undead captains.
        Or deranged captains
    I've had that happen, where it froze up as they were going to talk, and it's just a long, awkward silence.
This made me laugh
    There should be an option to turn that dialoge off. Its cool in the campaing but when you are grinding online conquests it gets annoying.
        Even better. I want the option to vocally say “shut up orc” and then have said orc be super offended
            ENRAGED: Hates being interrupted
                That’d actually be great, have em have the longest speeches too
                    Yeah that would be very fun and creative.

Would Show how well made the nemesis system is.
                That'd be perfect.  It could be a part of the skill tree and everything.
        Or skip it. Some go on for multiple refreshes of the subtitles.
            How do you skip it
                I meant we should have an option to
Zog really comes to mind here
Nothing like a 5 minute undead dance
No, no, keep going. It's going to make the two hits to behead you even funnier.
Already done this meme lol
    My bad, purely coincidental.
        Np, it's still different
It's even worse when that captain becomes one of the Undead Captains in the last Zog mission.

The creepy noise thing goes on....forever.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣yesss.like let’s do this already 😆
I always end up tryna speed kill the captains just so they can’t start 😂
I love their speeches especially the half tounge
Legitimate question, has anyone made a mod so that the uruk dialogue is as short as possible yet doesn’t cause any glitches?
This speaks to me on so many levels. I wish there was a "skip" feature during those monologues.
I just pack a bowl when they have long intros
Well Trump does look like an Orc so this meme fits even better. What would his title be?
    Ar-trump wall wanter
If you fail the Champion ancient warchief mission, you have to listen to his critiques all over again, both for the entrance and the weapon clash dialogue
yooww lol🤣😂🤣😂 One Uruk gave me the longest speech ever I am dead😭😂🤣 so relatable..
it’s always the infested ones, and any time you encounter them they have the same 2 dialogues.
