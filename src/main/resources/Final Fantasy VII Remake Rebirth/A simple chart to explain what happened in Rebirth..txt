[[A simple chart to explain what happened in Rebirth.]]





I accidentally glanced this post without finishing the game cause I'm stupid but luckily all i read was "Beagle Universe" so my head canon now is that there's is some kind of [Silent Hill control room dog](https://imgur.com/a/gxqHY13) situation going on that gets revealed lol
    sickos.jpg
    So you're on a reddit for a game you've not finished. That's kinda on you bud
        i said it was my bad 🤷
TIL Stamp’s breed changes based on universe. I’ve seen that empty chip packet blow passed Zack a dozen times and never clicked. 
    According to wikipedia there are 360 breeds of dog so that is the maximum number of alternate timelines.
        What if it's the same breed but a different kind of hat........there's so many hats...kutaja save us..
        I want to see St. Bernard stamp.

Jokes aside, how many breeds of SMALL dogs are there, because it only seems to be smaller dogs that are candidates to be Stamp-ed.
            The game is made in Japan after all, there's not a lot of space. Definitely not a lot of room for some golden retrievers in those 500 sq ft apartments they have to cram into.
                My european ass thinking "well damn 500 of something doesn't sound too bad, nani the hell?" and then googling the conversion into square metres. It's 46.5 square metres.

Jesus that is CRAMPED for a big dog. It'd be cramped for MY fat arse and, after conversion, I stand at an absolutely gigantic, monstruous even, "5 foot 6"(and don't say otherwise).
                    Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
                    You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
                Do you think that’s the reason why so Japanese people seem to prefer cats to dogs? Is it because they’re a better fit for their smaller apartments and/or that they don’t require as much maintenance as a dog does? 

I know that there are plenty of people in Japan who own and love dogs. I’m definitely not saying that dogs aren’t loved by the Japanese; however, it just seems *to me* that cats are the more popular pet and I’m curious as to why.
                Might have to deploy the cat stamp platoon
            St. Bernards are such good dogs. When I was 18 my best friend Tom got a puppy named Heidi. She was such a sweet girl, and when I crashed over at his place she would hop up onto the couch and sleep on top of me. 

Flash-forward to a year later when she’s a fully-grown pooch who *still had to lay on top of me* when I crashed on his couch. OUCH. She may have weighed more than I did at the time! But she was such a sweet girl that you would just let her climb onto your lap. Heidi was never my dog of course, but I miss that Very Good Girl all the same.
                I had a similar experience with a Newfoundland. Glorious beings, they are, and my grandma's was ever so sweet and would love to cuddle. I, for one, really like breathing, I'd go as far as to say I love it so much I live for it, but I made as much of an exception for that huge ball of floof even after he grew to an absolutely staggering size. He was a hugger, too. Bless that dog, he had a good life and I hope he thought I was part of what made it good, but this was when I was much younger. The only bad thing about most dogs is their lifespan. So unfair.
        Where’s my Husky universe 😀
        oh my god yes 😂
        I feel it's safe to say that there are 7 different possible timelines, considering its FFVII, Sephiroth says 7 seconds to the end, and there are a good amount of "7" references in the game.
            It's definitely lunched home way more than it needs to be lol.   Just in the costa del sol ticket quest they get tickets 7 and 77!
        It will all come full ***circle***. Which is also the shape of a planet. And a ball.
        Which means... all our headcanons are prolly canon now...
        Black Lab! Chocolate Lab! Yellow Lab! Chesapeake Golden Retriever! Australian Cattle Dog! Australian Shepherd (not actually Australian but adorable anyway)! Caviler King Charles Spaniel! German Shepherd! Burmese Mountain Dog! Staffy Pit! 

So many pooches, all good boys and good girls. 

Siiiiigh. I miss having a dog. After my Australian Cattle Dog died a few years ago I’ve been wanting to adopt a new pupper, but I’m just not ready yet. You never reallly get over losing a beloved dog or cat, or whatever pet you adore. Every time I get home from work and she’s not laying by the front door waiting for me I feel some little pain. Dogs - man’s best friend but without man’s lifespan. 

My daughter just got herself a kitten, and while he’s an adorable little turd he too will die far before she’s ready to let him go. I wish our pets could have lifespans comparable to our own! 

Back to your regularly-scheduled FFVII subreddit programming.
        Don't forget the stars on each dogs hat, maybe that denotes a number to the line, so we play in Beagle 5, and somewhere out there we will find a Beagle Prime world.

/s
        I suppose you could say multiverse theory has come... full circle! 😎

***<dies of own cringe>***
        Dog world
    I never noticed it either. 

I don't know why they are insisting on making this game so convoluted. The only thing I can think of is fan service: people like the wildly-popular Zack and Aerith, and they want them both to have a bigger role. Guess SE is willing to muddy this story further just to appease that crowd.
I found it funny how Zack is just going with the flow even though he knows nothing about what's going on and none it would make any lick of sense to him.
    we the players are zack
    I love that while he's getting universe swapped and sent to multiple boss fights at the end he takes a moment to just stop and go "what the hell is even happening right now!?"
        I was like "same bro, same"
    He had to deal with Genesis for a full game. He's used to just going with the nonsense.
    I like how even tho he doesn’t know what’s really going on, by the end of Rebirth he still arrives at a goal he needs to pursue - to somehow unite the worlds
If this is correct then you're gonna need a PHD to understand the story while playing Part 3.
    Hopefully they just focus on 1 or 2 timelines but yeah as I was watching the end, I was keeping track of the different worlds based on the dog
        Pug and Shiba universe seem mostly irrelevant and in my opinion were only used to illustrate the idea that a new universe is created with every major decision / deviation from fate. 

Spitz universe needed to be separate to make it clear that it's not just the "normal" Terrier Aerith and Cloud randomly waking up (and to give the Terrier universe a chance to continue, since Sephiroth probably kills Aerith after she gives Cloud the white Materia in that universe).

Not sure which universes ended after the Sephiroth fight, but I'd guess Terrier universe is the only one of Zack's worlds we'll see again in part 3, if any.
            But I also think Aerith’s consciousness is traveling between worlds. It’s the same Aerith in every timeline just as it’s the same Sephiroth.

I think Jessie’s theory in remake about her dad confirms this when Biggs tells Cloud the theory that his consciousness is trapped somewhere between his body and the planet. 

Aerith has the power to transition between these.
            Absolutely correct. After all, at least one planet must die to make the Meteor to traverse the Rift, and given how Zack's one is literally going to deteriorate and implode very soon... man, Square is doing everything possible to make Zack fate miserable.
            I'm thinking that the Aerith that gives Cloud the White Materia is the Aerith that had been dead in the OG timeline all the way to Advent Children.

When Seph shows up he says something like "so, this is where you've been hiding." Maybe Aerith and Seph have constantly been fighting ever since AC ended.
            Which universe is which?
I know that we have the normal timeline, the Zack timeline, the Biggs timeline (Zack in Reactor 6), the Cloud timeline (Zack in Shinra HQ) and the Aerith timeline (Zack and Sephiroth in church??) This is probably the only thing that's confusing me
                Terrier is the one we throughout the game multiple times which tells Zack's story.

Pug (Biggs) and Shiba (Zack staying at the church, wondering what to do) are only used for short scenes to show how new worlds are born.

Spitz is where the Aerith dream date happens and she gives the white Materia to Cloud.
            Outside chapter 14, Terrier is the only other one we see right?

With Spitz and Pug happening due to Zacks indecisiveness.

I knew something was "off" with Spitz Aerith, but i just thought that WAS Spitz Aerith with a bit more knowledge, though her behavior was a bit off to me as well (hell even Cloud noticed)

Didnt know ther was an "Ultimate" Aerith lol. And here i thought i was following along pretty well.
                Yeah, chapter 14 is the only one where we suddenly get a whole new pack of worlds in addition to the 2 (main and Terrier) we already knew.

"Ultimate Aerith" is just the most popular theory as to why Aerith acts the way she does in that scene. There is nothing ingame that suggests an "Ultimate Aerith" exists. Without outside knowledge, we are just supposed to notice that Aerith is acting weird and not as she usually does.  
We'll probably learn more about that in Part 3.

            Nomura didnt write this lol
            Nojima is the writer lmfao
    This is correct, but what this post doesn’t mention is that all of these other timelines are doomed to die or already have. I personally think that most of the other timelines shown in Rebirth were just to explain how different choices create different existences. But I highly doubt any of those other realities actually matter. The only timelines that will likely have any effect going forwards are the main one, which ever one Zack is alive in, and if there is one where Aerith lived.
        One idea I'm interested in is that, if the lifestream gets "spread" over every new timeline created, then it's entirely possible Sephiroth hopes to spread it so thin that it can't possibly defend against meteor.
            I think Meteor is a red herring now, and I'm convinced of this because of the added lore changes about the Gi and their situation.

They created the Black Materia because they wanted to end their suffering of being stuck in spiritual form. The Lifestream won't accept them because they're alien in nature. Sephiroth, because of the nature of his creation, is also set apart from The Lifestream. He is stuck between his body and the planet, so he can't really do anything except possess bodies that have Jenova cells in them.

In one of the side stories Aerith (the one in The Lifestream) mentions that Sephiroth is still there even after his defeat, but she describes that The Lifestream "washes off his back like rain", so Sephiroth is trapped in some kind of limbo in his afterlife.

The Sephiroth we're seeing in Remake/Rebirth may not want the same thing as he did in the OG story. The whole "become a god" thing could just be him manipulating the party.
                It also crossed my mind as well that that could be the case.  What's interesting with the new Black Materia lore is that it doesn't necessarily summon Meteor per say, it works to enact "destruction" per the will of the user. 

The Gi intended to use it to destroy their spirits thus relieving them of their tormented state and Sephiroth needed it to cause a wound so great to the planet it would take the entirety of the Lifestream to heal.

That being said, Sephiroths greatest weaknesses, despite his power, is his obsession with carrying out Jenovas Will and his utter inability to perceive anyone else as a threat. I'd reckon that despite this Sephiroth obviously having knowledge he shouldn't have, he's still trying to get to the same destination through a different road.

I think it would be rather poetic that, despite the ability to actually change his destiny, Sephiroth refuses to actually learn from his experiences and correct his mistakes.
                    I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
                        I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
                            If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
                                I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                                    I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
            I had the same thought when Sephiroth sent his whispers to dry out a mako spring in cosmo canyon as seen in bugenhagen’s side quest. We never see him do stuff like that in the original and he also didn’t have whispers then so I strongly believe that it’s part of his plan. Sephiroth knows exactly how he lost in the original and is trying his hardest to mitigate each factor (such as pitting Shinra and Wutai against each other so Rufus is too distracted to destroy the Northern Crater barrier with the Sister Ray)
                The dark whispers are still fascinating to me because it's hard to tell if they're directly under aephiroths control or if sephiroth has potentially manipulated them into trying to enforce an alternate "destiny." Possibly a universe where Sephiroth has already won. Then again, they may just be representing the lifestream that Sephiroth and Jenova have already corrupted.
        There’s a hundred percent a timeline where Aerith lives.  The game touches on this timeline the absolute least amount of time.  You see glimpses of it in the very first moment shown after he deflects masamune but the game quickly shifts to all the other timelines where he didn’t, including he main timeline where he apparently deflected masamune but not completely.

After all the battles, it revisits this one single timeline again, where Cloud tells Aerith to wake up.   I firmly believe in this timeline, the rest of the party is either lost to the void or is still blocked by whispers.  It’s hard to say without a whole third game to explain the outcome properly so, see you in four years.
    Not really, short of it is an Aerith can see all realities is trying to save us from the life stream and Sephiroth who can also see all realities is trying to stop her. 

She's now enlisted Cloud to help her, since he can see all the realities now and Aerith.

We'll likely get a convergence event in the next game that will flatten the story since Sephiroth is trying to create a convergence.
    This still stuff this doesn’t explain though

Why do the whispers try to stop us from leaving Midgar when they want to us to follow the originals plot before Sephiroth controls them. Why do the white whispers constantly flip between working with us and against us?
    It's not that complicated. Just remember that different choices create alternate timelines. Each timeline is a product of a wayward choice. An infinitely branching future. Zack chose 3 different things and created 3 different timelines. Zack surviving itself was its own timeline. Now Zack's goal is to unite all timelines and save everyone.
        So Zack chose 3 different things, alright cool but what does it have to do with the story? remake, and rebirth still pretty much have the same outcome as the OG.
            Did you just not pay attention to the ending? He literally says that he wants to reunite all the timelines to save everyone. That's his goal. This means that he could reunite the timelines in which everyone is alive and beat Sephiroth together. Zack's whole segment was setting him up to be this being that the lifestream had chosen to fix the world by saving everyone to defeath Sephiroth. He keeps getting saved by the white whispers. The white whispers from what we know seem to represent the planet and the lifestream. 


Maybe he succeeds, maybe he doesn't. Regardless his part isn't over yet. Him and cloud will definitely interact in the future. Aerith will also still play a huge part. I suspect the final boss battle's party will consist of Zack Cloud and Aerith regardless of whether they are all truly alive in the main timeline or not.

So while Cloud is off finding Sephiroth, Zack will be trying to figure out how to reunite the timelines.
                Maybe Zack is just a marketing strategy, a way to interest Zack fans into buying the game. Have you ever thought about that?

This whole defy fate or multiverse stuffs and the story still ended up the same as the OG. No need to try brain storming this shit cause it is wasted anyway.
                    Believe what you want to.
    You got 5 years, you can make it if you start now
    Please. This is basic KH
What we saw in Zack's world was shown to us as a visual demonstration of what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. Which was to say that different choices create new universes through their outcomes. This aligns perfectly with what the developers said in the Remake Ultimania where they identified Terrier Stamp to Zack's victory.

So I don't think the point was to focus on all the different timelines. Rather it was to show that they co-exist. However, the main focus  was/is the Terrier and Beagle timelines. Because they are seemingly intertwined with each other. Marlene still remembers Aerith, Biggs remembers Ex-SOLDIER Cloud. We heard the same news broadcasts in both worlds. So whatever is happening to the Terrier timeline is related to what happens (or what will happen) in the Beagle timeline. Because all worlds are doomed to fade.
    Yes, but Biggs is unique. In his case, another universe was not created where he survived, but HE himself was transported from the timeline of the Beagle to the timeline of the Terrier. That's why he has memories of another universe that others don't have. Is this done for something important? To be honest, I think it's just a trick to confuse us. And as for Marlin, the "touch" with Aerith could happen in all timelines, because we see that events went about the same way without Cloud, the only difference is that the journey ended in defeat.
        I don't see why the Whispers saved Biggs, but not Wedge. Plus the wanted poster with just Biggs left. Was that just to give Zack a guide and link to Beagle?
            What I got from it is that the "prime" consciousness of Biggs simply redistributed itself because a world now exists in which he survived.
        Events didn't go the same way without Cloud, Cloud was there. Marlene remembers him, Biggs remembers him, the Shinra troopers at the very start of the game talk about the last member being an ex-Soldier with a buster sword who's missing.
        But those scenes demonstrated that these worlds are related to Zack and the choices he makes.

In the corkscrew tunnel scene. We saw a flashback of Marlene describing Sephiroth as the scary man. **Then the camera pans over to the White Materia as** **Minerva's theme plays for about 10 seconds**. Following this, we see Zack with Terrier graffiti behind him as decides to enter the right tunnel to Shinra HQ. Then we see a lifestream burst out of the tunnel which Zack would have entered to save Biggs.

Following that we see both outcomes. Shinra HQ leads Zack to face the Shinra Army, so he buzzes off on his motorcycle.

Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

In addition, we see another possible outcome where Zack never made a choice and he's sitting on the Church steps. This is yet another timeline (Corgi). And Sephiroth vanquishes him with his whispers.

I bolded the Minerva part because that's a big clue. Holy does what it does based on the will of the planet. And Minerva is the will of the lifestream and thus has the power to defy destiny as she demonstrated in Crisis Core.

&#x200B;

All of that said. I am not defending how those scenes were depicted. Just breaking them down.
            >Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

Except that isn’t what we saw. He isn’t wearing the ribbon. Which they specifically focus on.
                Biggs had a bag of Stamp's Champs with a Pug Stamp on the front. Then he said the reactor is sucking up dirt because the lifestream is bone dry. So what do you mean that isn't what we saw?
                    I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
                        I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
                            >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
                                And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                                    That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
            Don't forget the will of the Goddess is mentioned in Loveless which may be a spoiler for Minerva. Also, the puppet of fate which most likely alludes to Cloud.
                They drove the LOVELESS stuff pretty hard. They changed the poem for the US localisation, but it remained the same in the Japanese.
            >This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

"Every choice creates a timeline but if it's not the mysterious and arbitrary 'correct' choice then your whole timeline is doomed and slowly dissolves lmao get fucked. You can pop into the main timeline to help a bit but you're still ultimately doomed" is a rules system for time travel that is used by exactly *Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,* *Homestuck,* and basically nothing else. There's no way that's not just a weird coincidence, even if FF7R and HS are *also* both meta stories about the concept of canon, but I want to believe.
        Yeah, and then Biggs still fucking died, so what was the point of bringing him back? Looks like Zack ended up dying too.
        Biggs in another world is to pave the way to Zach entering the main world.
        Agree with all you said here, small side note the news broadcast is not the exact same. In the beginning of the game (Terrier timeline) the reporter pauses his words when he almost walks into Shinra truck driving on the road. In Kalm (now back in Beagle timeline) on the radio version, this pause is not there.
    Remake is coming out, nobody understands anything 

but thank god there are the ultimanias that you can buy later so you can read what the hell happened in the remake 

passive skill on FF7 lore +3 
which are useful for Reddit discussion 

Anyone who hasn't read the Ultimanias is at a disadvantage muhahahahahaha 

Marketing 10/10
        Basically 
    > different choices create new universes through their outcomes. This aligns perfectly with what the developers said in the Remake Ultimania where they identified Terrier Stamp to Zack's victory.

The difference here is that Zack's victory didn't come at the cost of him or Shinra soldiers making a choice. It simply happened to him a binary  way. He was losing and then he wasn't.


Which is a great problem, because now it breeds confusion if that is intentional, or simply poor writing not taking these things into account.
        So, this is my theory. It was intentional but not by Zack's choice. It was lifestream Aerith's choice to save Zack as fate was killed.

All through Remake, Sephiroth is trying to manipulate us into destroying fate and to go against the whispers, which keep the timeline in order by the planet. That way there is only one world. In Beagle world, we destroyed fate which spawned many worlds including Spitz world, because the whispers were no longer keeping everything guided along a singular path.

Zack said he was losing surrounded by Shinra, felt a gust of wind and then he just wasn't. You, the player, get to see the whispers are that gust of wind and that they altered the bullet to barely nick his cheek, with a rainbow like effect signaling it was an act of lifestream Aerith. But not only was he saved, he was also whisked into a world (Spitz world) where the battle against Fate was ending, which is why it seems like there is some weird overlap of end of crisis core leading to end of midgar.

\---------------

To explain their powers:

We know that lifestream Sephiroth and lifestream Aerith have the power to not only send people to and from Worlds, but also to affect the worlds those people are in.

As Jenova dies after the Aerith death, we see the white whispers circling the party, again more rainbow like effects popping up. It then cuts to Zack walking in a bunch of white, and the white whispers show up with Cloud with more rainbow like effects emanating from Cloud. Zack touches him and they pop out in a fight with Sephiroth. 

After the battle with Cloud and Zack, Sephiroth slashes his sword and says "Just as Worlds unite, so too do they part", and Zack gets sent to a World with meteor crashing down on the World in the background. We cut back to the party that just killed Jenova and there is no sign of Cloud which shows that white Whispers took him and sent him to Zack. The party even asks "Any sign of him? Do you think the whispers got him? Did they take him somewhere?" So, the power of bringing people to and from worlds is confirmed.

Now, during Zack's fight with meteor in the background, a random circle will pop up that will heal you if you are in it and shield you from an attack. With Aerith not presumably around in this world, it means lifestream Aerith is helping him in this battle. I know it's a weak argument on how they can affect worlds, but this would explain how she was able to alter the bullet that saved Zack in the first place.

\-----------------

So back to the theory, as he arrives at Midgar in Spitz world, this is a world where Avalanche failed in their fight and ended up unconscious after the fight. Because they didn't defeat fate, Aerith's white materia in this world remained active and didn't get drained like the Beagle world, where Aerith confirmed beating fate caused it to lose it's color.

Presumably, seeing this, lifestream Aerith then plots a plan to save Zack, and brought him to the Spitz world so that Zack would bring Cloud to Midgar, knowing that he would bring Cloud close to where she is because she knows he would check up on her. This is so that later on, she can also bring "Cloud 1" to the Spitz world while lifestream Aerith can inhabit the Aerith body there. She gives Cloud the white matera to then take back to his Aerith in the beagle world.
        >The difference here is that Zack's victory didn't come at the cost of him or Shinra soldiers making a choice. It simply happened to him a binary  way. He was losing and then he wasn't.

&#x200B;

  It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

  

>Which is a great problem, because now it breeds confusion if that is intentional, or simply poor writing not taking these things into account.

I am not defending that scene in the slightest. I have very mixed feelings about it personally. It feels like alot of important context was cut from the final product in a last minute revision. Because it does feel like it wasn't thought through very well.
            > It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear. Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there. Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense. 


Why aren't we just making some choices that lead to a good, uncorrupted Sephiroth coming to help us? Why aren't any of these decisions leading to other events even further in the past changing? Like Gast's fate, or Ifalna? Or Vincent and Lucrecia?


It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation.
                >Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear.

&#x200B;

I didn't move the definition. I said both choices and outcomes from the beginning. The very first one starts with Zack's victory. We are told that Terrier Stamp symbolizes that. Then in the span of  10 minutes we see several other Stamp breeds that reflect different outcomes based on his decision. Because the point was to show us how Zack is effecting these worlds. 

&#x200B;

> Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there.

Sephiroth divulged everything at the TofA scene. So that is what it is. There are infinite possible worlds based on what Sephiroth said. But we're not going to explore all of those worlds. We're only exploring the ones that matter and that's the one where Zack, Marlene, and Elmyra are in. 

The point here isn't so much what was shown as it is why it was shown. The message intended for the audience. To visually demonstrate what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. How each choice leads to a different outcome, and thus a new universe that is doomed from the start. 

&#x200B;

> Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense.   
>  
>It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation. 

 Think back to what we saw in those cutscenes. Several different worlds that are near the end. Now think about what Sephiroth said. "Each of these worlds are bound to the planet as one". Hence, these worlds are dying because the planet is dying. So it's not a situation where Zack can just zip in and out of timelines til he finds the best one. Because they're all doomed. 

 The other question is whether or not this multiverse is something that is supposed to exist, or something that is a result of a corrupted lifestream. While it seems like the latter would be the case, Dirge has some crazy shit that makes you wonder. And the last two chapters of Rebirth were on par with that.
This is “simple” 😂
    Yeah this needs a  text explanation with it or the chart needs to be organized in a way that you know where to start looking at it.
    Honestly I think even this makes it more complicated than it needs to be lol
        Agreed!

I'm sticking with 'dream aerith gives Cloud a full white materia which he swaps for real aerith's empty one, allowing real aerith to summon holy and become schroedingers aerith just in time for part 3.'
    It would have been a lot simpler if they just fucking killed her.
        I mean technically they still did
            And also didn’t as we see another timelime get created by cloud deflecting sephiroth’s sword, with the rainbow effect on it as well, then for some reason we get transported back to a timeline featuring dead aerith

What I dislike about this ending is how fucking hard to understand it is, I get that they were going for a “this isn’t the same as the original” type of vibe, to entice you to play it even if you think ypu already know everything, but if they really wanted to do that then saving aerith would have achieved a significant “how are things gonna change next?” effect without this much of a mess
                My theory is that timelines were created at the fall of the Cetra empire, maybe as some means to actually pacify Jenova, confusing it or whatever as a last ditch effort to stave off obliteration (this is almost directly referenced in the game, as it is never fully explained why Jenova decided to just take a big ol nap). These timelines have coexisted for millenia, in some status quo of reality always at the edge of complete destruction. These timelines are powered by the lifestream (again for some reason related to pacifying Jenova). Shinra siphoning off mako has weakened the separation of realities, as the lifestream can no longer fully support them all at once. Aerith, as the last Cetra, actually exists as a single soul among all concurrent timelines. It would make sense that if the Cetra created these branches, they can walk across them at will. This is why she is aware of her imminent death after communing fully with her ancient ancestors, that if she dies in one timeline, she will die in all of them, she is a single soul. This would make the strange dead-not-dead Aerith scene make sense. If it isn't some version of this, all hope is lost lol. But this is what I gathered from my playthrough and what is being eluded to. We will see I guess.
            I mean technically after they did she was with cloud fighting sephiroth so, no.
        They did, I take it as cloud is so broken right now he can’t comprehend her being gone, I think when Tifa walked up to see the aftermath is flashed to show cloud covered in blood, then quickly back to his version where he wasn’t
    My sentiments exactly 😄
Christ I hate multiverse stuff
    Same here. Can't believe they had to muddle the story with this crap.
    Nomura did what he always wanted since the beggining.

He transformed FF7 fans into Kingdom Hearts fans.  This is what Kingdom Hearts fans have to deal with on a daily basis, lol.
        Nomura: THAT WAS NOJIMA!  NOT ME!
        What if you got into Kingdom Hearts because you're an FF7 fan. Do people just forget that KH came out after FF7
        Idk I'm a die hard kh fan could tell you the whole story and this game confused tf outta me
    It’s only because to western standards, Marvel and DC hammered the audience on what their version of them are. The remake trilogy was developed before they went all in on this concept so Square are late to the punch making it seemed boring.
        I think this is a bit reductive. Time travel and multiverse shit has been a plague on franchises for longer than just the last decade of comic book movies lol
            and even prior to their return in Cinema, they had already been plaguing 2000s era television series

SE did this because they wanted to jump on a trend, something theyve been doing for the better part of 2 decades. they arent the only devs, JP or otherwise, who do this either. Bayonetta 3 sullied its series future with this uncalled for embrace as well
            Chrono Cross did multiverse way back when, that story didn't make a lot of sense by the end either.
        They definitely saw that the multiverse was popular when they were developing remake and were like “hey let’s do that” and ironically when Rebirth came out everyone was sick of the multiverse already lmao
            EXACTLY.
    If you think about it Final Fantasy has always been a multiverse. Many different worlds sharing the same creatures, monsters, deities, summons, etc.
    Tbf only two rly matter right now still, I don’t think the others are going to matter as much
I look at this expecting a big revelation, but Im so confused that I don’t think this counts as a spoiler
    Same thing happened with Kingdom Hearts 3.

The entire plot leaked a week earlier but everyone was so confused by it that they thought it was a shitpost or something and didn't even considered it spoilers.
        They didn’t get the Yozora reveal though. That was the only surprise.
        ok thats funny.
The Neon Genesis Evangelion comparisons are inevitable but fitting.
    I remember when Remake reviews came out in 2020 and there was comparisons to the Rebuild of Evangelion films being thrown around. That sure turned out to be very accurate.
        Man, Imagine if Nomura pulls a Evangelion and Cloud doesn't end up with neither Tifa or Aerith but with Jessie. That would be a certified Evangelion middle finger moment, ha-ha, but I don't think they are brave enough.
            I want Zack to end up with Cissnei, dammit!
    Yep called it a week ago
        For what it's worth some people were saying that when Remake came out. Made me also think of Star Trek (2009) and how that film is also kind of a "in universe reboot" that sits alongside the main timeline and they interact with eachother.
    Only difference is, the Rebuilds didn't use all these multiverse shenanigans to justify changes to the story. >!Even though its theorized that Rebuild is part of a continuing cycle of Shinji trying to get it right!< The changes were made and it stood on it as its own thing.
        Isn't there a line in the third one where someone outright says "This has all happened before?"
            Kaworu I believe.
    Absolutely 
Shinra 100% lose to Wutai in the pug universe. A pug stamp aint winning any battles
    Bro's gonna curl up in a corner breathing heavily with a rasp after running towards the ship to Wutai, wouldn't even make it ON the ship and be left behind.
        😂😂
    “Pug universe” lmao
Wait y'all telling me this is not a shitpost?
![gif](giphy|APqEbxBsVlkWSuFpth|downsized)
Call me crazy and perhaps old fashion, but I thought saving the planet was a big and worthy enough goal. But the devs wanted to jump on the Multiverse train at a time when people have grown very sick of it.

The introduction of a multiverse almost always ruins any story it touches. It completely throws stakes out the window, it's confusing, it undermines any meaningful character changes or deaths, and it makes it harder to engage with the plot in any real emotional way. This chart, and all this theory crafting, and whatever 4D Chess the devs are trying to play here, are not nearly as emotionally engaging as a simple quiet scene of the life of a girl you loved being snuffed out in front of you.
    Felt weird playing 80 hours of an incredibly solidly crafted experience only to have it land in such a clusterfuck. Like, I love the rest of the game, but there’s no other way to put it
        To say it suddenly landed in a clusterfuck is putting our heads in the sand. Every scene with Zack was building up to what we saw at the end. 

I personally felt so unsatisfied. They showed everything in trailers, left nothing to the imagination, all while refusing to commit to anything with emotional consequence.

In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.
            Yeah that scene hurt! His personal trial with Myrna was painful too.

With Aerith? Meh. Apparently death isn't final, which cheapens the emotional impact this scene originally had.
            I skipped most of the trailers, so I don’t quite have the same experience, but I agree they were clearly setting up something, but I didn’t expect it all to come out during what is supposed to be an emotional gut punch, I really thought they respected the OG enough to let that scene breathe more, but idk. And i actually don’t agree that you can’t tell a complicated story like this well, imo 13 Sentinels is a great example of a seemingly super complex story that has a really clean resolution. But it feels like they chose a terrible moment to execute on their grand ideas.
            >In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.

kinda funny to me because to me it was one of the most butched parts.

i mean not to defend all the multiverse nonsense but at least there they are going for change. but the small changes around Dyne and Barrets situation ruins it for me. fuck of with Dyne being a barely fuctioning mad man. when he was a broken but fuctional man in the OG that was so much harder hitting. the only hint that he was mentally unwell was hearing the voice of his wife but even that he knew was delusions. and the game can fuck right of with the action scene of Shinra showing up right after.
            You really shouldn't watch Square Enix trailers within about 6 months of the release of a game, they ALWAYS do this.

Also there were tonnes more scenes than just Dyne vs Barret that hit right, the multiverse stuff only infected the story at the end.
        I mean, did you not see the signs while playing the rest of the game? The introduced many clusterfucks along the way.
    >not nearly as emotionally engaging as a simple quiet scene of the life of a girl you loved being snuffed out in front of you.

You nailed it.
    Nah you're right. They're overcomplicating the story and significantly damaging it.
    Nail on the fucking head.

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO FUCKING DONE WITH MULTIVERSAL FATE STORIES.

If nothing is permanent or binding or unique, then everything is meaningless.

Pepe Silvia couldn't work this shit out for them.

![gif](giphy|l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA|downsized)

Save the cheerleader, save the world. Or don't. Doesn't matter, multiverse Heroes and timey wimpy bullshit will save the day anyway.
    I don't think you are meant to save the multiverse. The question, I think, is what single universe all this mess will settle into once the dust is cleared. The one we all know where Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus follow up FFVII, or another one where things go more according to what Sephiroth would have wanted.

Considering AC is supposedly canon to the Remake timeline the answer is clear.
        We're told all the branching universes are doomed, they don't matter.
    Cant say anything except that I totally agree with you. Of course I wasn’t expecting a 1:1 recreation of the og but at this point, as you said, any meaningful character deaths that had real effect on the story and its characters was totally lost.
    Agreed 100%.

The only reason why I cried during Rebirth Aerith's death scene was because the music reminded me of OG's. I've played OG hundreds of times since 1997, and the emotional impact of that scene has left an impression on me lifelong. That was an iconic scene, one of the most famous heart-breaking scenes in all of RPG history, and Rebirth butchered it:

- We didn't see Sephy impale her bc Cloud deflected (lolwut)
- Aerith came back to "fight" against Sephy (Bizzaro Sephiroth, no less! tf?)
- Aerith "woke up" in Zack's timeline, meaning she's dead in the main timeline? But she didn't feel dead at all.
- Her continued presence with Cloud (during the fight, then later at the Tiny Bronco) made her feel alive still, and again not dead at all.
- There was no water burial, with her descending to the bottom (like OG)
- Cloud didn't cry and hold her, cursing Sephiroth before the Jenova fight like he did in OG. That was an extremely emotional scene I would have liked to hear acted.
- Aerith's Holy materia did not glow pale green, implying that she never summoned Holy. Her only prayer was to "keep her friends safe"; said nothing about protecting the planet, etc.

How could they leave out so many key parts to such a pivotal scene?
        This is exactly my problem with it.   All wishy washy switch’s universe bullshit.  It didn’t have any of the emotional impact that I was expecting.
    Hoping multiverse drawbacks such as low stakes are rectified a bit if there aren’t infinite worlds as such, but only new ones spawned at these key moments. But these new ones are short lived. And also, that all the worlds are just really within the lifestream so it’s a bit more contained conceptually
    yeah i'm with you 100%, i hate multiverse crap
I think they are building up to "There is only one possible solution that allows the planet to be saved, and that solution involves sacrifice."  Aerith wanted to 'have it all', but she is learning that might not be possible.
    This is my thought. This is all leading back to the original ending. The timelines are going to get converged (probably by Sephiroth), the main party is going to have to sacrifice something/someone (like having alt-Aerith and alt-Zack die, truly, the way they were supposed to), and the moral will be that you can’t outrun destiny and try to have all of the good with none of the bad. Same ending, different journey to get there. 

That, or it goes 110% wild and has a totally different ending and plot. I’m about 50/50 on that, as it is Nomura we are talking about.
        But if it will end the same way, then less is more.  They should have left out all of the garbage and told the excellent story of the original with more content (like they have been doing 99% of the time).
This whole situation feels awfully close to "It was alllllll a dream", with a bonus of being needlessly complicated.

Not a fan.
    At the end of part 3, the camera pans out from the Northern Crater while scrolling text explains that Cloud died in the first reactor explosion.
        With this music blasting in the background: [https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58](https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58)
        One of the funniest posts here 😀
    Ultimate Antagonist Sephiroth ruining Aerith's death scene for the player with Whispers is the greatest unintentional self-insert by a creator in the history of games.
        Considering how significant that scene was, not only to FF7 but to gaming, it might be, no joke
    That's because multiple timelines, being done poorly like this, leaves the narrative weightless, just like "it was all just a dream".
        Ironically they even made Sephiroth say to the player at one point basically ”this makes no sense now right? It’s probably just a dream or something”… *sigh*
    It better not be. I’m still salty the original ending is a bad ending and it all leads to Advent Children. Then what’s the point of this fate shit?
        The point was solely to keep you anticipating Rebirth and now the 3rd part for four years. As stated by the developers multiple times.
            So false advertising and a lie? Also a Paradox since it's strong hinted that this is AC Sephiroth messing with everything to begin with.
    totally agree that it's needlessly complicated but it's not exactly a retcon or an out....the implication is not only is it not a dream, but that there's no outrunning the events of the OG even by hopping universes.
    Nah it isnt a dream and you shouldnt focus on all the different timelines just know that they co exist and are doomed to fade
        I don't mean it's literally a dream, I mean it's just a poor writing trope that allows for pretty much any kind of nonsense with little or no consequence, regardless of whether it fits with the currently established universe - which this whole thing really doesn't.
            It doesnt? How tho? Cus it has been established since one game ago
I’m not a fan of multiverses or alternate realities either, and yes, I had to look up “Rebirth Ending Explained” in order to get a better understanding of it all. However, here are the two conclusions I ended up with:

1. The changes that were made have created an all new FF7 experience for OG fans. They managed to recapture the thrill and wonder that we had when we played the original FF7 for the first time. That’s a hell of an achievement. 

2. Even if you don’t like the direction of the new narrative, look at the product as a whole. That was top notch gaming. Side quests were intriguing and fun. There was a much broader open world to explore. And they poured a ton of creativity into the vast number of mini games to play. 

I just hope they get the third one to us quicker. Haha
Ff7 shouldn’t require a chart to follow. Wtf have they done?
    Its really simple. Dont concentrate on all the diff timelines
        I had to rewatch the ending two times to filter out what was a different timeline and what wasn't with aerith on screen. That shouldn't happen when your making as big of a moment as a character death. Confusion isn't good storytelling at pivotal moments.
            They actually ruined the most famous death scene in all of gaming man…I can’t believe what I watched lmao
                Anyone expecting them to just straightforwardly kill her wasn't reading the writing on the wall. I don't think a complicated story is inherently bad. But yeah you can argue execution wasn't great in some ways but "ruined " her death seems pretth strong.  I'm still very interested to see where it goes.
                    I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
                        I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
                        They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
                        I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
                            Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
                    Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
        Honestly this is what I've been doing. The different world shit feels so pointless because it doesn't really accomplish anything for the central narrative of the original. Only time it became impossible to ignore for me is the ending of Rebirth. That scene was too important to drag down with all the multiverse stuff
    When the creator of "Kingdom Hearts" is in charge of the whole series, what else can you expect?
        He was also part of the original team and the story writer is also the same, stop playing nomura for every decision, it's tiring
        Nomura is the one reining them all in. He isn't the one making all these wacky choices for the games he directs.

He said recently that he see his name being blamed for certain choices online but didn't even write most of them
        He was against changes
            bet
this is still so confusing and stupid. Why couldnt they just keep all this convoluted stuff out:/
    As much as I love how faithful this remake is, sort of wish they wouldn't do the whole timeline stuff. I love the remake project and everything about it but,  
It's so overrated nowadays to do the whole timeline universe thing, it creates plot holes that can easily be fixed with another timeline.
I love when you need a chart to try and understand the horrible convoluted ending
    And the funny thing is, it's not even the ending. I have no idea what really happened at the end, there are only assumptions that are not supported by anything.
        I have no faith the ending will be good, as remake and rebirth were both fantastic games that completely and utterly butchered the ending. If the third one follows 90% of the original then fucks the ending I’ll call it a win as I did with rebirth. At least this time I expected a garbage ending and was pleasantly surprised for the most part there wasn’t too much horrible multiverse shit through it haha
Aerith is actually dr strange explaining how there were however many scenarios, only 1 where they succed. That's this shit lmao
    lmfao... It's going to be a real plotline guarantee it
Someone explain to me how this cluster fuck of multiverses makes the story better?
    It doesn't. It's Nojima. He has never heard the concept of "less is more". For him, the more effort he puts into weaving a convoluted story together, the better that story is.
    ![gif](giphy|q49YSnLzrvghiyKBAR|downsized)
    It's terrible.
Let's just say. No one asked for a multiverse story remake of an already established solid story.
    It seems the original story was considered "too simple" by Square. I mean, I was just set in a fantasy world, featuring supernatural and genetically modified people. It was only about an alien (that was wrongly considered as ancient inhabitant of the planet) and was subject to not one but two Jenova projects. It was about chasing the dead body of that alient through the world (but without head and constantly appearing in the form of someone else, who is actually frozen in a crater). It was only about life after death. And it was only about a main character who is confusing himself with his friend, leading to a great twist in the middle of the game that basically changes the whole story. A major part of the information was given more implicitly than explicitly (my 10-years old me back in 1997 was just wondering why Cloud has sometimes black hair).

Obviously, the original plot was far too simple and boring. The two timelines introduced in Remake were not sufficient either because everybody expected them already. It needed arbitrary many timelines, but of course with intersections and characters moving between them. I am wondering what they could add in the third part to keep it interesting.
    No one asked for Advent Children either, or Crisis Core and yet they were created and added things to the setting and story
        At least those things didn’t retroactively harm or touch the original game, and had a few redeemable aspects. Rebirth just straight up changed the most iconic moment of the game for the worse
            Well, OG is still there for you it can't retroactively harm the original game in any way since it never did leave open ends that weren't resolved prior to Remake and now Rebirth, you are just being dramatic.


Also btw, Remake and Rebirth also have "redeemable" aspects since it did a lot of things better than the OG as well as went deeper in various different story beats and world building the original FF7 couldn't focus too much on due to technical limitations of the time
Kingdom hearts 3 all over again....WHY?WHY? I wish the meme of the dog with the BONK was real, only for him to stop Nomura and his clusterfuck of ideas.

KH 3 all over again, this man does not know how to make endings without cliffhangers (bad ones)...sign.....
    The third game is surely named FFVII Re:Connect
    Please do some research before complaining. This was not Nomura’s doing.
It's also worth noting that these don't seem to be full universes as much as they're like some weird pocket of probability or possibility.

Zack's death happened a good month or two before the Reactor 1 mission, but neither Zack nor Biggs can quite get their bearings on how much time has passed anymore.

Also, each new fractured world created appears to be collapsing. They're not supposed to exist, so the new versions are unstable and on the verge of ending already. So, it's not like these are different timelines where happy events played out instead of the original tragic story. These are basically just outcomes that Sephiroth can jump through for whatever he's doing.
     that was my interpretation as well but is going to be impossible to have a proper discussion around here. I'm baffled by how much people are misinterpreting everything.
Basically, you need to play the Original game to understand this, no way people still are saying “you don’t need to play the original”
    The remake trilogy would've benefitted massively from being self-contained. The only way to be surprised by the "twists" is if you're already going into this trilogy with certain expectations born from the original. This is obscenely shortsighted.  Imagine a newcomer playing Remake/Rebirth 30 years from now. The tonal/thematic shifts at the end will leave them confused. They'd then have to spend time researching what the fuck is happening, only to discover the endings were contingent on the presumed knowledge of a now 60-year-old game. It will immediately make the trilogy's story look like a product of its time instead of something timeless like the original.

I'm so frustrated by the shortsightedness of this trilogy. This was Square's chance to tell the story of Final Fantasy VII exactly how they wanted to tell it nearly 30 years ago. Now they're blowing it on multiverse hogwash because that's what's trendy. This trilogy will not have the same longevity as the original because as time goes on, less and less people will understand the endings because less and less people will have played the original Final Fantasy VII.
        I hope square knows that FF7 OG roms will be downloaded for years to come because of this lol
    You also need to play Remake. No idea why they were advertising Rebirth as a standalone experience lol.
        Why would you need to play the original for this? I mean I have, but why do you need to?
            I think you need at least a basic understanding of the original FF7 story to get the full experience from Remake and Rebirth. 

You can still enjoy them without, but I just think you’re missing something. They’re not remakes, I think that they’re pretty clearly sequels to the original story in a way.
                They're sequels? Aren't they reimaginations?
                    Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
        Because they needed sales since PS5 hasn't sold nearly as well as PS4
Huh... so you're saying in the Zack timeline where Cloud/Aerith wake up, that isn't "Remake" Aerith, but actually the OG/Lifestream Aerith? Which is why she seemingly knows everything again?

Two questions in that case:

- Was this whole timeline plot just so we could get Holy back to the main (Beagle) timeline?
- Why did Holy lose its power in the first place? Did Sephiroth do that via the Whispers?
    Fighting Fate 
/the Whispers drained it. The only thing I'm not getting from this is how they are supposed to permanently stop Sephiroth if he's capable of what he's doing now. Him and Aerith are pretty much trying to play chess against each other, but they keep starting side games.
        It sounded to me like the Whispers 'took away' both Aerith/Red's memories of the future AND Holy's power... I just don't know why they took away Holy? The memories make sense since they shouldn't have known the future in the first place... But Holy was always a part of the story. That's why I'm thinking it was Sephiroth's influence/plan to drain it?
            In the cutscene with Aerith and Red at johnnys hotel in costa del sol, it is explained that materia get their powers from the memories of the ancients stored within it, the whispers steal memories, during remake it got entirely drained of its memories
            Could it not have been Sepiroth who got the whispers to take away holy and their memories?
                That's my guess. Sephiroth gained control of the black whispers at the end of Remake and probably took both things away immediately.
It's so simple!
My God they made FF7 messy. They really should've saved this weird multiverse fate destiny energy they had to work out for an FF8 remake, where it'd actually be thematically appropriate. Good on OP for compiling this, but this multiverse stuff is not only not enhancing the story of FF7, but actively detracting from it.
    Eh, OG FF7 gets already messy at times. This is just the second course. Still better than Genesis.
        Never to this extent though, not even close. There's a lot going on in ff7 but it's all pretty straightforward and explained by the end of the game
            So is this
                The difference is this is trash, and the og wasn't.
                    lol nah.
            I mean, why are we assuming that by the end of part 3 the story won't also be explained? That said, the OG is not quite straightforward when you go into the details. Like the whole "Zack and Cloud memories mixed because they both got experimented and got Jenova's cells implanted in their bodies" or plot holes like Tifa not saying anything about the Nibelheim incident to Cloud (which THANK GOD Rebirth actually adress it) or Shinra sending Sephiroth to Nibelheim despite that being obviously a terrible idea as they knew Jenova was kept there. Plus some important info that could be easily missed (like the whole "is Sephiroth or Jenova in control?" which the answer is given subtly by Hojo when he's like "I thought the decayed Soldiers were going toward Jenova, but if it's not her, then...")
                FF7 isn't perfect, but multiverse instantly makes things messy. There's nothing about the original story of 7 that anybody should ever need a visual aid for though.
                    They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
                        I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
                            And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
                                Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                                    Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
                I'm less annoyed by things not being explained yet and more annoyed by not being able to take in the death scene without being completely confused what was real and what wasn't. Made it emotionless for me, which isn't good writing.
                IDK I feel like the messiest part of OG 7 was the whole debate on if it was really Sephiroth or Jenova illusions in charge for majority of the game (up until northern crater) -- Which is nothing in comparison to 7Re
                    There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
                        Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
        Don't confuse OG FF7 with the compilation bs. Nobody likes Genesis either, btw.
            I didn't? I meant between Remake stuff and the whole stuff with Genesis from the compilation, I'd still take Remake over it. Ff7 can be messy like with the whole mixed memory plot line.
        But it always felt like the confusing stuff was all in some book or file you’d have to find somewhere, and not shoved in your face in the middle of what is supposed to be an impactful character death. Like, maybe I’d be a little happier if they let the death play out as normal in full and then just explain the actual plot in exposition afterwards, cause the way characters in game talk about all this shit is way too vague, I need it spoon-fed to me if they want to make it so complicated.
Square Enix, was this really necessary?
I'm so tired of fucking square shitting up plots with metaphysical dimensioning hoping confusing nonsensical bullshit and they need to forcefully retire whoever keeps turning these games into kingdom Hearts clusters fucks that require graduate degrees to understand. 

I spent 2 hours last night just trying to explain KH and by the end I realized how absolutely schizophrenic I sounded and I just want plots that I can explain to people and not sound like I need to be institutionalized.
    >clusters fucks that require graduate degrees to understand

I think most people with graduate degrees are smart enough to know that this nonsense is not even worth trying to understand. It's an overly convoluted mess made by a writer (writers?) who is way less smart than he thinks he is. 

I don't trust that they have a truly coherent plan or vision or explanation that actually makes sense, and I trust them even less to properly convey that vision to the player. If we ever get any kind of even remotely logical explanation (lol) it will be in an Ultimania or some shit.
        The only reason I wouldn't fire all these writers and bump them back down to moderating fanfiction forums is because they might start thinking some of the ideas from those places are actually good, start incorporating them into their own stories, and entirely miss the whole point that it would be a punishment
    Honestly Kingdom Hearts isn’t that complicated, just a lot to remember. The only instances of time travel are in DDD and KH3, all of which don’t change the past in any way (other than Sora at the end, which breaks the laws of nature so that’s not the norm). Everything else is pretty straightforward. Plus, Nomura didn’t write the plot for FF7R so “Kingdom Hearts cluster fucks” aren’t even a factor here.
        Sea salt ice cream. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. DARKNESS!!
Honestly, all the multiverse stuff just makes me want to not engage with the plot at all. I can't stand it, and it seems like a way for the writers to avoid any consequences for anything - so what if one Aerith died, when there's another 3 hanging around anyway?

I'm glad that other people enjoyed it, but for me it just doesn't work.
    Yeh, the thing that bugs me the most, is SE have tried this, over and over again, and it never ends well for them.

Multiverses and Time Travel seem to be themes they keep attempting, and keep failing at, they haven't succeeded in either area since Chrono Trigger.
        In fairness time travel/alternate dimensions have been core concepts in Final Fantasy since the very first game. I would say the bigger problem is that historically FF isn't really great at sticking the landing on finales.

FF1 - >!Time Travel/Causal loop where Garland fights Chaos who makes Garland become Chaos in the past!<  
FF2 - >!Alternate Dimension (hell)!<  
FF3 - >!Alternate Dimension (world of darkness)!<  
FF5 - >!Alternate dimension AND dimensions merging together!<  
FF8 - >!Time travel AND times merging together!<  
FF9 - Technically, no other dimensions or time travel. BUT, the end of this game is so metaphorical that it almost fails to be comprehensible at all  
FF13 - Let's not even go there, lmao  
FF14 - >!Alternate Dimensions AND Time travel!<


So yea. While I agree that these concepts tend to become quite convoluted, they're foundational concepts in FF and probably will never go away. I didn't even mention the spin off titles, of which a large amount are about alternate dimensions and time travel.
            FF10 is also technically >!some kind of alternative dimension in a dream!<
                I excluded it because it's super convoluted haha

>!dream Zanarkand is a real physical location in the middle of the ocean but it only exists while Sin summons it and since Sin makes people have amnesia the outside world can't get there!<

But yea nonetheless, convoluted otherworldly concepts are the basic building block of most FF stories
            Reinforces my opinion that 6 is still the GOAT.
                I like 6 a lot, but my point is more that people have a recency bias with FF where they say "oh wow, square is really getting crazy with this one" when basically every single title is super crazy and that's the DNA of the series. 

I think that much like Remake before it, the deviations in part 3 as a result of this ending will be not too impactful and 95% of the game will be the same story as the original. We are just going to arrive at the conclusion via a slightly different route.
        That's because Chrono Trigger was a single timeline (unless I'm misremembering something). It was just simple, wholesome time travel.
    >I'm glad that other people enjoyed it, but for me it just doesn't work.

Same.
    i think it's a lot of confusion for the same result. the aerith we spent all that time with IS dead, the other three hanging around are either dead or actively hunted by sephiroth (the one who sent cloud back to our timeline did so right before sephiroth caught up to her in the church etc). as of now rebirth is telling us there is no outrunning fate even when timelines diverge. the timelines are just a way of exploring how aerith (and now zack) may still help the team in the third game.

ultimately aerith is affecting the outcome of the third game from the lifestream which is both what many people guessed after remake...and not all that different to what happens in the original game, in a way.
    *Did* other people enjoy it? I’ve read like twenty of these threads across different subreddits and I quite literally have not seen a single person anywhere who was a proponent of the multiverse shit
        Some like it but I see more people syabthay the games great except for the multiverse shit.
        I dunno if they did. I mean the ff7 remake crowd has more toxic positivity than most fanbases, and some people were going to love and worship this game no matter and will die defending it from any criticism. 

But even from that crowd, I really haven't seen many people actually come out and say "you know, multiverse and alternate time lines was exactly what the ff7 story needed"
        I'll reserve my judgement untill after Part 3 is done, but so far I'm still of a mind that the original story was fine the way it was. I really like how Jessie and Biggs got more fleshed out as a character, how Dio was less of an ass, how Tifa and Aerith are now clear BFFs, I  liked the concept of Nanaki faking his maturity and I adore how much depth they gave Yuffie in this version. But I'm not convinced the multiverse stuff was necessary and I think they are overusing uncle Sephi. Him being a phantom you chase in the original was great, Him popping out everywhere like he is a youtube ad is not.
        I don't hate it, but I'm going to continue to remain skeptical about it until Part 3 is out, which is basically where I was when I finished Remake after it released.  Personally, I like the changes to the story (for the most part.  Looking at you shitty Shinra Manor section.)  The timeline/different worlds stuff isn't TOO hard to actually grasp, I'm still just not quite sure if it's going to make for a satisfying conclusion/end to the story as they're telling it, but I want to reserve the right to say "THIS IS SHIT" or "THIS IS AMAZING" until I see how the entire thing pans out.
        lot of people out there are just happy to see their favorite characters in hd. 

even more people are happy to see Tifa in a bikini and date her in the gold saucer. 

I don’t think people who are here for the plot like these changes, but I also think plot people are a loud minority.
    The story was the most potent and interesting when it was very simple. Putting more stuffs don't improve in the hands of a careless storyteller.
    Same here. They botched the story in the lamest way possible.
    Same here.

It could potentially be redeemed in the 3rd game i guess. I LOVED the game overall, up to the last little bit and the "payoff" because it just felt forced and as if the directors were trying to make everyone happy.

&#x200B;

I was definitely in the camp where i hoped that Cloud would hit Sephiroth as he descended and save Aerith but i was also happy enough if they stuck with the original portion of her dying in that moment.

&#x200B;

Having infinite worlds with Aeriths alive just hanging around though is just bleh.

It made Aeriths "Death" completely inconsequential and ruined the pacing of that moment. Before the moment can breathe, you've had 6 quick cuts of Aeriths body, is she alive, is she dead? Cut, Cut, Cut.

Then thrown into a spectacle of a fight, no time to take in the moment. Cloud and Zack fighting together OMG, then Zack alone OMG, then Cloud but WAIT, Aerith is back for Cloud, lets fight together. Aerith and Cloud are alive?!

&#x200B;

The whole thing felt so so rushed and as if the moment was supposed to have zero impact overall.
        I think that's the point. We are not feeling the sadness because Cloud himself isn't accepting. His mind is so broken he still think his Aerith is alive and well. Which will likely means that when his mind will have to be fixed, that's where the real moment of mourning will come.
            No, i get that. Thats exactly how im sure they will go about it.

My issue was just the way that they had to make it a spectacle, instead of making it a moment to pause and reflect.

It reminded me of that meme video where they showed the film "Taken" and showed that it had 14 cuts in 3 seconds or something made?

&#x200B;

Aerith has just died, let that moment rest and let us see the impact. Instead we spend 30mins being blasted across 5 different worlds and having corny 1-liners thrown at us.

&#x200B;

Just feels like the Directors wanted to give both camps, the Aerith still dies and Aerith will live hope and let them be "Right" whilst also causing another 4 years of arguing and theories because they didnt want to upset anyone.

Especially since they've now shown multiple Aeriths alive and Zack leaving us with a "Hey, Worlds can combine, thats cool" moment which basically says that Aerith could still return because "Ha, Multiverse".
            Except that’s not how to make people feel connected to your storytelling.  Especially for an already established story.  Making things confusing for the sake of it, at the cost of all else, isn’t good writing.
The Aerith’s death card is only a card you get to play once. Revisiting it in part 3 for the ‘real version’ is too little too late.
    I just don't understand this line of thinking


Yeah there's other Aeriths

Ours still died though, she's the important one. Other universes are important but would you feel remotely satisfied if one of your friends died and then they got replaced with a slightly different version who has never met you in their life?
        Which one is "ours" exactly?

The original?
The one from the remakes?

What about when they all inevitably converge?

To me the problem with the whole multiverse thing is that it lowers the stakes for everyone.

Like, Zacks death was amazingly handled in Crisis Core. But in here we see yet another Zack (which I'd say, not "our" Zack) meet his end (or be in a doomed world) several times, in several universes.

It's just... Lazy. 

They can just pull out whatever they want and say "multiverse!".
        Because when you introduce stuff like this, especially unnecessarily, \*nothing matters\*.  
Slightly different?  Sure.  That doesn't mean that watching a character die then immediately show up again feels like it means anything.
        To add to this, in addition to our Aerith, the one that matters, still being very dead, it's also important to keep in mind that this is still only part 2 of a 3 part saga. That means it's still very possible that these other worlds, fractures in the lifestream, or whatever the hell they are, won't even exist anymore by the end of game 3. I mean if Aerith and Zack are sitting around the fire at Cosmo Canyon with everyone else, singing songs, smiling and having a good time at the end of game 3, then yeah, I'll be pretty upset. That hasn't happened yet though, so it seems odd to me that so many people seem ready to write the entire trilogy off as a failure, when the story before the endings of the two games was so good, and we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.
            We already see that these worlds basically end in Rebirth itself, the only one that seems to be sticking around is the Terrier timeline, so it's not like we're actually meant to get invested in 10 different realities lol.

It's just a vehicle to explain that any choice creates a new branch of the world that will eventually die off.
            Man it’s kind of funny seeing everyone fall for the same exact shit they did in Remake 😂 95% of the game was an extremely faithful recreation of the original, with a very bombastic/extravagant ending (ultimately ending up in the same place) where everyone was saying how it ruined the game and they aren’t even interested now. 4 years later when Rebirth comes out, 95% is extremely faithful, another big ending, and “wow it’s ruined” 💀 you put it perfectly, don’t write off the entire trilogy until it’s actually finished
                All I'm getting from this is Part 3 will be an amazing 95% faithful game and then the ending will be bombastic / extravagant nonsense.

I actually completely agree with that, but I'm not sure that's the point you were hoping to make.
                    I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
            > we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.

I'm not holding my breath for any explanation that is satisfying and truly makes sense.

Confusion is now the brand of storytelling they've explicitly chosen for the remake series and I don't expect that to change in part 3.
            Issue being that it detracts from story and emotional beats.  You end at the same destination, but without the same meaning behind it.  And thus far, many feel this meaning is far inferior.
                they can't help how they feel but i can't relate. i can't dismiss dozens of hours of a game that was full of emotional beats about loss and each character starting to think about what life looks like after death and war, and still ended with them figuring out how to move forward after losing aerith.
        people are going to see all the time stuff and immediately dismiss it but it's really not as bad as everyone is saying. in the OG, aerith dies and finds a way to help the team in the lifestream. in remake, aerith dies (seems to have known all along that she would) and finds a way to help the team (with the addition of zack). third game will hopefully answer how that comes to be.  

full disrespect to the writers for creating this confusion on purpose but it is absolutely just a version of the same story that the OG told. people will always be mad that they didn't do the story beats exactly the same but this idea that it's cheapened now is silly to me.

tseng shouldve 100% died tho lol
        If ours still died why is cloud so emotionless and cold? He should be sad. Not just "meh, oh well let's get going".
            Mate he literally has brain damage, AND is seeing her ghost
            Did you skip the scene where he’s crying over her dead body?
    The good news is that the other universes are unlikely to matter ever again.

It's established now that the alternate universes are not persistent, they all die. The only reason it "mattered" in the context of THIS game is because Aerith lost the innate knowledge of the planet at the end of Remake when the white materia was drained by killing Whisper Bahamut and by way of trading she now got back the white materia.

I do agree that this was a weak addition to the story but I think people expecting like an alternate universe Aerith to come back in part 3 are wrong, she is dead and the alternate universes don't last (except maybe Zack, who is no longer in any universe at all but in the same state as Sephiroth/Aerith where he is just a consciousness in the lifestream that isn't merged)

I also think 1 detail of this chart is wrong though, there's not really an "ultimate Aerith". All the Aeriths have knowledge of how the planet works because of the white materia, there doesn't need to be some individual "ultimate Aerith" that is dimension hopping.
        >The good news is that the other universes are unlikely to matter ever again.

People said the exact same thing about the Whispers in Part 1. "No need to keep complaining because we killed them, so now there won't be any Whispers in the next parts". 

Uh huh, sure. We saw how that turned out.

These alternate universes weren't introduced just to be discarded for Part 3. They will 100% have some kind of role in the last game.
            I mean, the doomsaying about whispers literally WAS wrong about part 2.

People said because of the Whispers the ending would completely change, all the same events would not play out, Aerith would not die, the story would be completely altered, etc. 

Rebirth was even *closer* to the original game than Remake was. So doomsay away, but they pretty blatantly stated that the alternate universes do not persist. They already served a purpose in the lore, I don't see any reason to forecast a total deviation from the original game now.
    I was a big Remake defender and kept telling people “let square enix cook”, well now they cooked and I feel like they’re trying to do too much. It’s a shame because the game is GOTY material easy (and will probably win) but the ending was way, way too much.
        I was the opposite, wasn't sure what they were trying to do with Remake, but after playing Rebirth I can kind of see what they are going for from a writer's perspective.

Basically they want the third game to be an emotional nuclear bomb that destroys the player, and to achieve that they are shifting the payoff of aerith's death from the 2nd to the 3rd game at the cost of a satisfying end to the 2nd game. This explains why we don't see the iconic scenes of aerith being stabbed and lowered into the water, and why Tifa and Barret were blocked from seeing anything unlike the OG where they are there and snap Cloud out of being puppeted by Sephiroth.

It's a risky move as it damages the reception of the 2nd game, but if they stick the landing with the 3rd it will probably be forgiven.
    Yeah. Like it’s already so jarring to me that supposedly a huge part of the fanbase rejoiced at making Zack live at the end of Remake… well guess what? They actually killed him in this game. 

But don’t worry! Here’s a completely _different_ Zack who lived in a different universe who we knew nothing off but somehow was different personality enough to make different choices.. oh but we made him kill himself, whoops.

But don’t worry, there’s now infinite amount these Zacks, so here’s one that you also know nothing about who just sits here, we make _him_ actually tag team with Cloud, that’s what the fans have been wanting to see forever, right?

In part 3 we can do the same with Aerith, neat!
    I think people are just making this more complicated than it actually is. Squares just adding shit in to try and confuse us but for the most part it's the same story. This is a retelling with bizarre story additions. I don't believe things are going to get as crazy as people are claiming.
        Probably correct we will end up In the same place it’s just the rd there is way more twisty
            Yeah, that's pretty much how I suspect it'll go as well.
        I agree that we’ll end up in the same place, but man, for them to show Aerith’s death scene and then throw 10+ boss fights at you? I get that you fight right after she dies in the OG but to me they didn’t spend nearly enough time on her getting killed. Kind of took all the emotion away for me
            Yeah, that's why I brought up bizarre story choices. It feels like they didn't know which direction to go in so we got... whatever this was.
    The point is to do allmthisbexyta stuff but return to status quo in part 3. It will end exactly as the og with Sephiroth defeated and everything extra won't really matter.
        That's exactly what people said at Remake's ending.
            And they were right. We defeated the whispers, Destiny is free and we basically spent the game doing 99% the same thing anyway.
I mean that’s basically how I interpreted it!
The potato chips bags explain alot
    FF7 Remake literally has the thematic depth of trash blowing in the wind.
        Well said
Still don’t get it, what’s the point of the first 3 universes on zack’s side?
    The first three universes were all the result of Zack making different choices. The Terrier universe -  Zack went to Hojo to seek healing for Cloud. The Pug universe - Zack chose to save Biggs. And the Siba universe - Zack wasn't sure what to do. What is it for?

In order for OG Aerith to be able to move into the "correct" version of Aerith 2. We saw that when OG Aerith turns out to be in a physical body, S**ephiroth immediately tracks her down**. While Aerith 2 is "sleeping", she is safe, so **Aerith 3 is waiting for a version of the world where Zack will make the right choice** - to heal Cloud - then she could inhabit the body in this timeline and continue to implement her plan.
        My eyes couldn't roll harder reading this if they tried. 

I hate modern Squares approach to storytelling. Utter drivel.
        Except it makes no sense that the universes result from Zack’s choices, because nothing in Zack should result in new universe. Like, how would the chips bag mascot change from Zack’s choice if it already was one type? 

Rather, the Zacks just lived in different universes (that has resulted in different bag design via some butterfly effect) and that alone deterministically made Zack make different choices. It’s dumb.
            Yes, we can say that Zack exists in all universes at the same time, these universes differ in the choices that he made. But it won't change the essence. But it is also correct to say that he creates new universes by his actions, because his survival was the reason for their creation, he is the Butterfly that causes a storm with a flap of its wing. 

Don't take everything too literally about the Stamps, it's more of a clue for the players.
I was just scrolling the main page and saw this, I just started chapter 12 today so I’m gonna do my best to forget this and really wish reddit would recommend spoilers in the future
I thought this was really well made. Idk how people in the replies don’t know how to read left to right.

I never considered that this aerith in the dream date was OG Aerith, she was acting slightly differently, and it’s really compelling to think she gave up her white materia to save another world where sephiroth managed to nullify its white materia. 

This also adds so much credibility to the theory that this series takes place AFTER advent children, and devs are being cheeky when when they say this story will link up with advent children. I think the the final game will reveal this, and honestly it’s obvious considering the whole black wing thing but some people think it’s just a design think they decided to keep.
And i thought the og was a mindfuck. Rebirth is even worse!
This shit is more confusing then Kingdom hearts
    Was Kingdom Hearts really that confusing?
        On the beggining? Not really.

But when Chain of Memories and Dream Drop Distance were released, oh god, it became more confusing than Metal Gear and Zelda combined.
            No, CoM was not confusing at all its fairly simple. KH story only became confusing when DDD got released
        Not really but people that don't play it love to say it is
        As a big kingdom hearts fan who has been in the franchise since release i say the most confusing part is trying to get every game that is released in different consoles and try to get the full story. As the story itself ehh not really people who dont play it tend to exaggerate it. There is no multiverse crap in this game at best there is some time whiny shit starting in dream drop distance but thats more like "i pulled my younger self to fight with me now, also even if you go back in time shit doesn't change"

Also i guess the 6+ versions of xehanort are a bit hard to track if you loose sight but honestly its not that bad. We do like to joke that everyone is xehanort. 

I say its turning confusing though because nomura is trying to shoehorn his versus 13 plotlines into kh now
I wonder if this is a super convoluted way to explain Aerith and Zack in Advent Children?

They aren't just lifestream ghosts, they are actually manifestations of a separate universe where they survived and only Cloud, whose strong emotional ties to Zack allows him to experience their presence fleetingly. 

I'm a Zack fanboy, so if they write a great excuse (emphasis on great, gotta make sense without being shoehorned) then I'm all for it. I think it needs to be at least some Tenth Dr and Rose level shit though. Last fight has to end with Zack and Aerith living happily ever after forever separated from their friends in an alternate plane of existence. We need the separation and permanence. 

I do agree that the writers have to be careful, one of VII's pivotal plot points is definitely permanence of loss, if the main characters get away scot free then they lose out on some important character development. But that's not to say that permanence has to be death, there are other forms of permanence in high fantasy.
This makes me lose all investment in the story.

Just.. why?
After seeing the ending, I am 100% sure the finale will not be at the northern crater.
Doesn't Zack know that Hojo was the one that experimented on him and Cloud? Why would any incarnation of him think going to him was a good idea?
There is a chart in front of me and I still am not sure what went on.
What about the Terrier Snacks at Gold Saucer when chasing Cait Sith? We swap realities?
So much negativity. I think everyone is frustrated because they don’t have a nice neat ending. The confusion and feelings the game causes is by design. It’s a huge set up for part 3. I really enjoyed it and am having a blast pondering the meaning of the ending and searching for clues. Doing the same thing over again would have been predictable and boring. Instead they gave us all something to think about. The scene with Aerith and the ending had so many layers to it and had me feeling so many emotions and confusion and a desire to figure shit out. I think everyone needs to calm down and give it a chance lol
    Yeah I like it. Wouldn’t have hated if they just stuck to the OG to the letter but I like that they’re trying to put a new spin on things. There are many things I don’t like about the remake trilogy but those are mainly technical gameplay issues like traversal and minigames etc. - I don’t really have a problem with the storytelling.

Here in the best quality. The previous post was deleted because the word >!Universes !<in the title is a spoiler... I love reddit. Anyway, write your opinion, if you do not agree with what is presented in the diagram, it will be interesting to read.
    The universe where Aerith and Cloud are unconscious bodies are after the Remake where they didn't succeed after the battle with whisper harbinger and they're collected by Shinra. How the Holy Materia is intact?

My understanding is the Holy/memories is taken from Aerith during the Remake and not after this pivotal moment.
        with that universe, cloud also is not that there to help avalanche, cus zack survives and stays with him
        Good question I’m not sure
I hate what they've done to this story so much.
    I said it the moment those fucking fate fucks showed up in the first game. We are heafing for an absolute fucking shitshow in part 3 when they try to pull all this bullshit together.

Utter drivel.
        Completely agree, sadly. Sometimes less is more. You don't need to introduce complicated nonsense to a timeless story.
This is so confusing but simple at the same time
Hell I’m confused even more now
Because my entire comment is filled with spoilers for the early game it’s just too much to black it all out, so read at your own risk. Since this only covers the end of Chapter 2 you’re probably past that by now. 



I still think that Cloud drowns after fighting Midgardsomr. He sinks to the bottom, clearly out of breath, and then the next moment he’s on dry land while Aerith tells him to wake up. It was weird. No one mentions who saved him and brought him to dry land. It wasn’t Sephiroth using one of his proxies or Jenova because he spikes the snake and goes on about his day. 

I always thought that, if the multiverse stuff were real, how cool it would be that you would die in this world and wake in the next, continuing your life. No matter how young you were or how you died, you still get to live and die from old age before you finally stop waking up in the next universe. 

Kinda thinking that’s what happened to Cloud. Why isn’t he wet? Why are none of the team wet? Why does no one say a single word about rescuing him?
Why is everything a multiverse now?  


I'm so damn sick of multiverse storylines
    Because Nomura
Interesting. While i didn’t pay attention about the dogs until i rewatched the ending. I think it’s very clear to me that the Cloud and the gang are still in the Beagle timeline and Zack seems to be jumping to multiverses i guess with the help of Lifestream Aerith?. Honestly, i would not be surprised if another multiverse shenanigans will come to play in part 3 since the worlds merging is still not yet done. Because here’s my theory for Part 3 (1) we still don’t know about the 7 seconds thing. But i have a speculation that the clear or blank materia from Aerith will somehow will come to play in Part 3, when Cloud will regain his memories it will be form a new materia that will eventually defeat Sephiroth. (2) When Sephiroth said about the worlds, that some worlds will fade. Just like in Zack worlds when defeating the bizarro. I think now few of the worlds will be also destroyed too since Sephiroth from the Shiba and Fitz world attempting to kill Aerith. Leaving only Terrier world has the unconscious Aerith still residing in Elmyra’s house. (3) Aerith is dead in the Beagle timeline. Cloud realization sequence will destroy his mental will due the fact that he is in denial that he saved her. That’s all for now. This is just pure speculation and will varies once more theories and interviews from the devs rises.
It's so joever
Does anyone know which version of Zack is the one that fights with Cloud? All the stuff with him and Biggs seems pointless, I hope there's a pay off in part 3
    Zack from the Shiba universe.
        Yeah that makes sense, only thing that throws me off is that the Zack we play as in Rebirth potentially meets the same fate now just in a different setting (they did leave it open ended though)
            WDYM? We play two different Zack’s from two different timelines. The one we play at the beginning and middle dies at Shinra building, very sad. Luckily there’s an infinite amount of Zack’s now.

Maybe in part three Cloud will have an ability like Yuffie’s doppelganger where he pulls a random Zack from random universe who fights alongside him until he dies.
So which timeliness is the OG FF7 in? 🤔
You're the man.  
But I still don't know how did Aerith 1 die.  
Aerith 1 started with an empty materia, which suggests she is not the original Aerith. I would like to know more about how she used the materia also.
Next breed in part 3 will be Disney's Pluto. That's the Universe where Cloud, Goofy, and Donald duck survive the Sector 7 collapse and Mickey Mouse summons the Death Star to blow up meteor. 

You know, multiverse stuff.
well the aerith with double voice on cetra temple is ultimate aerith fight sephiroth on lifestream ?
Except, to my knowledge, nobody else can SEE Aerith in the Beagle Universe, so wouldn't she be technically dead in that Universe as well, just a part of the Lifestream?  And why can Cloud see the fucked up sky but nobody else can?  I think this does an OK job at giving a rough explanation, but is too simple to be of much use besides naming each universe.
    We don't know exactly what happened at the end. That we know that there are different universes, we identify by the stamps and that Aerith from our timeline received a "filled" White Materia, and Cloud in return an empty one.
This is incredible! This helped me collate all of my jumbled thoughts about the ending and solidify something. Well done and thank you!
Amazing chart! I was thinking about making something like this myself. I'm still desparately trying to figure out why Cloud ended up in a timeline where she dies at the end of Rebith, when he clearly saves her from death and creates a new timeline. Deifies Fate and Destiny so that she lives but still ends up warped into a timeline where she's dead. He can still communicate with her though, but since the others see that she died it's so weird to all of them.
    You should check out the [extended version](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1bn0wzs/an_extended_chart_describing_the_events_in_the/). When Cloud deflected Sephiroth's blade, another universe was created with another Cloud. Our Cloud stayed in his universe where Aerith was supposed to die, but at the same time he saw both outcomes of events, and now he does not realize that his Aerith is dead.
        Yes, but he deflected Sephiroth's blade in the remake timeline saving Aerith. Why does Aerith end up dead in the remake timeline when he clearly saved her? Unless he somehow ended up in an alternate timeline where she is dead anyway, but how would Cloud have gotten there? That's what I'm trying to figure out.
            "Because Cloud is still sick," as Marlene said. Since we do not know by what rules parallel universes work, there may be dozens of theories, for example, that Cloud did not deflect Sephiroth's blade, but saw how his "healthy" version did it in another universe. Anyway, I think that even in the third part they will not explain to us exactly what happened. The universes will merge, and it won't matter anymore.
    I don't think cloud actually did it. I think cloud is doing cloud shit where he experiences a traumatic event and creates his own reality in his head of what happened and that's how he sees it.
I absolutely fucking hate this so much!!! The chart is great and really helpful, don’t get me wrong, but this kind of story telling just… sucks and is exhausting. Whoever possibly had the thought that what would improve the original ff7 story would multiple timelines/worlds? I don’t think a story has ever been made better by obfuscating clear story beats and trying to confuse the audience. It feels like they’ve  sacrificed a powerful, clear, and emotional narrative in order to be clever. Fuck this.
    I've been beating this drum since the end of Remake and I was very concerned with the new direction. I think a lot of people were more confident than I was about how they were going to handle the story going forward. It is sort of bittersweet to feel like more people are now coming around to my line of thinking, but at the same time, I wish I had been wrong.
    >It feels like they’ve  sacrificed a powerful, clear, and emotional narrative in order to be clever. Fuck this.

They did. And it's not even that clever.
Maybe I'm just overly hopeful, but I think Square is honestly just intentionally making things seem more confusing than they actually are, as a way to keep theories going, and the actual explanation will be far more grounded in OG/Compilation concepts and lore than most people expect.
    You're on that real good shit. Send some my way. My stores of copium have just been depleted.
        In all fairness, you very well could be right. Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle when it comes to the Zack and Whisper stuff, and am just setting myself up for disappointment in that regard. If I'm completely honest though...I never really cared about that stuff, one way or the other. I'm here for the 95% of the remake trilogy that's actually a remake of the FFVII story. That's what I've always been here for. The Zack stuff, whether it soars, or flops, is just extra for me. I'm intrigued enough to see where they're going with it, and they've done enough right with the remake so far that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, and assume they have a plan to make this work. If they pull that miracle off, and manage to make all of Zack's stuff make sense within the larger story of FFVII, then great, everyone wins. Even if it should fail though, so long as they get the FFVII remake part of the story right, (and so far I think that part of the story has been incredibly enjoyable) then Zack's part of the storyline could end with him arm wrestling Dio on the moon, while wearing a Princess Peach cosplay, and I honestly wouldn't care. So long as we still get that proper remake/reimagining of the FFVII story at the end of this, then that's still a win in my book. I'll just focus on enjoying the 95% of the game that really worked. It wouldn't be the first time I had to ignore some really bad parts in a game I otherwise totally love.
    I have no doubt they will backtrack after rebirth. The general reception to the story has been very poor compared to remake that was already divisive. So much so that eeven mainstream reviews at pointing to a messy and failed storytelling.
        The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen. Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII, and people generally really enjoy that part. Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have most of their issues. Thankfully, that weird stuff isn't what's being focused on. That stuff with Zack, and the different Stamps are there to create confusion, and get people talking about what might be happening, but at the end of the day, I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story of FFVII, so I don't think they were ever going to allow anything that would forever compromise the integrity of that story. I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up, but I don't think this will be the result of Square changing their minds in response to backlash, and walking anything back. I think setting things right in the end was their plan from the very beginning, from the moment they decided to introduce these new subplots.
            > The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen.

No, this is far more skewered towards the negative. Remake had the benefit of people sitting in the middle not knowing if part 2 would go wildly off the rails, and thus were cautiously optimistic, but if you look at the endgame discussion thread of over 2.5k posts, then its pretty clear that most people in general are not happy about a lot of the writing choices here and especially the multiverse nonsense.


>Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII

That is a charitably way of looking at it, the endgame discussion thread and myself included felt great frustration with the rewrites and how undercut many of the key moments were, by all the new additions and "noise" added to the game (Dyne, Nanaki's trial, Aerith's fate, just to name a few key examples) where lots of these moments not only lost the original tone of the game, but importantly also their memorable impact. Dyne for instance had a very dark and impactful original scene, and now it was just replaced with lots of noise, new magnetic powers, Shinra troops randomly giving him a heroic death out of nowhere. So messy and generic compared to the original scene --- And don't get me started on Aeriths scene. Its been spoken to death already, so I won't go further into just the ridiculously botched job they did with that.

>Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have their issues.


Nah, lots of things here changed in the telling these events and how they unfolded, which was significantly different to the OG. Which is what remake got a way with alot. Looking at something like the reactor bombing mission, its about as close and faithful of a recreation as you can have, while also expanding it.

Wall Market? It made slight changes, but ultimately kept the key points of what happened and how it happened, while importantly not changing the tone of the area.


Then you have something like the plate sequence, which was far more controversial in remake, because they changed it so dramatically, with so many people being warned and escaping, that it almost felt like nobody died in-universe. Obviously they did, but the colossal disaster it was in the OG, isn't felt nearly in the same way here, with you shortly after walking around talking to the same npcs again.


And yes of course the finale is the big controversial one.


But in rebirth, there is FAR more of this. From all the multiverse cuts with Zack, to odd new additions that just feel weirdly out of place, like Hojo attacking the party, Dyne growing magical magnetic powers from reading too much One Piece, and the Gi being handed a new script by Nomura, all of which just drastically changes so much of the dynamic in storytelling here. 


>I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story FFVII

again I think you're being charitable. They already locked themselves into doing the main storybeats for the most part, when Kitase literally went out and said you'd see the main story beats again, just perhaps a bit differently. But the fact that its done in such an unsatisfying way that often completely removes the tone, or impact of the original scenes, is just not doing it.


>I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up

Part of me thinks that Nomura is too stubborn to accept that the reception is a reason to course correct and that we are riding this out into full fanfic fanservice territory, like they spoke about in Ultimania, about wanting Zack to have a happy ending. Where we end up mashing all the timelines together and everyone has their happy ending. Seems perfect for his typical storytelling preference.


On the other hand, I HOPE that Square sees this reception and pushes for making sure that he isn't going completely Nomura all over it again.
                >most people in general

Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

>felt great frustration with the rewrites

SOME of the people in that thread. But really, even those are debatable. 
Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking, thanks to the voice acting and imagery (the scene where Dyne imagine returning home, man...). Sure he doesn't kill himself exactly like the original, but he still let himself be gunned down while cursing Barret and telling him to live on, which is pretty dark still. The meaning of said death is still kept as it shows to Barret what could he have become and why he has to keep living on, even despite the feeling of guilt.
Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot (although they do still come back to an extent via sidequests, which are appreciated).
As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

>colossal disaster in the OG

I call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died. Jesse, Biggs and Wedge all died before the plate fell. The only people we saw die was the reporter with his broadcast. And unlike the OG, Remake actually holds on the aftermath a lot more instead of moving on to Aerith 5 minutes later. Plus, the true despair vision of the plate fall happen in Yuffie's PoV of Intergrade, so that is kept too. 

>weird addictions like

Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them? Also you are not allowed to question why Dyne's arm has electromagnetic powers when him and Barret have infinite amount of ammo and Barret can do a massive beam if he wants. Also Nomura didn't write the script. He's just one of 4 writers, with Kitase being reason of most changes. 

Also no shit the storytelling is different in some parts, it's still meant to not be quite the OG story but a new one, basically a sequel/what if. Of course it will have differences.
                    > Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.


Its really only the overly defensive people that seem to be happy about this.


>SOME of the people in that thread.

I already clarified it as being the vast majority. That by definition already clarifies that.


>But really, even those are debatable. 

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.
                        >only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
                            > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
                Remake has an 87 on metacritic.

Rebirth has a 93.

Rebirth was received significantly better.

I'm not surprised by this in the slightest by the way. Critics loooove Auteur subversive stuff so they are all aboard the confusing ending train.
                Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all. He wanted to die, and was practically begging Barret to just shoot him, and put him out of his misery. Barret wouldn't do it, so he found another way to get it done. He had given up on himself, and was no longer even looking for a reason to go on living. He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred, killing as many Shinra troopers as he could before finally going down, rather than go with Barret to see Marlene again and try to find a place for himself in her life. Dyne's final attack was a suicide. The troopers were just the insturment for his suicide, since he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on himself. Dyne's death is a cautionary tale to Barret on what could happen to him if he ever lost sight of his reason for living, and gave in fully to his hatred, just as it was in the original. 

Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer, who came after us because we had been unknowingly ruining his day since we first arrived at the Gold Saucer.
                    > Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
                        He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
                            > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
                                The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
Yeah that looks about as dumb as it seemed playing through it. (Not your chart, that was good design)
What the fuck have they done
    We warned you
Is it a spoiler if I look at this while roughly halfway through the game and zero percent of it makes sense to me? I genuinely can’t even tell if its serious or not
    I don't think this is going to be a spoiler because you don't understand the context in which this is happening. A bunch of different scenes are dumped on us, and this chart helps to connect what is happening at least a little. But if you haven't seen these scenes yet, then the chart won't make sense to you.
    You should finish the game and come back.
        I can’t wait to be more confused than kingdom hearts
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry 

I still don't understand the whole thing 

And I don't know if this is a stroke of genius from the devs or the biggest piece of storytelling Shit I've ever seen 

I'm just empty, confused and burned out
Reading multitude of comments of people not really liking the multiverse stuff, and how many upvotes those comments got, makes me sorta feel vindicated when I say that they messed up the story big time and should have just stuck to the original script while adding world building and character building stuff ONLY. BUT OH what do I know haha.
    100000% agree. It could have been amazing
Spot on, good graph for anyone still confused about the ending.

My theory at the moment is that there is one timeline where Aerith survived that will get explored more in part 3. I also think that Zack is still alive in one of the timelines getting ready to figure out how to reunite with Aerith and Cloud.
I don’t understand a single word I read
What about the zack from intermission? What time line is that?
How the hell have you guys finished already. Seriously I'm about 70 hrs in and on chapter 10!
So, basically, each time we play, the game will be a bit different.....
Shits so stupid
“Simple”
You are the best.
Thanks for the chart
Zack waking up in the church at the end is in which world? Is he the same Zack we saw from Intermission?
    We don't know.
Thank you so much for this! I can only understand something complicated like this visually, so this chart is great. I kept reading comments trying to understand it but I just couldn't get it lol.
Ok but am i getting her back in 3 or not
I’m more confused now :<
Even simpler explanation. Or at least my understanding.  
At the end of Remake Sephi forced a confrontation between  between us and the whispers. After that was done quantum mechanics was introduced to the storyline and every time an event had multiple outcomes, it branched out to other timelines. Now Sephiroth plans to remerge all of this into a singular reality again, but with every possibility landing on whatever benefits him the most. He also uses the lifestrream to travel into these other possibilities to create more outcomes beneficial to him.

Aerith meanwhile wants to stop him, but is still kinda okay with herself dying cause apparently the OG timeline is the best possibility.
    >Aerith meanwhile wants to stop him, but is still kinda okay with herself dying cause apparently the OG timeline is the best possibility.

And yet at the end of Remake she encouraged the party to defy fate and cross the wall to fight the Whispers. So clearly she doesn't want the OG timeline to happen exactly as it did. 

Your explanation about the Sephiroth stuff is pretty good, but honestly there is not a single explanation or theory about this that fully makes sense. You can poke massive holes in all of them. It's just kind of a mess.
        Well this is my understanding of a plot that is missing a third act, so I might be completely off base. Who knows?

All we can hope is that the final answers at the end of Resomething will make sense.
saving for later
DBZ timelines were way more complicated
Commenting so I can come back to this
I was much younger and dumber when I played the OG FF7 and the plot was pretty easy to follow.

Now, I'm about to graduate from university but FF7R's plot still confuses the hell out of me even with this chart.
Just finished Remake and starting Rebirth, I’m absolutely clueless now. Who tf is Zack?
    It's worth watching the FF7: Crisis Core walkthrough.
So what happened to og timeline
    We've never been in the OG timeline in remakes, because from the very beginning Sephiroth and Aerith know the future, which means it's not OG anymore.
Very nice chart, this is exactly how I understood it as well. However, 3 questions.

1. What is the significance of the empty Holy materia. You see at the end of the game Cloud still has it. Just sentimental value at this point?

2. Does Ultimate Aerith die after giving Cloud her Holy materia in Spitz timeline? Sephiroth walks in suggesting it, but we do not see it. Which leads to question 3;

3. When Cloud (seemingly?) stops Sephiroth’s impalement at Forgotten Capital we get the telltale rainbow flash of a timeline creation, and our Aerith dies(?). Last part of Sephiroth fight, out walks Aerith to help. Is this Ultimate Aerith or a new one, or possibly our Aerith somehow? 

To me it’s suggested by the game she’s ours since she’s now dead and in the lifestream, but as of now no one legitimately dead was ever able to physically manifest in our living world, suggesting not our Aerith. (Zack lived in terrier timeline, was now able to jump around timelines and do physical actions, not just a “force ghost”) 

Cloud seems to be in 2 timelines or half in the lifestream simultaneously now. He does not speak to invisible Aerith with anyone else nearby, implying he understands she’s dead in our timeline, to not raise the groups suspicion. It is odd though he tells her to Wake up and she does momentarily, but you don’t see the group anywhere nearby and then it skitzo-cuts back to everyone around her body.

Bit fuzzy on these last points.
TIL there are different mascot dog breeds in the game. 
I’m more confused now
Fk .... Shouldve paid more attention to the dog posters.
I think the Zack we see at the end of Intermission is in yet another world/universe/timeline. One with no Stamp or perhaps a Stamp not yet shown. If you include that, we have 7 shown timelines, which seems just on the nose enough that it's probably intentional.

1.Original
2.Beagle
3.Terrier
4.Stampless/Different Breed Stamp
5.Spitz
6. Pug
7. Shiba

I think 2 and 3 will be very key to Remake part 3. 5 played it's part already and 6/7 I think we're simply to show more divergent "worlds". 4 is a wildcard. Perhaps this is the rejoined "reunion of worlds" ? I don't think it was just a throwaway scene but a taste of something yet to come.
The different versions of Stamp is one of the best, most understated examples of branched timeline clues I've ever seen. I'd say I can't believe I didn't pick up on it, but damn, it's so subtle.
At least it seems like the timelines will eventually converge, and I think it will converge into the Beagle Timeline. Therefore, whatever happens in the other timelines is whatever and non-canon. That's the way my simple brain will process this story. lol

&#x200B;

T
It is especially inspired because Zack “the Puppy” is more or less who the Stamp song describes. (One of dozens of Sleepezi analyses that have totally borne out.)
What's the Shiba universe. Where do you see it?
How many stars does it have?

Is OG ff7 universe 1?
its like so convoluted yet so....not lol 

  
I guess the word im looking for is complex
Nomura is at it again
    He didnt write this tho. He was the only one against changes
        Funny cause it is really nomura-esque changes
            True that
What in the Kingdom Hearts- is this real? I didn’t play any of the remake games
Thanks for making this!

I’m loving these games but I really wish they hadn’t gone this route with the story. It just feels so unnecessary. I didn’t even really mind the whispers in remake and story changes in general were bound to happen but this is just…a bit much.
That Nomura stink 💀
I wish they'd just tell a normal story
All I wanted was a simple remake :/
Maybe years from now, somebody will be able to combine these three games, cut out all of the chaff, and I'll be able to play the actual remake of FF7 that I wanted.
I don’t think the main world is inside the lifestream like the others. The other worlds are split from the main one, and they exist in the lifestream, but the lifestream itself exists as the lifeblood of the planet, which is the main ”physical” world.
    None of the worlds "inside the Lifestream". But the Lifestream is in each of them. OG Aerith and Sephiroth, who exist in it, can access any of the worlds. In this case, the Lifestream is like a railway on which you can travel through the worlds.
        Funnily enough this image perfectly encapsulates my theory because I do believe everything is within the lifestream, and the different worlds are akin to the different memory lines within the lifestream described in Ever Crisis.

Edit: But also I've come to the conclusion that the mechanics now don't really matter when it comes to theorising the plot going forward because the lifestream theory and the multiverse still work in Sephiroth achieving the same thing; absorbing all the shit, it's just the mechanism in play to make that happen changes.
        Ohhh i misunderstood, i thought the big lifestream outline meant that all the worlds are inside it
        We can assume in this case that the entire Remake world is a branch universe where the OG Aerith and OG Sephiroth in LifeStream are acessing other worlds and the main objective of Sephiroth is reach a universe where he can "win" and turn the "main universe" and Aerith is fighting against it?

In this case they can travel on time too since the Ultimate Aerith reach her Remake body where she meets cloud.

Sounds a good theory to me to make it simple this Multiverse mess.
            Something like that. Sephiroth made this world where he took away Aerith's White Materia from her. As a result, she cannot use Holy, and there is no one to stop the meteor. But OG Aerith found a way to transfer the White Materia, through another universe.
YESSS THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IVE BEEN TRYING YO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO UNDERSTAND ZACK'S WHOLE SECTIONS. Finally something I can just show instead of having to type of 10 paragraphs each time.
THIS WHOLE THING FEELS LIKE SOMETHING YOU PUT IN A FFVIII REMAKE.
What's hilarious is that I kept seeing these different dogs but everything that was happening was so asinine that I just ignored them lmao Even after having this post bring them into focus Im still wondering what exactly the end game here is.
Simple? They've made it far too conveluted. Having multiple timeliness only signified by a mascot you wouldn't think to look out for is ridiculous.
I wouldn’t call this simple.
But why? None of this made any sense to me. Why claim the story changes if key points don’t? Seems like a lot of wasted effort to throw the proverbial paddles at the crocodile and then fight them by hand just to get the paddles back to keep moving up stream…
Imagine how awesome it’d been if they’d just remade the original story without changing it?

All these amazing visuals, music and gameplay, with the cohesive story of FF7, and expanded areas?

And imagine if there wasn’t hours upon hours of filler including the greatest hits of “make this elevator work 3 times” or “vacuum this mako and connect that power cable”.

Christ, it’s been almost ten years since the first FF7R remake trailer and we still have to wait 4 more years for something that already makes little sense?
    Yep, the ending is like, "See ya in 4 years, Prepare 70 bucks to find out what really happened."
They butchered any emotion at all at the ending. It's really amazing how bad they can miss it
Yeah, this is bad. The state of Final Fantasy VII lol.
What?? Granted, I haven’t finished the game yet but what?
    [deleted]
        Nomura isn't the one making these changes, he's the one reining them in, so most of the story stays intact.

He also doesn't write a lot of the stuff he just gets blamed for online.
        It actually isn't that hard to understand when you've thought about it after the ending.

Did you however not complete the picture due to spoilers of the ending? There is another fracture in the ending.
            Because we don't know what really happened at the end, just different theories. Stamps are at least some kind of reference point that allows you to understand in what reality events are taking place at the moment.
                Good point, the one's you mentioned we are sure of.

Yeah but what all this Marlene being a cetra.  Explain that /s
Mean Ultimate Aerith like Cloud for now

Main song  : "no promises to keep"
Aerith say to zack for sure...... Sadddd
Wouldn't they just be fighting a losing battle or a different end to fate every time they deviated instead of just being unconscious?
So why do Ultimate/OG Aerith and OG Sephiroth care so much about Beagle universe and not the others?
What kind of breed is Torgal then?!?!?
But if different choices create different universes, as we were told, then why are the dogs logo different? They should be the same since the universes come from the same ones before they diverge no?
    The different dogs are just symbols to the viewer that we're seeing a different universe.
Could there be a universe where Sephiroth is reformed or innocent?
“Simple”?
Nintendogs on Switch 2 confirmed?
damn this is going to get more complicated in part 3 lol
I cabt tell if this is ironic or not
i prefer using number of stars in the Stamp designs rather than breed. simplifies things a bit
saving for later
"Simple."
The only thing that bugs me, is that in Remake you have an epic ending sequence of fights against sephirot, whispers and such. Here they rush from TotA to Forgotten City in a moment, yet again diverging from OG history. And into other epic fights that means nothing...
In part 3 we are gonna fight again against sephirot and jenova and a weir form of God sephirot and in a galaxy like plane just like the final sequence of OG where u beat sephirot with omnislash.
Or hopefully we will take the fight inside the lifestream and fight the last remnant of sephirit and jenova in another place beyond time and space, probably with the help of aerith and zack and then instead of sephiroth flying away, actually killing him
It's more simple than that Ultimate Aerith and Cloud  or 2 stuff
Was Intermission's post-credits scene the aftermath of what happened in Spitz's world since Zack finds all those people in mourning (presumably over Aerith getting merc'd by Sephiroth) when he enters the church?
    No, because before entering the church, Zack is preparing a speech, because he felt guilty to Aerith for his long absence. So he hasn't found her unconscious body yet, this hasn't happened in any timeline that we know of, which means it's either a new timeline or this scene was just a teaser advertisement. Perhaps at that moment, Zack's script was not fully completed or was changed later.
Uhh, Ultimate OG Aerith is the one Cloud dates? What? Can you explain / prove this a bit more?
    Yes, I can. Aerith, who has a date with Cloud, knows her future, which means that this is not our Aerith from the main timeline. At their first meeting in the church, Aerith promised Cloud a date for protection from the Turks. In the original timeline, this did not happen, so Aerith pays back the debt plus enjoys something real after an eternity in the Lifestream. When they first find themselves in the universe of Spitz, she says that this is her dream, everyone takes it literally, but for a dead person, a dream is to be alive. The finale of the date repeats the original, Sephiroth catches up with Aerith, and Cloud is powerless to help.
I can't understand how you're all going crazy about multiverse. 

Zack world is probably the hazy world of dead in the lifestream where time is stopped and consciousness merged, aerith as a cetra can have a glimpse on it (as she sense Zack when her hand is in the lifestream). If you know OG story, Sephiroth fighting within it is logical because of his plan and cloud can catch a glimpse of it at the end of rebirth.
Stupid question, where do you guys see these dog stamps, i never realized it at all 😔
I just want to know why Shiba Sephiroth went to the church. It makes in the Spitz timeline because Aerith is there, but what happened on Shiba?
Incredible, I’m certain this chart is more confusing than the game.
Hate this so much.
You know an ending is confusing when people are making charts about it, and I am actually finding it quite hilarious.
Ah, the Kingdom Hearts experience, where every characters has at least two alternate versions and a dozen timeline
Loved Rebirth 10/10, cool to see this made.
Kinda hope the game bombs in sales so they get rid of Nomura and nojima. Might be able to get a good ffX remake.
Thanks a lot for the chart! I'm not sure why people are bothered that it's too complicated or not faithful, isn't it the whole point of the remake? If it was just a 1:1 copy, then that'd be it. You don't have to look past the face value if you don't want to, but these novel multiverse thingies are what kept the dialogue and discourse among fans for years after Remake. I really enjoyed all the time i spent theorizing about Rebirth with my friends and watching Max's streams as well. I don't want anyone to rob me off that because of some selfish desires to preserve something that already exists in the past. I'm looking forward for all of that again with Rebirth, there's certainly a lot to say.
Ah right, got sudden flashback of remakes release I forgot this sub is going to turn into circlejerk sub for the next couple of months of the most incessant whining acting like the ending beat your wife and fucked your dog infront of you.

Going to need a low-sodium so I can just talk about this amazing game without a little bitch in my ear telling me is bad.
sickos.jpg
So you're on a reddit for a game you've not finished. That's kinda on you bud
    i said it was my bad 🤷
According to wikipedia there are 360 breeds of dog so that is the maximum number of alternate timelines.
    What if it's the same breed but a different kind of hat........there's so many hats...kutaja save us..
    I want to see St. Bernard stamp.

Jokes aside, how many breeds of SMALL dogs are there, because it only seems to be smaller dogs that are candidates to be Stamp-ed.
        The game is made in Japan after all, there's not a lot of space. Definitely not a lot of room for some golden retrievers in those 500 sq ft apartments they have to cram into.
            My european ass thinking "well damn 500 of something doesn't sound too bad, nani the hell?" and then googling the conversion into square metres. It's 46.5 square metres.

Jesus that is CRAMPED for a big dog. It'd be cramped for MY fat arse and, after conversion, I stand at an absolutely gigantic, monstruous even, "5 foot 6"(and don't say otherwise).
                Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
                You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
            Do you think that’s the reason why so Japanese people seem to prefer cats to dogs? Is it because they’re a better fit for their smaller apartments and/or that they don’t require as much maintenance as a dog does? 

I know that there are plenty of people in Japan who own and love dogs. I’m definitely not saying that dogs aren’t loved by the Japanese; however, it just seems *to me* that cats are the more popular pet and I’m curious as to why.
            Might have to deploy the cat stamp platoon
        St. Bernards are such good dogs. When I was 18 my best friend Tom got a puppy named Heidi. She was such a sweet girl, and when I crashed over at his place she would hop up onto the couch and sleep on top of me. 

Flash-forward to a year later when she’s a fully-grown pooch who *still had to lay on top of me* when I crashed on his couch. OUCH. She may have weighed more than I did at the time! But she was such a sweet girl that you would just let her climb onto your lap. Heidi was never my dog of course, but I miss that Very Good Girl all the same.
            I had a similar experience with a Newfoundland. Glorious beings, they are, and my grandma's was ever so sweet and would love to cuddle. I, for one, really like breathing, I'd go as far as to say I love it so much I live for it, but I made as much of an exception for that huge ball of floof even after he grew to an absolutely staggering size. He was a hugger, too. Bless that dog, he had a good life and I hope he thought I was part of what made it good, but this was when I was much younger. The only bad thing about most dogs is their lifespan. So unfair.
    Where’s my Husky universe 😀
    oh my god yes 😂
    I feel it's safe to say that there are 7 different possible timelines, considering its FFVII, Sephiroth says 7 seconds to the end, and there are a good amount of "7" references in the game.
        It's definitely lunched home way more than it needs to be lol.   Just in the costa del sol ticket quest they get tickets 7 and 77!
    It will all come full ***circle***. Which is also the shape of a planet. And a ball.
    Which means... all our headcanons are prolly canon now...
    Black Lab! Chocolate Lab! Yellow Lab! Chesapeake Golden Retriever! Australian Cattle Dog! Australian Shepherd (not actually Australian but adorable anyway)! Caviler King Charles Spaniel! German Shepherd! Burmese Mountain Dog! Staffy Pit! 

So many pooches, all good boys and good girls. 

Siiiiigh. I miss having a dog. After my Australian Cattle Dog died a few years ago I’ve been wanting to adopt a new pupper, but I’m just not ready yet. You never reallly get over losing a beloved dog or cat, or whatever pet you adore. Every time I get home from work and she’s not laying by the front door waiting for me I feel some little pain. Dogs - man’s best friend but without man’s lifespan. 

My daughter just got herself a kitten, and while he’s an adorable little turd he too will die far before she’s ready to let him go. I wish our pets could have lifespans comparable to our own! 

Back to your regularly-scheduled FFVII subreddit programming.
    Don't forget the stars on each dogs hat, maybe that denotes a number to the line, so we play in Beagle 5, and somewhere out there we will find a Beagle Prime world.

/s
    I suppose you could say multiverse theory has come... full circle! 😎

***<dies of own cringe>***
    Dog world
I never noticed it either. 

I don't know why they are insisting on making this game so convoluted. The only thing I can think of is fan service: people like the wildly-popular Zack and Aerith, and they want them both to have a bigger role. Guess SE is willing to muddy this story further just to appease that crowd.
we the players are zack
I love that while he's getting universe swapped and sent to multiple boss fights at the end he takes a moment to just stop and go "what the hell is even happening right now!?"
    I was like "same bro, same"
He had to deal with Genesis for a full game. He's used to just going with the nonsense.
I like how even tho he doesn’t know what’s really going on, by the end of Rebirth he still arrives at a goal he needs to pursue - to somehow unite the worlds
Hopefully they just focus on 1 or 2 timelines but yeah as I was watching the end, I was keeping track of the different worlds based on the dog
    Pug and Shiba universe seem mostly irrelevant and in my opinion were only used to illustrate the idea that a new universe is created with every major decision / deviation from fate. 

Spitz universe needed to be separate to make it clear that it's not just the "normal" Terrier Aerith and Cloud randomly waking up (and to give the Terrier universe a chance to continue, since Sephiroth probably kills Aerith after she gives Cloud the white Materia in that universe).

Not sure which universes ended after the Sephiroth fight, but I'd guess Terrier universe is the only one of Zack's worlds we'll see again in part 3, if any.
        But I also think Aerith’s consciousness is traveling between worlds. It’s the same Aerith in every timeline just as it’s the same Sephiroth.

I think Jessie’s theory in remake about her dad confirms this when Biggs tells Cloud the theory that his consciousness is trapped somewhere between his body and the planet. 

Aerith has the power to transition between these.
        Absolutely correct. After all, at least one planet must die to make the Meteor to traverse the Rift, and given how Zack's one is literally going to deteriorate and implode very soon... man, Square is doing everything possible to make Zack fate miserable.
        I'm thinking that the Aerith that gives Cloud the White Materia is the Aerith that had been dead in the OG timeline all the way to Advent Children.

When Seph shows up he says something like "so, this is where you've been hiding." Maybe Aerith and Seph have constantly been fighting ever since AC ended.
        Which universe is which?
I know that we have the normal timeline, the Zack timeline, the Biggs timeline (Zack in Reactor 6), the Cloud timeline (Zack in Shinra HQ) and the Aerith timeline (Zack and Sephiroth in church??) This is probably the only thing that's confusing me
            Terrier is the one we throughout the game multiple times which tells Zack's story.

Pug (Biggs) and Shiba (Zack staying at the church, wondering what to do) are only used for short scenes to show how new worlds are born.

Spitz is where the Aerith dream date happens and she gives the white Materia to Cloud.
        Outside chapter 14, Terrier is the only other one we see right?

With Spitz and Pug happening due to Zacks indecisiveness.

I knew something was "off" with Spitz Aerith, but i just thought that WAS Spitz Aerith with a bit more knowledge, though her behavior was a bit off to me as well (hell even Cloud noticed)

Didnt know ther was an "Ultimate" Aerith lol. And here i thought i was following along pretty well.
            Yeah, chapter 14 is the only one where we suddenly get a whole new pack of worlds in addition to the 2 (main and Terrier) we already knew.

"Ultimate Aerith" is just the most popular theory as to why Aerith acts the way she does in that scene. There is nothing ingame that suggests an "Ultimate Aerith" exists. Without outside knowledge, we are just supposed to notice that Aerith is acting weird and not as she usually does.  
We'll probably learn more about that in Part 3.

        Nomura didnt write this lol
        Nojima is the writer lmfao
This is correct, but what this post doesn’t mention is that all of these other timelines are doomed to die or already have. I personally think that most of the other timelines shown in Rebirth were just to explain how different choices create different existences. But I highly doubt any of those other realities actually matter. The only timelines that will likely have any effect going forwards are the main one, which ever one Zack is alive in, and if there is one where Aerith lived.
    One idea I'm interested in is that, if the lifestream gets "spread" over every new timeline created, then it's entirely possible Sephiroth hopes to spread it so thin that it can't possibly defend against meteor.
        I think Meteor is a red herring now, and I'm convinced of this because of the added lore changes about the Gi and their situation.

They created the Black Materia because they wanted to end their suffering of being stuck in spiritual form. The Lifestream won't accept them because they're alien in nature. Sephiroth, because of the nature of his creation, is also set apart from The Lifestream. He is stuck between his body and the planet, so he can't really do anything except possess bodies that have Jenova cells in them.

In one of the side stories Aerith (the one in The Lifestream) mentions that Sephiroth is still there even after his defeat, but she describes that The Lifestream "washes off his back like rain", so Sephiroth is trapped in some kind of limbo in his afterlife.

The Sephiroth we're seeing in Remake/Rebirth may not want the same thing as he did in the OG story. The whole "become a god" thing could just be him manipulating the party.
            It also crossed my mind as well that that could be the case.  What's interesting with the new Black Materia lore is that it doesn't necessarily summon Meteor per say, it works to enact "destruction" per the will of the user. 

The Gi intended to use it to destroy their spirits thus relieving them of their tormented state and Sephiroth needed it to cause a wound so great to the planet it would take the entirety of the Lifestream to heal.

That being said, Sephiroths greatest weaknesses, despite his power, is his obsession with carrying out Jenovas Will and his utter inability to perceive anyone else as a threat. I'd reckon that despite this Sephiroth obviously having knowledge he shouldn't have, he's still trying to get to the same destination through a different road.

I think it would be rather poetic that, despite the ability to actually change his destiny, Sephiroth refuses to actually learn from his experiences and correct his mistakes.
                I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
                    I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
                        If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
                            I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                                I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
        I had the same thought when Sephiroth sent his whispers to dry out a mako spring in cosmo canyon as seen in bugenhagen’s side quest. We never see him do stuff like that in the original and he also didn’t have whispers then so I strongly believe that it’s part of his plan. Sephiroth knows exactly how he lost in the original and is trying his hardest to mitigate each factor (such as pitting Shinra and Wutai against each other so Rufus is too distracted to destroy the Northern Crater barrier with the Sister Ray)
            The dark whispers are still fascinating to me because it's hard to tell if they're directly under aephiroths control or if sephiroth has potentially manipulated them into trying to enforce an alternate "destiny." Possibly a universe where Sephiroth has already won. Then again, they may just be representing the lifestream that Sephiroth and Jenova have already corrupted.
    There’s a hundred percent a timeline where Aerith lives.  The game touches on this timeline the absolute least amount of time.  You see glimpses of it in the very first moment shown after he deflects masamune but the game quickly shifts to all the other timelines where he didn’t, including he main timeline where he apparently deflected masamune but not completely.

After all the battles, it revisits this one single timeline again, where Cloud tells Aerith to wake up.   I firmly believe in this timeline, the rest of the party is either lost to the void or is still blocked by whispers.  It’s hard to say without a whole third game to explain the outcome properly so, see you in four years.
Not really, short of it is an Aerith can see all realities is trying to save us from the life stream and Sephiroth who can also see all realities is trying to stop her. 

She's now enlisted Cloud to help her, since he can see all the realities now and Aerith.

We'll likely get a convergence event in the next game that will flatten the story since Sephiroth is trying to create a convergence.
This still stuff this doesn’t explain though

Why do the whispers try to stop us from leaving Midgar when they want to us to follow the originals plot before Sephiroth controls them. Why do the white whispers constantly flip between working with us and against us?
It's not that complicated. Just remember that different choices create alternate timelines. Each timeline is a product of a wayward choice. An infinitely branching future. Zack chose 3 different things and created 3 different timelines. Zack surviving itself was its own timeline. Now Zack's goal is to unite all timelines and save everyone.
    So Zack chose 3 different things, alright cool but what does it have to do with the story? remake, and rebirth still pretty much have the same outcome as the OG.
        Did you just not pay attention to the ending? He literally says that he wants to reunite all the timelines to save everyone. That's his goal. This means that he could reunite the timelines in which everyone is alive and beat Sephiroth together. Zack's whole segment was setting him up to be this being that the lifestream had chosen to fix the world by saving everyone to defeath Sephiroth. He keeps getting saved by the white whispers. The white whispers from what we know seem to represent the planet and the lifestream. 


Maybe he succeeds, maybe he doesn't. Regardless his part isn't over yet. Him and cloud will definitely interact in the future. Aerith will also still play a huge part. I suspect the final boss battle's party will consist of Zack Cloud and Aerith regardless of whether they are all truly alive in the main timeline or not.

So while Cloud is off finding Sephiroth, Zack will be trying to figure out how to reunite the timelines.
            Maybe Zack is just a marketing strategy, a way to interest Zack fans into buying the game. Have you ever thought about that?

This whole defy fate or multiverse stuffs and the story still ended up the same as the OG. No need to try brain storming this shit cause it is wasted anyway.
                Believe what you want to.
You got 5 years, you can make it if you start now
Please. This is basic KH
Yes, but Biggs is unique. In his case, another universe was not created where he survived, but HE himself was transported from the timeline of the Beagle to the timeline of the Terrier. That's why he has memories of another universe that others don't have. Is this done for something important? To be honest, I think it's just a trick to confuse us. And as for Marlin, the "touch" with Aerith could happen in all timelines, because we see that events went about the same way without Cloud, the only difference is that the journey ended in defeat.
    I don't see why the Whispers saved Biggs, but not Wedge. Plus the wanted poster with just Biggs left. Was that just to give Zack a guide and link to Beagle?
        What I got from it is that the "prime" consciousness of Biggs simply redistributed itself because a world now exists in which he survived.
    Events didn't go the same way without Cloud, Cloud was there. Marlene remembers him, Biggs remembers him, the Shinra troopers at the very start of the game talk about the last member being an ex-Soldier with a buster sword who's missing.
    But those scenes demonstrated that these worlds are related to Zack and the choices he makes.

In the corkscrew tunnel scene. We saw a flashback of Marlene describing Sephiroth as the scary man. **Then the camera pans over to the White Materia as** **Minerva's theme plays for about 10 seconds**. Following this, we see Zack with Terrier graffiti behind him as decides to enter the right tunnel to Shinra HQ. Then we see a lifestream burst out of the tunnel which Zack would have entered to save Biggs.

Following that we see both outcomes. Shinra HQ leads Zack to face the Shinra Army, so he buzzes off on his motorcycle.

Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

In addition, we see another possible outcome where Zack never made a choice and he's sitting on the Church steps. This is yet another timeline (Corgi). And Sephiroth vanquishes him with his whispers.

I bolded the Minerva part because that's a big clue. Holy does what it does based on the will of the planet. And Minerva is the will of the lifestream and thus has the power to defy destiny as she demonstrated in Crisis Core.

&#x200B;

All of that said. I am not defending how those scenes were depicted. Just breaking them down.
        >Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

Except that isn’t what we saw. He isn’t wearing the ribbon. Which they specifically focus on.
            Biggs had a bag of Stamp's Champs with a Pug Stamp on the front. Then he said the reactor is sucking up dirt because the lifestream is bone dry. So what do you mean that isn't what we saw?
                I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
                    I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
                        >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
                            And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                                That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
        Don't forget the will of the Goddess is mentioned in Loveless which may be a spoiler for Minerva. Also, the puppet of fate which most likely alludes to Cloud.
            They drove the LOVELESS stuff pretty hard. They changed the poem for the US localisation, but it remained the same in the Japanese.
        >This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

"Every choice creates a timeline but if it's not the mysterious and arbitrary 'correct' choice then your whole timeline is doomed and slowly dissolves lmao get fucked. You can pop into the main timeline to help a bit but you're still ultimately doomed" is a rules system for time travel that is used by exactly *Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,* *Homestuck,* and basically nothing else. There's no way that's not just a weird coincidence, even if FF7R and HS are *also* both meta stories about the concept of canon, but I want to believe.
    Yeah, and then Biggs still fucking died, so what was the point of bringing him back? Looks like Zack ended up dying too.
    Biggs in another world is to pave the way to Zach entering the main world.
    Agree with all you said here, small side note the news broadcast is not the exact same. In the beginning of the game (Terrier timeline) the reporter pauses his words when he almost walks into Shinra truck driving on the road. In Kalm (now back in Beagle timeline) on the radio version, this pause is not there.
Remake is coming out, nobody understands anything 

but thank god there are the ultimanias that you can buy later so you can read what the hell happened in the remake 

passive skill on FF7 lore +3 
which are useful for Reddit discussion 

Anyone who hasn't read the Ultimanias is at a disadvantage muhahahahahaha 

Marketing 10/10
    Basically 
> different choices create new universes through their outcomes. This aligns perfectly with what the developers said in the Remake Ultimania where they identified Terrier Stamp to Zack's victory.

The difference here is that Zack's victory didn't come at the cost of him or Shinra soldiers making a choice. It simply happened to him a binary  way. He was losing and then he wasn't.


Which is a great problem, because now it breeds confusion if that is intentional, or simply poor writing not taking these things into account.
    So, this is my theory. It was intentional but not by Zack's choice. It was lifestream Aerith's choice to save Zack as fate was killed.

All through Remake, Sephiroth is trying to manipulate us into destroying fate and to go against the whispers, which keep the timeline in order by the planet. That way there is only one world. In Beagle world, we destroyed fate which spawned many worlds including Spitz world, because the whispers were no longer keeping everything guided along a singular path.

Zack said he was losing surrounded by Shinra, felt a gust of wind and then he just wasn't. You, the player, get to see the whispers are that gust of wind and that they altered the bullet to barely nick his cheek, with a rainbow like effect signaling it was an act of lifestream Aerith. But not only was he saved, he was also whisked into a world (Spitz world) where the battle against Fate was ending, which is why it seems like there is some weird overlap of end of crisis core leading to end of midgar.

\---------------

To explain their powers:

We know that lifestream Sephiroth and lifestream Aerith have the power to not only send people to and from Worlds, but also to affect the worlds those people are in.

As Jenova dies after the Aerith death, we see the white whispers circling the party, again more rainbow like effects popping up. It then cuts to Zack walking in a bunch of white, and the white whispers show up with Cloud with more rainbow like effects emanating from Cloud. Zack touches him and they pop out in a fight with Sephiroth. 

After the battle with Cloud and Zack, Sephiroth slashes his sword and says "Just as Worlds unite, so too do they part", and Zack gets sent to a World with meteor crashing down on the World in the background. We cut back to the party that just killed Jenova and there is no sign of Cloud which shows that white Whispers took him and sent him to Zack. The party even asks "Any sign of him? Do you think the whispers got him? Did they take him somewhere?" So, the power of bringing people to and from worlds is confirmed.

Now, during Zack's fight with meteor in the background, a random circle will pop up that will heal you if you are in it and shield you from an attack. With Aerith not presumably around in this world, it means lifestream Aerith is helping him in this battle. I know it's a weak argument on how they can affect worlds, but this would explain how she was able to alter the bullet that saved Zack in the first place.

\-----------------

So back to the theory, as he arrives at Midgar in Spitz world, this is a world where Avalanche failed in their fight and ended up unconscious after the fight. Because they didn't defeat fate, Aerith's white materia in this world remained active and didn't get drained like the Beagle world, where Aerith confirmed beating fate caused it to lose it's color.

Presumably, seeing this, lifestream Aerith then plots a plan to save Zack, and brought him to the Spitz world so that Zack would bring Cloud to Midgar, knowing that he would bring Cloud close to where she is because she knows he would check up on her. This is so that later on, she can also bring "Cloud 1" to the Spitz world while lifestream Aerith can inhabit the Aerith body there. She gives Cloud the white matera to then take back to his Aerith in the beagle world.
    >The difference here is that Zack's victory didn't come at the cost of him or Shinra soldiers making a choice. It simply happened to him a binary  way. He was losing and then he wasn't.

&#x200B;

  It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

  

>Which is a great problem, because now it breeds confusion if that is intentional, or simply poor writing not taking these things into account.

I am not defending that scene in the slightest. I have very mixed feelings about it personally. It feels like alot of important context was cut from the final product in a last minute revision. Because it does feel like it wasn't thought through very well.
        > It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear. Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there. Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense. 


Why aren't we just making some choices that lead to a good, uncorrupted Sephiroth coming to help us? Why aren't any of these decisions leading to other events even further in the past changing? Like Gast's fate, or Ifalna? Or Vincent and Lucrecia?


It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation.
            >Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear.

&#x200B;

I didn't move the definition. I said both choices and outcomes from the beginning. The very first one starts with Zack's victory. We are told that Terrier Stamp symbolizes that. Then in the span of  10 minutes we see several other Stamp breeds that reflect different outcomes based on his decision. Because the point was to show us how Zack is effecting these worlds. 

&#x200B;

> Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there.

Sephiroth divulged everything at the TofA scene. So that is what it is. There are infinite possible worlds based on what Sephiroth said. But we're not going to explore all of those worlds. We're only exploring the ones that matter and that's the one where Zack, Marlene, and Elmyra are in. 

The point here isn't so much what was shown as it is why it was shown. The message intended for the audience. To visually demonstrate what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. How each choice leads to a different outcome, and thus a new universe that is doomed from the start. 

&#x200B;

> Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense.   
>

 Think back to what we saw in those cutscenes. Several different worlds that are near the end. Now think about what Sephiroth said. "Each of these worlds are bound to the planet as one". Hence, these worlds are dying because the planet is dying. So it's not a situation where Zack can just zip in and out of timelines til he finds the best one. Because they're all doomed. 

 The other question is whether or not this multiverse is something that is supposed to exist, or something that is a result of a corrupted lifestream. While it seems like the latter would be the case, Dirge has some crazy shit that makes you wonder. And the last two chapters of Rebirth were on par with that.
Yeah this needs a  text explanation with it or the chart needs to be organized in a way that you know where to start looking at it.
Honestly I think even this makes it more complicated than it needs to be lol
    Agreed!

I'm sticking with 'dream aerith gives Cloud a full white materia which he swaps for real aerith's empty one, allowing real aerith to summon holy and become schroedingers aerith just in time for part 3.'
It would have been a lot simpler if they just fucking killed her.
    I mean technically they still did
        And also didn’t as we see another timelime get created by cloud deflecting sephiroth’s sword, with the rainbow effect on it as well, then for some reason we get transported back to a timeline featuring dead aerith

What I dislike about this ending is how fucking hard to understand it is, I get that they were going for a “this isn’t the same as the original” type of vibe, to entice you to play it even if you think ypu already know everything, but if they really wanted to do that then saving aerith would have achieved a significant “how are things gonna change next?” effect without this much of a mess
            My theory is that timelines were created at the fall of the Cetra empire, maybe as some means to actually pacify Jenova, confusing it or whatever as a last ditch effort to stave off obliteration (this is almost directly referenced in the game, as it is never fully explained why Jenova decided to just take a big ol nap). These timelines have coexisted for millenia, in some status quo of reality always at the edge of complete destruction. These timelines are powered by the lifestream (again for some reason related to pacifying Jenova). Shinra siphoning off mako has weakened the separation of realities, as the lifestream can no longer fully support them all at once. Aerith, as the last Cetra, actually exists as a single soul among all concurrent timelines. It would make sense that if the Cetra created these branches, they can walk across them at will. This is why she is aware of her imminent death after communing fully with her ancient ancestors, that if she dies in one timeline, she will die in all of them, she is a single soul. This would make the strange dead-not-dead Aerith scene make sense. If it isn't some version of this, all hope is lost lol. But this is what I gathered from my playthrough and what is being eluded to. We will see I guess.
        I mean technically after they did she was with cloud fighting sephiroth so, no.
    They did, I take it as cloud is so broken right now he can’t comprehend her being gone, I think when Tifa walked up to see the aftermath is flashed to show cloud covered in blood, then quickly back to his version where he wasn’t
My sentiments exactly 😄
Same here. Can't believe they had to muddle the story with this crap.
Nomura did what he always wanted since the beggining.

He transformed FF7 fans into Kingdom Hearts fans.  This is what Kingdom Hearts fans have to deal with on a daily basis, lol.
    Nomura: THAT WAS NOJIMA!  NOT ME!
    What if you got into Kingdom Hearts because you're an FF7 fan. Do people just forget that KH came out after FF7
    Idk I'm a die hard kh fan could tell you the whole story and this game confused tf outta me
It’s only because to western standards, Marvel and DC hammered the audience on what their version of them are. The remake trilogy was developed before they went all in on this concept so Square are late to the punch making it seemed boring.
    I think this is a bit reductive. Time travel and multiverse shit has been a plague on franchises for longer than just the last decade of comic book movies lol
        and even prior to their return in Cinema, they had already been plaguing 2000s era television series

SE did this because they wanted to jump on a trend, something theyve been doing for the better part of 2 decades. they arent the only devs, JP or otherwise, who do this either. Bayonetta 3 sullied its series future with this uncalled for embrace as well
        Chrono Cross did multiverse way back when, that story didn't make a lot of sense by the end either.
    They definitely saw that the multiverse was popular when they were developing remake and were like “hey let’s do that” and ironically when Rebirth came out everyone was sick of the multiverse already lmao
        EXACTLY.
If you think about it Final Fantasy has always been a multiverse. Many different worlds sharing the same creatures, monsters, deities, summons, etc.
Tbf only two rly matter right now still, I don’t think the others are going to matter as much
Same thing happened with Kingdom Hearts 3.

The entire plot leaked a week earlier but everyone was so confused by it that they thought it was a shitpost or something and didn't even considered it spoilers.
    They didn’t get the Yozora reveal though. That was the only surprise.
    ok thats funny.
I remember when Remake reviews came out in 2020 and there was comparisons to the Rebuild of Evangelion films being thrown around. That sure turned out to be very accurate.
    Man, Imagine if Nomura pulls a Evangelion and Cloud doesn't end up with neither Tifa or Aerith but with Jessie. That would be a certified Evangelion middle finger moment, ha-ha, but I don't think they are brave enough.
        I want Zack to end up with Cissnei, dammit!
Yep called it a week ago
    For what it's worth some people were saying that when Remake came out. Made me also think of Star Trek (2009) and how that film is also kind of a "in universe reboot" that sits alongside the main timeline and they interact with eachother.
Only difference is, the Rebuilds didn't use all these multiverse shenanigans to justify changes to the story. >!Even though its theorized that Rebuild is part of a continuing cycle of Shinji trying to get it right!< The changes were made and it stood on it as its own thing.
    Isn't there a line in the third one where someone outright says "This has all happened before?"
        Kaworu I believe.
Absolutely 
Bro's gonna curl up in a corner breathing heavily with a rasp after running towards the ship to Wutai, wouldn't even make it ON the ship and be left behind.
    😂😂
“Pug universe” lmao
Felt weird playing 80 hours of an incredibly solidly crafted experience only to have it land in such a clusterfuck. Like, I love the rest of the game, but there’s no other way to put it
    To say it suddenly landed in a clusterfuck is putting our heads in the sand. Every scene with Zack was building up to what we saw at the end. 

I personally felt so unsatisfied. They showed everything in trailers, left nothing to the imagination, all while refusing to commit to anything with emotional consequence.

In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.
        Yeah that scene hurt! His personal trial with Myrna was painful too.

With Aerith? Meh. Apparently death isn't final, which cheapens the emotional impact this scene originally had.
        I skipped most of the trailers, so I don’t quite have the same experience, but I agree they were clearly setting up something, but I didn’t expect it all to come out during what is supposed to be an emotional gut punch, I really thought they respected the OG enough to let that scene breathe more, but idk. And i actually don’t agree that you can’t tell a complicated story like this well, imo 13 Sentinels is a great example of a seemingly super complex story that has a really clean resolution. But it feels like they chose a terrible moment to execute on their grand ideas.
        >In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.

kinda funny to me because to me it was one of the most butched parts.

i mean not to defend all the multiverse nonsense but at least there they are going for change. but the small changes around Dyne and Barrets situation ruins it for me. fuck of with Dyne being a barely fuctioning mad man. when he was a broken but fuctional man in the OG that was so much harder hitting. the only hint that he was mentally unwell was hearing the voice of his wife but even that he knew was delusions. and the game can fuck right of with the action scene of Shinra showing up right after.
        You really shouldn't watch Square Enix trailers within about 6 months of the release of a game, they ALWAYS do this.

Also there were tonnes more scenes than just Dyne vs Barret that hit right, the multiverse stuff only infected the story at the end.
    I mean, did you not see the signs while playing the rest of the game? The introduced many clusterfucks along the way.
>not nearly as emotionally engaging as a simple quiet scene of the life of a girl you loved being snuffed out in front of you.

You nailed it.
Nah you're right. They're overcomplicating the story and significantly damaging it.
Nail on the fucking head.

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO FUCKING DONE WITH MULTIVERSAL FATE STORIES.

If nothing is permanent or binding or unique, then everything is meaningless.

Pepe Silvia couldn't work this shit out for them.

![gif](giphy|l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA|downsized)

Save the cheerleader, save the world. Or don't. Doesn't matter, multiverse Heroes and timey wimpy bullshit will save the day anyway.
I don't think you are meant to save the multiverse. The question, I think, is what single universe all this mess will settle into once the dust is cleared. The one we all know where Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus follow up FFVII, or another one where things go more according to what Sephiroth would have wanted.

Considering AC is supposedly canon to the Remake timeline the answer is clear.
    We're told all the branching universes are doomed, they don't matter.
Cant say anything except that I totally agree with you. Of course I wasn’t expecting a 1:1 recreation of the og but at this point, as you said, any meaningful character deaths that had real effect on the story and its characters was totally lost.
Agreed 100%.

The only reason why I cried during Rebirth Aerith's death scene was because the music reminded me of OG's. I've played OG hundreds of times since 1997, and the emotional impact of that scene has left an impression on me lifelong. That was an iconic scene, one of the most famous heart-breaking scenes in all of RPG history, and Rebirth butchered it:

- We didn't see Sephy impale her bc Cloud deflected (lolwut)
- Aerith came back to "fight" against Sephy (Bizzaro Sephiroth, no less! tf?)
- Aerith "woke up" in Zack's timeline, meaning she's dead in the main timeline? But she didn't feel dead at all.
- Her continued presence with Cloud (during the fight, then later at the Tiny Bronco) made her feel alive still, and again not dead at all.
- There was no water burial, with her descending to the bottom (like OG)
- Cloud didn't cry and hold her, cursing Sephiroth before the Jenova fight like he did in OG. That was an extremely emotional scene I would have liked to hear acted.
- Aerith's Holy materia did not glow pale green, implying that she never summoned Holy. Her only prayer was to "keep her friends safe"; said nothing about protecting the planet, etc.

How could they leave out so many key parts to such a pivotal scene?
    This is exactly my problem with it.   All wishy washy switch’s universe bullshit.  It didn’t have any of the emotional impact that I was expecting.
Hoping multiverse drawbacks such as low stakes are rectified a bit if there aren’t infinite worlds as such, but only new ones spawned at these key moments. But these new ones are short lived. And also, that all the worlds are just really within the lifestream so it’s a bit more contained conceptually
yeah i'm with you 100%, i hate multiverse crap
This is my thought. This is all leading back to the original ending. The timelines are going to get converged (probably by Sephiroth), the main party is going to have to sacrifice something/someone (like having alt-Aerith and alt-Zack die, truly, the way they were supposed to), and the moral will be that you can’t outrun destiny and try to have all of the good with none of the bad. Same ending, different journey to get there. 

That, or it goes 110% wild and has a totally different ending and plot. I’m about 50/50 on that, as it is Nomura we are talking about.
    But if it will end the same way, then less is more.  They should have left out all of the garbage and told the excellent story of the original with more content (like they have been doing 99% of the time).
At the end of part 3, the camera pans out from the Northern Crater while scrolling text explains that Cloud died in the first reactor explosion.
    With this music blasting in the background: [https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58](https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58)
    One of the funniest posts here 😀
Ultimate Antagonist Sephiroth ruining Aerith's death scene for the player with Whispers is the greatest unintentional self-insert by a creator in the history of games.
    Considering how significant that scene was, not only to FF7 but to gaming, it might be, no joke
That's because multiple timelines, being done poorly like this, leaves the narrative weightless, just like "it was all just a dream".
    Ironically they even made Sephiroth say to the player at one point basically ”this makes no sense now right? It’s probably just a dream or something”… *sigh*
It better not be. I’m still salty the original ending is a bad ending and it all leads to Advent Children. Then what’s the point of this fate shit?
    The point was solely to keep you anticipating Rebirth and now the 3rd part for four years. As stated by the developers multiple times.
        So false advertising and a lie? Also a Paradox since it's strong hinted that this is AC Sephiroth messing with everything to begin with.
totally agree that it's needlessly complicated but it's not exactly a retcon or an out....the implication is not only is it not a dream, but that there's no outrunning the events of the OG even by hopping universes.
Nah it isnt a dream and you shouldnt focus on all the different timelines just know that they co exist and are doomed to fade
    I don't mean it's literally a dream, I mean it's just a poor writing trope that allows for pretty much any kind of nonsense with little or no consequence, regardless of whether it fits with the currently established universe - which this whole thing really doesn't.
        It doesnt? How tho? Cus it has been established since one game ago
Its really simple. Dont concentrate on all the diff timelines
    I had to rewatch the ending two times to filter out what was a different timeline and what wasn't with aerith on screen. That shouldn't happen when your making as big of a moment as a character death. Confusion isn't good storytelling at pivotal moments.
        They actually ruined the most famous death scene in all of gaming man…I can’t believe what I watched lmao
            Anyone expecting them to just straightforwardly kill her wasn't reading the writing on the wall. I don't think a complicated story is inherently bad. But yeah you can argue execution wasn't great in some ways but "ruined " her death seems pretth strong.  I'm still very interested to see where it goes.
                I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
                    I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
                    They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
                    I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
                        Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
                Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
    Honestly this is what I've been doing. The different world shit feels so pointless because it doesn't really accomplish anything for the central narrative of the original. Only time it became impossible to ignore for me is the ending of Rebirth. That scene was too important to drag down with all the multiverse stuff
When the creator of "Kingdom Hearts" is in charge of the whole series, what else can you expect?
    He was also part of the original team and the story writer is also the same, stop playing nomura for every decision, it's tiring
    Nomura is the one reining them all in. He isn't the one making all these wacky choices for the games he directs.

He said recently that he see his name being blamed for certain choices online but didn't even write most of them
    He was against changes
        bet
As much as I love how faithful this remake is, sort of wish they wouldn't do the whole timeline stuff. I love the remake project and everything about it but,  
It's so overrated nowadays to do the whole timeline universe thing, it creates plot holes that can easily be fixed with another timeline.
And the funny thing is, it's not even the ending. I have no idea what really happened at the end, there are only assumptions that are not supported by anything.
    I have no faith the ending will be good, as remake and rebirth were both fantastic games that completely and utterly butchered the ending. If the third one follows 90% of the original then fucks the ending I’ll call it a win as I did with rebirth. At least this time I expected a garbage ending and was pleasantly surprised for the most part there wasn’t too much horrible multiverse shit through it haha
lmfao... It's going to be a real plotline guarantee it
It doesn't. It's Nojima. He has never heard the concept of "less is more". For him, the more effort he puts into weaving a convoluted story together, the better that story is.
![gif](giphy|q49YSnLzrvghiyKBAR|downsized)
It's terrible.
It seems the original story was considered "too simple" by Square. I mean, I was just set in a fantasy world, featuring supernatural and genetically modified people. It was only about an alien (that was wrongly considered as ancient inhabitant of the planet) and was subject to not one but two Jenova projects. It was about chasing the dead body of that alient through the world (but without head and constantly appearing in the form of someone else, who is actually frozen in a crater). It was only about life after death. And it was only about a main character who is confusing himself with his friend, leading to a great twist in the middle of the game that basically changes the whole story. A major part of the information was given more implicitly than explicitly (my 10-years old me back in 1997 was just wondering why Cloud has sometimes black hair).

Obviously, the original plot was far too simple and boring. The two timelines introduced in Remake were not sufficient either because everybody expected them already. It needed arbitrary many timelines, but of course with intersections and characters moving between them. I am wondering what they could add in the third part to keep it interesting.
No one asked for Advent Children either, or Crisis Core and yet they were created and added things to the setting and story
    At least those things didn’t retroactively harm or touch the original game, and had a few redeemable aspects. Rebirth just straight up changed the most iconic moment of the game for the worse
        Well, OG is still there for you it can't retroactively harm the original game in any way since it never did leave open ends that weren't resolved prior to Remake and now Rebirth, you are just being dramatic.


Also btw, Remake and Rebirth also have "redeemable" aspects since it did a lot of things better than the OG as well as went deeper in various different story beats and world building the original FF7 couldn't focus too much on due to technical limitations of the time
The third game is surely named FFVII Re:Connect
Please do some research before complaining. This was not Nomura’s doing.
 that was my interpretation as well but is going to be impossible to have a proper discussion around here. I'm baffled by how much people are misinterpreting everything.
The remake trilogy would've benefitted massively from being self-contained. The only way to be surprised by the "twists" is if you're already going into this trilogy with certain expectations born from the original. This is obscenely shortsighted.  Imagine a newcomer playing Remake/Rebirth 30 years from now. The tonal/thematic shifts at the end will leave them confused. They'd then have to spend time researching what the fuck is happening, only to discover the endings were contingent on the presumed knowledge of a now 60-year-old game. It will immediately make the trilogy's story look like a product of its time instead of something timeless like the original.

I'm so frustrated by the shortsightedness of this trilogy. This was Square's chance to tell the story of Final Fantasy VII exactly how they wanted to tell it nearly 30 years ago. Now they're blowing it on multiverse hogwash because that's what's trendy. This trilogy will not have the same longevity as the original because as time goes on, less and less people will understand the endings because less and less people will have played the original Final Fantasy VII.
    I hope square knows that FF7 OG roms will be downloaded for years to come because of this lol
You also need to play Remake. No idea why they were advertising Rebirth as a standalone experience lol.
    Why would you need to play the original for this? I mean I have, but why do you need to?
        I think you need at least a basic understanding of the original FF7 story to get the full experience from Remake and Rebirth. 

You can still enjoy them without, but I just think you’re missing something. They’re not remakes, I think that they’re pretty clearly sequels to the original story in a way.
            They're sequels? Aren't they reimaginations?
                Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
    Because they needed sales since PS5 hasn't sold nearly as well as PS4
Fighting Fate 
/the Whispers drained it. The only thing I'm not getting from this is how they are supposed to permanently stop Sephiroth if he's capable of what he's doing now. Him and Aerith are pretty much trying to play chess against each other, but they keep starting side games.
    It sounded to me like the Whispers 'took away' both Aerith/Red's memories of the future AND Holy's power... I just don't know why they took away Holy? The memories make sense since they shouldn't have known the future in the first place... But Holy was always a part of the story. That's why I'm thinking it was Sephiroth's influence/plan to drain it?
        In the cutscene with Aerith and Red at johnnys hotel in costa del sol, it is explained that materia get their powers from the memories of the ancients stored within it, the whispers steal memories, during remake it got entirely drained of its memories
        Could it not have been Sepiroth who got the whispers to take away holy and their memories?
            That's my guess. Sephiroth gained control of the black whispers at the end of Remake and probably took both things away immediately.
Eh, OG FF7 gets already messy at times. This is just the second course. Still better than Genesis.
    Never to this extent though, not even close. There's a lot going on in ff7 but it's all pretty straightforward and explained by the end of the game
        So is this
            The difference is this is trash, and the og wasn't.
                lol nah.
        I mean, why are we assuming that by the end of part 3 the story won't also be explained? That said, the OG is not quite straightforward when you go into the details. Like the whole "Zack and Cloud memories mixed because they both got experimented and got Jenova's cells implanted in their bodies" or plot holes like Tifa not saying anything about the Nibelheim incident to Cloud (which THANK GOD Rebirth actually adress it) or Shinra sending Sephiroth to Nibelheim despite that being obviously a terrible idea as they knew Jenova was kept there. Plus some important info that could be easily missed (like the whole "is Sephiroth or Jenova in control?" which the answer is given subtly by Hojo when he's like "I thought the decayed Soldiers were going toward Jenova, but if it's not her, then...")
            FF7 isn't perfect, but multiverse instantly makes things messy. There's nothing about the original story of 7 that anybody should ever need a visual aid for though.
                They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
                    I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
                        And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
                            Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                                Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
            I'm less annoyed by things not being explained yet and more annoyed by not being able to take in the death scene without being completely confused what was real and what wasn't. Made it emotionless for me, which isn't good writing.
            IDK I feel like the messiest part of OG 7 was the whole debate on if it was really Sephiroth or Jenova illusions in charge for majority of the game (up until northern crater) -- Which is nothing in comparison to 7Re
                There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
                    Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
    Don't confuse OG FF7 with the compilation bs. Nobody likes Genesis either, btw.
        I didn't? I meant between Remake stuff and the whole stuff with Genesis from the compilation, I'd still take Remake over it. Ff7 can be messy like with the whole mixed memory plot line.
    But it always felt like the confusing stuff was all in some book or file you’d have to find somewhere, and not shoved in your face in the middle of what is supposed to be an impactful character death. Like, maybe I’d be a little happier if they let the death play out as normal in full and then just explain the actual plot in exposition afterwards, cause the way characters in game talk about all this shit is way too vague, I need it spoon-fed to me if they want to make it so complicated.
>clusters fucks that require graduate degrees to understand

I think most people with graduate degrees are smart enough to know that this nonsense is not even worth trying to understand. It's an overly convoluted mess made by a writer (writers?) who is way less smart than he thinks he is. 

I don't trust that they have a truly coherent plan or vision or explanation that actually makes sense, and I trust them even less to properly convey that vision to the player. If we ever get any kind of even remotely logical explanation (lol) it will be in an Ultimania or some shit.
    The only reason I wouldn't fire all these writers and bump them back down to moderating fanfiction forums is because they might start thinking some of the ideas from those places are actually good, start incorporating them into their own stories, and entirely miss the whole point that it would be a punishment
Honestly Kingdom Hearts isn’t that complicated, just a lot to remember. The only instances of time travel are in DDD and KH3, all of which don’t change the past in any way (other than Sora at the end, which breaks the laws of nature so that’s not the norm). Everything else is pretty straightforward. Plus, Nomura didn’t write the plot for FF7R so “Kingdom Hearts cluster fucks” aren’t even a factor here.
    Sea salt ice cream. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. DARKNESS!!
Yeh, the thing that bugs me the most, is SE have tried this, over and over again, and it never ends well for them.

Multiverses and Time Travel seem to be themes they keep attempting, and keep failing at, they haven't succeeded in either area since Chrono Trigger.
    In fairness time travel/alternate dimensions have been core concepts in Final Fantasy since the very first game. I would say the bigger problem is that historically FF isn't really great at sticking the landing on finales.

FF1 - >!Time Travel/Causal loop where Garland fights Chaos who makes Garland become Chaos in the past!<  
FF2 - >!Alternate Dimension (hell)!<  
FF3 - >!Alternate Dimension (world of darkness)!<  
FF5 - >!Alternate dimension AND dimensions merging together!<  
FF8 - >!Time travel AND times merging together!<  
FF9 - Technically, no other dimensions or time travel. BUT, the end of this game is so metaphorical that it almost fails to be comprehensible at all  
FF13 - Let's not even go there, lmao  
FF14 - >!Alternate Dimensions AND Time travel!<


So yea. While I agree that these concepts tend to become quite convoluted, they're foundational concepts in FF and probably will never go away. I didn't even mention the spin off titles, of which a large amount are about alternate dimensions and time travel.
        FF10 is also technically >!some kind of alternative dimension in a dream!<
            I excluded it because it's super convoluted haha

>!dream Zanarkand is a real physical location in the middle of the ocean but it only exists while Sin summons it and since Sin makes people have amnesia the outside world can't get there!<

But yea nonetheless, convoluted otherworldly concepts are the basic building block of most FF stories
        Reinforces my opinion that 6 is still the GOAT.
            I like 6 a lot, but my point is more that people have a recency bias with FF where they say "oh wow, square is really getting crazy with this one" when basically every single title is super crazy and that's the DNA of the series. 

I think that much like Remake before it, the deviations in part 3 as a result of this ending will be not too impactful and 95% of the game will be the same story as the original. We are just going to arrive at the conclusion via a slightly different route.
    That's because Chrono Trigger was a single timeline (unless I'm misremembering something). It was just simple, wholesome time travel.
>I'm glad that other people enjoyed it, but for me it just doesn't work.

Same.
i think it's a lot of confusion for the same result. the aerith we spent all that time with IS dead, the other three hanging around are either dead or actively hunted by sephiroth (the one who sent cloud back to our timeline did so right before sephiroth caught up to her in the church etc). as of now rebirth is telling us there is no outrunning fate even when timelines diverge. the timelines are just a way of exploring how aerith (and now zack) may still help the team in the third game.

ultimately aerith is affecting the outcome of the third game from the lifestream which is both what many people guessed after remake...and not all that different to what happens in the original game, in a way.
*Did* other people enjoy it? I’ve read like twenty of these threads across different subreddits and I quite literally have not seen a single person anywhere who was a proponent of the multiverse shit
    Some like it but I see more people syabthay the games great except for the multiverse shit.
    I dunno if they did. I mean the ff7 remake crowd has more toxic positivity than most fanbases, and some people were going to love and worship this game no matter and will die defending it from any criticism. 

But even from that crowd, I really haven't seen many people actually come out and say "you know, multiverse and alternate time lines was exactly what the ff7 story needed"
    I'll reserve my judgement untill after Part 3 is done, but so far I'm still of a mind that the original story was fine the way it was. I really like how Jessie and Biggs got more fleshed out as a character, how Dio was less of an ass, how Tifa and Aerith are now clear BFFs, I  liked the concept of Nanaki faking his maturity and I adore how much depth they gave Yuffie in this version. But I'm not convinced the multiverse stuff was necessary and I think they are overusing uncle Sephi. Him being a phantom you chase in the original was great, Him popping out everywhere like he is a youtube ad is not.
    I don't hate it, but I'm going to continue to remain skeptical about it until Part 3 is out, which is basically where I was when I finished Remake after it released.  Personally, I like the changes to the story (for the most part.  Looking at you shitty Shinra Manor section.)  The timeline/different worlds stuff isn't TOO hard to actually grasp, I'm still just not quite sure if it's going to make for a satisfying conclusion/end to the story as they're telling it, but I want to reserve the right to say "THIS IS SHIT" or "THIS IS AMAZING" until I see how the entire thing pans out.
    lot of people out there are just happy to see their favorite characters in hd. 

even more people are happy to see Tifa in a bikini and date her in the gold saucer. 

I don’t think people who are here for the plot like these changes, but I also think plot people are a loud minority.
The story was the most potent and interesting when it was very simple. Putting more stuffs don't improve in the hands of a careless storyteller.
Same here. They botched the story in the lamest way possible.
Same here.

It could potentially be redeemed in the 3rd game i guess. I LOVED the game overall, up to the last little bit and the "payoff" because it just felt forced and as if the directors were trying to make everyone happy.

&#x200B;

I was definitely in the camp where i hoped that Cloud would hit Sephiroth as he descended and save Aerith but i was also happy enough if they stuck with the original portion of her dying in that moment.

&#x200B;

Having infinite worlds with Aeriths alive just hanging around though is just bleh.

It made Aeriths "Death" completely inconsequential and ruined the pacing of that moment. Before the moment can breathe, you've had 6 quick cuts of Aeriths body, is she alive, is she dead? Cut, Cut, Cut.

Then thrown into a spectacle of a fight, no time to take in the moment. Cloud and Zack fighting together OMG, then Zack alone OMG, then Cloud but WAIT, Aerith is back for Cloud, lets fight together. Aerith and Cloud are alive?!

&#x200B;

The whole thing felt so so rushed and as if the moment was supposed to have zero impact overall.
    I think that's the point. We are not feeling the sadness because Cloud himself isn't accepting. His mind is so broken he still think his Aerith is alive and well. Which will likely means that when his mind will have to be fixed, that's where the real moment of mourning will come.
        No, i get that. Thats exactly how im sure they will go about it.

My issue was just the way that they had to make it a spectacle, instead of making it a moment to pause and reflect.

It reminded me of that meme video where they showed the film "Taken" and showed that it had 14 cuts in 3 seconds or something made?

&#x200B;

Aerith has just died, let that moment rest and let us see the impact. Instead we spend 30mins being blasted across 5 different worlds and having corny 1-liners thrown at us.

&#x200B;

Just feels like the Directors wanted to give both camps, the Aerith still dies and Aerith will live hope and let them be "Right" whilst also causing another 4 years of arguing and theories because they didnt want to upset anyone.

Especially since they've now shown multiple Aeriths alive and Zack leaving us with a "Hey, Worlds can combine, thats cool" moment which basically says that Aerith could still return because "Ha, Multiverse".
        Except that’s not how to make people feel connected to your storytelling.  Especially for an already established story.  Making things confusing for the sake of it, at the cost of all else, isn’t good writing.
The Aerith’s death card is only a card you get to play once. Revisiting it in part 3 for the ‘real version’ is too little too late.
I just don't understand this line of thinking


Yeah there's other Aeriths

Ours still died though, she's the important one. Other universes are important but would you feel remotely satisfied if one of your friends died and then they got replaced with a slightly different version who has never met you in their life?
    Which one is "ours" exactly?

The original?
The one from the remakes?

What about when they all inevitably converge?

To me the problem with the whole multiverse thing is that it lowers the stakes for everyone.

Like, Zacks death was amazingly handled in Crisis Core. But in here we see yet another Zack (which I'd say, not "our" Zack) meet his end (or be in a doomed world) several times, in several universes.

It's just... Lazy. 

They can just pull out whatever they want and say "multiverse!".
    Because when you introduce stuff like this, especially unnecessarily, \*nothing matters\*.  
Slightly different?  Sure.  That doesn't mean that watching a character die then immediately show up again feels like it means anything.
    To add to this, in addition to our Aerith, the one that matters, still being very dead, it's also important to keep in mind that this is still only part 2 of a 3 part saga. That means it's still very possible that these other worlds, fractures in the lifestream, or whatever the hell they are, won't even exist anymore by the end of game 3. I mean if Aerith and Zack are sitting around the fire at Cosmo Canyon with everyone else, singing songs, smiling and having a good time at the end of game 3, then yeah, I'll be pretty upset. That hasn't happened yet though, so it seems odd to me that so many people seem ready to write the entire trilogy off as a failure, when the story before the endings of the two games was so good, and we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.
        We already see that these worlds basically end in Rebirth itself, the only one that seems to be sticking around is the Terrier timeline, so it's not like we're actually meant to get invested in 10 different realities lol.

It's just a vehicle to explain that any choice creates a new branch of the world that will eventually die off.
        Man it’s kind of funny seeing everyone fall for the same exact shit they did in Remake 😂 95% of the game was an extremely faithful recreation of the original, with a very bombastic/extravagant ending (ultimately ending up in the same place) where everyone was saying how it ruined the game and they aren’t even interested now. 4 years later when Rebirth comes out, 95% is extremely faithful, another big ending, and “wow it’s ruined” 💀 you put it perfectly, don’t write off the entire trilogy until it’s actually finished
            All I'm getting from this is Part 3 will be an amazing 95% faithful game and then the ending will be bombastic / extravagant nonsense.

I actually completely agree with that, but I'm not sure that's the point you were hoping to make.
                I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
        > we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.

I'm not holding my breath for any explanation that is satisfying and truly makes sense.

Confusion is now the brand of storytelling they've explicitly chosen for the remake series and I don't expect that to change in part 3.
        Issue being that it detracts from story and emotional beats.  You end at the same destination, but without the same meaning behind it.  And thus far, many feel this meaning is far inferior.
            they can't help how they feel but i can't relate. i can't dismiss dozens of hours of a game that was full of emotional beats about loss and each character starting to think about what life looks like after death and war, and still ended with them figuring out how to move forward after losing aerith.
    people are going to see all the time stuff and immediately dismiss it but it's really not as bad as everyone is saying. in the OG, aerith dies and finds a way to help the team in the lifestream. in remake, aerith dies (seems to have known all along that she would) and finds a way to help the team (with the addition of zack). third game will hopefully answer how that comes to be.  

full disrespect to the writers for creating this confusion on purpose but it is absolutely just a version of the same story that the OG told. people will always be mad that they didn't do the story beats exactly the same but this idea that it's cheapened now is silly to me.

tseng shouldve 100% died tho lol
    If ours still died why is cloud so emotionless and cold? He should be sad. Not just "meh, oh well let's get going".
        Mate he literally has brain damage, AND is seeing her ghost
        Did you skip the scene where he’s crying over her dead body?
The good news is that the other universes are unlikely to matter ever again.

It's established now that the alternate universes are not persistent, they all die. The only reason it "mattered" in the context of THIS game is because Aerith lost the innate knowledge of the planet at the end of Remake when the white materia was drained by killing Whisper Bahamut and by way of trading she now got back the white materia.

I do agree that this was a weak addition to the story but I think people expecting like an alternate universe Aerith to come back in part 3 are wrong, she is dead and the alternate universes don't last (except maybe Zack, who is no longer in any universe at all but in the same state as Sephiroth/Aerith where he is just a consciousness in the lifestream that isn't merged)

I also think 1 detail of this chart is wrong though, there's not really an "ultimate Aerith". All the Aeriths have knowledge of how the planet works because of the white materia, there doesn't need to be some individual "ultimate Aerith" that is dimension hopping.
    >The good news is that the other universes are unlikely to matter ever again.

People said the exact same thing about the Whispers in Part 1. "No need to keep complaining because we killed them, so now there won't be any Whispers in the next parts". 

Uh huh, sure. We saw how that turned out.

These alternate universes weren't introduced just to be discarded for Part 3. They will 100% have some kind of role in the last game.
        I mean, the doomsaying about whispers literally WAS wrong about part 2.

People said because of the Whispers the ending would completely change, all the same events would not play out, Aerith would not die, the story would be completely altered, etc. 

Rebirth was even *closer* to the original game than Remake was. So doomsay away, but they pretty blatantly stated that the alternate universes do not persist. They already served a purpose in the lore, I don't see any reason to forecast a total deviation from the original game now.
I was a big Remake defender and kept telling people “let square enix cook”, well now they cooked and I feel like they’re trying to do too much. It’s a shame because the game is GOTY material easy (and will probably win) but the ending was way, way too much.
    I was the opposite, wasn't sure what they were trying to do with Remake, but after playing Rebirth I can kind of see what they are going for from a writer's perspective.

Basically they want the third game to be an emotional nuclear bomb that destroys the player, and to achieve that they are shifting the payoff of aerith's death from the 2nd to the 3rd game at the cost of a satisfying end to the 2nd game. This explains why we don't see the iconic scenes of aerith being stabbed and lowered into the water, and why Tifa and Barret were blocked from seeing anything unlike the OG where they are there and snap Cloud out of being puppeted by Sephiroth.

It's a risky move as it damages the reception of the 2nd game, but if they stick the landing with the 3rd it will probably be forgiven.
Yeah. Like it’s already so jarring to me that supposedly a huge part of the fanbase rejoiced at making Zack live at the end of Remake… well guess what? They actually killed him in this game. 

But don’t worry! Here’s a completely _different_ Zack who lived in a different universe who we knew nothing off but somehow was different personality enough to make different choices.. oh but we made him kill himself, whoops.

But don’t worry, there’s now infinite amount these Zacks, so here’s one that you also know nothing about who just sits here, we make _him_ actually tag team with Cloud, that’s what the fans have been wanting to see forever, right?

In part 3 we can do the same with Aerith, neat!
I think people are just making this more complicated than it actually is. Squares just adding shit in to try and confuse us but for the most part it's the same story. This is a retelling with bizarre story additions. I don't believe things are going to get as crazy as people are claiming.
    Probably correct we will end up In the same place it’s just the rd there is way more twisty
        Yeah, that's pretty much how I suspect it'll go as well.
    I agree that we’ll end up in the same place, but man, for them to show Aerith’s death scene and then throw 10+ boss fights at you? I get that you fight right after she dies in the OG but to me they didn’t spend nearly enough time on her getting killed. Kind of took all the emotion away for me
        Yeah, that's why I brought up bizarre story choices. It feels like they didn't know which direction to go in so we got... whatever this was.
The point is to do allmthisbexyta stuff but return to status quo in part 3. It will end exactly as the og with Sephiroth defeated and everything extra won't really matter.
    That's exactly what people said at Remake's ending.
        And they were right. We defeated the whispers, Destiny is free and we basically spent the game doing 99% the same thing anyway.
FF7 Remake literally has the thematic depth of trash blowing in the wind.
    Well said
The first three universes were all the result of Zack making different choices. The Terrier universe -  Zack went to Hojo to seek healing for Cloud. The Pug universe - Zack chose to save Biggs. And the Siba universe - Zack wasn't sure what to do. What is it for?

In order for OG Aerith to be able to move into the "correct" version of Aerith 2. We saw that when OG Aerith turns out to be in a physical body, S**ephiroth immediately tracks her down**. While Aerith 2 is "sleeping", she is safe, so **Aerith 3 is waiting for a version of the world where Zack will make the right choice** - to heal Cloud - then she could inhabit the body in this timeline and continue to implement her plan.
    My eyes couldn't roll harder reading this if they tried. 

I hate modern Squares approach to storytelling. Utter drivel.
    Except it makes no sense that the universes result from Zack’s choices, because nothing in Zack should result in new universe. Like, how would the chips bag mascot change from Zack’s choice if it already was one type? 

Rather, the Zacks just lived in different universes (that has resulted in different bag design via some butterfly effect) and that alone deterministically made Zack make different choices. It’s dumb.
        Yes, we can say that Zack exists in all universes at the same time, these universes differ in the choices that he made. But it won't change the essence. But it is also correct to say that he creates new universes by his actions, because his survival was the reason for their creation, he is the Butterfly that causes a storm with a flap of its wing. 

Don't take everything too literally about the Stamps, it's more of a clue for the players.
Was Kingdom Hearts really that confusing?
    On the beggining? Not really.

But when Chain of Memories and Dream Drop Distance were released, oh god, it became more confusing than Metal Gear and Zelda combined.
        No, CoM was not confusing at all its fairly simple. KH story only became confusing when DDD got released
    Not really but people that don't play it love to say it is
    As a big kingdom hearts fan who has been in the franchise since release i say the most confusing part is trying to get every game that is released in different consoles and try to get the full story. As the story itself ehh not really people who dont play it tend to exaggerate it. There is no multiverse crap in this game at best there is some time whiny shit starting in dream drop distance but thats more like "i pulled my younger self to fight with me now, also even if you go back in time shit doesn't change"

Also i guess the 6+ versions of xehanort are a bit hard to track if you loose sight but honestly its not that bad. We do like to joke that everyone is xehanort. 

I say its turning confusing though because nomura is trying to shoehorn his versus 13 plotlines into kh now
Yeah I like it. Wouldn’t have hated if they just stuck to the OG to the letter but I like that they’re trying to put a new spin on things. There are many things I don’t like about the remake trilogy but those are mainly technical gameplay issues like traversal and minigames etc. - I don’t really have a problem with the storytelling.
The universe where Aerith and Cloud are unconscious bodies are after the Remake where they didn't succeed after the battle with whisper harbinger and they're collected by Shinra. How the Holy Materia is intact?

My understanding is the Holy/memories is taken from Aerith during the Remake and not after this pivotal moment.
    with that universe, cloud also is not that there to help avalanche, cus zack survives and stays with him
    Good question I’m not sure
I said it the moment those fucking fate fucks showed up in the first game. We are heafing for an absolute fucking shitshow in part 3 when they try to pull all this bullshit together.

Utter drivel.
    Completely agree, sadly. Sometimes less is more. You don't need to introduce complicated nonsense to a timeless story.
Because Nomura
Zack from the Shiba universe.
    Yeah that makes sense, only thing that throws me off is that the Zack we play as in Rebirth potentially meets the same fate now just in a different setting (they did leave it open ended though)
        WDYM? We play two different Zack’s from two different timelines. The one we play at the beginning and middle dies at Shinra building, very sad. Luckily there’s an infinite amount of Zack’s now.

Maybe in part three Cloud will have an ability like Yuffie’s doppelganger where he pulls a random Zack from random universe who fights alongside him until he dies.
We don't know exactly what happened at the end. That we know that there are different universes, we identify by the stamps and that Aerith from our timeline received a "filled" White Materia, and Cloud in return an empty one.
You should check out the [extended version](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1bn0wzs/an_extended_chart_describing_the_events_in_the/). When Cloud deflected Sephiroth's blade, another universe was created with another Cloud. Our Cloud stayed in his universe where Aerith was supposed to die, but at the same time he saw both outcomes of events, and now he does not realize that his Aerith is dead.
    Yes, but he deflected Sephiroth's blade in the remake timeline saving Aerith. Why does Aerith end up dead in the remake timeline when he clearly saved her? Unless he somehow ended up in an alternate timeline where she is dead anyway, but how would Cloud have gotten there? That's what I'm trying to figure out.
        "Because Cloud is still sick," as Marlene said. Since we do not know by what rules parallel universes work, there may be dozens of theories, for example, that Cloud did not deflect Sephiroth's blade, but saw how his "healthy" version did it in another universe. Anyway, I think that even in the third part they will not explain to us exactly what happened. The universes will merge, and it won't matter anymore.
I don't think cloud actually did it. I think cloud is doing cloud shit where he experiences a traumatic event and creates his own reality in his head of what happened and that's how he sees it.
I've been beating this drum since the end of Remake and I was very concerned with the new direction. I think a lot of people were more confident than I was about how they were going to handle the story going forward. It is sort of bittersweet to feel like more people are now coming around to my line of thinking, but at the same time, I wish I had been wrong.
>It feels like they’ve  sacrificed a powerful, clear, and emotional narrative in order to be clever. Fuck this.

They did. And it's not even that clever.
You're on that real good shit. Send some my way. My stores of copium have just been depleted.
    In all fairness, you very well could be right. Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle when it comes to the Zack and Whisper stuff, and am just setting myself up for disappointment in that regard. If I'm completely honest though...I never really cared about that stuff, one way or the other. I'm here for the 95% of the remake trilogy that's actually a remake of the FFVII story. That's what I've always been here for. The Zack stuff, whether it soars, or flops, is just extra for me. I'm intrigued enough to see where they're going with it, and they've done enough right with the remake so far that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, and assume they have a plan to make this work. If they pull that miracle off, and manage to make all of Zack's stuff make sense within the larger story of FFVII, then great, everyone wins. Even if it should fail though, so long as they get the FFVII remake part of the story right, (and so far I think that part of the story has been incredibly enjoyable) then Zack's part of the storyline could end with him arm wrestling Dio on the moon, while wearing a Princess Peach cosplay, and I honestly wouldn't care. So long as we still get that proper remake/reimagining of the FFVII story at the end of this, then that's still a win in my book. I'll just focus on enjoying the 95% of the game that really worked. It wouldn't be the first time I had to ignore some really bad parts in a game I otherwise totally love.
I have no doubt they will backtrack after rebirth. The general reception to the story has been very poor compared to remake that was already divisive. So much so that eeven mainstream reviews at pointing to a messy and failed storytelling.
    The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen. Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII, and people generally really enjoy that part. Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have most of their issues. Thankfully, that weird stuff isn't what's being focused on. That stuff with Zack, and the different Stamps are there to create confusion, and get people talking about what might be happening, but at the end of the day, I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story of FFVII, so I don't think they were ever going to allow anything that would forever compromise the integrity of that story. I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up, but I don't think this will be the result of Square changing their minds in response to backlash, and walking anything back. I think setting things right in the end was their plan from the very beginning, from the moment they decided to introduce these new subplots.
        > The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen.

No, this is far more skewered towards the negative. Remake had the benefit of people sitting in the middle not knowing if part 2 would go wildly off the rails, and thus were cautiously optimistic, but if you look at the endgame discussion thread of over 2.5k posts, then its pretty clear that most people in general are not happy about a lot of the writing choices here and especially the multiverse nonsense.


>Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII

That is a charitably way of looking at it, the endgame discussion thread and myself included felt great frustration with the rewrites and how undercut many of the key moments were, by all the new additions and "noise" added to the game (Dyne, Nanaki's trial, Aerith's fate, just to name a few key examples) where lots of these moments not only lost the original tone of the game, but importantly also their memorable impact. Dyne for instance had a very dark and impactful original scene, and now it was just replaced with lots of noise, new magnetic powers, Shinra troops randomly giving him a heroic death out of nowhere. So messy and generic compared to the original scene --- And don't get me started on Aeriths scene. Its been spoken to death already, so I won't go further into just the ridiculously botched job they did with that.

>Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have their issues.


Nah, lots of things here changed in the telling these events and how they unfolded, which was significantly different to the OG. Which is what remake got a way with alot. Looking at something like the reactor bombing mission, its about as close and faithful of a recreation as you can have, while also expanding it.

Wall Market? It made slight changes, but ultimately kept the key points of what happened and how it happened, while importantly not changing the tone of the area.


Then you have something like the plate sequence, which was far more controversial in remake, because they changed it so dramatically, with so many people being warned and escaping, that it almost felt like nobody died in-universe. Obviously they did, but the colossal disaster it was in the OG, isn't felt nearly in the same way here, with you shortly after walking around talking to the same npcs again.


And yes of course the finale is the big controversial one.


But in rebirth, there is FAR more of this. From all the multiverse cuts with Zack, to odd new additions that just feel weirdly out of place, like Hojo attacking the party, Dyne growing magical magnetic powers from reading too much One Piece, and the Gi being handed a new script by Nomura, all of which just drastically changes so much of the dynamic in storytelling here. 


>I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story FFVII

again I think you're being charitable. They already locked themselves into doing the main storybeats for the most part, when Kitase literally went out and said you'd see the main story beats again, just perhaps a bit differently. But the fact that its done in such an unsatisfying way that often completely removes the tone, or impact of the original scenes, is just not doing it.


>I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up

Part of me thinks that Nomura is too stubborn to accept that the reception is a reason to course correct and that we are riding this out into full fanfic fanservice territory, like they spoke about in Ultimania, about wanting Zack to have a happy ending. Where we end up mashing all the timelines together and everyone has their happy ending. Seems perfect for his typical storytelling preference.


On the other hand, I HOPE that Square sees this reception and pushes for making sure that he isn't going completely Nomura all over it again.
            >most people in general

Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

>felt great frustration with the rewrites

SOME of the people in that thread. But really, even those are debatable. 
Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking, thanks to the voice acting and imagery (the scene where Dyne imagine returning home, man...). Sure he doesn't kill himself exactly like the original, but he still let himself be gunned down while cursing Barret and telling him to live on, which is pretty dark still. The meaning of said death is still kept as it shows to Barret what could he have become and why he has to keep living on, even despite the feeling of guilt.
Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot (although they do still come back to an extent via sidequests, which are appreciated).
As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

>colossal disaster in the OG

I call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died. Jesse, Biggs and Wedge all died before the plate fell. The only people we saw die was the reporter with his broadcast. And unlike the OG, Remake actually holds on the aftermath a lot more instead of moving on to Aerith 5 minutes later. Plus, the true despair vision of the plate fall happen in Yuffie's PoV of Intergrade, so that is kept too. 

>weird addictions like

Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them? Also you are not allowed to question why Dyne's arm has electromagnetic powers when him and Barret have infinite amount of ammo and Barret can do a massive beam if he wants. Also Nomura didn't write the script. He's just one of 4 writers, with Kitase being reason of most changes. 

Also no shit the storytelling is different in some parts, it's still meant to not be quite the OG story but a new one, basically a sequel/what if. Of course it will have differences.
                > Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.


Its really only the overly defensive people that seem to be happy about this.


>SOME of the people in that thread.

I already clarified it as being the vast majority. That by definition already clarifies that.


>But really, even those are debatable. 

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.
                    >only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
                        > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
            Remake has an 87 on metacritic.

Rebirth has a 93.

Rebirth was received significantly better.

I'm not surprised by this in the slightest by the way. Critics loooove Auteur subversive stuff so they are all aboard the confusing ending train.
            Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all. He wanted to die, and was practically begging Barret to just shoot him, and put him out of his misery. Barret wouldn't do it, so he found another way to get it done. He had given up on himself, and was no longer even looking for a reason to go on living. He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred, killing as many Shinra troopers as he could before finally going down, rather than go with Barret to see Marlene again and try to find a place for himself in her life. Dyne's final attack was a suicide. The troopers were just the insturment for his suicide, since he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on himself. Dyne's death is a cautionary tale to Barret on what could happen to him if he ever lost sight of his reason for living, and gave in fully to his hatred, just as it was in the original. 

Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer, who came after us because we had been unknowingly ruining his day since we first arrived at the Gold Saucer.
                > Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
                    He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
                        > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
                            The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
We warned you
I don't think this is going to be a spoiler because you don't understand the context in which this is happening. A bunch of different scenes are dumped on us, and this chart helps to connect what is happening at least a little. But if you haven't seen these scenes yet, then the chart won't make sense to you.
You should finish the game and come back.
    I can’t wait to be more confused than kingdom hearts
100000% agree. It could have been amazing
We don't know.
>Aerith meanwhile wants to stop him, but is still kinda okay with herself dying cause apparently the OG timeline is the best possibility.

And yet at the end of Remake she encouraged the party to defy fate and cross the wall to fight the Whispers. So clearly she doesn't want the OG timeline to happen exactly as it did. 

Your explanation about the Sephiroth stuff is pretty good, but honestly there is not a single explanation or theory about this that fully makes sense. You can poke massive holes in all of them. It's just kind of a mess.
    Well this is my understanding of a plot that is missing a third act, so I might be completely off base. Who knows?

All we can hope is that the final answers at the end of Resomething will make sense.
It's worth watching the FF7: Crisis Core walkthrough.
We've never been in the OG timeline in remakes, because from the very beginning Sephiroth and Aerith know the future, which means it's not OG anymore.
He didnt write this tho. He was the only one against changes
    Funny cause it is really nomura-esque changes
        True that
None of the worlds "inside the Lifestream". But the Lifestream is in each of them. OG Aerith and Sephiroth, who exist in it, can access any of the worlds. In this case, the Lifestream is like a railway on which you can travel through the worlds.
    Funnily enough this image perfectly encapsulates my theory because I do believe everything is within the lifestream, and the different worlds are akin to the different memory lines within the lifestream described in Ever Crisis.

Edit: But also I've come to the conclusion that the mechanics now don't really matter when it comes to theorising the plot going forward because the lifestream theory and the multiverse still work in Sephiroth achieving the same thing; absorbing all the shit, it's just the mechanism in play to make that happen changes.
    Ohhh i misunderstood, i thought the big lifestream outline meant that all the worlds are inside it
    We can assume in this case that the entire Remake world is a branch universe where the OG Aerith and OG Sephiroth in LifeStream are acessing other worlds and the main objective of Sephiroth is reach a universe where he can "win" and turn the "main universe" and Aerith is fighting against it?

In this case they can travel on time too since the Ultimate Aerith reach her Remake body where she meets cloud.

Sounds a good theory to me to make it simple this Multiverse mess.
        Something like that. Sephiroth made this world where he took away Aerith's White Materia from her. As a result, she cannot use Holy, and there is no one to stop the meteor. But OG Aerith found a way to transfer the White Materia, through another universe.
Yep, the ending is like, "See ya in 4 years, Prepare 70 bucks to find out what really happened."
[deleted]
    Nomura isn't the one making these changes, he's the one reining them in, so most of the story stays intact.

He also doesn't write a lot of the stuff he just gets blamed for online.
    It actually isn't that hard to understand when you've thought about it after the ending.

Did you however not complete the picture due to spoilers of the ending? There is another fracture in the ending.
        Because we don't know what really happened at the end, just different theories. Stamps are at least some kind of reference point that allows you to understand in what reality events are taking place at the moment.
            Good point, the one's you mentioned we are sure of.
The different dogs are just symbols to the viewer that we're seeing a different universe.
No, because before entering the church, Zack is preparing a speech, because he felt guilty to Aerith for his long absence. So he hasn't found her unconscious body yet, this hasn't happened in any timeline that we know of, which means it's either a new timeline or this scene was just a teaser advertisement. Perhaps at that moment, Zack's script was not fully completed or was changed later.
Yes, I can. Aerith, who has a date with Cloud, knows her future, which means that this is not our Aerith from the main timeline. At their first meeting in the church, Aerith promised Cloud a date for protection from the Turks. In the original timeline, this did not happen, so Aerith pays back the debt plus enjoys something real after an eternity in the Lifestream. When they first find themselves in the universe of Spitz, she says that this is her dream, everyone takes it literally, but for a dead person, a dream is to be alive. The finale of the date repeats the original, Sephiroth catches up with Aerith, and Cloud is powerless to help.
i said it was my bad 🤷
What if it's the same breed but a different kind of hat........there's so many hats...kutaja save us..
I want to see St. Bernard stamp.

Jokes aside, how many breeds of SMALL dogs are there, because it only seems to be smaller dogs that are candidates to be Stamp-ed.
    The game is made in Japan after all, there's not a lot of space. Definitely not a lot of room for some golden retrievers in those 500 sq ft apartments they have to cram into.
        My european ass thinking "well damn 500 of something doesn't sound too bad, nani the hell?" and then googling the conversion into square metres. It's 46.5 square metres.

Jesus that is CRAMPED for a big dog. It'd be cramped for MY fat arse and, after conversion, I stand at an absolutely gigantic, monstruous even, "5 foot 6"(and don't say otherwise).
            Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
            You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
        Do you think that’s the reason why so Japanese people seem to prefer cats to dogs? Is it because they’re a better fit for their smaller apartments and/or that they don’t require as much maintenance as a dog does? 

I know that there are plenty of people in Japan who own and love dogs. I’m definitely not saying that dogs aren’t loved by the Japanese; however, it just seems *to me* that cats are the more popular pet and I’m curious as to why.
        Might have to deploy the cat stamp platoon
    St. Bernards are such good dogs. When I was 18 my best friend Tom got a puppy named Heidi. She was such a sweet girl, and when I crashed over at his place she would hop up onto the couch and sleep on top of me. 

Flash-forward to a year later when she’s a fully-grown pooch who *still had to lay on top of me* when I crashed on his couch. OUCH. She may have weighed more than I did at the time! But she was such a sweet girl that you would just let her climb onto your lap. Heidi was never my dog of course, but I miss that Very Good Girl all the same.
        I had a similar experience with a Newfoundland. Glorious beings, they are, and my grandma's was ever so sweet and would love to cuddle. I, for one, really like breathing, I'd go as far as to say I love it so much I live for it, but I made as much of an exception for that huge ball of floof even after he grew to an absolutely staggering size. He was a hugger, too. Bless that dog, he had a good life and I hope he thought I was part of what made it good, but this was when I was much younger. The only bad thing about most dogs is their lifespan. So unfair.
Where’s my Husky universe 😀
oh my god yes 😂
I feel it's safe to say that there are 7 different possible timelines, considering its FFVII, Sephiroth says 7 seconds to the end, and there are a good amount of "7" references in the game.
    It's definitely lunched home way more than it needs to be lol.   Just in the costa del sol ticket quest they get tickets 7 and 77!
It will all come full ***circle***. Which is also the shape of a planet. And a ball.
Which means... all our headcanons are prolly canon now...
Black Lab! Chocolate Lab! Yellow Lab! Chesapeake Golden Retriever! Australian Cattle Dog! Australian Shepherd (not actually Australian but adorable anyway)! Caviler King Charles Spaniel! German Shepherd! Burmese Mountain Dog! Staffy Pit! 

So many pooches, all good boys and good girls. 

Siiiiigh. I miss having a dog. After my Australian Cattle Dog died a few years ago I’ve been wanting to adopt a new pupper, but I’m just not ready yet. You never reallly get over losing a beloved dog or cat, or whatever pet you adore. Every time I get home from work and she’s not laying by the front door waiting for me I feel some little pain. Dogs - man’s best friend but without man’s lifespan. 

My daughter just got herself a kitten, and while he’s an adorable little turd he too will die far before she’s ready to let him go. I wish our pets could have lifespans comparable to our own! 

Back to your regularly-scheduled FFVII subreddit programming.
Don't forget the stars on each dogs hat, maybe that denotes a number to the line, so we play in Beagle 5, and somewhere out there we will find a Beagle Prime world.

/s
I suppose you could say multiverse theory has come... full circle! 😎

***<dies of own cringe>***
Dog world
I was like "same bro, same"
Pug and Shiba universe seem mostly irrelevant and in my opinion were only used to illustrate the idea that a new universe is created with every major decision / deviation from fate. 

Spitz universe needed to be separate to make it clear that it's not just the "normal" Terrier Aerith and Cloud randomly waking up (and to give the Terrier universe a chance to continue, since Sephiroth probably kills Aerith after she gives Cloud the white Materia in that universe).

Not sure which universes ended after the Sephiroth fight, but I'd guess Terrier universe is the only one of Zack's worlds we'll see again in part 3, if any.
    But I also think Aerith’s consciousness is traveling between worlds. It’s the same Aerith in every timeline just as it’s the same Sephiroth.

I think Jessie’s theory in remake about her dad confirms this when Biggs tells Cloud the theory that his consciousness is trapped somewhere between his body and the planet. 

Aerith has the power to transition between these.
    Absolutely correct. After all, at least one planet must die to make the Meteor to traverse the Rift, and given how Zack's one is literally going to deteriorate and implode very soon... man, Square is doing everything possible to make Zack fate miserable.
    I'm thinking that the Aerith that gives Cloud the White Materia is the Aerith that had been dead in the OG timeline all the way to Advent Children.

When Seph shows up he says something like "so, this is where you've been hiding." Maybe Aerith and Seph have constantly been fighting ever since AC ended.
    Which universe is which?
I know that we have the normal timeline, the Zack timeline, the Biggs timeline (Zack in Reactor 6), the Cloud timeline (Zack in Shinra HQ) and the Aerith timeline (Zack and Sephiroth in church??) This is probably the only thing that's confusing me
        Terrier is the one we throughout the game multiple times which tells Zack's story.

Pug (Biggs) and Shiba (Zack staying at the church, wondering what to do) are only used for short scenes to show how new worlds are born.

Spitz is where the Aerith dream date happens and she gives the white Materia to Cloud.
    Outside chapter 14, Terrier is the only other one we see right?

With Spitz and Pug happening due to Zacks indecisiveness.

I knew something was "off" with Spitz Aerith, but i just thought that WAS Spitz Aerith with a bit more knowledge, though her behavior was a bit off to me as well (hell even Cloud noticed)

Didnt know ther was an "Ultimate" Aerith lol. And here i thought i was following along pretty well.
        Yeah, chapter 14 is the only one where we suddenly get a whole new pack of worlds in addition to the 2 (main and Terrier) we already knew.

"Ultimate Aerith" is just the most popular theory as to why Aerith acts the way she does in that scene. There is nothing ingame that suggests an "Ultimate Aerith" exists. Without outside knowledge, we are just supposed to notice that Aerith is acting weird and not as she usually does.  
We'll probably learn more about that in Part 3.
[deleted]
    Nomura didnt write this lol
    Nojima is the writer lmfao
One idea I'm interested in is that, if the lifestream gets "spread" over every new timeline created, then it's entirely possible Sephiroth hopes to spread it so thin that it can't possibly defend against meteor.
    I think Meteor is a red herring now, and I'm convinced of this because of the added lore changes about the Gi and their situation.

They created the Black Materia because they wanted to end their suffering of being stuck in spiritual form. The Lifestream won't accept them because they're alien in nature. Sephiroth, because of the nature of his creation, is also set apart from The Lifestream. He is stuck between his body and the planet, so he can't really do anything except possess bodies that have Jenova cells in them.

In one of the side stories Aerith (the one in The Lifestream) mentions that Sephiroth is still there even after his defeat, but she describes that The Lifestream "washes off his back like rain", so Sephiroth is trapped in some kind of limbo in his afterlife.

The Sephiroth we're seeing in Remake/Rebirth may not want the same thing as he did in the OG story. The whole "become a god" thing could just be him manipulating the party.
        It also crossed my mind as well that that could be the case.  What's interesting with the new Black Materia lore is that it doesn't necessarily summon Meteor per say, it works to enact "destruction" per the will of the user. 

The Gi intended to use it to destroy their spirits thus relieving them of their tormented state and Sephiroth needed it to cause a wound so great to the planet it would take the entirety of the Lifestream to heal.

That being said, Sephiroths greatest weaknesses, despite his power, is his obsession with carrying out Jenovas Will and his utter inability to perceive anyone else as a threat. I'd reckon that despite this Sephiroth obviously having knowledge he shouldn't have, he's still trying to get to the same destination through a different road.

I think it would be rather poetic that, despite the ability to actually change his destiny, Sephiroth refuses to actually learn from his experiences and correct his mistakes.
            I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
                I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
                    If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
                        I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                            I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
    I had the same thought when Sephiroth sent his whispers to dry out a mako spring in cosmo canyon as seen in bugenhagen’s side quest. We never see him do stuff like that in the original and he also didn’t have whispers then so I strongly believe that it’s part of his plan. Sephiroth knows exactly how he lost in the original and is trying his hardest to mitigate each factor (such as pitting Shinra and Wutai against each other so Rufus is too distracted to destroy the Northern Crater barrier with the Sister Ray)
        The dark whispers are still fascinating to me because it's hard to tell if they're directly under aephiroths control or if sephiroth has potentially manipulated them into trying to enforce an alternate "destiny." Possibly a universe where Sephiroth has already won. Then again, they may just be representing the lifestream that Sephiroth and Jenova have already corrupted.
There’s a hundred percent a timeline where Aerith lives.  The game touches on this timeline the absolute least amount of time.  You see glimpses of it in the very first moment shown after he deflects masamune but the game quickly shifts to all the other timelines where he didn’t, including he main timeline where he apparently deflected masamune but not completely.

After all the battles, it revisits this one single timeline again, where Cloud tells Aerith to wake up.   I firmly believe in this timeline, the rest of the party is either lost to the void or is still blocked by whispers.  It’s hard to say without a whole third game to explain the outcome properly so, see you in four years.
So Zack chose 3 different things, alright cool but what does it have to do with the story? remake, and rebirth still pretty much have the same outcome as the OG.
    Did you just not pay attention to the ending? He literally says that he wants to reunite all the timelines to save everyone. That's his goal. This means that he could reunite the timelines in which everyone is alive and beat Sephiroth together. Zack's whole segment was setting him up to be this being that the lifestream had chosen to fix the world by saving everyone to defeath Sephiroth. He keeps getting saved by the white whispers. The white whispers from what we know seem to represent the planet and the lifestream. 


Maybe he succeeds, maybe he doesn't. Regardless his part isn't over yet. Him and cloud will definitely interact in the future. Aerith will also still play a huge part. I suspect the final boss battle's party will consist of Zack Cloud and Aerith regardless of whether they are all truly alive in the main timeline or not.

So while Cloud is off finding Sephiroth, Zack will be trying to figure out how to reunite the timelines.
        Maybe Zack is just a marketing strategy, a way to interest Zack fans into buying the game. Have you ever thought about that?

This whole defy fate or multiverse stuffs and the story still ended up the same as the OG. No need to try brain storming this shit cause it is wasted anyway.
            Believe what you want to.
I don't see why the Whispers saved Biggs, but not Wedge. Plus the wanted poster with just Biggs left. Was that just to give Zack a guide and link to Beagle?
    What I got from it is that the "prime" consciousness of Biggs simply redistributed itself because a world now exists in which he survived.
Events didn't go the same way without Cloud, Cloud was there. Marlene remembers him, Biggs remembers him, the Shinra troopers at the very start of the game talk about the last member being an ex-Soldier with a buster sword who's missing.
But those scenes demonstrated that these worlds are related to Zack and the choices he makes.

In the corkscrew tunnel scene. We saw a flashback of Marlene describing Sephiroth as the scary man. **Then the camera pans over to the White Materia as** **Minerva's theme plays for about 10 seconds**. Following this, we see Zack with Terrier graffiti behind him as decides to enter the right tunnel to Shinra HQ. Then we see a lifestream burst out of the tunnel which Zack would have entered to save Biggs.

Following that we see both outcomes. Shinra HQ leads Zack to face the Shinra Army, so he buzzes off on his motorcycle.

Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

In addition, we see another possible outcome where Zack never made a choice and he's sitting on the Church steps. This is yet another timeline (Corgi). And Sephiroth vanquishes him with his whispers.

I bolded the Minerva part because that's a big clue. Holy does what it does based on the will of the planet. And Minerva is the will of the lifestream and thus has the power to defy destiny as she demonstrated in Crisis Core.

&#x200B;

All of that said. I am not defending how those scenes were depicted. Just breaking them down.
    >Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

Except that isn’t what we saw. He isn’t wearing the ribbon. Which they specifically focus on.
        Biggs had a bag of Stamp's Champs with a Pug Stamp on the front. Then he said the reactor is sucking up dirt because the lifestream is bone dry. So what do you mean that isn't what we saw?
            I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
                I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
                    >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
                        And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                            That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
    Don't forget the will of the Goddess is mentioned in Loveless which may be a spoiler for Minerva. Also, the puppet of fate which most likely alludes to Cloud.
        They drove the LOVELESS stuff pretty hard. They changed the poem for the US localisation, but it remained the same in the Japanese.
    >This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

"Every choice creates a timeline but if it's not the mysterious and arbitrary 'correct' choice then your whole timeline is doomed and slowly dissolves lmao get fucked. You can pop into the main timeline to help a bit but you're still ultimately doomed" is a rules system for time travel that is used by exactly *Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,* *Homestuck,* and basically nothing else. There's no way that's not just a weird coincidence, even if FF7R and HS are *also* both meta stories about the concept of canon, but I want to believe.
Yeah, and then Biggs still fucking died, so what was the point of bringing him back? Looks like Zack ended up dying too.
Biggs in another world is to pave the way to Zach entering the main world.
Agree with all you said here, small side note the news broadcast is not the exact same. In the beginning of the game (Terrier timeline) the reporter pauses his words when he almost walks into Shinra truck driving on the road. In Kalm (now back in Beagle timeline) on the radio version, this pause is not there.
Basically 
So, this is my theory. It was intentional but not by Zack's choice. It was lifestream Aerith's choice to save Zack as fate was killed.

All through Remake, Sephiroth is trying to manipulate us into destroying fate and to go against the whispers, which keep the timeline in order by the planet. That way there is only one world. In Beagle world, we destroyed fate which spawned many worlds including Spitz world, because the whispers were no longer keeping everything guided along a singular path.

Zack said he was losing surrounded by Shinra, felt a gust of wind and then he just wasn't. You, the player, get to see the whispers are that gust of wind and that they altered the bullet to barely nick his cheek, with a rainbow like effect signaling it was an act of lifestream Aerith. But not only was he saved, he was also whisked into a world (Spitz world) where the battle against Fate was ending, which is why it seems like there is some weird overlap of end of crisis core leading to end of midgar.

\---------------

To explain their powers:

We know that lifestream Sephiroth and lifestream Aerith have the power to not only send people to and from Worlds, but also to affect the worlds those people are in.

As Jenova dies after the Aerith death, we see the white whispers circling the party, again more rainbow like effects popping up. It then cuts to Zack walking in a bunch of white, and the white whispers show up with Cloud with more rainbow like effects emanating from Cloud. Zack touches him and they pop out in a fight with Sephiroth. 

After the battle with Cloud and Zack, Sephiroth slashes his sword and says "Just as Worlds unite, so too do they part", and Zack gets sent to a World with meteor crashing down on the World in the background. We cut back to the party that just killed Jenova and there is no sign of Cloud which shows that white Whispers took him and sent him to Zack. The party even asks "Any sign of him? Do you think the whispers got him? Did they take him somewhere?" So, the power of bringing people to and from worlds is confirmed.

Now, during Zack's fight with meteor in the background, a random circle will pop up that will heal you if you are in it and shield you from an attack. With Aerith not presumably around in this world, it means lifestream Aerith is helping him in this battle. I know it's a weak argument on how they can affect worlds, but this would explain how she was able to alter the bullet that saved Zack in the first place.

\-----------------

So back to the theory, as he arrives at Midgar in Spitz world, this is a world where Avalanche failed in their fight and ended up unconscious after the fight. Because they didn't defeat fate, Aerith's white materia in this world remained active and didn't get drained like the Beagle world, where Aerith confirmed beating fate caused it to lose it's color.

Presumably, seeing this, lifestream Aerith then plots a plan to save Zack, and brought him to the Spitz world so that Zack would bring Cloud to Midgar, knowing that he would bring Cloud close to where she is because she knows he would check up on her. This is so that later on, she can also bring "Cloud 1" to the Spitz world while lifestream Aerith can inhabit the Aerith body there. She gives Cloud the white matera to then take back to his Aerith in the beagle world.
>The difference here is that Zack's victory didn't come at the cost of him or Shinra soldiers making a choice. It simply happened to him a binary  way. He was losing and then he wasn't.

&#x200B;

  It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

  

>Which is a great problem, because now it breeds confusion if that is intentional, or simply poor writing not taking these things into account.

I am not defending that scene in the slightest. I have very mixed feelings about it personally. It feels like alot of important context was cut from the final product in a last minute revision. Because it does feel like it wasn't thought through very well.
    > It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear. Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there. Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense. 


Why aren't we just making some choices that lead to a good, uncorrupted Sephiroth coming to help us? Why aren't any of these decisions leading to other events even further in the past changing? Like Gast's fate, or Ifalna? Or Vincent and Lucrecia?


It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation.
        >Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear.

&#x200B;

I didn't move the definition. I said both choices and outcomes from the beginning. The very first one starts with Zack's victory. We are told that Terrier Stamp symbolizes that. Then in the span of  10 minutes we see several other Stamp breeds that reflect different outcomes based on his decision. Because the point was to show us how Zack is effecting these worlds. 

&#x200B;

> Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there.

Sephiroth divulged everything at the TofA scene. So that is what it is. There are infinite possible worlds based on what Sephiroth said. But we're not going to explore all of those worlds. We're only exploring the ones that matter and that's the one where Zack, Marlene, and Elmyra are in. 

The point here isn't so much what was shown as it is why it was shown. The message intended for the audience. To visually demonstrate what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. How each choice leads to a different outcome, and thus a new universe that is doomed from the start. 

&#x200B;

> Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense.   
>  
>It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation. 

 Think back to what we saw in those cutscenes. Several different worlds that are near the end. Now think about what Sephiroth said. "Each of these worlds are bound to the planet as one". Hence, these worlds are dying because the planet is dying. So it's not a situation where Zack can just zip in and out of timelines til he finds the best one. Because they're all doomed. 

 The other question is whether or not this multiverse is something that is supposed to exist, or something that is a result of a corrupted lifestream. While it seems like the latter would be the case, Dirge has some crazy shit that makes you wonder. And the last two chapters of Rebirth were on par with that.
Agreed!

I'm sticking with 'dream aerith gives Cloud a full white materia which he swaps for real aerith's empty one, allowing real aerith to summon holy and become schroedingers aerith just in time for part 3.'
I mean technically they still did
    And also didn’t as we see another timelime get created by cloud deflecting sephiroth’s sword, with the rainbow effect on it as well, then for some reason we get transported back to a timeline featuring dead aerith

What I dislike about this ending is how fucking hard to understand it is, I get that they were going for a “this isn’t the same as the original” type of vibe, to entice you to play it even if you think ypu already know everything, but if they really wanted to do that then saving aerith would have achieved a significant “how are things gonna change next?” effect without this much of a mess
        My theory is that timelines were created at the fall of the Cetra empire, maybe as some means to actually pacify Jenova, confusing it or whatever as a last ditch effort to stave off obliteration (this is almost directly referenced in the game, as it is never fully explained why Jenova decided to just take a big ol nap). These timelines have coexisted for millenia, in some status quo of reality always at the edge of complete destruction. These timelines are powered by the lifestream (again for some reason related to pacifying Jenova). Shinra siphoning off mako has weakened the separation of realities, as the lifestream can no longer fully support them all at once. Aerith, as the last Cetra, actually exists as a single soul among all concurrent timelines. It would make sense that if the Cetra created these branches, they can walk across them at will. This is why she is aware of her imminent death after communing fully with her ancient ancestors, that if she dies in one timeline, she will die in all of them, she is a single soul. This would make the strange dead-not-dead Aerith scene make sense. If it isn't some version of this, all hope is lost lol. But this is what I gathered from my playthrough and what is being eluded to. We will see I guess.
    I mean technically after they did she was with cloud fighting sephiroth so, no.
They did, I take it as cloud is so broken right now he can’t comprehend her being gone, I think when Tifa walked up to see the aftermath is flashed to show cloud covered in blood, then quickly back to his version where he wasn’t
Nomura: THAT WAS NOJIMA!  NOT ME!
What if you got into Kingdom Hearts because you're an FF7 fan. Do people just forget that KH came out after FF7
Idk I'm a die hard kh fan could tell you the whole story and this game confused tf outta me
I think this is a bit reductive. Time travel and multiverse shit has been a plague on franchises for longer than just the last decade of comic book movies lol
    and even prior to their return in Cinema, they had already been plaguing 2000s era television series

SE did this because they wanted to jump on a trend, something theyve been doing for the better part of 2 decades. they arent the only devs, JP or otherwise, who do this either. Bayonetta 3 sullied its series future with this uncalled for embrace as well
    Chrono Cross did multiverse way back when, that story didn't make a lot of sense by the end either.
They definitely saw that the multiverse was popular when they were developing remake and were like “hey let’s do that” and ironically when Rebirth came out everyone was sick of the multiverse already lmao
    EXACTLY.
They didn’t get the Yozora reveal though. That was the only surprise.
ok thats funny.
Man, Imagine if Nomura pulls a Evangelion and Cloud doesn't end up with neither Tifa or Aerith but with Jessie. That would be a certified Evangelion middle finger moment, ha-ha, but I don't think they are brave enough.
    I want Zack to end up with Cissnei, dammit!
For what it's worth some people were saying that when Remake came out. Made me also think of Star Trek (2009) and how that film is also kind of a "in universe reboot" that sits alongside the main timeline and they interact with eachother.
Isn't there a line in the third one where someone outright says "This has all happened before?"
    Kaworu I believe.
😂😂
To say it suddenly landed in a clusterfuck is putting our heads in the sand. Every scene with Zack was building up to what we saw at the end. 

I personally felt so unsatisfied. They showed everything in trailers, left nothing to the imagination, all while refusing to commit to anything with emotional consequence.

In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.
    Yeah that scene hurt! His personal trial with Myrna was painful too.

With Aerith? Meh. Apparently death isn't final, which cheapens the emotional impact this scene originally had.
    I skipped most of the trailers, so I don’t quite have the same experience, but I agree they were clearly setting up something, but I didn’t expect it all to come out during what is supposed to be an emotional gut punch, I really thought they respected the OG enough to let that scene breathe more, but idk. And i actually don’t agree that you can’t tell a complicated story like this well, imo 13 Sentinels is a great example of a seemingly super complex story that has a really clean resolution. But it feels like they chose a terrible moment to execute on their grand ideas.
    >In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.

kinda funny to me because to me it was one of the most butched parts.

i mean not to defend all the multiverse nonsense but at least there they are going for change. but the small changes around Dyne and Barrets situation ruins it for me. fuck of with Dyne being a barely fuctioning mad man. when he was a broken but fuctional man in the OG that was so much harder hitting. the only hint that he was mentally unwell was hearing the voice of his wife but even that he knew was delusions. and the game can fuck right of with the action scene of Shinra showing up right after.
    You really shouldn't watch Square Enix trailers within about 6 months of the release of a game, they ALWAYS do this.

Also there were tonnes more scenes than just Dyne vs Barret that hit right, the multiverse stuff only infected the story at the end.
I mean, did you not see the signs while playing the rest of the game? The introduced many clusterfucks along the way.
We're told all the branching universes are doomed, they don't matter.
This is exactly my problem with it.   All wishy washy switch’s universe bullshit.  It didn’t have any of the emotional impact that I was expecting.
But if it will end the same way, then less is more.  They should have left out all of the garbage and told the excellent story of the original with more content (like they have been doing 99% of the time).
With this music blasting in the background: [https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58](https://youtu.be/MgJghykl8SI?t=58)
One of the funniest posts here 😀
Considering how significant that scene was, not only to FF7 but to gaming, it might be, no joke
Ironically they even made Sephiroth say to the player at one point basically ”this makes no sense now right? It’s probably just a dream or something”… *sigh*
The point was solely to keep you anticipating Rebirth and now the 3rd part for four years. As stated by the developers multiple times.
    So false advertising and a lie? Also a Paradox since it's strong hinted that this is AC Sephiroth messing with everything to begin with.
I don't mean it's literally a dream, I mean it's just a poor writing trope that allows for pretty much any kind of nonsense with little or no consequence, regardless of whether it fits with the currently established universe - which this whole thing really doesn't.
    It doesnt? How tho? Cus it has been established since one game ago
I had to rewatch the ending two times to filter out what was a different timeline and what wasn't with aerith on screen. That shouldn't happen when your making as big of a moment as a character death. Confusion isn't good storytelling at pivotal moments.
    They actually ruined the most famous death scene in all of gaming man…I can’t believe what I watched lmao
        Anyone expecting them to just straightforwardly kill her wasn't reading the writing on the wall. I don't think a complicated story is inherently bad. But yeah you can argue execution wasn't great in some ways but "ruined " her death seems pretth strong.  I'm still very interested to see where it goes.
            I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
                I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
                They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
                I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
                    Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
            Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
Honestly this is what I've been doing. The different world shit feels so pointless because it doesn't really accomplish anything for the central narrative of the original. Only time it became impossible to ignore for me is the ending of Rebirth. That scene was too important to drag down with all the multiverse stuff
He was also part of the original team and the story writer is also the same, stop playing nomura for every decision, it's tiring
Nomura is the one reining them all in. He isn't the one making all these wacky choices for the games he directs.

He said recently that he see his name being blamed for certain choices online but didn't even write most of them
He was against changes
    bet
I have no faith the ending will be good, as remake and rebirth were both fantastic games that completely and utterly butchered the ending. If the third one follows 90% of the original then fucks the ending I’ll call it a win as I did with rebirth. At least this time I expected a garbage ending and was pleasantly surprised for the most part there wasn’t too much horrible multiverse shit through it haha
At least those things didn’t retroactively harm or touch the original game, and had a few redeemable aspects. Rebirth just straight up changed the most iconic moment of the game for the worse
    Well, OG is still there for you it can't retroactively harm the original game in any way since it never did leave open ends that weren't resolved prior to Remake and now Rebirth, you are just being dramatic.


Also btw, Remake and Rebirth also have "redeemable" aspects since it did a lot of things better than the OG as well as went deeper in various different story beats and world building the original FF7 couldn't focus too much on due to technical limitations of the time
I hope square knows that FF7 OG roms will be downloaded for years to come because of this lol
Why would you need to play the original for this? I mean I have, but why do you need to?
    I think you need at least a basic understanding of the original FF7 story to get the full experience from Remake and Rebirth. 

You can still enjoy them without, but I just think you’re missing something. They’re not remakes, I think that they’re pretty clearly sequels to the original story in a way.
        They're sequels? Aren't they reimaginations?
            Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
Because they needed sales since PS5 hasn't sold nearly as well as PS4
It sounded to me like the Whispers 'took away' both Aerith/Red's memories of the future AND Holy's power... I just don't know why they took away Holy? The memories make sense since they shouldn't have known the future in the first place... But Holy was always a part of the story. That's why I'm thinking it was Sephiroth's influence/plan to drain it?
    In the cutscene with Aerith and Red at johnnys hotel in costa del sol, it is explained that materia get their powers from the memories of the ancients stored within it, the whispers steal memories, during remake it got entirely drained of its memories
    Could it not have been Sepiroth who got the whispers to take away holy and their memories?
        That's my guess. Sephiroth gained control of the black whispers at the end of Remake and probably took both things away immediately.
Never to this extent though, not even close. There's a lot going on in ff7 but it's all pretty straightforward and explained by the end of the game
    So is this
        The difference is this is trash, and the og wasn't.
            lol nah.
    I mean, why are we assuming that by the end of part 3 the story won't also be explained? That said, the OG is not quite straightforward when you go into the details. Like the whole "Zack and Cloud memories mixed because they both got experimented and got Jenova's cells implanted in their bodies" or plot holes like Tifa not saying anything about the Nibelheim incident to Cloud (which THANK GOD Rebirth actually adress it) or Shinra sending Sephiroth to Nibelheim despite that being obviously a terrible idea as they knew Jenova was kept there. Plus some important info that could be easily missed (like the whole "is Sephiroth or Jenova in control?" which the answer is given subtly by Hojo when he's like "I thought the decayed Soldiers were going toward Jenova, but if it's not her, then...")
        FF7 isn't perfect, but multiverse instantly makes things messy. There's nothing about the original story of 7 that anybody should ever need a visual aid for though.
            They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
                I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
                    And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
                        Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                            Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
        I'm less annoyed by things not being explained yet and more annoyed by not being able to take in the death scene without being completely confused what was real and what wasn't. Made it emotionless for me, which isn't good writing.
        IDK I feel like the messiest part of OG 7 was the whole debate on if it was really Sephiroth or Jenova illusions in charge for majority of the game (up until northern crater) -- Which is nothing in comparison to 7Re
            There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
                Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
Don't confuse OG FF7 with the compilation bs. Nobody likes Genesis either, btw.
    I didn't? I meant between Remake stuff and the whole stuff with Genesis from the compilation, I'd still take Remake over it. Ff7 can be messy like with the whole mixed memory plot line.
But it always felt like the confusing stuff was all in some book or file you’d have to find somewhere, and not shoved in your face in the middle of what is supposed to be an impactful character death. Like, maybe I’d be a little happier if they let the death play out as normal in full and then just explain the actual plot in exposition afterwards, cause the way characters in game talk about all this shit is way too vague, I need it spoon-fed to me if they want to make it so complicated.
The only reason I wouldn't fire all these writers and bump them back down to moderating fanfiction forums is because they might start thinking some of the ideas from those places are actually good, start incorporating them into their own stories, and entirely miss the whole point that it would be a punishment
Sea salt ice cream. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. DARKNESS!!
In fairness time travel/alternate dimensions have been core concepts in Final Fantasy since the very first game. I would say the bigger problem is that historically FF isn't really great at sticking the landing on finales.

FF1 - >!Time Travel/Causal loop where Garland fights Chaos who makes Garland become Chaos in the past!<  
FF2 - >!Alternate Dimension (hell)!<  
FF3 - >!Alternate Dimension (world of darkness)!<  
FF5 - >!Alternate dimension AND dimensions merging together!<  
FF8 - >!Time travel AND times merging together!<  
FF9 - Technically, no other dimensions or time travel. BUT, the end of this game is so metaphorical that it almost fails to be comprehensible at all  
FF13 - Let's not even go there, lmao  
FF14 - >!Alternate Dimensions AND Time travel!<


So yea. While I agree that these concepts tend to become quite convoluted, they're foundational concepts in FF and probably will never go away. I didn't even mention the spin off titles, of which a large amount are about alternate dimensions and time travel.
    FF10 is also technically >!some kind of alternative dimension in a dream!<
        I excluded it because it's super convoluted haha

>!dream Zanarkand is a real physical location in the middle of the ocean but it only exists while Sin summons it and since Sin makes people have amnesia the outside world can't get there!<

But yea nonetheless, convoluted otherworldly concepts are the basic building block of most FF stories
    Reinforces my opinion that 6 is still the GOAT.
        I like 6 a lot, but my point is more that people have a recency bias with FF where they say "oh wow, square is really getting crazy with this one" when basically every single title is super crazy and that's the DNA of the series. 

I think that much like Remake before it, the deviations in part 3 as a result of this ending will be not too impactful and 95% of the game will be the same story as the original. We are just going to arrive at the conclusion via a slightly different route.
That's because Chrono Trigger was a single timeline (unless I'm misremembering something). It was just simple, wholesome time travel.
Some like it but I see more people syabthay the games great except for the multiverse shit.
I dunno if they did. I mean the ff7 remake crowd has more toxic positivity than most fanbases, and some people were going to love and worship this game no matter and will die defending it from any criticism. 

But even from that crowd, I really haven't seen many people actually come out and say "you know, multiverse and alternate time lines was exactly what the ff7 story needed"
I'll reserve my judgement untill after Part 3 is done, but so far I'm still of a mind that the original story was fine the way it was. I really like how Jessie and Biggs got more fleshed out as a character, how Dio was less of an ass, how Tifa and Aerith are now clear BFFs, I  liked the concept of Nanaki faking his maturity and I adore how much depth they gave Yuffie in this version. But I'm not convinced the multiverse stuff was necessary and I think they are overusing uncle Sephi. Him being a phantom you chase in the original was great, Him popping out everywhere like he is a youtube ad is not.
I don't hate it, but I'm going to continue to remain skeptical about it until Part 3 is out, which is basically where I was when I finished Remake after it released.  Personally, I like the changes to the story (for the most part.  Looking at you shitty Shinra Manor section.)  The timeline/different worlds stuff isn't TOO hard to actually grasp, I'm still just not quite sure if it's going to make for a satisfying conclusion/end to the story as they're telling it, but I want to reserve the right to say "THIS IS SHIT" or "THIS IS AMAZING" until I see how the entire thing pans out.
lot of people out there are just happy to see their favorite characters in hd. 

even more people are happy to see Tifa in a bikini and date her in the gold saucer. 

I don’t think people who are here for the plot like these changes, but I also think plot people are a loud minority.
I think that's the point. We are not feeling the sadness because Cloud himself isn't accepting. His mind is so broken he still think his Aerith is alive and well. Which will likely means that when his mind will have to be fixed, that's where the real moment of mourning will come.
    No, i get that. Thats exactly how im sure they will go about it.

My issue was just the way that they had to make it a spectacle, instead of making it a moment to pause and reflect.

It reminded me of that meme video where they showed the film "Taken" and showed that it had 14 cuts in 3 seconds or something made?

&#x200B;

Aerith has just died, let that moment rest and let us see the impact. Instead we spend 30mins being blasted across 5 different worlds and having corny 1-liners thrown at us.

&#x200B;

Just feels like the Directors wanted to give both camps, the Aerith still dies and Aerith will live hope and let them be "Right" whilst also causing another 4 years of arguing and theories because they didnt want to upset anyone.

Especially since they've now shown multiple Aeriths alive and Zack leaving us with a "Hey, Worlds can combine, thats cool" moment which basically says that Aerith could still return because "Ha, Multiverse".
    Except that’s not how to make people feel connected to your storytelling.  Especially for an already established story.  Making things confusing for the sake of it, at the cost of all else, isn’t good writing.
The Aerith’s death card is only a card you get to play once. Revisiting it in part 3 for the ‘real version’ is too little too late.
Which one is "ours" exactly?

The original?
The one from the remakes?

What about when they all inevitably converge?

To me the problem with the whole multiverse thing is that it lowers the stakes for everyone.

Like, Zacks death was amazingly handled in Crisis Core. But in here we see yet another Zack (which I'd say, not "our" Zack) meet his end (or be in a doomed world) several times, in several universes.

It's just... Lazy. 

They can just pull out whatever they want and say "multiverse!".
Because when you introduce stuff like this, especially unnecessarily, \*nothing matters\*.  
Slightly different?  Sure.  That doesn't mean that watching a character die then immediately show up again feels like it means anything.
To add to this, in addition to our Aerith, the one that matters, still being very dead, it's also important to keep in mind that this is still only part 2 of a 3 part saga. That means it's still very possible that these other worlds, fractures in the lifestream, or whatever the hell they are, won't even exist anymore by the end of game 3. I mean if Aerith and Zack are sitting around the fire at Cosmo Canyon with everyone else, singing songs, smiling and having a good time at the end of game 3, then yeah, I'll be pretty upset. That hasn't happened yet though, so it seems odd to me that so many people seem ready to write the entire trilogy off as a failure, when the story before the endings of the two games was so good, and we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.
    We already see that these worlds basically end in Rebirth itself, the only one that seems to be sticking around is the Terrier timeline, so it's not like we're actually meant to get invested in 10 different realities lol.

It's just a vehicle to explain that any choice creates a new branch of the world that will eventually die off.
    Man it’s kind of funny seeing everyone fall for the same exact shit they did in Remake 😂 95% of the game was an extremely faithful recreation of the original, with a very bombastic/extravagant ending (ultimately ending up in the same place) where everyone was saying how it ruined the game and they aren’t even interested now. 4 years later when Rebirth comes out, 95% is extremely faithful, another big ending, and “wow it’s ruined” 💀 you put it perfectly, don’t write off the entire trilogy until it’s actually finished
        All I'm getting from this is Part 3 will be an amazing 95% faithful game and then the ending will be bombastic / extravagant nonsense.

I actually completely agree with that, but I'm not sure that's the point you were hoping to make.
            I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
    > we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.

I'm not holding my breath for any explanation that is satisfying and truly makes sense.

Confusion is now the brand of storytelling they've explicitly chosen for the remake series and I don't expect that to change in part 3.
    Issue being that it detracts from story and emotional beats.  You end at the same destination, but without the same meaning behind it.  And thus far, many feel this meaning is far inferior.
        they can't help how they feel but i can't relate. i can't dismiss dozens of hours of a game that was full of emotional beats about loss and each character starting to think about what life looks like after death and war, and still ended with them figuring out how to move forward after losing aerith.
people are going to see all the time stuff and immediately dismiss it but it's really not as bad as everyone is saying. in the OG, aerith dies and finds a way to help the team in the lifestream. in remake, aerith dies (seems to have known all along that she would) and finds a way to help the team (with the addition of zack). third game will hopefully answer how that comes to be.  

full disrespect to the writers for creating this confusion on purpose but it is absolutely just a version of the same story that the OG told. people will always be mad that they didn't do the story beats exactly the same but this idea that it's cheapened now is silly to me.

tseng shouldve 100% died tho lol
If ours still died why is cloud so emotionless and cold? He should be sad. Not just "meh, oh well let's get going".
    Mate he literally has brain damage, AND is seeing her ghost
    Did you skip the scene where he’s crying over her dead body?
>The good news is that the other universes are unlikely to matter ever again.

People said the exact same thing about the Whispers in Part 1. "No need to keep complaining because we killed them, so now there won't be any Whispers in the next parts". 

Uh huh, sure. We saw how that turned out.

These alternate universes weren't introduced just to be discarded for Part 3. They will 100% have some kind of role in the last game.
    I mean, the doomsaying about whispers literally WAS wrong about part 2.

People said because of the Whispers the ending would completely change, all the same events would not play out, Aerith would not die, the story would be completely altered, etc. 

Rebirth was even *closer* to the original game than Remake was. So doomsay away, but they pretty blatantly stated that the alternate universes do not persist. They already served a purpose in the lore, I don't see any reason to forecast a total deviation from the original game now.
I was the opposite, wasn't sure what they were trying to do with Remake, but after playing Rebirth I can kind of see what they are going for from a writer's perspective.

Basically they want the third game to be an emotional nuclear bomb that destroys the player, and to achieve that they are shifting the payoff of aerith's death from the 2nd to the 3rd game at the cost of a satisfying end to the 2nd game. This explains why we don't see the iconic scenes of aerith being stabbed and lowered into the water, and why Tifa and Barret were blocked from seeing anything unlike the OG where they are there and snap Cloud out of being puppeted by Sephiroth.

It's a risky move as it damages the reception of the 2nd game, but if they stick the landing with the 3rd it will probably be forgiven.
Probably correct we will end up In the same place it’s just the rd there is way more twisty
    Yeah, that's pretty much how I suspect it'll go as well.
I agree that we’ll end up in the same place, but man, for them to show Aerith’s death scene and then throw 10+ boss fights at you? I get that you fight right after she dies in the OG but to me they didn’t spend nearly enough time on her getting killed. Kind of took all the emotion away for me
    Yeah, that's why I brought up bizarre story choices. It feels like they didn't know which direction to go in so we got... whatever this was.
That's exactly what people said at Remake's ending.
    And they were right. We defeated the whispers, Destiny is free and we basically spent the game doing 99% the same thing anyway.
Well said
My eyes couldn't roll harder reading this if they tried. 

I hate modern Squares approach to storytelling. Utter drivel.
Except it makes no sense that the universes result from Zack’s choices, because nothing in Zack should result in new universe. Like, how would the chips bag mascot change from Zack’s choice if it already was one type? 

Rather, the Zacks just lived in different universes (that has resulted in different bag design via some butterfly effect) and that alone deterministically made Zack make different choices. It’s dumb.
    Yes, we can say that Zack exists in all universes at the same time, these universes differ in the choices that he made. But it won't change the essence. But it is also correct to say that he creates new universes by his actions, because his survival was the reason for their creation, he is the Butterfly that causes a storm with a flap of its wing. 

Don't take everything too literally about the Stamps, it's more of a clue for the players.
On the beggining? Not really.

But when Chain of Memories and Dream Drop Distance were released, oh god, it became more confusing than Metal Gear and Zelda combined.
    No, CoM was not confusing at all its fairly simple. KH story only became confusing when DDD got released
Not really but people that don't play it love to say it is
As a big kingdom hearts fan who has been in the franchise since release i say the most confusing part is trying to get every game that is released in different consoles and try to get the full story. As the story itself ehh not really people who dont play it tend to exaggerate it. There is no multiverse crap in this game at best there is some time whiny shit starting in dream drop distance but thats more like "i pulled my younger self to fight with me now, also even if you go back in time shit doesn't change"

Also i guess the 6+ versions of xehanort are a bit hard to track if you loose sight but honestly its not that bad. We do like to joke that everyone is xehanort. 

I say its turning confusing though because nomura is trying to shoehorn his versus 13 plotlines into kh now
with that universe, cloud also is not that there to help avalanche, cus zack survives and stays with him
Good question I’m not sure
Completely agree, sadly. Sometimes less is more. You don't need to introduce complicated nonsense to a timeless story.
Yeah that makes sense, only thing that throws me off is that the Zack we play as in Rebirth potentially meets the same fate now just in a different setting (they did leave it open ended though)
    WDYM? We play two different Zack’s from two different timelines. The one we play at the beginning and middle dies at Shinra building, very sad. Luckily there’s an infinite amount of Zack’s now.

Maybe in part three Cloud will have an ability like Yuffie’s doppelganger where he pulls a random Zack from random universe who fights alongside him until he dies.
Yes, but he deflected Sephiroth's blade in the remake timeline saving Aerith. Why does Aerith end up dead in the remake timeline when he clearly saved her? Unless he somehow ended up in an alternate timeline where she is dead anyway, but how would Cloud have gotten there? That's what I'm trying to figure out.
    "Because Cloud is still sick," as Marlene said. Since we do not know by what rules parallel universes work, there may be dozens of theories, for example, that Cloud did not deflect Sephiroth's blade, but saw how his "healthy" version did it in another universe. Anyway, I think that even in the third part they will not explain to us exactly what happened. The universes will merge, and it won't matter anymore.
In all fairness, you very well could be right. Maybe I'm hoping for a miracle when it comes to the Zack and Whisper stuff, and am just setting myself up for disappointment in that regard. If I'm completely honest though...I never really cared about that stuff, one way or the other. I'm here for the 95% of the remake trilogy that's actually a remake of the FFVII story. That's what I've always been here for. The Zack stuff, whether it soars, or flops, is just extra for me. I'm intrigued enough to see where they're going with it, and they've done enough right with the remake so far that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now, and assume they have a plan to make this work. If they pull that miracle off, and manage to make all of Zack's stuff make sense within the larger story of FFVII, then great, everyone wins. Even if it should fail though, so long as they get the FFVII remake part of the story right, (and so far I think that part of the story has been incredibly enjoyable) then Zack's part of the storyline could end with him arm wrestling Dio on the moon, while wearing a Princess Peach cosplay, and I honestly wouldn't care. So long as we still get that proper remake/reimagining of the FFVII story at the end of this, then that's still a win in my book. I'll just focus on enjoying the 95% of the game that really worked. It wouldn't be the first time I had to ignore some really bad parts in a game I otherwise totally love.
The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen. Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII, and people generally really enjoy that part. Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have most of their issues. Thankfully, that weird stuff isn't what's being focused on. That stuff with Zack, and the different Stamps are there to create confusion, and get people talking about what might be happening, but at the end of the day, I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story of FFVII, so I don't think they were ever going to allow anything that would forever compromise the integrity of that story. I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up, but I don't think this will be the result of Square changing their minds in response to backlash, and walking anything back. I think setting things right in the end was their plan from the very beginning, from the moment they decided to introduce these new subplots.
    > The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen.

No, this is far more skewered towards the negative. Remake had the benefit of people sitting in the middle not knowing if part 2 would go wildly off the rails, and thus were cautiously optimistic, but if you look at the endgame discussion thread of over 2.5k posts, then its pretty clear that most people in general are not happy about a lot of the writing choices here and especially the multiverse nonsense.


>Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII

That is a charitably way of looking at it, the endgame discussion thread and myself included felt great frustration with the rewrites and how undercut many of the key moments were, by all the new additions and "noise" added to the game (Dyne, Nanaki's trial, Aerith's fate, just to name a few key examples) where lots of these moments not only lost the original tone of the game, but importantly also their memorable impact. Dyne for instance had a very dark and impactful original scene, and now it was just replaced with lots of noise, new magnetic powers, Shinra troops randomly giving him a heroic death out of nowhere. So messy and generic compared to the original scene --- And don't get me started on Aeriths scene. Its been spoken to death already, so I won't go further into just the ridiculously botched job they did with that.

>Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have their issues.


Nah, lots of things here changed in the telling these events and how they unfolded, which was significantly different to the OG. Which is what remake got a way with alot. Looking at something like the reactor bombing mission, its about as close and faithful of a recreation as you can have, while also expanding it.

Wall Market? It made slight changes, but ultimately kept the key points of what happened and how it happened, while importantly not changing the tone of the area.


Then you have something like the plate sequence, which was far more controversial in remake, because they changed it so dramatically, with so many people being warned and escaping, that it almost felt like nobody died in-universe. Obviously they did, but the colossal disaster it was in the OG, isn't felt nearly in the same way here, with you shortly after walking around talking to the same npcs again.


And yes of course the finale is the big controversial one.


But in rebirth, there is FAR more of this. From all the multiverse cuts with Zack, to odd new additions that just feel weirdly out of place, like Hojo attacking the party, Dyne growing magical magnetic powers from reading too much One Piece, and the Gi being handed a new script by Nomura, all of which just drastically changes so much of the dynamic in storytelling here. 


>I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story FFVII

again I think you're being charitable. They already locked themselves into doing the main storybeats for the most part, when Kitase literally went out and said you'd see the main story beats again, just perhaps a bit differently. But the fact that its done in such an unsatisfying way that often completely removes the tone, or impact of the original scenes, is just not doing it.


>I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up

Part of me thinks that Nomura is too stubborn to accept that the reception is a reason to course correct and that we are riding this out into full fanfic fanservice territory, like they spoke about in Ultimania, about wanting Zack to have a happy ending. Where we end up mashing all the timelines together and everyone has their happy ending. Seems perfect for his typical storytelling preference.


On the other hand, I HOPE that Square sees this reception and pushes for making sure that he isn't going completely Nomura all over it again.
        >most people in general

Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

>felt great frustration with the rewrites

SOME of the people in that thread. But really, even those are debatable. 
Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking, thanks to the voice acting and imagery (the scene where Dyne imagine returning home, man...). Sure he doesn't kill himself exactly like the original, but he still let himself be gunned down while cursing Barret and telling him to live on, which is pretty dark still. The meaning of said death is still kept as it shows to Barret what could he have become and why he has to keep living on, even despite the feeling of guilt.
Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot (although they do still come back to an extent via sidequests, which are appreciated).
As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

>colossal disaster in the OG

I call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died. Jesse, Biggs and Wedge all died before the plate fell. The only people we saw die was the reporter with his broadcast. And unlike the OG, Remake actually holds on the aftermath a lot more instead of moving on to Aerith 5 minutes later. Plus, the true despair vision of the plate fall happen in Yuffie's PoV of Intergrade, so that is kept too. 

>weird addictions like

Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them? Also you are not allowed to question why Dyne's arm has electromagnetic powers when him and Barret have infinite amount of ammo and Barret can do a massive beam if he wants. Also Nomura didn't write the script. He's just one of 4 writers, with Kitase being reason of most changes. 

Also no shit the storytelling is different in some parts, it's still meant to not be quite the OG story but a new one, basically a sequel/what if. Of course it will have differences.
            > Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.


Its really only the overly defensive people that seem to be happy about this.


>SOME of the people in that thread.

I already clarified it as being the vast majority. That by definition already clarifies that.


>But really, even those are debatable. 

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.
                >only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
                    > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
        Remake has an 87 on metacritic.

Rebirth has a 93.

Rebirth was received significantly better.

I'm not surprised by this in the slightest by the way. Critics loooove Auteur subversive stuff so they are all aboard the confusing ending train.
        Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all. He wanted to die, and was practically begging Barret to just shoot him, and put him out of his misery. Barret wouldn't do it, so he found another way to get it done. He had given up on himself, and was no longer even looking for a reason to go on living. He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred, killing as many Shinra troopers as he could before finally going down, rather than go with Barret to see Marlene again and try to find a place for himself in her life. Dyne's final attack was a suicide. The troopers were just the insturment for his suicide, since he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on himself. Dyne's death is a cautionary tale to Barret on what could happen to him if he ever lost sight of his reason for living, and gave in fully to his hatred, just as it was in the original. 

Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer, who came after us because we had been unknowingly ruining his day since we first arrived at the Gold Saucer.
            > Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
                He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
                    > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
                        The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
I can’t wait to be more confused than kingdom hearts
Well this is my understanding of a plot that is missing a third act, so I might be completely off base. Who knows?

All we can hope is that the final answers at the end of Resomething will make sense.
Funny cause it is really nomura-esque changes
    True that
Funnily enough this image perfectly encapsulates my theory because I do believe everything is within the lifestream, and the different worlds are akin to the different memory lines within the lifestream described in Ever Crisis.

Edit: But also I've come to the conclusion that the mechanics now don't really matter when it comes to theorising the plot going forward because the lifestream theory and the multiverse still work in Sephiroth achieving the same thing; absorbing all the shit, it's just the mechanism in play to make that happen changes.
Ohhh i misunderstood, i thought the big lifestream outline meant that all the worlds are inside it
We can assume in this case that the entire Remake world is a branch universe where the OG Aerith and OG Sephiroth in LifeStream are acessing other worlds and the main objective of Sephiroth is reach a universe where he can "win" and turn the "main universe" and Aerith is fighting against it?

In this case they can travel on time too since the Ultimate Aerith reach her Remake body where she meets cloud.

Sounds a good theory to me to make it simple this Multiverse mess.
    Something like that. Sephiroth made this world where he took away Aerith's White Materia from her. As a result, she cannot use Holy, and there is no one to stop the meteor. But OG Aerith found a way to transfer the White Materia, through another universe.
Nomura isn't the one making these changes, he's the one reining them in, so most of the story stays intact.

He also doesn't write a lot of the stuff he just gets blamed for online.
It actually isn't that hard to understand when you've thought about it after the ending.

Did you however not complete the picture due to spoilers of the ending? There is another fracture in the ending.
    Because we don't know what really happened at the end, just different theories. Stamps are at least some kind of reference point that allows you to understand in what reality events are taking place at the moment.
        Good point, the one's you mentioned we are sure of.
The game is made in Japan after all, there's not a lot of space. Definitely not a lot of room for some golden retrievers in those 500 sq ft apartments they have to cram into.
    My european ass thinking "well damn 500 of something doesn't sound too bad, nani the hell?" and then googling the conversion into square metres. It's 46.5 square metres.

Jesus that is CRAMPED for a big dog. It'd be cramped for MY fat arse and, after conversion, I stand at an absolutely gigantic, monstruous even, "5 foot 6"(and don't say otherwise).
        Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
        You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
    Do you think that’s the reason why so Japanese people seem to prefer cats to dogs? Is it because they’re a better fit for their smaller apartments and/or that they don’t require as much maintenance as a dog does? 

I know that there are plenty of people in Japan who own and love dogs. I’m definitely not saying that dogs aren’t loved by the Japanese; however, it just seems *to me* that cats are the more popular pet and I’m curious as to why.
    Might have to deploy the cat stamp platoon
St. Bernards are such good dogs. When I was 18 my best friend Tom got a puppy named Heidi. She was such a sweet girl, and when I crashed over at his place she would hop up onto the couch and sleep on top of me. 

Flash-forward to a year later when she’s a fully-grown pooch who *still had to lay on top of me* when I crashed on his couch. OUCH. She may have weighed more than I did at the time! But she was such a sweet girl that you would just let her climb onto your lap. Heidi was never my dog of course, but I miss that Very Good Girl all the same.
    I had a similar experience with a Newfoundland. Glorious beings, they are, and my grandma's was ever so sweet and would love to cuddle. I, for one, really like breathing, I'd go as far as to say I love it so much I live for it, but I made as much of an exception for that huge ball of floof even after he grew to an absolutely staggering size. He was a hugger, too. Bless that dog, he had a good life and I hope he thought I was part of what made it good, but this was when I was much younger. The only bad thing about most dogs is their lifespan. So unfair.
It's definitely lunched home way more than it needs to be lol.   Just in the costa del sol ticket quest they get tickets 7 and 77!
But I also think Aerith’s consciousness is traveling between worlds. It’s the same Aerith in every timeline just as it’s the same Sephiroth.

I think Jessie’s theory in remake about her dad confirms this when Biggs tells Cloud the theory that his consciousness is trapped somewhere between his body and the planet. 

Aerith has the power to transition between these.
Absolutely correct. After all, at least one planet must die to make the Meteor to traverse the Rift, and given how Zack's one is literally going to deteriorate and implode very soon... man, Square is doing everything possible to make Zack fate miserable.
I'm thinking that the Aerith that gives Cloud the White Materia is the Aerith that had been dead in the OG timeline all the way to Advent Children.

When Seph shows up he says something like "so, this is where you've been hiding." Maybe Aerith and Seph have constantly been fighting ever since AC ended.
Which universe is which?
I know that we have the normal timeline, the Zack timeline, the Biggs timeline (Zack in Reactor 6), the Cloud timeline (Zack in Shinra HQ) and the Aerith timeline (Zack and Sephiroth in church??) This is probably the only thing that's confusing me
    Terrier is the one we throughout the game multiple times which tells Zack's story.

Pug (Biggs) and Shiba (Zack staying at the church, wondering what to do) are only used for short scenes to show how new worlds are born.

Spitz is where the Aerith dream date happens and she gives the white Materia to Cloud.
Outside chapter 14, Terrier is the only other one we see right?

With Spitz and Pug happening due to Zacks indecisiveness.

I knew something was "off" with Spitz Aerith, but i just thought that WAS Spitz Aerith with a bit more knowledge, though her behavior was a bit off to me as well (hell even Cloud noticed)

Didnt know ther was an "Ultimate" Aerith lol. And here i thought i was following along pretty well.
    Yeah, chapter 14 is the only one where we suddenly get a whole new pack of worlds in addition to the 2 (main and Terrier) we already knew.

"Ultimate Aerith" is just the most popular theory as to why Aerith acts the way she does in that scene. There is nothing ingame that suggests an "Ultimate Aerith" exists. Without outside knowledge, we are just supposed to notice that Aerith is acting weird and not as she usually does.  
We'll probably learn more about that in Part 3.
Nomura didnt write this lol
Nojima is the writer lmfao
I think Meteor is a red herring now, and I'm convinced of this because of the added lore changes about the Gi and their situation.

They created the Black Materia because they wanted to end their suffering of being stuck in spiritual form. The Lifestream won't accept them because they're alien in nature. Sephiroth, because of the nature of his creation, is also set apart from The Lifestream. He is stuck between his body and the planet, so he can't really do anything except possess bodies that have Jenova cells in them.

In one of the side stories Aerith (the one in The Lifestream) mentions that Sephiroth is still there even after his defeat, but she describes that The Lifestream "washes off his back like rain", so Sephiroth is trapped in some kind of limbo in his afterlife.

The Sephiroth we're seeing in Remake/Rebirth may not want the same thing as he did in the OG story. The whole "become a god" thing could just be him manipulating the party.
    It also crossed my mind as well that that could be the case.  What's interesting with the new Black Materia lore is that it doesn't necessarily summon Meteor per say, it works to enact "destruction" per the will of the user. 

The Gi intended to use it to destroy their spirits thus relieving them of their tormented state and Sephiroth needed it to cause a wound so great to the planet it would take the entirety of the Lifestream to heal.

That being said, Sephiroths greatest weaknesses, despite his power, is his obsession with carrying out Jenovas Will and his utter inability to perceive anyone else as a threat. I'd reckon that despite this Sephiroth obviously having knowledge he shouldn't have, he's still trying to get to the same destination through a different road.

I think it would be rather poetic that, despite the ability to actually change his destiny, Sephiroth refuses to actually learn from his experiences and correct his mistakes.
        I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
            I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
                If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
                    I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                        I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
I had the same thought when Sephiroth sent his whispers to dry out a mako spring in cosmo canyon as seen in bugenhagen’s side quest. We never see him do stuff like that in the original and he also didn’t have whispers then so I strongly believe that it’s part of his plan. Sephiroth knows exactly how he lost in the original and is trying his hardest to mitigate each factor (such as pitting Shinra and Wutai against each other so Rufus is too distracted to destroy the Northern Crater barrier with the Sister Ray)
    The dark whispers are still fascinating to me because it's hard to tell if they're directly under aephiroths control or if sephiroth has potentially manipulated them into trying to enforce an alternate "destiny." Possibly a universe where Sephiroth has already won. Then again, they may just be representing the lifestream that Sephiroth and Jenova have already corrupted.
Did you just not pay attention to the ending? He literally says that he wants to reunite all the timelines to save everyone. That's his goal. This means that he could reunite the timelines in which everyone is alive and beat Sephiroth together. Zack's whole segment was setting him up to be this being that the lifestream had chosen to fix the world by saving everyone to defeath Sephiroth. He keeps getting saved by the white whispers. The white whispers from what we know seem to represent the planet and the lifestream. 


Maybe he succeeds, maybe he doesn't. Regardless his part isn't over yet. Him and cloud will definitely interact in the future. Aerith will also still play a huge part. I suspect the final boss battle's party will consist of Zack Cloud and Aerith regardless of whether they are all truly alive in the main timeline or not.

So while Cloud is off finding Sephiroth, Zack will be trying to figure out how to reunite the timelines.
    Maybe Zack is just a marketing strategy, a way to interest Zack fans into buying the game. Have you ever thought about that?

This whole defy fate or multiverse stuffs and the story still ended up the same as the OG. No need to try brain storming this shit cause it is wasted anyway.
        Believe what you want to.
What I got from it is that the "prime" consciousness of Biggs simply redistributed itself because a world now exists in which he survived.
>Then we see the other outcome in reactor 6 when a defeated Biggs tells Zack the planet is out of lifestream. This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

Except that isn’t what we saw. He isn’t wearing the ribbon. Which they specifically focus on.
    Biggs had a bag of Stamp's Champs with a Pug Stamp on the front. Then he said the reactor is sucking up dirt because the lifestream is bone dry. So what do you mean that isn't what we saw?
        I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
            I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
                >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
                    And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                        That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
Don't forget the will of the Goddess is mentioned in Loveless which may be a spoiler for Minerva. Also, the puppet of fate which most likely alludes to Cloud.
    They drove the LOVELESS stuff pretty hard. They changed the poem for the US localisation, but it remained the same in the Japanese.
>This is now the Pug timeline because Zack made a different choice. The wrong choice, and that world is doomed.

"Every choice creates a timeline but if it's not the mysterious and arbitrary 'correct' choice then your whole timeline is doomed and slowly dissolves lmao get fucked. You can pop into the main timeline to help a bit but you're still ultimately doomed" is a rules system for time travel that is used by exactly *Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,* *Homestuck,* and basically nothing else. There's no way that's not just a weird coincidence, even if FF7R and HS are *also* both meta stories about the concept of canon, but I want to believe.
> It's choices and outcomes. Outcomes don't always have to be the result of one's own choice. Based on his account of his last stand, it's apparent that the whispers saved him. What's happening to Zack is due the will of the planet and/or the white whispers.

Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear. Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there. Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense. 


Why aren't we just making some choices that lead to a good, uncorrupted Sephiroth coming to help us? Why aren't any of these decisions leading to other events even further in the past changing? Like Gast's fate, or Ifalna? Or Vincent and Lucrecia?


It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation.
    >Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear.

I didn't move the definition. I said both choices and outcomes from the beginning. The very first one starts with Zack's victory. We are told that Terrier Stamp symbolizes that. Then in the span of  10 minutes we see several other Stamp breeds that reflect different outcomes based on his decision. Because the point was to show us how Zack is effecting these worlds. 

&#x200B;

> Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there.

Sephiroth divulged everything at the TofA scene. So that is what it is. There are infinite possible worlds based on what Sephiroth said. But we're not going to explore all of those worlds. We're only exploring the ones that matter and that's the one where Zack, Marlene, and Elmyra are in. 

The point here isn't so much what was shown as it is why it was shown. The message intended for the audience. To visually demonstrate what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. How each choice leads to a different outcome, and thus a new universe that is doomed from the start. 

&#x200B;

> Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense.   
>  
>It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation. 

 Think back to what we saw in those cutscenes. Several different worlds that are near the end. Now think about what Sephiroth said. "Each of these worlds are bound to the planet as one". Hence, these worlds are dying because the planet is dying. So it's not a situation where Zack can just zip in and out of timelines til he finds the best one. Because they're all doomed. 

 The other question is whether or not this multiverse is something that is supposed to exist, or something that is a result of a corrupted lifestream. While it seems like the latter would be the case, Dirge has some crazy shit that makes you wonder. And the last two chapters of Rebirth were on par with that.
And also didn’t as we see another timelime get created by cloud deflecting sephiroth’s sword, with the rainbow effect on it as well, then for some reason we get transported back to a timeline featuring dead aerith

What I dislike about this ending is how fucking hard to understand it is, I get that they were going for a “this isn’t the same as the original” type of vibe, to entice you to play it even if you think ypu already know everything, but if they really wanted to do that then saving aerith would have achieved a significant “how are things gonna change next?” effect without this much of a mess
    My theory is that timelines were created at the fall of the Cetra empire, maybe as some means to actually pacify Jenova, confusing it or whatever as a last ditch effort to stave off obliteration (this is almost directly referenced in the game, as it is never fully explained why Jenova decided to just take a big ol nap). These timelines have coexisted for millenia, in some status quo of reality always at the edge of complete destruction. These timelines are powered by the lifestream (again for some reason related to pacifying Jenova). Shinra siphoning off mako has weakened the separation of realities, as the lifestream can no longer fully support them all at once. Aerith, as the last Cetra, actually exists as a single soul among all concurrent timelines. It would make sense that if the Cetra created these branches, they can walk across them at will. This is why she is aware of her imminent death after communing fully with her ancient ancestors, that if she dies in one timeline, she will die in all of them, she is a single soul. This would make the strange dead-not-dead Aerith scene make sense. If it isn't some version of this, all hope is lost lol. But this is what I gathered from my playthrough and what is being eluded to. We will see I guess.
I mean technically after they did she was with cloud fighting sephiroth so, no.
and even prior to their return in Cinema, they had already been plaguing 2000s era television series

SE did this because they wanted to jump on a trend, something theyve been doing for the better part of 2 decades. they arent the only devs, JP or otherwise, who do this either. Bayonetta 3 sullied its series future with this uncalled for embrace as well
Chrono Cross did multiverse way back when, that story didn't make a lot of sense by the end either.
EXACTLY.
I want Zack to end up with Cissnei, dammit!
Kaworu I believe.
Yeah that scene hurt! His personal trial with Myrna was painful too.

With Aerith? Meh. Apparently death isn't final, which cheapens the emotional impact this scene originally had.
I skipped most of the trailers, so I don’t quite have the same experience, but I agree they were clearly setting up something, but I didn’t expect it all to come out during what is supposed to be an emotional gut punch, I really thought they respected the OG enough to let that scene breathe more, but idk. And i actually don’t agree that you can’t tell a complicated story like this well, imo 13 Sentinels is a great example of a seemingly super complex story that has a really clean resolution. But it feels like they chose a terrible moment to execute on their grand ideas.
>In my opinion, the only scenario that hit correctly was Dyne vs Barret, and it is the only one mostly untouched by their multiverse layering.

kinda funny to me because to me it was one of the most butched parts.

i mean not to defend all the multiverse nonsense but at least there they are going for change. but the small changes around Dyne and Barrets situation ruins it for me. fuck of with Dyne being a barely fuctioning mad man. when he was a broken but fuctional man in the OG that was so much harder hitting. the only hint that he was mentally unwell was hearing the voice of his wife but even that he knew was delusions. and the game can fuck right of with the action scene of Shinra showing up right after.
You really shouldn't watch Square Enix trailers within about 6 months of the release of a game, they ALWAYS do this.

Also there were tonnes more scenes than just Dyne vs Barret that hit right, the multiverse stuff only infected the story at the end.
So false advertising and a lie? Also a Paradox since it's strong hinted that this is AC Sephiroth messing with everything to begin with.
It doesnt? How tho? Cus it has been established since one game ago
They actually ruined the most famous death scene in all of gaming man…I can’t believe what I watched lmao
    Anyone expecting them to just straightforwardly kill her wasn't reading the writing on the wall. I don't think a complicated story is inherently bad. But yeah you can argue execution wasn't great in some ways but "ruined " her death seems pretth strong.  I'm still very interested to see where it goes.
        I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
            I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
            They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
            I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
                Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
        Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
bet
Well, OG is still there for you it can't retroactively harm the original game in any way since it never did leave open ends that weren't resolved prior to Remake and now Rebirth, you are just being dramatic.


Also btw, Remake and Rebirth also have "redeemable" aspects since it did a lot of things better than the OG as well as went deeper in various different story beats and world building the original FF7 couldn't focus too much on due to technical limitations of the time
I think you need at least a basic understanding of the original FF7 story to get the full experience from Remake and Rebirth. 

You can still enjoy them without, but I just think you’re missing something. They’re not remakes, I think that they’re pretty clearly sequels to the original story in a way.
    They're sequels? Aren't they reimaginations?
        Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
In the cutscene with Aerith and Red at johnnys hotel in costa del sol, it is explained that materia get their powers from the memories of the ancients stored within it, the whispers steal memories, during remake it got entirely drained of its memories
Could it not have been Sepiroth who got the whispers to take away holy and their memories?
    That's my guess. Sephiroth gained control of the black whispers at the end of Remake and probably took both things away immediately.
So is this
    The difference is this is trash, and the og wasn't.
        lol nah.
I mean, why are we assuming that by the end of part 3 the story won't also be explained? That said, the OG is not quite straightforward when you go into the details. Like the whole "Zack and Cloud memories mixed because they both got experimented and got Jenova's cells implanted in their bodies" or plot holes like Tifa not saying anything about the Nibelheim incident to Cloud (which THANK GOD Rebirth actually adress it) or Shinra sending Sephiroth to Nibelheim despite that being obviously a terrible idea as they knew Jenova was kept there. Plus some important info that could be easily missed (like the whole "is Sephiroth or Jenova in control?" which the answer is given subtly by Hojo when he's like "I thought the decayed Soldiers were going toward Jenova, but if it's not her, then...")
    FF7 isn't perfect, but multiverse instantly makes things messy. There's nothing about the original story of 7 that anybody should ever need a visual aid for though.
        They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
            I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
                And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
                    Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                        Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
    I'm less annoyed by things not being explained yet and more annoyed by not being able to take in the death scene without being completely confused what was real and what wasn't. Made it emotionless for me, which isn't good writing.
    IDK I feel like the messiest part of OG 7 was the whole debate on if it was really Sephiroth or Jenova illusions in charge for majority of the game (up until northern crater) -- Which is nothing in comparison to 7Re
        There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
            Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
I didn't? I meant between Remake stuff and the whole stuff with Genesis from the compilation, I'd still take Remake over it. Ff7 can be messy like with the whole mixed memory plot line.
FF10 is also technically >!some kind of alternative dimension in a dream!<
    I excluded it because it's super convoluted haha

>!dream Zanarkand is a real physical location in the middle of the ocean but it only exists while Sin summons it and since Sin makes people have amnesia the outside world can't get there!<

But yea nonetheless, convoluted otherworldly concepts are the basic building block of most FF stories
Reinforces my opinion that 6 is still the GOAT.
    I like 6 a lot, but my point is more that people have a recency bias with FF where they say "oh wow, square is really getting crazy with this one" when basically every single title is super crazy and that's the DNA of the series. 

I think that much like Remake before it, the deviations in part 3 as a result of this ending will be not too impactful and 95% of the game will be the same story as the original. We are just going to arrive at the conclusion via a slightly different route.
No, i get that. Thats exactly how im sure they will go about it.

My issue was just the way that they had to make it a spectacle, instead of making it a moment to pause and reflect.

It reminded me of that meme video where they showed the film "Taken" and showed that it had 14 cuts in 3 seconds or something made?

&#x200B;

Aerith has just died, let that moment rest and let us see the impact. Instead we spend 30mins being blasted across 5 different worlds and having corny 1-liners thrown at us.

&#x200B;

Just feels like the Directors wanted to give both camps, the Aerith still dies and Aerith will live hope and let them be "Right" whilst also causing another 4 years of arguing and theories because they didnt want to upset anyone.

Especially since they've now shown multiple Aeriths alive and Zack leaving us with a "Hey, Worlds can combine, thats cool" moment which basically says that Aerith could still return because "Ha, Multiverse".
Except that’s not how to make people feel connected to your storytelling.  Especially for an already established story.  Making things confusing for the sake of it, at the cost of all else, isn’t good writing.
The Aerith’s death card is only a card you get to play once. Revisiting it in part 3 for the ‘real version’ is too little too late.
We already see that these worlds basically end in Rebirth itself, the only one that seems to be sticking around is the Terrier timeline, so it's not like we're actually meant to get invested in 10 different realities lol.

It's just a vehicle to explain that any choice creates a new branch of the world that will eventually die off.
Man it’s kind of funny seeing everyone fall for the same exact shit they did in Remake 😂 95% of the game was an extremely faithful recreation of the original, with a very bombastic/extravagant ending (ultimately ending up in the same place) where everyone was saying how it ruined the game and they aren’t even interested now. 4 years later when Rebirth comes out, 95% is extremely faithful, another big ending, and “wow it’s ruined” 💀 you put it perfectly, don’t write off the entire trilogy until it’s actually finished
    All I'm getting from this is Part 3 will be an amazing 95% faithful game and then the ending will be bombastic / extravagant nonsense.

I actually completely agree with that, but I'm not sure that's the point you were hoping to make.
        I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
> we still have a whole other game to go to explain the weirdness of the previous two endings.

I'm not holding my breath for any explanation that is satisfying and truly makes sense.

Confusion is now the brand of storytelling they've explicitly chosen for the remake series and I don't expect that to change in part 3.
Issue being that it detracts from story and emotional beats.  You end at the same destination, but without the same meaning behind it.  And thus far, many feel this meaning is far inferior.
    they can't help how they feel but i can't relate. i can't dismiss dozens of hours of a game that was full of emotional beats about loss and each character starting to think about what life looks like after death and war, and still ended with them figuring out how to move forward after losing aerith.
Mate he literally has brain damage, AND is seeing her ghost
Did you skip the scene where he’s crying over her dead body?
I mean, the doomsaying about whispers literally WAS wrong about part 2.

People said because of the Whispers the ending would completely change, all the same events would not play out, Aerith would not die, the story would be completely altered, etc. 

Rebirth was even *closer* to the original game than Remake was. So doomsay away, but they pretty blatantly stated that the alternate universes do not persist. They already served a purpose in the lore, I don't see any reason to forecast a total deviation from the original game now.
Yeah, that's pretty much how I suspect it'll go as well.
Yeah, that's why I brought up bizarre story choices. It feels like they didn't know which direction to go in so we got... whatever this was.
And they were right. We defeated the whispers, Destiny is free and we basically spent the game doing 99% the same thing anyway.
Yes, we can say that Zack exists in all universes at the same time, these universes differ in the choices that he made. But it won't change the essence. But it is also correct to say that he creates new universes by his actions, because his survival was the reason for their creation, he is the Butterfly that causes a storm with a flap of its wing. 

Don't take everything too literally about the Stamps, it's more of a clue for the players.
No, CoM was not confusing at all its fairly simple. KH story only became confusing when DDD got released
WDYM? We play two different Zack’s from two different timelines. The one we play at the beginning and middle dies at Shinra building, very sad. Luckily there’s an infinite amount of Zack’s now.

Maybe in part three Cloud will have an ability like Yuffie’s doppelganger where he pulls a random Zack from random universe who fights alongside him until he dies.
"Because Cloud is still sick," as Marlene said. Since we do not know by what rules parallel universes work, there may be dozens of theories, for example, that Cloud did not deflect Sephiroth's blade, but saw how his "healthy" version did it in another universe. Anyway, I think that even in the third part they will not explain to us exactly what happened. The universes will merge, and it won't matter anymore.
> The reception of the story seems pretty much the same as Remake's from what I've seen.

No, this is far more skewered towards the negative. Remake had the benefit of people sitting in the middle not knowing if part 2 would go wildly off the rails, and thus were cautiously optimistic, but if you look at the endgame discussion thread of over 2.5k posts, then its pretty clear that most people in general are not happy about a lot of the writing choices here and especially the multiverse nonsense.


>Most of the time, both games are exactly what Square said they would be, just an embelished, and expanded reimagining of FFVII

That is a charitably way of looking at it, the endgame discussion thread and myself included felt great frustration with the rewrites and how undercut many of the key moments were, by all the new additions and "noise" added to the game (Dyne, Nanaki's trial, Aerith's fate, just to name a few key examples) where lots of these moments not only lost the original tone of the game, but importantly also their memorable impact. Dyne for instance had a very dark and impactful original scene, and now it was just replaced with lots of noise, new magnetic powers, Shinra troops randomly giving him a heroic death out of nowhere. So messy and generic compared to the original scene --- And don't get me started on Aeriths scene. Its been spoken to death already, so I won't go further into just the ridiculously botched job they did with that.

>Then a bunch of weird things happen at the very end, and that's where people have their issues.


Nah, lots of things here changed in the telling these events and how they unfolded, which was significantly different to the OG. Which is what remake got a way with alot. Looking at something like the reactor bombing mission, its about as close and faithful of a recreation as you can have, while also expanding it.

Wall Market? It made slight changes, but ultimately kept the key points of what happened and how it happened, while importantly not changing the tone of the area.


Then you have something like the plate sequence, which was far more controversial in remake, because they changed it so dramatically, with so many people being warned and escaping, that it almost felt like nobody died in-universe. Obviously they did, but the colossal disaster it was in the OG, isn't felt nearly in the same way here, with you shortly after walking around talking to the same npcs again.


And yes of course the finale is the big controversial one.


But in rebirth, there is FAR more of this. From all the multiverse cuts with Zack, to odd new additions that just feel weirdly out of place, like Hojo attacking the party, Dyne growing magical magnetic powers from reading too much One Piece, and the Gi being handed a new script by Nomura, all of which just drastically changes so much of the dynamic in storytelling here. 


>I think Square realizes that this isn't what most players are here to see. What we're here for is the story FFVII

again I think you're being charitable. They already locked themselves into doing the main storybeats for the most part, when Kitase literally went out and said you'd see the main story beats again, just perhaps a bit differently. But the fact that its done in such an unsatisfying way that often completely removes the tone, or impact of the original scenes, is just not doing it.


>I do think that part 3 will ultimately set whatever is happening right, and make sure everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up

Part of me thinks that Nomura is too stubborn to accept that the reception is a reason to course correct and that we are riding this out into full fanfic fanservice territory, like they spoke about in Ultimania, about wanting Zack to have a happy ending. Where we end up mashing all the timelines together and everyone has their happy ending. Seems perfect for his typical storytelling preference.


On the other hand, I HOPE that Square sees this reception and pushes for making sure that he isn't going completely Nomura all over it again.
    >most people in general

Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

>felt great frustration with the rewrites

SOME of the people in that thread. But really, even those are debatable. 
Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking, thanks to the voice acting and imagery (the scene where Dyne imagine returning home, man...). Sure he doesn't kill himself exactly like the original, but he still let himself be gunned down while cursing Barret and telling him to live on, which is pretty dark still. The meaning of said death is still kept as it shows to Barret what could he have become and why he has to keep living on, even despite the feeling of guilt.
Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot (although they do still come back to an extent via sidequests, which are appreciated).
As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

>colossal disaster in the OG

I call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died. Jesse, Biggs and Wedge all died before the plate fell. The only people we saw die was the reporter with his broadcast. And unlike the OG, Remake actually holds on the aftermath a lot more instead of moving on to Aerith 5 minutes later. Plus, the true despair vision of the plate fall happen in Yuffie's PoV of Intergrade, so that is kept too. 

>weird addictions like

Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them? Also you are not allowed to question why Dyne's arm has electromagnetic powers when him and Barret have infinite amount of ammo and Barret can do a massive beam if he wants. Also Nomura didn't write the script. He's just one of 4 writers, with Kitase being reason of most changes. 

Also no shit the storytelling is different in some parts, it's still meant to not be quite the OG story but a new one, basically a sequel/what if. Of course it will have differences.
        > Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.


Its really only the overly defensive people that seem to be happy about this.


>SOME of the people in that thread.

I already clarified it as being the vast majority. That by definition already clarifies that.


>But really, even those are debatable. 

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.
            >only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
                > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
    Remake has an 87 on metacritic.

Rebirth has a 93.

Rebirth was received significantly better.

I'm not surprised by this in the slightest by the way. Critics loooove Auteur subversive stuff so they are all aboard the confusing ending train.
    Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all. He wanted to die, and was practically begging Barret to just shoot him, and put him out of his misery. Barret wouldn't do it, so he found another way to get it done. He had given up on himself, and was no longer even looking for a reason to go on living. He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred, killing as many Shinra troopers as he could before finally going down, rather than go with Barret to see Marlene again and try to find a place for himself in her life. Dyne's final attack was a suicide. The troopers were just the insturment for his suicide, since he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on himself. Dyne's death is a cautionary tale to Barret on what could happen to him if he ever lost sight of his reason for living, and gave in fully to his hatred, just as it was in the original. 

Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer, who came after us because we had been unknowingly ruining his day since we first arrived at the Gold Saucer.
        > Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
            He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
                > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
                    The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
True that
Something like that. Sephiroth made this world where he took away Aerith's White Materia from her. As a result, she cannot use Holy, and there is no one to stop the meteor. But OG Aerith found a way to transfer the White Materia, through another universe.
Because we don't know what really happened at the end, just different theories. Stamps are at least some kind of reference point that allows you to understand in what reality events are taking place at the moment.
    Good point, the one's you mentioned we are sure of.
My european ass thinking "well damn 500 of something doesn't sound too bad, nani the hell?" and then googling the conversion into square metres. It's 46.5 square metres.

Jesus that is CRAMPED for a big dog. It'd be cramped for MY fat arse and, after conversion, I stand at an absolutely gigantic, monstruous even, "5 foot 6"(and don't say otherwise).
    Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
    You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
Do you think that’s the reason why so Japanese people seem to prefer cats to dogs? Is it because they’re a better fit for their smaller apartments and/or that they don’t require as much maintenance as a dog does? 

I know that there are plenty of people in Japan who own and love dogs. I’m definitely not saying that dogs aren’t loved by the Japanese; however, it just seems *to me* that cats are the more popular pet and I’m curious as to why.
Might have to deploy the cat stamp platoon
I had a similar experience with a Newfoundland. Glorious beings, they are, and my grandma's was ever so sweet and would love to cuddle. I, for one, really like breathing, I'd go as far as to say I love it so much I live for it, but I made as much of an exception for that huge ball of floof even after he grew to an absolutely staggering size. He was a hugger, too. Bless that dog, he had a good life and I hope he thought I was part of what made it good, but this was when I was much younger. The only bad thing about most dogs is their lifespan. So unfair.
Terrier is the one we throughout the game multiple times which tells Zack's story.

Pug (Biggs) and Shiba (Zack staying at the church, wondering what to do) are only used for short scenes to show how new worlds are born.

Spitz is where the Aerith dream date happens and she gives the white Materia to Cloud.
Yeah, chapter 14 is the only one where we suddenly get a whole new pack of worlds in addition to the 2 (main and Terrier) we already knew.

"Ultimate Aerith" is just the most popular theory as to why Aerith acts the way she does in that scene. There is nothing ingame that suggests an "Ultimate Aerith" exists. Without outside knowledge, we are just supposed to notice that Aerith is acting weird and not as she usually does.  
We'll probably learn more about that in Part 3.
It also crossed my mind as well that that could be the case.  What's interesting with the new Black Materia lore is that it doesn't necessarily summon Meteor per say, it works to enact "destruction" per the will of the user. 

The Gi intended to use it to destroy their spirits thus relieving them of their tormented state and Sephiroth needed it to cause a wound so great to the planet it would take the entirety of the Lifestream to heal.

That being said, Sephiroths greatest weaknesses, despite his power, is his obsession with carrying out Jenovas Will and his utter inability to perceive anyone else as a threat. I'd reckon that despite this Sephiroth obviously having knowledge he shouldn't have, he's still trying to get to the same destination through a different road.

I think it would be rather poetic that, despite the ability to actually change his destiny, Sephiroth refuses to actually learn from his experiences and correct his mistakes.
    I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
        I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
            If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
                I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                    I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
The dark whispers are still fascinating to me because it's hard to tell if they're directly under aephiroths control or if sephiroth has potentially manipulated them into trying to enforce an alternate "destiny." Possibly a universe where Sephiroth has already won. Then again, they may just be representing the lifestream that Sephiroth and Jenova have already corrupted.
Maybe Zack is just a marketing strategy, a way to interest Zack fans into buying the game. Have you ever thought about that?

This whole defy fate or multiverse stuffs and the story still ended up the same as the OG. No need to try brain storming this shit cause it is wasted anyway.
    Believe what you want to.
Biggs had a bag of Stamp's Champs with a Pug Stamp on the front. Then he said the reactor is sucking up dirt because the lifestream is bone dry. So what do you mean that isn't what we saw?
    I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
        I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
            >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
                And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                    That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
They drove the LOVELESS stuff pretty hard. They changed the poem for the US localisation, but it remained the same in the Japanese.
>Right, but then you've also greatly moved the definition of what creates these branching paths to be far more watered down and unclear.

&#x200B;

I didn't move the definition. I said both choices and outcomes from the beginning. The very first one starts with Zack's victory. We are told that Terrier Stamp symbolizes that. Then in the span of  10 minutes we see several other Stamp breeds that reflect different outcomes based on his decision. Because the point was to show us how Zack is effecting these worlds. 

&#x200B;

> Now almost anything could be the result of any choice  by anyone out there.

Sephiroth divulged everything at the TofA scene. So that is what it is. There are infinite possible worlds based on what Sephiroth said. But we're not going to explore all of those worlds. We're only exploring the ones that matter and that's the one where Zack, Marlene, and Elmyra are in. 

The point here isn't so much what was shown as it is why it was shown. The message intended for the audience. To visually demonstrate what Sephiroth explained in the previous chapter. How each choice leads to a different outcome, and thus a new universe that is doomed from the start. 

&#x200B;

> Which is clearly a problem if you want this to make sense. Because now you open the doors that ANYTHING could make sense.   
>  
>It just becomes arbitrary at some point in how this mechanic works if you open it up to be that wide in its interpretation. 

 Think back to what we saw in those cutscenes. Several different worlds that are near the end. Now think about what Sephiroth said. "Each of these worlds are bound to the planet as one". Hence, these worlds are dying because the planet is dying. So it's not a situation where Zack can just zip in and out of timelines til he finds the best one. Because they're all doomed. 

 The other question is whether or not this multiverse is something that is supposed to exist, or something that is a result of a corrupted lifestream. While it seems like the latter would be the case, Dirge has some crazy shit that makes you wonder. And the last two chapters of Rebirth were on par with that.
My theory is that timelines were created at the fall of the Cetra empire, maybe as some means to actually pacify Jenova, confusing it or whatever as a last ditch effort to stave off obliteration (this is almost directly referenced in the game, as it is never fully explained why Jenova decided to just take a big ol nap). These timelines have coexisted for millenia, in some status quo of reality always at the edge of complete destruction. These timelines are powered by the lifestream (again for some reason related to pacifying Jenova). Shinra siphoning off mako has weakened the separation of realities, as the lifestream can no longer fully support them all at once. Aerith, as the last Cetra, actually exists as a single soul among all concurrent timelines. It would make sense that if the Cetra created these branches, they can walk across them at will. This is why she is aware of her imminent death after communing fully with her ancient ancestors, that if she dies in one timeline, she will die in all of them, she is a single soul. This would make the strange dead-not-dead Aerith scene make sense. If it isn't some version of this, all hope is lost lol. But this is what I gathered from my playthrough and what is being eluded to. We will see I guess.
Anyone expecting them to just straightforwardly kill her wasn't reading the writing on the wall. I don't think a complicated story is inherently bad. But yeah you can argue execution wasn't great in some ways but "ruined " her death seems pretth strong.  I'm still very interested to see where it goes.
    I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
        I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
        They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
        I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
            Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
    Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
They're sequels? Aren't they reimaginations?
    Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
That's my guess. Sephiroth gained control of the black whispers at the end of Remake and probably took both things away immediately.
The difference is this is trash, and the og wasn't.
    lol nah.
FF7 isn't perfect, but multiverse instantly makes things messy. There's nothing about the original story of 7 that anybody should ever need a visual aid for though.
    They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
        I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
            And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
                Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                    Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
I'm less annoyed by things not being explained yet and more annoyed by not being able to take in the death scene without being completely confused what was real and what wasn't. Made it emotionless for me, which isn't good writing.
IDK I feel like the messiest part of OG 7 was the whole debate on if it was really Sephiroth or Jenova illusions in charge for majority of the game (up until northern crater) -- Which is nothing in comparison to 7Re
    There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
        Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
I excluded it because it's super convoluted haha

>!dream Zanarkand is a real physical location in the middle of the ocean but it only exists while Sin summons it and since Sin makes people have amnesia the outside world can't get there!<

But yea nonetheless, convoluted otherworldly concepts are the basic building block of most FF stories
I like 6 a lot, but my point is more that people have a recency bias with FF where they say "oh wow, square is really getting crazy with this one" when basically every single title is super crazy and that's the DNA of the series. 

I think that much like Remake before it, the deviations in part 3 as a result of this ending will be not too impactful and 95% of the game will be the same story as the original. We are just going to arrive at the conclusion via a slightly different route.
All I'm getting from this is Part 3 will be an amazing 95% faithful game and then the ending will be bombastic / extravagant nonsense.

I actually completely agree with that, but I'm not sure that's the point you were hoping to make.
    I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
they can't help how they feel but i can't relate. i can't dismiss dozens of hours of a game that was full of emotional beats about loss and each character starting to think about what life looks like after death and war, and still ended with them figuring out how to move forward after losing aerith.
>most people in general

Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

>felt great frustration with the rewrites

SOME of the people in that thread. But really, even those are debatable. 
Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking, thanks to the voice acting and imagery (the scene where Dyne imagine returning home, man...). Sure he doesn't kill himself exactly like the original, but he still let himself be gunned down while cursing Barret and telling him to live on, which is pretty dark still. The meaning of said death is still kept as it shows to Barret what could he have become and why he has to keep living on, even despite the feeling of guilt.
Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot (although they do still come back to an extent via sidequests, which are appreciated).
As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

>colossal disaster in the OG

I call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died. Jesse, Biggs and Wedge all died before the plate fell. The only people we saw die was the reporter with his broadcast. And unlike the OG, Remake actually holds on the aftermath a lot more instead of moving on to Aerith 5 minutes later. Plus, the true despair vision of the plate fall happen in Yuffie's PoV of Intergrade, so that is kept too. 

>weird addictions like

Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them? Also you are not allowed to question why Dyne's arm has electromagnetic powers when him and Barret have infinite amount of ammo and Barret can do a massive beam if he wants. Also Nomura didn't write the script. He's just one of 4 writers, with Kitase being reason of most changes. 

Also no shit the storytelling is different in some parts, it's still meant to not be quite the OG story but a new one, basically a sequel/what if. Of course it will have differences.
    > Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.


Its really only the overly defensive people that seem to be happy about this.


>SOME of the people in that thread.

I already clarified it as being the vast majority. That by definition already clarifies that.


>But really, even those are debatable. 

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.
        >only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
            > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
Remake has an 87 on metacritic.

Rebirth has a 93.

Rebirth was received significantly better.

I'm not surprised by this in the slightest by the way. Critics loooove Auteur subversive stuff so they are all aboard the confusing ending train.
Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all. He wanted to die, and was practically begging Barret to just shoot him, and put him out of his misery. Barret wouldn't do it, so he found another way to get it done. He had given up on himself, and was no longer even looking for a reason to go on living. He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred, killing as many Shinra troopers as he could before finally going down, rather than go with Barret to see Marlene again and try to find a place for himself in her life. Dyne's final attack was a suicide. The troopers were just the insturment for his suicide, since he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger on himself. Dyne's death is a cautionary tale to Barret on what could happen to him if he ever lost sight of his reason for living, and gave in fully to his hatred, just as it was in the original. 

Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer, who came after us because we had been unknowingly ruining his day since we first arrived at the Gold Saucer.
    > Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
        He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
            > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
                The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
Good point, the one's you mentioned we are sure of.
Nobody invents a Futon in a spacious living area lol
You’re definitely a spicy meatball then!
I want Sephiroth redeemed because it's clear from Crisis Core and FFVII that he's:

1) Heavily influenced by Jenova

2) Completely misunderstood his birth

3) Unable to ever die properly because of Jenova

Also, we have fought Sephiroth as a final boss *TWICE* already. Would it even be impactful if we just rehashed the same ending as the original and ended up having the events in AC where it just circles back around the Sephiroth trying to do Remake again?

**Or**, would it be better to fight the *real* Jenova and end her influence from the planet completely so Sephiroth can move on and not be stuck for all eternity?
    I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
        If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
            I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
                I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
Believe what you want to.
I mean the rainbow isn’t showing a choice aka split in the timeline. Zack is shown wearing the ribbon on his hand, something the game focuses heavily on. He then makes a choice. If that was a split, he would have the ribbon on in both scenes, because the split happened after. He doesn’t. Meaning it isn’t a split from there.

The world was doomed no matter what choice he made.
    I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
        >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
            And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
                That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
I’m actually glad they’re going with the route that Aerith died but Cloud thinks he saved her, it’s a great example of “end up at the same point but make it more emotional/different in the remake”. I just wish they would have sat on that scene for a bit longer instead of doing a Marvel Avengers team-up at the end lmao.
    I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
    They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
    I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
        Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
Complicated is not the same as confusing. They only needed to make it more clear. I'm not looking for rainbows on the edge of the screen every time the camera changes. Takes your focus off the action. That's ridiculous.
Don’t think so personally. Both Aerith and Sephiroth make it pretty clear they already have knowledge of events that hadn’t yet happened.

Some timey whimey Lifestream stuff going on.
lol nah.
They can be messy but you can make them comprehensible if the writer explain them well enough by the end. Stein's Gate is a great example. That said, to be all fair...a visual aid for some points of FF7 would help a bit. Like take the final battle. Imagine explaining to someone who didn't play the game that "the party after reaching the North Crater, confront Jenova again and after that, reach by floating, Sephiroth and engage in a fight where he turn himself into a monster that looks like the fusion between him and the image of how he remember his mother Jenova as, and after that he bring the party into another heaven like dimension where he appear before them as a giant half naked angel, with wings as legs and one arm for one final battle where among his attacks, he summon equations and bring a meteor to destroy past most planets of the solar system and hit the sun, turning it into a giant red". Now, I know, I know, I'm a bit cheating by using the "Final Fantasy ending style" as example, but still.
    I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
        And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
            Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
                Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
There's also the whole thing with Cloud and Zack memories sheenanigans who to be fair, it's mostly caused by not enough in-depth explanation.
    Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
I don’t disagree or really see that as a horrible thing by this point. FF7 had a pretty ambiguous ending and was always more about the journey itself, so I really don’t mind if they expand the conclusion and tie up the loose ends they’ve set up for this trilogy. In fact, it would be odd if they didn’t
> Aside from Reddit not being most of the fandom in general, there have also been many who are still optimistic or simply interested in how it will conclude. 

No, its but a minor look in. I refer to more than just that. Like the general japanese poor reception. The fact that its being laughed at on twitter and general gaming circles for its nonsense writing.

No? There is nothing debatable about people laughing at poor writing and then wondering if they are happy about the writing and choices made. 


>Dyne's death? It's still very emotional and heartbreaking

Yes. That is an accurate way of putting the original. Sadly most of the tone and impact of that scene is lost here in nonsensical writing. Like Dyne being happy to go get help prior to seeing Cloud, implying that he was actually willing to seek help and not the completely broken man that we then see later on, but then again, thats oddly consistent of the story to be that incoherent, so maybe thats just part of the charm for you.


>Both Dyne and Nanaki's trial just have this small problem that don't linger too much on what happened before moving on the plot

"just this tiny issue of the story moments and their impact being lost and having much of their tone removed in favor of new additions and plot devices!" cool stuff.


>As for Aerith, It's early to say as the scene is clearly meant to be written differently and have Cloud not being able yet to accept reality and it's very likely that the true scale and feels of her death will happen in part 3 when Cloud's mind will have to be fixed.

No, it is not to early to say that the writing for that scene is garbage as it stands and clear to anyone, even if they go back and retcon the shit out of the scene afterwards. Its not some playdough thing that you can just pull around do whatever you want with it. These things are about impact and writing and you can't just "fix" terrible writing by putting some flextape all over it later. Aerith's death was iconic, arguably the most iconic moment in FF history, given just impact of the scene, and no matter how much backtracking or new fluff you throw over that in a 3rd part, won't change that the moment is lost in favor of pushing more multiverse nonsense.


>call false on that. Even in the OG nobody named died.

What are you talking about? You literally witness people around around unsuspecting in sector 7, then looking up as the plate starts falling. They weren't evacuating or escaping. You don't return there later or have all the people that magically inhabited the area still exist and ready to rebuild. They are dead.


>Why WOULDN'T Hojo try attacking them to retrieve them?

Its a weird addition, because we know that attacking them would make the party want to actually deal with Hojo here, which leads to the incredibly satisfying writing of " NO LET HIM GO" and everyone laughing at the party just having to let Hojo go, because unlike in the OG, where he isn't posing as threat and it made sense that he wasn't actually someone worth attacking -- he literally just gone done attacking the party and now you have to make the writers absolutely shit themselves on paper, and let him walk away for ABSOLUTELY no reason other than he needs to be unharmed so the rest of the plot later can happen.


Again, awful writing additions leading to more awful writing necessary to try and explain why the obvious conclusions aren't being met.

Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. Unlike the original where the death and mourn happen shortly after one another, Rebirth is clearly planning to have her death happen now but the mourning part will happen when Cloud will settle with his mind, essentially making her death a core part of Cloud's development and growth in regard to his memories. 

>they are dead

And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.
        > Do not generalize, please.

You seemed perfectly happy to generalize thousands of comments before as not fitting your criteria for having problems with the story, and now you take issue with me pointing out that clearly the only people that tend to have any sort of positive reaction to  this, are exactly people like yourself, that hope that part 3 will fix it, and somehow look past all the lacking impact and tone being lost here and just throw it off as a minor thing.


You don't comprehend just what this means for someone that experiences this story for a first time, in just how much more generic and terrible it comes across, with most of these storybeats either being washed away with new nonsense immediately undercutting the value of the scene, or it being complete incoherent to the point that they have to hope that it makes sense in 4 years when they maybe play the 3rd part.


Its ridiculous.

>True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 
 

If the vast majority react negatively towards it, its pretty safe to say its poor writing.


And when I can spell out easy examples to you, like the Hojo scene and how utterly ridiculous it makes the whole writing, just to fit in new noise, then its no wonder that you just happily skip over the Hojo part right after I showcase how ridiculous it is.


>Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments?


A vast majority isn't necessary to count. Its obvious from everything you see and read. 


>The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. 

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
> Dyne's death wasn't heroic at all.

In what world isn't him jumping on Barret and stopping him from eating the bullets read as a heroic sacrifice?



>He wanted to die,

We can agree on that, he wanted to die in the original  too. The circumstances are very different though.


>He chose to end his life in a final act of hatred

You're grossly skipping over a ton of what is being said in that scene, and talked about right after. Him talking about wanting Barret to live with the guilt, is comparative to his perspective, a way forward in life with Marlene. One he himself could not see -- that is the key thing that they still have in common. 


The problem is that the scene is otherwise changed, to be generic with him diving on top of Barret to take the bullets (Which I guess you read as him having hatred and spite?)

While the original scene is raw and impactful, with him seeing no way out and forcing Barret to make a stand. This rewrite completely robs Barret of a key character defining decision, but it also robs Dyne of a memorable moment, replaced with this generic death that won't be remembered in a month.


>Also, the troopers weren't there at random, they were there with Palmer,

Yeah except you're again ignoring the fact that there is no entrance to that area outside of where the party was waiting, yet somehow that small army goes around the entire party and ambushes everyone? BS.
    He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all, taking down as many soldiers as he can before he finally drops. His only real goal in this moment is putting an end to his own life. As he says, he wants to see his wife again, and knows what he needs to do to make that happen, but he doesn't have the courage to do it himself. So he lets the Shinra troopers do it for him.

He doesn't tell Barret to "carry that weight" as a way of encouraging him. Just before this, Dyne literally accuses Barret of taking Marlene from him. He's full of resentment. From his perspective, telling Barret to live is not an act of heroism, mercy,  forgiveness, or kindness. It's a punishment. He's letting Barret go back to Marlene so that he can remember what he did every time he looks at her. Whenever he sees her face, Barret will be reminded of Dyne, and how his decision to support the reactor's construction ultimately destroyed Dyne's life. Dyne knows this. He's refusing to give Barret the ending to this that he wants, and instead chooses death, forcing Barret to live with the guilt of it all.
        > He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
            The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
I believe the devs have already stated that events won't deviate so much that Advent Children is no longer canon.

In regards to some of your points,

1. Sephiroth has become the new Jenova. He has declared her will his own and works to enact that will. His DNA  has literally hybridized with Jenova. I don't think there's any fixing that.

2. He only misunderstood his birth before he was thrown into the reactor. He learned the truth of Jenova, the Cetra, and the planet from interfacing with the lifestream. 

3. I assume that's meant to be his penance. Much like Saurons ultimate fate of being "tied" to the world but eventually so weakened that they can never again take physical form or have any meaningful effect on Gaia.
    If Remake is canon then AC remains canon because it's clear that Sephiroth has advanced knowledge of his fate from Advent Children.

This would mean that AC technically happens *before* Remake because Sephiroth couldn't have that advanced knowledge unless AC has happened in "the past".

The new lore of the Gi shows why Sephiroth is refused from the Lifestream:

1) His birth is tainted by Jenova because she is alien in nature. He wasn't created the same as other soldiers as her cells were introduced *before* he was formed. It's why he doesn't degrade.

2) The Cetra are seemingly revealed to be a more hateful and intolerant people than previously thought. They seem to actively work to keep the alien out of the Lifestream despite being long dead.

3) Bugrnhagen also points out this parallel between the Gi and Sephiroth for us, the player, by describing Gi Nattak as formless and yet forever angry. They've never been allowed peace, and that's similar to Sephiroth's fate

It seems to me that Square-Enix pointed that out for a reason.

Regardless, though, if Square-Enix isn't going to change Sephiroth's or anyone else's fate then the entire Remake project has been pointless. There would have been no reason to have us defeat destiny if it couldn't be altered for some ultimate end goal.

Oh, and don't say "well sometimes you can't change fate blah blah blah" because if that was the case then Destiny's Harbinger couldn't have lost that battle. Bugenhagen even tells Red *explicitly* that people are the architects of their own future.

So, going with that message and then just being like "just kidding nothing changed in the end" would be the worst ending ever.
        I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
            I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
I think the ribbon is actually there to show the process of choices. 

Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

But with the biggs part, it showed him without it. So in this timeline he either cared most to save biggs ( thus didnt take the ribbon ) or the ribbon was forgotten and thus did not influence him to go to Shinra HQ
    >Isn’t he wearing the ribbon specifically because of his wish to save Aerith? Heck he even looks at it before deciding to go to Shinra HQ first. So the ribbon influenced him to go there.

Going to Shinra is to save Cloud.

And the claim is that he creates a split in time on the bike when he chooses to save Cloud. Hence the rainbow. Which is AFTER he takes the ribbon. So he should have the ribbon on during both because he was wearing it when he made the choice.
        And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
            That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
I'm fine with the 'she died but cloud thinks she didn't' angle. You just shouldn't need to rewatch it to see the rainbows and other effects on the outside of the screen away from the action to tell what's what.
They put themselves into a corner by making her death the ending. I think it should've been the crater. Putting here forced them to make a bombastic finale where there should have been some weight to a character death. Jenova would've been enough if it wasn't the end of the game.
I dont think its that Cloud thinks he saved her since he actually did in one timeline. Notice the rainbow effect when his sword clashes with Sephs
    Yeah I left that comment a couple days ago, and now that I’ve gone back and watched the scene plus some analyses of it I think there’s definitely two timelines now, one where she’s alive and one where she’s dead. Especially since Cloud can see the tear in the sky at the end of the game and no one else can.
I shouldn't need a visual aid distracting me from a pivotal scene with character death in order to understand it. I took more time trying to figure out wtf was going on then to take in the emotions of the story.
    And liks I said, I think the intention is that you're not supposed to grieve _yet_ Of course, it's speculation, but I think it's unfair to judge the scene of Aerith in Rebirth for now until we see how part 3 handle it and see if it was indeed a case of delayed sadness.
        Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
            Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
Can you elaborate on what about that was so convoluted in OG FF7? This is the first time I've heard that part being referred to as confusing / messy. I felt both the flashback and Lifestream sequences not only explained but showed it all pretty clearly?
>only the overly defensive people that seems to be happy about.

Do not generalize, please. There are plenty of people who dislike it, plenty of people who are fine with it, and plenty of people who are just confused and are curious about it. And I've seen all these groups on all social media.  Also vast majority based on what? Did you count every single of the 2000+ comments? Sure, it's probably majority that are on the too confused or dislike, but saying vast majority is hard to say considering the number of people who just speculate or are interested.

>there is nothing debatable about poor writing

True. Problem is, what you mentioned isn't bad writing at all. It's different writing style. And I proved why it's not bad writing. 

>most of the tone and impact is lost

And that is false. The impact and tone of those scene is still kept and gets brought back later. Dyne's death is still emotional and impactful just as much as the original. It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud. He was still deep in hallucinations and Barret was simply carrying him away in hope to help him without asking him. It's just followed by an action scene with Shinra. But thankfully, unlike the OG which just move on with the plot and nothing more, Rebirth actually reconfront it with a good talk of Cloud with Barret about Dyne and Marlene. 

>it's garbage and stands clear to anyone. 

And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way.

>walk away for absolutely no reason

If you used your brain and thought about it for more than a second you'd realize that if they did attack and kill Hojo now, Shinra would send soldiers nonstop to track them down and of course disturb or worse the people at Costa del Sol way more than at Kalm.

No, which is also exactly what the vast majority of people complained about in the thread. I don't care to argue about your delusions of feeling that you had the same experience or not. Most didn't and that is what matters.


>It's not true that Dyne was happy to get help prior to seeing Cloud.

Why are you lying? He literally freaking states that he thought Barret was gonna help him right after getting angry with seeing Cloud? Did you even pay attention? Am I wasting my time trying to argue with someone that didn't even listen to the story they are defending?


>And that is a lie. It would be garbage if it was all that is. But it's clearly not. The scene of Aerith death is simply shown in a different way. 

You can paint that cope any way you want. The reception speaks for itself.


>And so are the people in Remake which we clearly see did not evacuate in time. 

No. Go back and pay some attention to the scene... In fact, I cant be bothered. You've clearly not paid attention to this story and have no clue what you're saying and this is like the 3rd factually false statement you've made just in this comment. I can't be assed with someone just lying the whole time trying to cover up this mess.


Grow up.
> He doesn't fall on Barret to save him from the bullets. By the time Dyne falls on top of Barret, the shooting has already stopped. Dyne pushes Barret aside and puts himself in the line of fire, but that's because he wants nothing more than to end it all


You are right that he didn't stop bullets on top of him, but you're absolutely joking, if you're claiming, that the shot of him pushing Barret aside, then cutting to Barret literally looking at Dyne blocking all the bullets, and then Dyne entrusting the weight of living on to Barret, as some sort of hatred towards Barret, then I cannot take what you're serious at all. Do you also think that just accidentally put triumphant music behind him saying that? That Barret immediately smiled remembering what he wanted him to do?


Like how are you misreading this scene this poorly?
    The music wasn't triumphant. I found it to be pretty somber, which is fitting since a man giving up on life isn't really a heroic moment. It's a tragic one. He literally tells Barret to "carry that guilt" This isn't like when Zack died, where he gave Cloud his blessing and told Cloud to live for the both of them. Dyne wants Barret to feel guilty over what has happened. That desire is stated very plainly. Barret ultimately accepts this because at this point, he feels that carrying the weight of Dyne's resentment is only fair after how badly he messed things up.
I mean, feel free to call me out in 4 years if I'm wrong but I don't believe the plan for Remake was ever to invalidate the OG. 

1) Yes, his cells have perfectly hybridized with that of Jenova. He is effectively the next evolutionary stage of Jenova. It's why he can both keep his individuality but also interface with the Lifestream.

2) Yes, the Cetra are shown to be xenophobic, but in their defense, they are literally stewards of the planet charged with interpreting the will of the planet while cultivating its spiritual energy. It makes sense that the Gi are seen as foreign bodies that may have unknown side effects should they integrate with the Lifestream.

3) Bugenhagen seems to have had a change of heart since meeting him where he and the rest of the planetologists are fairly nihilistic in their belief that the planet's imminent death is upon them. He's also a religious fanatic who firmly believes your party just doesn't understand the planet despite comrades like Aerith and Nanaki having a deeper connection to it than he will ever have.

I think my biggest takeaway from everything that's happened is that changing fate doesn't always lead to better results. If the planet's lifestream exists outside of time, then it stands to reason it facilitates events to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  Aerith dies in order to coax the lifestream to defend against Meteor. Zack dies to trigger clouds awakening. 

I always assumed the Harbringer isn't a literal edict from some divine providence but more akin to a WEAPON in that it was created in order to maintain the timeline the planet had chosen as being the quickest and most efficient way of dealing with Sephiroth and Jenova. It also should be noted that Sephiroth doesn't seem to be omnipresent from the lifestream as he apparently still needed to wait for his variants to fall into the reactor in order to contact them.

If SQE does take the extreme change route, I can only really see it ending with the destruction of Minerva and the will of the lifestream altogether. If the planet's voice and will are destroyed, then it truly does offer freedom to humankind to decide their own fates. However, that choice also means no planetary energy recycling or whispers to ensure self-preservation. People will be responsible for the planet in its entirety.
    I don't think my ideas would invalidate the OG game either because, in my opinion, you still need to play the OG game to really grasp what is happening in the Remake.

To me, the Remake series serves as a *sequel* to the compilation instead of an actual remake. I think that's why the first game was called "Remake" but the second is called "Rebirth." They're not simply remaking the game as some updated graphically superior version. It's a Remake in a truer sense. A redo. A second chance.

Something the characters can do to set something right.
And saving Cloud is necessary to save Aerith like Marlene told him
    That doesn’t change the fact that he’s already got the ribbon on. He puts it on before he leaves.
Even if they try to give it some sort of emotional pay off in part 3, ignoring that I think that's the wrong way to go, this is still a full 70$ game on it's own. It should have it's own emotional pay off. The goal shouldn't be "confuse people so they theorize and talk about it for 3 more years."

It was a marketing stunt. Now how weird and ambiguous this ending and all the different universes factor in was is all people are gonna be talking about until part 3 comes out, and it'll help drive up sales. They sacrificed good storytelling for this. I know it's a part 2 of 3, but Empire Strikes Back, Two Towers, part 2s are allowed to have satisfying endings.
    Saying that the 70 € are just for the ending seems too much. Like let's not ignore the amazing stuff that is in the rest of the game. That said, I have to disagree on your last point. Pass Two Towers, but Empire Strikes Back did end with a big cliffhanger and lots of questions on how it will finish. The only real satisfying part was the cool fight of Luke vs Darth Vader, but aside from that, it's mostly just hype for the third part.
