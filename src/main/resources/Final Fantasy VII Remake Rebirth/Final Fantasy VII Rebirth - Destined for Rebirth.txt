[[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - Destined for Rebirth]]





That music is absolutely ridiculous.

I'M SO FUCKING HYPED HOLY SHIT
    I know, right? The music in the first game was arguably the best thing about it, and the rest of it was amazing! Hoping the music in this is just as good.
        That’s the same version of Those Who Fight from Crab Warden phase 1, Abzu, and the Hojo experiment fight. It’s the best version IMHO
            The version in the trailer is a lot more bassy
                It’s the same. They added an orchestral hit track to accentuate the beats for the purposes of the trailer edit
                ‘Bassy’?
                    Them bass are bitin.
            [deleted]
                It’s the FF7 Remake OST: disc 3 track 6. There’s additional percussion hits added to the downbeats for the trailer mix
        I'm genuinely more excited for the new music than I am for the game, and I'm REALLY fucking excited for the game. Remake's soundtrack is a masterpiece
    One of the reasons why I replayed it again even though I didn’t need to. 

The game needs a music video mode so I can watch gameplay as I listen to its PHENOMENAL soundtrack.
        No lies detected. I listen to JENOVA Quickening and The Valkyrie an unhealthy amount
            Same here. Easily my top two.
            The Airbuster theme is fucking awesome if you need to get pumped for something 🤘
    I got so many chills from this trailer and the music might've played a part in that.
    For real. Slow down, Square-Enix; I can only get *so* hyped!

The video cuts with the rhythm made it that much better. Cool mix, cool video. They've done a great job on all the trailers, really.
    Hopefully they don't slam us with a ton of lifeless new characters and filler now that they have access to so much more of the original game. If they stick closer to the main cast while still continuing this defy fate thing they got I'm all in
    My hype is hyped
That was unbelievably well-crafted. Graphics look unreal.
    Ahhhahaha see what ya did there!
        Give me a high 5!

Actually, give me an unreal high-4
Even if it's just a minute and some material was reused:  
Holy I wasn't prepared for a new trailer out of nowhere
    To be fair, we're less than 50 days away, the marketing is gonna have to ramp up. 


...also holy SHIT, we're less than 50 days away :O
        U MEAN LESS THAN 45 DAYS, EVERY DAY. EVERY MINUTE, MATTERS
            > EVERY MINUTE, MATTERS

I'll remember that
                Good.
        True, I'm just too accustomed to trailers being tied to events, so we pretty much knew of / expected every other trailer in advance.
    Can’t wait for a demo. Remember when they randomly released the Remake demo on March 2nd 2020 💀😭😂🤣 !!
Cloud’s VA is unreal.
    Cody Christian is best Cloud, crazy how we were all against a new VA at first but then he turned out to be the better Cloud lol
        Only people who are terminally online get up in arms about that stuff
            Well really I wasn’t one who was against it, cause I already knew Cody Christian from watching All American so I knew he was gonna kill it. But there were alot of people who didn’t know who he was that were heavily against it until they heard him
            “Terminally online” 💀💀💀 bruuuuh
        Let's not downplay Steve Burton as Cloud but Cody is absolutely killing it.
            Steve Burton for me is just for nostalgia, he’s the Cloud I grew up with and he did a good job yes
But Cody…. Cody is the Cloud we needed!
            Clouds recasting didnt bother me, george newborn not being sephiroth bothered me. Still kinda does but i'll cope
                It's obvious they wanted Tyler Hoechlin to sound very close to George Newborn tho. It's extremely similar.
                    Exactly, why not keep george?
                        Whole number of reasons.

Budget for voice acting, likely better to hire new talent for less instead of paying more for a vet.

Intentionally getting a new cast for story purposes.

Internal conflicts for original cast, scheduling issues, couldn't hire them all back so go with a new cast.

It could be anything.
                            Well i think george said they didnt even ask him
                                Well there ya go.

At the end of the day it's whatever the casting director and dev team want.

It's nice to have returning voice actors but they aren't obligated to bring people back.

However, their decision paid off because most/if not all the new cast kills it entirely.
                                    Kinda funny having two people who where superman playing sephiroth
    Just to tag onto this... 100% YES AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH.

He had kind of a tough role, especially as someone who is unsure about even who the hell he is and "playing it cool" whenever he can, he doesn't have a lot of opportunity for very "showy" moments. But between how he handled Part 1 of his arc, his work in Crisis Core Reunion really capturing a very different 'young Cloud Strife,' and the lines we've heard in Rebirth from the flashback to his mental crisis to this explosive "Tifa" ... he's doing a FANTASTIC job finally bringing all of the dimensions of Cloud to life.
    Cody is Unreal 4, almost unreal 5
That "Tifa" scream, holy shit this game can't come sooner?? I want It now 😭
    Cody Christian is the perfect Cloud
    Also, wasn't that the weapon from a previous trailer, or am I wrong?
        Yeah I’m pretty sure. At least, that’s what was shown when Tifa said “A Weapon?”
            It looks like the bottom half of Bizarro Sephiroth. So it could be a new Weapon or creature of the planet and Bizarro Sephiroth in the original was just Sephiroth fused with this new creature
                My very early prediction is that this is a creature that has some type of relationship with the Weapons (maybe they’re like barnacles that attach themselves to whales for nutrients or something like that, but it’s the reverse where they suck up Mako and deliver it to the Weapons), and Red XIII explains them as having connections to “a Weapon”, prompting Tifa’s question.

Seeing this thing even closer makes me really feel like it’s not literally a Weapon; it just doesn’t look anything like one.
                    Yo, that could be it! Nice prediction 😄
                    That would be a reasonable expansion on the lore of the Weapons, i like it. I hope they dig a lot more into their history and function. Agree I don't think that is a Weapon though.
        It looks like it might be in the destroyed reactor in Gongaga? A replacement for the scene with Scarlet maybe.
            Could be, with all the plants growing everywhere. But how you gonna drop a Weapon in there already..? 

I was thinking Mideel at first, but it doesn't have a reactor, so maybe new area like Rhadora or what is it from First Soldier.
        I think it’s just a monster from Coral “lake” where the dolphin scene happened in the original (think that’s the right name). They might be adding more depth to the weapon lore so they’re not just randomly out of nowhere. I don’t think it’s an actual weapon though.
            The dolphin scene is from open sea (well, a beach actually…but still…)
                Right. Under Junon that was it.

I think it’s a reworking of Bottomswell
                    No, you get to fight Bottomswell in the Junon demo (they changed the English name to Terror of the Deep or something, but in Japanese it's still Bottomswell) and that monster wasn't this. This is a Weapon if the previous trailer is to be believed.
                        Then I have no idea hha
    You and everyone else, my friend.
    Makes me wonder, are there any good compilations of great video game screams out there?  
I know there are several in the Xenoblade series, I thought Yuffie at the end of Intermission was great too, but I can't find any overview of screams in other games.
    Right?! Gave me chills for some reason. Man, I can't wait for this to come out.

        We understand you feel very passionately about your ship and your favourite character, however we get a lot of these posts and it always ends in a disastrous comment section. If you wish to look into more about the Tifa/Aerith ship war, we recommend Twitter or Tumblr. Or you could always try looking at our megathreads to continue your discussion there. Thanks!
        I mean... he could scream just as hard for Aerith when she gets killed, we all know his dialogue. Let's not go there.
            He definitely will. Doesnt take away from this scene.
                And i don't know how you got that idea from my comment. Of course it doesn't take away from the scene, but the guy's original comment was "rip cleriths"  trying to bait ship wars like Cloud doesn't have multiple people he cares about.
            I'm hoping that Sephiroth maintains his crucifixion T-pose throughout as he did in the OG
Damn, Cody Christian can scream
    Dude nailed it. 😭
I’m not emotionally prepared for whatever that scene where Cloud screams for Tifa will entail 😭
    Thinking back to the OG, I really have no clue where or what this moment could be. Looks like something new, and frankly it has me scared :O
        It's probably Tifa getting slashed by Sephiroth at the reactor and they just edited the audio into some unrelated scene, happens a lot with trailers. I cannot possibly think of another moment where Tifa is in danger where Cloud would scream like that on the OG game.
        I think it’s the retelling of the nib reactor just more dramatic since we have a lot better everything nowadays.  Could be wrong though.
            That's kinda my thought too, no idea where else it would come up otherwise. Could just be a new thing though, not like the remake was 1:1 with the OG.
            Yeah i was thinking the same
    Dont worry, she lives.
        I've got curious, 'cause Cloud scream was really worrying. Are you guys talking about the moment Sephiroth burns Nibel?
            Hard to say since it cuts right after to present day Tifa falling from somewhere. And Cloud is in his SOLDIER gear, not infantry gear so.
                It's normal. When Cloud has these flashbacks in Kalm, he sees himself on his SOLDIER gear. But when his mind is put back together, he has the same flashbacks but now with the infantry gear.
                    Yea but he'd be wearing Zack's SOLDIER outfit as we see at the very beginning of the trailer. Not "his" SOLDIER outfit as we see there since he gets that when Zack pulls him out of Hojo's "bacta tank" years after the Nibelheim incident.
                        There is no [difference between their SOLDIER outfits tho?](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/4/41/Zack_brings_Cloud_to_Midgar_from_FFVII_Remake.png/revision/latest?cb=20200502173444)
                            Yes there is. Zack has double shoulder pads (as does Cloud in Nibelheim flashback when he thinks he's Zack). Present day Cloud has single pad with bolts (in the scene where he screams Tifa). You're just proving my point that it doesnt happen in the Nibelheim flashback.
More info dropped here too today: https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-cait-sith-yuffie-preview
    I guess it's pretty much confirmed here Elena's face has been changed. Not sure if it's the angle, but her eye area has definitely changed
        Thats a good thing.
        It still pretty much looks like Tifa to me, which is weird as hell.  


What exactly did they changed?
    Some of this feels a bit spoilery (though nothing super major). Read at your own risk. 
        Doesn’t seem spoilery at all IMO.
Clouds VA is unreal
words cannot describe how hype i am for this game, i was gonna buy p3 remake but i figure by the time this game comes out im still not gonna be done with p3 and will have to put it down

i’ll just buy miles morales instead since its shorter and i can sell it afterwards
Where is the new Tifa scene happening? The reactor at Gongaga?
    Looks like Gongaga, yes.
        The scene?  Gongaga
    Feels like Gongaga is fleshed tf out lol
    Me? Gongaga
        It’s such a backwater name
Midgar Zolom using Beta! 

Looks like the trees are catching fire - how cool is that!
    They have a lot of heavy lifting to do if they want to impress us with Midgar Zolom after they pulled that embarassing OP fight against the god of time and destiny.
For those of you worried about spoilers - I would say this has less spoilers than previous trailers, I watched tentatively and didn’t feel as though I’d seen too much
    Yes I’m actually shocked how un spoilery this has been compared to the past few lol
Tifa is aooo falling into the lifestream and that’s when we get that scene with her and the weapon
I was legit never more excited for a game.
    I literally cry a little bit everytime I think or see something about it
WHY DOES SEPHIROTH LOOK SO RAW?!?!?! HIM WALKING ON THE FIRE, HIM HOLDING JENOVA, HIS STABBING POSE WITH THE WHISPERS ON THE BACKGROUND. HE'S SO GOATED!
In the grand scheme of FF trailers getting increasingly spoilery the closer to launch, where does this sit? I know launch trailer is a must avoid but I was considering forgoing this one and beginning radio silence as of Jan 29th. Anyone regret watching this trailer?
    It's quite safe to watch
        Appreciate it! Thank you.
    Nope. There's only one really "wait this is different" thing related to Tifa and as a longtime OG fan I have no idea how it fits - must be a new addition to the game.
        Thank you for replying. Watched it with no regrets. Definitely more of a “wait…whoa!” reaction from me!
    This one is safe.
        Agreed. Some cool moments shown but nothing too “what?!???”.
[They released some cool ass artwork too :)](https://www.gematsu.com/2024/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-destined-for-rebirth-trailer-caith-sith-elena-captain-titov-and-yuffie-detailed)

February couldn't come sooner
Music gets me so hyped! Can’t wait!!
Not watching these trailers is making me twitchy. I need the demo to release for my sanity. Lol
Did y’all notice Sephiroth Edge of creation battle scene at the end of the trailer? I wonder if that’s from a recap video or perhaps Cloud goes back
    It's new, there's new rocks and the like in the background. Almost like the area is getting formed or something.
        From the looks of it, hope y'all ready for round 2.
        To me it also seems like a new scene, most obviously from Sephiroth's wing and the debris floating around, but if you compare the platform to the EoC at the end of Remake you see that the platform seems to be smaller and "raised" sections are gone, which is probably where the debris is coming from. To me it seems like the EoC is slowly being destroyed, which may be where to "seven seconds till the end" is referring to.
    It was that, for a moment I thought it was AC fight
I'VE SAID THIS SO MANY TIMES BUT MAH BUSTER SWORD JUST BUSTER NUT

Tifa falling into the lifestream but without Cloud seemingly? WHAT IS HAPPENING
Holy fuck i need a distraction until launch 
    FF16 is my distraction rn lol
    I'm currently playing my way through Remake - the Plate's just fallen, and I'm about to head into the Shinra building. If I time it right, I *should* be about done by mid-Feb (adulting sucks so I have limited time), and so minimise my downtime
Guys. How spoilery is this? Is it as bad as the Remake launch Trailer? I have played OG, CC multiple times so I'm in the old man camp
    Don't think it's spoilery at all. I'd say the trailer from TGA was a tad spoilery depending on what you may consider spoilers. But this is mostly stuff you've seen already or know about if you've played OG,CC and Remake
        Ok great. Time to get my popcorn. Thanks
    Depends on what you consider a spoiler.  There are definitely things in this trailer that were not in the original.
    Not spoilery. More of a hype trailer.
    Honestly, I would say there's one small Tifa moment that feels very significant and spoilery. Otherwise it's mostly clips we've already seen or OG stuff that, if you know, you know. 
    Nothing you haven't seen in OG.
    Not spoilery! Not as story/character focused as the last trailer, this one is mostly just hype stuff.
Music is hype
GAAAAAAAAAH!  I can only get so hyped for this game!
CHILLS
Anyone notice at the end, it looks like Sephiroth at the edge of creation, but as part of a fight and not cutscene. Might be getting Sephy round II at the end of this game like some people speculate.
    It is potentially, there's new rock formations
My favorite version of Those Who Fight paired with some wicked editing!
Looks like it's time to finally get a ps5.
Holy HYPE!!!!!  


Also, can't wait for Final Fantasy VII Reclaim on 2027!
    Yesss Reclaim gang rise up!
I HAVE A BONER.
Cloud screaming TIFAAAAAA is literally going to be me everytime she is onscreen when playing rebirth
Fuck I'm gonna have to buy a PlayStation
    It's says "exclusive to at least 05/29" so the exclusivity doesen't seem to be that long this time.
Holy shit I got goosebumps and tears at the same time wtf
Interesting.  I've been super curious about that Tifa in the Lifestream with Weapon scene since they showed it, cause it almost seems like we could be getting the Nibelheim sequence moved up to this part.

I don't know how that fits in this early in the story, but it sort of makes sense with Zack being in the game.  It really feels like we're going to know just how different part 3 has the potential of being once Rebirth hits its conclusion.  That's the most exciting part for me.
    Even if it looks super similiar to the lifestream sequence after Mideel we know from the OG, it could very well be an unrelated event.

In the first trailer that showed Tifa and the Weapon, many people speculated it might be visuals from Bugenhagens loredrop, supported by Red XIII replying to Tifa asking about the Weapon.
        Sure, but that's the only thing specifically from the original where Tifa is in the Lifestream.

Of course it could be something totally different that has no basis in the original game, and it does seem like one of the things they're showcasing there is Weapon itself.  Which is also something that we don't typically get for much later.
            Yeah, it being a new event unrelated to OG was what I was trying to say.

The background when Tifa is falling is most likely Gongaga, but definitely not Mideel. So either the entire Lifestream Memory sequence is moved there, or it's an entirely new sequence.

The former would make some thematic sense with the Gongaga - Zack connection, but I think the latter is much more likely. We know from the trailers Sephiroth is trying to convince Cloud that Tifa died in the Nibelheim incident and that she's an impostor, I feel like Gongaga would be way too early to resolve that Arc.
    I feel like everything is moving at a faster pace storywise...
Im wondering if this was the hint to the key art with Cloud, Zack, Tifa and Aerith. When you put them together, Tifa and Zack are going off on different paths... 
They showed a cut of the sky from it before the Tifa scene too.
        It definitely seems connected to that, yes, and it looks like this is around when they go to Gongaga.  So, another Zack connection.  

There's also the destruction of Midgar that they keep showing in what looks to be "Zack's world."  Here we get more of it from the motorcycle chase at the end of Remake, but it looks like an alternate version of that.
I can't wait for it ❤️
This one seems to be very cinematic, something i already like from Remake. Also, we can be confident a delay won’t happen at this point. 

They delayed Remake on the 14th January 2020, and this time, they confirmed the release date
Damn I didn't expect a trailer today wtf!
Dude the way Cloud yelled TIFAAAA gave me chills.
Weapons appearing in Rebirth?  
How do they handle this, because as far as I remember the weapon appears after Cloud gives the black materia to Sephiroth in the North Crater and is an important part of the story.
Cody putting his all in that TIFAAAAA!!! I know that's right! We got *so freaking lucky* by getting him as our Cloud.



Also Cloud was all of us, because finally, some Tifa content.
this was such a tease 😭😭😭 amazing hype trailer
Can't wait to finally kill Sephiroth for good!
Damn it's only ps5 exclusive til may? They working hard on that pc port this time.
    Remake only had a 3 month exclusivity contract as well but it took longer than that to get ported

edit: my bad my memory is wrong 😭 was 1 year for Remake
        Remake announced 1 year on PS4. This was silently extended a few months for Intermission, which launched with another 6 months of PS4 exclusivity. The month that exclusivity ended it launched exclusively on Epic for another year before finally coming to Steam.

I don’t know if we see 3 month turnaround to release but the past official exclusivity periods were much longer. And the very month it ended it showed up on the platform.
            oops my bad I totally remember it being 3 months lol, thank you
VA's are amazing, that Scream 😭! Don't worry, Tifa will be okay, I believe in her!!
Stealth trailer, jeez!
Now that’s how to make a compelling trailer!
Damn, the way Cloud screamed for Tifa.
Guys... If you listen to it carefully at the very end, you can hear Cloud screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! and it's fucking heartbreaking.

Make of it what you will.
Destined for rebirth. 

Birth, death, rebirth.

Zack and/or Aerith.
GUYS IM AT WORK RIGHT NOW AND PLANNING TO WATCH IT DURING MY BREAK.

DOES IT CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS!?
    no
        Bless your soul fellow citizen.
How spoilery is this?
    Very litte
    Imo not too much. Only a handful of new shots but that’s it
Tifa eaten by big fishy confirmed
My only issue with this trailer is... for people new to the serie-  too much sephiroth. Like, I remember playing it back in 1997 thinking, we are just gonna deal with this madman who think some monster is his mom and put clouds village on fire. And then surely we are gonna go back to Midgar and stop Shinra- right?

But this game has pushed that he can basically summon a meteor and fly and spawn alien monsters and trying to rule the planet etc... its just a bit too much sepiroth, its like almost Shinra itself isnt a threat anymore to the planet, if you are new to the serie.
    Games 25 years old, just about everyone who is remotely into gaming knew who sephiroth was even if they never played OG. And if they didn’t, it’s really not that big of a deal that they know who the main antagonist is.
Anyone else notice >!Bizarro Sephiroth!<?
    Pretty sure that's a Weapon. It was in the Release Date trailer.
        Ah ok. That makes more sense.
    When?

Not long to go. I think this is going to be a great game 😁 don't know if I should replay remake to prepare...
    In the words of The Mighty Senate:

"Dew it"
Did anyone else notice the scene at about 00:23 where there’s green behind Sephiroth and he’s aiming up his sword? Yea those are whispers behind him and that’s the same spot Aerith was in the last trailer. It’s definitely happening.
god I have to finish the first remake game at double speed now
Finally i get to justify the purchase of my ps5 🤣 although Returnal was aso great.
Cloud chooses Tifa, Aerith dead confirmed!
    Of course Aerith will die, we all know this
Emerald Weapon?
    Looks like a new one potentially.  Almost like a proto-Weapon, or baby Weapon.  Something to hint at what's to come.
Not watching but super hyped
Damn, I was kinda hoping for a demo to drop.
    I'm sure one will, it's still a bit early though. January 31st (FF7 Day) at the earliest
Is this spoiler heavy ? (Like the Remake Final Trailer) or should be okay to watch?
    Depends what you deem spoilery. I didn't find it all that spoilery. Most of the stuff has already been seen from previous trailers. There's maybe one or two new scenes, but you can't really tell what's going on.
        Thank you , I’ll give it a watch
Oh hey, it's a game I'll never play as it's not for me anymore I guess. Moving on...
    Ok?
    Why are you going to 8 month old posts just to say you're not playing this anymore? Nobody's forcing you to dude, just move on lol
Do they show a glimpse of AC Sephirot v Cloud? The less Zack the better tbh
No 4k again....
Weird how this “reboot that isn’t actually a remake” goes to all the same exact locations as the OG. Surely there’s a needlessly complex explanation for this.
    Can you imagine the outrage if the remake trilogy did *not* go to most /all major locations
        Not half as bad as if it wasn’t a remake
            Allow me to doubt that. It seems the general reception for the current product is very positive
                Sure, because the current product is a remake. If that were to change, so would the reception
                    Ok I'm not sure I understand what your point is

Are you saying it *is* a remake then?
                        Of course I am. It says so on the box, and they did all the same stuff.
                            Ok but then what are you really saying? Are you expressing your concern over the deviation from the source material ?
                                Not at all. You seem sincere enough, so I will set jokes aside and say it plainly:

I think the details and developments added so far have been excellent, and compelling, but I do not believe they constitute a major deviation from the OG plot. My original comment in this post was made to  lampoon the wrong opinion that the Rebirth plot is about to veer significantly away from the original plot. I think it will continue to be compelling in its development of this classic plot, but, the broad strokes will remain intact and this will always be a remake, and not a reboot or a sequel.
                                    This is exactly how I feel with the direction of the trilogy. Things from OG get expanded on, some new story bits to enhance the main story, but the overall path and plot remain the same.
                                    Oh well I honestly think that's most people's expectation (and even, hope) for the trilogy. But I'm still somewhat ready for a few major twists, just in case I'm not devastated if they happen
I wonder maybe everyone will get some kind of power from these new weapons? It looks like a boss arena fight designed for this. A new weapon. Maybe there are multiple new weapons around the map and every character will open up something with them after fight.. This one shows Tifa is falling to lifestream. Maybe Barret will have his own weapon fight in Corel Prison? I dunno.
All trailers and trailer screenshots from now on until release should be considered spoilers IMHO.   
Square will spoil everything, they did it before.
“Rebirth” like this?

    I'd be for it (what a badly translated video), but the fan rage will be loud.
        Can you imagine fan base if this will turn out true?
            The whole thing comes off as a like a machine translation that doesn't know how English speakers communicate ideas. Every portion of it is like half-done thoughts that don't express full sentences or paragraphs. It seems averse to words like 'the' and 'a' (etc), that helps structure an English sentence.
                Its like make a sense but at the same time like out of context, am I understanding well?
                    For example, I'll rewrite your sentence:

\-Its like it makes some sense, but at that same time its out of context; am I understanding this correctly?

But no, its not the context, but the grammar and style. I got the context with some effort. You're saying things are going multiverse and live service about it.
                        Ahh thanks a ton! Yup grammar hopefully this video wasynt too annoying to watch. Actually i preparing second video that will nearly confirm this multiversal structure that might end up online
Aww shit, let's go!
CRYING
The Highwind! Finally!
Looks like Tifa falls into the livestream at what I'm guessing is Gongaga's ruined reactor.
Cool.

*Inner Voice;* HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIT!! HOLY SHIT!!!
You are truly a model SOLDIER.
As excited as I am for this game, I'm really looking forward to the soundtrack.
who’s the guy with the shotgun who shows up at the beginning of the video on the other side of Sephiroth when Sephiroth walks away?
    Pretty sure it’s a new character. Looks like it might be a sheriff of some kind as you can see a badge.
        Isn't it >!Tifa's dad!< ?
            Nah. He is killed in the reactor and is also far slimmer than the man in the trailer. It’s actually a character that was introduced in the remake novel two pasts most likely. His name is >!Zander!<
I'm so excited! I need it now! Hopefully I will get mine in the mail on release day.
I need it now
You can actually hear the masamune stabbing sound which I bet is not used for the NPC sheriff but certain other character(for those who know).

Go listen to the OG scene, you'll notice it.
This goes hard, and I am hard.

Destined for Rebirth as live service game ;)

I know, right? The music in the first game was arguably the best thing about it, and the rest of it was amazing! Hoping the music in this is just as good.
    That’s the same version of Those Who Fight from Crab Warden phase 1, Abzu, and the Hojo experiment fight. It’s the best version IMHO
        The version in the trailer is a lot more bassy
            It’s the same. They added an orchestral hit track to accentuate the beats for the purposes of the trailer edit
            ‘Bassy’?
                Them bass are bitin.
        [deleted]
            It’s the FF7 Remake OST: disc 3 track 6. There’s additional percussion hits added to the downbeats for the trailer mix
    I'm genuinely more excited for the new music than I am for the game, and I'm REALLY fucking excited for the game. Remake's soundtrack is a masterpiece
One of the reasons why I replayed it again even though I didn’t need to. 

The game needs a music video mode so I can watch gameplay as I listen to its PHENOMENAL soundtrack.
    No lies detected. I listen to JENOVA Quickening and The Valkyrie an unhealthy amount
        Same here. Easily my top two.
        The Airbuster theme is fucking awesome if you need to get pumped for something 🤘
I got so many chills from this trailer and the music might've played a part in that.
For real. Slow down, Square-Enix; I can only get *so* hyped!

The video cuts with the rhythm made it that much better. Cool mix, cool video. They've done a great job on all the trailers, really.
Hopefully they don't slam us with a ton of lifeless new characters and filler now that they have access to so much more of the original game. If they stick closer to the main cast while still continuing this defy fate thing they got I'm all in
My hype is hyped
Ahhhahaha see what ya did there!
    Give me a high 5!

Actually, give me an unreal high-4
To be fair, we're less than 50 days away, the marketing is gonna have to ramp up. 


...also holy SHIT, we're less than 50 days away :O
    U MEAN LESS THAN 45 DAYS, EVERY DAY. EVERY MINUTE, MATTERS
        > EVERY MINUTE, MATTERS

I'll remember that
            Good.
    True, I'm just too accustomed to trailers being tied to events, so we pretty much knew of / expected every other trailer in advance.
Can’t wait for a demo. Remember when they randomly released the Remake demo on March 2nd 2020 💀😭😂🤣 !!
Cody Christian is best Cloud, crazy how we were all against a new VA at first but then he turned out to be the better Cloud lol
    Only people who are terminally online get up in arms about that stuff
        Well really I wasn’t one who was against it, cause I already knew Cody Christian from watching All American so I knew he was gonna kill it. But there were alot of people who didn’t know who he was that were heavily against it until they heard him
        “Terminally online” 💀💀💀 bruuuuh
    Let's not downplay Steve Burton as Cloud but Cody is absolutely killing it.
        Steve Burton for me is just for nostalgia, he’s the Cloud I grew up with and he did a good job yes
But Cody…. Cody is the Cloud we needed!
        Clouds recasting didnt bother me, george newborn not being sephiroth bothered me. Still kinda does but i'll cope
            It's obvious they wanted Tyler Hoechlin to sound very close to George Newborn tho. It's extremely similar.
                Exactly, why not keep george?
                    Whole number of reasons.

Budget for voice acting, likely better to hire new talent for less instead of paying more for a vet.

Intentionally getting a new cast for story purposes.

Internal conflicts for original cast, scheduling issues, couldn't hire them all back so go with a new cast.

It could be anything.
                        Well i think george said they didnt even ask him
                            Well there ya go.

At the end of the day it's whatever the casting director and dev team want.

It's nice to have returning voice actors but they aren't obligated to bring people back.

However, their decision paid off because most/if not all the new cast kills it entirely.
                                Kinda funny having two people who where superman playing sephiroth
Just to tag onto this... 100% YES AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH.

He had kind of a tough role, especially as someone who is unsure about even who the hell he is and "playing it cool" whenever he can, he doesn't have a lot of opportunity for very "showy" moments. But between how he handled Part 1 of his arc, his work in Crisis Core Reunion really capturing a very different 'young Cloud Strife,' and the lines we've heard in Rebirth from the flashback to his mental crisis to this explosive "Tifa" ... he's doing a FANTASTIC job finally bringing all of the dimensions of Cloud to life.
Cody is Unreal 4, almost unreal 5
Cody Christian is the perfect Cloud
Also, wasn't that the weapon from a previous trailer, or am I wrong?
    Yeah I’m pretty sure. At least, that’s what was shown when Tifa said “A Weapon?”
        It looks like the bottom half of Bizarro Sephiroth. So it could be a new Weapon or creature of the planet and Bizarro Sephiroth in the original was just Sephiroth fused with this new creature
            My very early prediction is that this is a creature that has some type of relationship with the Weapons (maybe they’re like barnacles that attach themselves to whales for nutrients or something like that, but it’s the reverse where they suck up Mako and deliver it to the Weapons), and Red XIII explains them as having connections to “a Weapon”, prompting Tifa’s question.

Seeing this thing even closer makes me really feel like it’s not literally a Weapon; it just doesn’t look anything like one.
                Yo, that could be it! Nice prediction 😄
                That would be a reasonable expansion on the lore of the Weapons, i like it. I hope they dig a lot more into their history and function. Agree I don't think that is a Weapon though.
    It looks like it might be in the destroyed reactor in Gongaga? A replacement for the scene with Scarlet maybe.
        Could be, with all the plants growing everywhere. But how you gonna drop a Weapon in there already..? 

I was thinking Mideel at first, but it doesn't have a reactor, so maybe new area like Rhadora or what is it from First Soldier.
    I think it’s just a monster from Coral “lake” where the dolphin scene happened in the original (think that’s the right name). They might be adding more depth to the weapon lore so they’re not just randomly out of nowhere. I don’t think it’s an actual weapon though.
        The dolphin scene is from open sea (well, a beach actually…but still…)
            Right. Under Junon that was it.

I think it’s a reworking of Bottomswell
                No, you get to fight Bottomswell in the Junon demo (they changed the English name to Terror of the Deep or something, but in Japanese it's still Bottomswell) and that monster wasn't this. This is a Weapon if the previous trailer is to be believed.
                    Then I have no idea hha
You and everyone else, my friend.
Makes me wonder, are there any good compilations of great video game screams out there?  
I know there are several in the Xenoblade series, I thought Yuffie at the end of Intermission was great too, but I can't find any overview of screams in other games.
Right?! Gave me chills for some reason. Man, I can't wait for this to come out.
[removed]
    We understand you feel very passionately about your ship and your favourite character, however we get a lot of these posts and it always ends in a disastrous comment section. If you wish to look into more about the Tifa/Aerith ship war, we recommend Twitter or Tumblr. Or you could always try looking at our megathreads to continue your discussion there. Thanks!
    I mean... he could scream just as hard for Aerith when she gets killed, we all know his dialogue. Let's not go there.
        He definitely will. Doesnt take away from this scene.
            And i don't know how you got that idea from my comment. Of course it doesn't take away from the scene, but the guy's original comment was "rip cleriths"  trying to bait ship wars like Cloud doesn't have multiple people he cares about.
        I'm hoping that Sephiroth maintains his crucifixion T-pose throughout as he did in the OG
Dude nailed it. 😭
Thinking back to the OG, I really have no clue where or what this moment could be. Looks like something new, and frankly it has me scared :O
    It's probably Tifa getting slashed by Sephiroth at the reactor and they just edited the audio into some unrelated scene, happens a lot with trailers. I cannot possibly think of another moment where Tifa is in danger where Cloud would scream like that on the OG game.
    I think it’s the retelling of the nib reactor just more dramatic since we have a lot better everything nowadays.  Could be wrong though.
        That's kinda my thought too, no idea where else it would come up otherwise. Could just be a new thing though, not like the remake was 1:1 with the OG.
        Yeah i was thinking the same
Dont worry, she lives.
    I've got curious, 'cause Cloud scream was really worrying. Are you guys talking about the moment Sephiroth burns Nibel?
        Hard to say since it cuts right after to present day Tifa falling from somewhere. And Cloud is in his SOLDIER gear, not infantry gear so.
            It's normal. When Cloud has these flashbacks in Kalm, he sees himself on his SOLDIER gear. But when his mind is put back together, he has the same flashbacks but now with the infantry gear.
                Yea but he'd be wearing Zack's SOLDIER outfit as we see at the very beginning of the trailer. Not "his" SOLDIER outfit as we see there since he gets that when Zack pulls him out of Hojo's "bacta tank" years after the Nibelheim incident.
                    There is no [difference between their SOLDIER outfits tho?](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/4/41/Zack_brings_Cloud_to_Midgar_from_FFVII_Remake.png/revision/latest?cb=20200502173444)
                        Yes there is. Zack has double shoulder pads (as does Cloud in Nibelheim flashback when he thinks he's Zack). Present day Cloud has single pad with bolts (in the scene where he screams Tifa). You're just proving my point that it doesnt happen in the Nibelheim flashback.
I guess it's pretty much confirmed here Elena's face has been changed. Not sure if it's the angle, but her eye area has definitely changed
    Thats a good thing.
    It still pretty much looks like Tifa to me, which is weird as hell.  


What exactly did they changed?
Some of this feels a bit spoilery (though nothing super major). Read at your own risk. 
    Doesn’t seem spoilery at all IMO.
Looks like Gongaga, yes.
    The scene?  Gongaga
Feels like Gongaga is fleshed tf out lol
Me? Gongaga
    It’s such a backwater name
They have a lot of heavy lifting to do if they want to impress us with Midgar Zolom after they pulled that embarassing OP fight against the god of time and destiny.
Yes I’m actually shocked how un spoilery this has been compared to the past few lol
I literally cry a little bit everytime I think or see something about it
It's quite safe to watch
    Appreciate it! Thank you.
Nope. There's only one really "wait this is different" thing related to Tifa and as a longtime OG fan I have no idea how it fits - must be a new addition to the game.
    Thank you for replying. Watched it with no regrets. Definitely more of a “wait…whoa!” reaction from me!
This one is safe.
    Agreed. Some cool moments shown but nothing too “what?!???”.
It's new, there's new rocks and the like in the background. Almost like the area is getting formed or something.
    From the looks of it, hope y'all ready for round 2.
    To me it also seems like a new scene, most obviously from Sephiroth's wing and the debris floating around, but if you compare the platform to the EoC at the end of Remake you see that the platform seems to be smaller and "raised" sections are gone, which is probably where the debris is coming from. To me it seems like the EoC is slowly being destroyed, which may be where to "seven seconds till the end" is referring to.
It was that, for a moment I thought it was AC fight
FF16 is my distraction rn lol
I'm currently playing my way through Remake - the Plate's just fallen, and I'm about to head into the Shinra building. If I time it right, I *should* be about done by mid-Feb (adulting sucks so I have limited time), and so minimise my downtime
Don't think it's spoilery at all. I'd say the trailer from TGA was a tad spoilery depending on what you may consider spoilers. But this is mostly stuff you've seen already or know about if you've played OG,CC and Remake
    Ok great. Time to get my popcorn. Thanks
Depends on what you consider a spoiler.  There are definitely things in this trailer that were not in the original.
Not spoilery. More of a hype trailer.
Honestly, I would say there's one small Tifa moment that feels very significant and spoilery. Otherwise it's mostly clips we've already seen or OG stuff that, if you know, you know. 
Nothing you haven't seen in OG.
Not spoilery! Not as story/character focused as the last trailer, this one is mostly just hype stuff.
It is potentially, there's new rock formations
Yesss Reclaim gang rise up!
It's says "exclusive to at least 05/29" so the exclusivity doesen't seem to be that long this time.
Even if it looks super similiar to the lifestream sequence after Mideel we know from the OG, it could very well be an unrelated event.

In the first trailer that showed Tifa and the Weapon, many people speculated it might be visuals from Bugenhagens loredrop, supported by Red XIII replying to Tifa asking about the Weapon.
    Sure, but that's the only thing specifically from the original where Tifa is in the Lifestream.

Of course it could be something totally different that has no basis in the original game, and it does seem like one of the things they're showcasing there is Weapon itself.  Which is also something that we don't typically get for much later.
        Yeah, it being a new event unrelated to OG was what I was trying to say.

The background when Tifa is falling is most likely Gongaga, but definitely not Mideel. So either the entire Lifestream Memory sequence is moved there, or it's an entirely new sequence.

The former would make some thematic sense with the Gongaga - Zack connection, but I think the latter is much more likely. We know from the trailers Sephiroth is trying to convince Cloud that Tifa died in the Nibelheim incident and that she's an impostor, I feel like Gongaga would be way too early to resolve that Arc.
I feel like everything is moving at a faster pace storywise...
Im wondering if this was the hint to the key art with Cloud, Zack, Tifa and Aerith. When you put them together, Tifa and Zack are going off on different paths... 
They showed a cut of the sky from it before the Tifa scene too.
    It definitely seems connected to that, yes, and it looks like this is around when they go to Gongaga.  So, another Zack connection.  

There's also the destruction of Midgar that they keep showing in what looks to be "Zack's world."  Here we get more of it from the motorcycle chase at the end of Remake, but it looks like an alternate version of that.
Remake only had a 3 month exclusivity contract as well but it took longer than that to get ported

edit: my bad my memory is wrong 😭 was 1 year for Remake
    Remake announced 1 year on PS4. This was silently extended a few months for Intermission, which launched with another 6 months of PS4 exclusivity. The month that exclusivity ended it launched exclusively on Epic for another year before finally coming to Steam.

I don’t know if we see 3 month turnaround to release but the past official exclusivity periods were much longer. And the very month it ended it showed up on the platform.
        oops my bad I totally remember it being 3 months lol, thank you
no
    Bless your soul fellow citizen.
Very litte
Imo not too much. Only a handful of new shots but that’s it
Games 25 years old, just about everyone who is remotely into gaming knew who sephiroth was even if they never played OG. And if they didn’t, it’s really not that big of a deal that they know who the main antagonist is.
Pretty sure that's a Weapon. It was in the Release Date trailer.
    Ah ok. That makes more sense.
When?
In the words of The Mighty Senate:

"Dew it"
Of course Aerith will die, we all know this
Looks like a new one potentially.  Almost like a proto-Weapon, or baby Weapon.  Something to hint at what's to come.
I'm sure one will, it's still a bit early though. January 31st (FF7 Day) at the earliest
Depends what you deem spoilery. I didn't find it all that spoilery. Most of the stuff has already been seen from previous trailers. There's maybe one or two new scenes, but you can't really tell what's going on.
    Thank you , I’ll give it a watch
Ok?
Why are you going to 8 month old posts just to say you're not playing this anymore? Nobody's forcing you to dude, just move on lol
Can you imagine the outrage if the remake trilogy did *not* go to most /all major locations
    Not half as bad as if it wasn’t a remake
        Allow me to doubt that. It seems the general reception for the current product is very positive
            Sure, because the current product is a remake. If that were to change, so would the reception
                Ok I'm not sure I understand what your point is

Are you saying it *is* a remake then?
                    Of course I am. It says so on the box, and they did all the same stuff.
                        Ok but then what are you really saying? Are you expressing your concern over the deviation from the source material ?
                            Not at all. You seem sincere enough, so I will set jokes aside and say it plainly:

I think the details and developments added so far have been excellent, and compelling, but I do not believe they constitute a major deviation from the OG plot. My original comment in this post was made to  lampoon the wrong opinion that the Rebirth plot is about to veer significantly away from the original plot. I think it will continue to be compelling in its development of this classic plot, but, the broad strokes will remain intact and this will always be a remake, and not a reboot or a sequel.
                                This is exactly how I feel with the direction of the trilogy. Things from OG get expanded on, some new story bits to enhance the main story, but the overall path and plot remain the same.
                                Oh well I honestly think that's most people's expectation (and even, hope) for the trilogy. But I'm still somewhat ready for a few major twists, just in case I'm not devastated if they happen

I think it’s a reworking of Bottomswell
            No, you get to fight Bottomswell in the Junon demo (they changed the English name to Terror of the Deep or something, but in Japanese it's still Bottomswell) and that monster wasn't this. This is a Weapon if the previous trailer is to be believed.
                Then I have no idea hha
We understand you feel very passionately about your ship and your favourite character, however we get a lot of these posts and it always ends in a disastrous comment section. If you wish to look into more about the Tifa/Aerith ship war, we recommend Twitter or Tumblr. Or you could always try looking at our megathreads to continue your discussion there. Thanks!
I mean... he could scream just as hard for Aerith when she gets killed, we all know his dialogue. Let's not go there.
    He definitely will. Doesnt take away from this scene.
        And i don't know how you got that idea from my comment. Of course it doesn't take away from the scene, but the guy's original comment was "rip cleriths"  trying to bait ship wars like Cloud doesn't have multiple people he cares about.
    I'm hoping that Sephiroth maintains his crucifixion T-pose throughout as he did in the OG
It's probably Tifa getting slashed by Sephiroth at the reactor and they just edited the audio into some unrelated scene, happens a lot with trailers. I cannot possibly think of another moment where Tifa is in danger where Cloud would scream like that on the OG game.
I think it’s the retelling of the nib reactor just more dramatic since we have a lot better everything nowadays.  Could be wrong though.
    That's kinda my thought too, no idea where else it would come up otherwise. Could just be a new thing though, not like the remake was 1:1 with the OG.
    Yeah i was thinking the same
I've got curious, 'cause Cloud scream was really worrying. Are you guys talking about the moment Sephiroth burns Nibel?
    Hard to say since it cuts right after to present day Tifa falling from somewhere. And Cloud is in his SOLDIER gear, not infantry gear so.
        It's normal. When Cloud has these flashbacks in Kalm, he sees himself on his SOLDIER gear. But when his mind is put back together, he has the same flashbacks but now with the infantry gear.
            Yea but he'd be wearing Zack's SOLDIER outfit as we see at the very beginning of the trailer. Not "his" SOLDIER outfit as we see there since he gets that when Zack pulls him out of Hojo's "bacta tank" years after the Nibelheim incident.
                There is no [difference between their SOLDIER outfits tho?](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/4/41/Zack_brings_Cloud_to_Midgar_from_FFVII_Remake.png/revision/latest?cb=20200502173444)
                    Yes there is. Zack has double shoulder pads (as does Cloud in Nibelheim flashback when he thinks he's Zack). Present day Cloud has single pad with bolts (in the scene where he screams Tifa). You're just proving my point that it doesnt happen in the Nibelheim flashback.
Thats a good thing.
It still pretty much looks like Tifa to me, which is weird as hell.  


What exactly did they changed?
Doesn’t seem spoilery at all IMO.
The scene?  Gongaga
It’s such a backwater name
Appreciate it! Thank you.
Thank you for replying. Watched it with no regrets. Definitely more of a “wait…whoa!” reaction from me!
Agreed. Some cool moments shown but nothing too “what?!???”.
From the looks of it, hope y'all ready for round 2.
To me it also seems like a new scene, most obviously from Sephiroth's wing and the debris floating around, but if you compare the platform to the EoC at the end of Remake you see that the platform seems to be smaller and "raised" sections are gone, which is probably where the debris is coming from. To me it seems like the EoC is slowly being destroyed, which may be where to "seven seconds till the end" is referring to.
Ok great. Time to get my popcorn. Thanks
Sure, but that's the only thing specifically from the original where Tifa is in the Lifestream.

Of course it could be something totally different that has no basis in the original game, and it does seem like one of the things they're showcasing there is Weapon itself.  Which is also something that we don't typically get for much later.
    Yeah, it being a new event unrelated to OG was what I was trying to say.

The background when Tifa is falling is most likely Gongaga, but definitely not Mideel. So either the entire Lifestream Memory sequence is moved there, or it's an entirely new sequence.

The former would make some thematic sense with the Gongaga - Zack connection, but I think the latter is much more likely. We know from the trailers Sephiroth is trying to convince Cloud that Tifa died in the Nibelheim incident and that she's an impostor, I feel like Gongaga would be way too early to resolve that Arc.
It definitely seems connected to that, yes, and it looks like this is around when they go to Gongaga.  So, another Zack connection.  

There's also the destruction of Midgar that they keep showing in what looks to be "Zack's world."  Here we get more of it from the motorcycle chase at the end of Remake, but it looks like an alternate version of that.
Remake announced 1 year on PS4. This was silently extended a few months for Intermission, which launched with another 6 months of PS4 exclusivity. The month that exclusivity ended it launched exclusively on Epic for another year before finally coming to Steam.

I don’t know if we see 3 month turnaround to release but the past official exclusivity periods were much longer. And the very month it ended it showed up on the platform.
    oops my bad I totally remember it being 3 months lol, thank you
Bless your soul fellow citizen.
Ah ok. That makes more sense.
Thank you , I’ll give it a watch
Not half as bad as if it wasn’t a remake
    Allow me to doubt that. It seems the general reception for the current product is very positive
        Sure, because the current product is a remake. If that were to change, so would the reception
            Ok I'm not sure I understand what your point is

Are you saying it *is* a remake then?
                Of course I am. It says so on the box, and they did all the same stuff.
                    Ok but then what are you really saying? Are you expressing your concern over the deviation from the source material ?
                        Not at all. You seem sincere enough, so I will set jokes aside and say it plainly:

I think the details and developments added so far have been excellent, and compelling, but I do not believe they constitute a major deviation from the OG plot. My original comment in this post was made to  lampoon the wrong opinion that the Rebirth plot is about to veer significantly away from the original plot. I think it will continue to be compelling in its development of this classic plot, but, the broad strokes will remain intact and this will always be a remake, and not a reboot or a sequel.
                            This is exactly how I feel with the direction of the trilogy. Things from OG get expanded on, some new story bits to enhance the main story, but the overall path and plot remain the same.
                            Oh well I honestly think that's most people's expectation (and even, hope) for the trilogy. But I'm still somewhat ready for a few major twists, just in case I'm not devastated if they happen
Can you imagine fan base if this will turn out true?
    The whole thing comes off as a like a machine translation that doesn't know how English speakers communicate ideas. Every portion of it is like half-done thoughts that don't express full sentences or paragraphs. It seems averse to words like 'the' and 'a' (etc), that helps structure an English sentence.
        Its like make a sense but at the same time like out of context, am I understanding well?
            For example, I'll rewrite your sentence:

\-Its like it makes some sense, but at that same time its out of context; am I understanding this correctly?

But no, its not the context, but the grammar and style. I got the context with some effort. You're saying things are going multiverse and live service about it.
                Ahh thanks a ton! Yup grammar hopefully this video wasynt too annoying to watch. Actually i preparing second video that will nearly confirm this multiversal structure that might end up online
Isn't it >!Tifa's dad!< ?
    Nah. He is killed in the reactor and is also far slimmer than the man in the trailer. It’s actually a character that was introduced in the remake novel two pasts most likely. His name is >!Zander!<
The version in the trailer is a lot more bassy
    It’s the same. They added an orchestral hit track to accentuate the beats for the purposes of the trailer edit
    ‘Bassy’?
        Them bass are bitin.
[deleted]
    It’s the FF7 Remake OST: disc 3 track 6. There’s additional percussion hits added to the downbeats for the trailer mix
Same here. Easily my top two.
The Airbuster theme is fucking awesome if you need to get pumped for something 🤘
> EVERY MINUTE, MATTERS

I'll remember that
    Good.
Well really I wasn’t one who was against it, cause I already knew Cody Christian from watching All American so I knew he was gonna kill it. But there were alot of people who didn’t know who he was that were heavily against it until they heard him
“Terminally online” 💀💀💀 bruuuuh
Steve Burton for me is just for nostalgia, he’s the Cloud I grew up with and he did a good job yes
But Cody…. Cody is the Cloud we needed!
Clouds recasting didnt bother me, george newborn not being sephiroth bothered me. Still kinda does but i'll cope
    It's obvious they wanted Tyler Hoechlin to sound very close to George Newborn tho. It's extremely similar.
        Exactly, why not keep george?
            Whole number of reasons.

Budget for voice acting, likely better to hire new talent for less instead of paying more for a vet.

Intentionally getting a new cast for story purposes.

Internal conflicts for original cast, scheduling issues, couldn't hire them all back so go with a new cast.

It could be anything.
                Well i think george said they didnt even ask him
                    Well there ya go.

At the end of the day it's whatever the casting director and dev team want.

It's nice to have returning voice actors but they aren't obligated to bring people back.

However, their decision paid off because most/if not all the new cast kills it entirely.
                        Kinda funny having two people who where superman playing sephiroth
It looks like the bottom half of Bizarro Sephiroth. So it could be a new Weapon or creature of the planet and Bizarro Sephiroth in the original was just Sephiroth fused with this new creature
    My very early prediction is that this is a creature that has some type of relationship with the Weapons (maybe they’re like barnacles that attach themselves to whales for nutrients or something like that, but it’s the reverse where they suck up Mako and deliver it to the Weapons), and Red XIII explains them as having connections to “a Weapon”, prompting Tifa’s question.

Seeing this thing even closer makes me really feel like it’s not literally a Weapon; it just doesn’t look anything like one.
        Yo, that could be it! Nice prediction 😄
        That would be a reasonable expansion on the lore of the Weapons, i like it. I hope they dig a lot more into their history and function. Agree I don't think that is a Weapon though.
Could be, with all the plants growing everywhere. But how you gonna drop a Weapon in there already..? 

I was thinking Mideel at first, but it doesn't have a reactor, so maybe new area like Rhadora or what is it from First Soldier.
The dolphin scene is from open sea (well, a beach actually…but still…)
    Right. Under Junon that was it.

I think it’s a reworking of Bottomswell

My original comment in this post was made to  lampoon the wrong opinion that the Rebirth plot is about to veer significantly away from the original plot. I think it will continue to be compelling in its development of this classic plot, but, the broad strokes will remain intact and this will always be a remake, and not a reboot or a sequel.
        This is exactly how I feel with the direction of the trilogy. Things from OG get expanded on, some new story bits to enhance the main story, but the overall path and plot remain the same.
        Oh well I honestly think that's most people's expectation (and even, hope) for the trilogy. But I'm still somewhat ready for a few major twists, just in case I'm not devastated if they happen
Well there ya go.

At the end of the day it's whatever the casting director and dev team want.

It's nice to have returning voice actors but they aren't obligated to bring people back.

However, their decision paid off because most/if not all the new cast kills it entirely.
    Kinda funny having two people who where superman playing sephiroth
