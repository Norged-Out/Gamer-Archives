[[Oh my god, I am so bad at Rebirth]]


I absolutely loved 7 Remake and don’t recall being god awful at that game, but holy shit I am atrocious at rebirth. I died 3 times to the water monster, constantly getting party members trapped in water prison or grabbed. 

Ive forgotten everything about this combat system 😭😭😭 

Anyone else suck?




They've upped the complexity of combat with new abilities, synergy skills and abilities, and these new enemy types with more varied ways of pressuring them. Junon Demo is a little ways into the game so you're basically being tossed into the deep end, don't be too hard on yourself. In the full game the difficulty curve should be a lot smoother and you'll have time to get the hang of things.
    Yeah, I keep trying to tell myself that. I'm intimately familiar with Remake's combat, and feel that I could pick it up and play any time. Yet, playing Rebirth last night, I was getting stomped at every turn. I found the enemy AI much, much more aggressive than I remember, and I was simply unable to build up enough ATB through basic attacks to stay afloat. It was embarrassing.
        I'm in exactly the same boat, I've been playing through Remake Hard Mode to prepare for Remake and have been absolutely destroying, but I had a few game overs myself in the Junon demo. I think another thing to keep in mind is the addition of perfect guards to try and keep damage low. I've never been too good at timing them but it may well make the difference in whether I have to use a potion/cure with my ATB or if I can set up some more damage/pressure. 

Once we have a game's length of experience with Rebirth's combat under our belts, I bet we'll have the same feeling of understanding and expertise that we have with Remake's.
            maybe we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image properly but thats just me.
                There is a materia that gives you a bigger perfect block window if you're struggling with it
                    I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.
                        It would have made Sephiroth a cake walk in episode 1
                            Tbh Cloud’s punisher stance block counters made Sephiroth quite easy in the first game too.
                                It didn't on Hard mode 😭
                    im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
                        lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.
                            I can flex just fine. Its not my problem you couldn't actually comprehend what i was struggling with despite me spelling it out twice. Where did i say i struggle to find the perfect block window? and even my prior comment i clearly said ''im struggling to see, not block'' It is making my job harder because instead of %100 focusing on the battle i have to %50 focus on the image and then %50 focus on the battle. 

Lobotomy hitting hard i see if you cant even comprehend that. In my original comment also i said ''we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image'' meaning my issue is not doing perfect guards but the fact that image being blurry makes it harder than it should be and you're like just practice bro ? practice for what ? blurry IQ and shitty camera angles ?  this is such a stupid argument. 

And the advice was ''just make your experience game journalist difficulty by using materia bro'' when i can see the image, i can perfect block just fine but not every instance is the same, some sections of the game are affected less by the blur than others which causes inconsistency.

 Such an easy concept to understand but half the thread is too busy bootlicking. And what does your last sentence have to do with anything?  Did i say somewhere that i wanna beat the game without playing it or something ? thats like saying well you wouldn't be alive without breathing air. No shit sherlock thanks.
                                Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
                                    Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better. 

Do you think Shroud would perform the same way as he does if he was playing with 480p at 45 fps ? No, he wouldn't. Is it his aim thats worse? Does he need to practice more? No, he needs proper vision to see and read his target on the screen. Case and point. Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
                        You're right. It's the game that's wrong, not you.
                            Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
                yeah,why we didn't see every move enemy telegraphed by red text? how I supposed to block this focusing on one monster moves meanwhile second monster can hit you off screen...
            I just finished replaying Remake, and having just finished FFXVI before it, I found myself missing the dodge and parry mechanics from XVI; Remake's combat felt simplistic by comparison.

But I got into the rhythm again and that feeling disappeared after just a couple chapters.

And then I tried the Junon demo, and...

Be careful what you wish for, people. That's all I'm saying.
        The lack of ATB guage is fucking insane. 

Combined with the insane levels of instant aggro on whichever character is being controlled and I have to say I just hate the fucking combat in this game. 

Oh and you never have enough gold for any items, the transmuter is a fucking shit system to make up for it, and the lack of MP means that any remotely hard battle is insanely costly. 

Fuck this shitshow.
            Rebirth has an ATB gauge, the transmuted is a great addition as it keeps you from having to spend Gil, and every character also has mp. And I have a surplus of gold. So....
            Everything you just said is wrong its almost impressive lol i have way too much money for everything, transmuter is sick especially when you get chips and levels, the combat system is way better and more complex now and sooo fun, you can also just use an aggro ability to pull aggro to your tank and mp is fine? Just use items or drain to get mp back. Not a problem at all. Idt ive ever ran out of mp once.
            lol I have so much money I can’t spend it all. Not sure what you’re talking about. Const is great. Aggro is a bit strong I agree
            Honestly, I blame all the couch potato no life whiners who have no job, no life, and said that Remake was either ‘too easy’ or ‘not hard enough’. Remake was fine difficulty-wise. Here, it’s hard, because they added new things. Artificial difficulty spike, I’m guessing.
                I got better at it as time went on, but Aerith still absolutely sucks to play. 

Insane aggro + fucking forever and a half to build up even one bar of ATB. Ugh.
            It's not that bad, you gotta strategise a bit more to beat your enemies. There are some fights that are really painful without a ranged fighter. Some fights benefit from heavy hitters, some require magic. It's just about figuring it out. You can't pick your favourite team and roll with them through the whole game because it'll punish you pretty hard.
            Do you mean the demo? Or the game? Bc the game I literally can’t spend my gold up lol
    I'm all for it tbh. It's been a minute since I've felt this challenged on normal mode. Makes me think of how to set up material more and different party setups to beat specific enemy scenarios. I find myself switching from character to character often. I also didn't realize how cool Aeriths ward is that boosts her auto attack. Red XIII also seems pretty nuts once you get him going.
        Ward Shift and Radiant Ward have cemented Aerith as probably my favourite playable character for Rebirth. That's not even getting into how fleeting familiar is now part of her basic attack kit instead of needing ATB. 

With Remake, encounters were usually built around the party you would have at that part of the story. Now we're getting the opposite, where you'll put together a team that's a sort of counter pick to the boss.
            Aerith feels like a black mage from ff14 and im loving it, I missed my ley lines
        Coming into this comment a little bit late to the party because I'm playing the game soooooo slowly (I'm on chapter 8....) but you made a really good point about the different materia setups and different party setups.  I've now got a rule that if I die to the same boss/mechanic/section twice in a row, I need to sit down and start making adjustments.  The party setup isn't optimal, or I'm not taking advantage of materia, or there was some gimmick I missed.  Corel Prison example:  >!with the lil baby cactuars that stole my gysal greens, I realized I just needed to block with Cloud to build up limit break and murder them, because if I actually tried to attack them directly I'd die the first time they went 3,000 needles on me.!<
    Honestly, the complexity is way too much. Red XIII has like some sort of secondary attack mode and a bunch of alternate attacks? But his basic attacks don’t hit as easily. And I beat all the fights on the first try.

My other complaint is that non-range party members don’t close distance on their targets with normal attack like they used to, and I don’t know how to aerial attack.

Something about the combat is weird. Remake just felt more…responsive?
        Reds as easy as going into sentinel stance, block to build vengeance while letting go of block and pressing square to counter, and then using siphon fang (think that’s what it’s called). He’s actually easier than people think.

As for non range party members, you can turn cloud into a ranged two ways.

1: dodge twice then press attack to throw out constant blade beams.

2: have Barret in party and do Cloud/Barret synergy which can be spammed. Barret literally shoots at cloud and Cloud deflects the bullets to the enemy.
            You only have to press dodge once to use Cloud's blade beams just FYI. Also Red does the same synergy skill as Cloud/Barrett, except it's magic.
                Noted. Yeah tried it out today after learning you can also hold square to launch into the air.
            Also if you hold Cloud's attack after a dodge instead of just attacking he'll dash up to the enemy and do air combos.
            Also it seems like Tifa/Barrett synergy skills launch tifa into the air, which could be helpful for aerials.
            Dodge then hold square for aerial attacks with cloud
        So Red XIII's basic attacks have little reach, but if you hold square to do his spin attack you can move him around with the left stick and send him straight towards the enemies. Vengeance Mode charges up from him guarding attacks, and he has a counter that you have to do manually by dropping guard and hitting square right after he blocks a hit. Changing into Vengeance Mode is its own attack, and it soups up his regular attacks as well as letting him do a move that heals him with triangle. Like all the characters, playing him well is all about knowing what he can do and getting experience doing.

Aerial combat for melee characters isn't automatic anymore, Cloud needs to attack right after dodging to start an aerial combo, and you need to use Tifa's Synergy Skills to launch her at enemies in the air, or use Reverse Gale to bring them down to the ground.
            It’s too much. Look at what you just wrote. How am I supposed to keep track of all that. Remake combat was perfect, I never found there was something I couldn’t do with a character. Yuffie kept it interesting with some new mechanics in Intergrade. But this is way too complex.
                Relax. Junon is a few chapters into the game. We'll get the hang of it as we play from the start.
                It’s only 4 button presses he wrote about for Red XIII, not exactly war and peace.
                Even the original FF7 was too much when you got all the characters, it's one of those games where I didn't use all the characters.

The confusion comes from the fact that there are now more than 4 characters. It gets a bit more complex with 6 characters, and in part 3 we will have Cid and Vincent too.
                    So I got to play the Chadley missions and realized it flows well. There is a bit too much still — the extra synergy attacks are easy to forget about it, for instance, but overall it’s solid. I recant my complaint, actually.
                Just take it slowly. Replay the tutorial until you get the gist.
                Git Gud

Or just spam spells for stagger and pure damage tbh 

Or there’s always easy mode
                Sometimes describing something with words is more complicated than just doing it.  Just takes a bit of practice.

There are bound to be simpler characters and more complex characters.  I doubt there will be many points of the game where Red is mandatory.  Cosmo Canyon, probably, but not too much more than that.

A player who struggles with aerial combat can just use Barret and Aerith anytime they come up, or even for nearly the entire game if they like, and they'll be fine.
        I really hope they just crammed in a bunch of extra stuff from later in the game for the demo, and that the real game takes much longer to build up to that level of complexity.
            I saw multiple "first 4 hours preview" and that is 100% the case. You don't even have ANY synergy abilities and barely any synergy skills. You have to get them through the skill tree, so it should be a very balanced learning curve.
            Most likely. Remember that most of the abilities and materia you can use in the demo (espevially the sinergies attacks) won't be available from the start
            Nope.
                Hahah! Well, sort of, I mean there's 15+ hours of game you can do before you actually get to that point, and the difficulty is much lower in the actual game. And then there's the battle sim training and monster hunts which are good for practicing. Plus, they removed a bunch of the extra content they'd crammed into that small space for the demo, so overall I'm pretty happy with the final product. Even though I still feel the combat still has a bit too much going on. At least they got rid of the weapon upgrade sphere grid thing, or you could say changed it into the synergy vending machine, which I like a little better since it doesn't change when you change your equipment.
            I think that's likely,  as they did the same thing with the FF16 demo.
        Yep. Just block. Like the tutorials say. Go to chadley. And play them. They explain everything.
            Well kindaaaaaa


It’s a lot of trial and error.  And the tutorials just tell you what to do but if you kill the enemies with out even doing the teachable mechanic it goes on to the next tutorial.
                All I’m saying is. I just held block and pressed square and triangle and built up synergy and destroyed everything in my path. I actually have been feel v like this game is easier than remake. 

…no one is more shocked than myself about this.
        If you lock on targets the misses aren’t as much of an issue imo
        No one closes on targets because the characters move at about half the speed they should.

Flying enemies just wreck your party because 3 of the characters are useless, one is so fucking slow, and the last just sucks to play. 

I feel like combat was 1000 times better in Remake. Rebirth is just awful.
        Stop crying, I'm happy that they make the game more complex instead of dumbing it down for people like you
        Hamaguchi is tinkering with Nomura's perfection
            This is a group project.
        Ariel with Cloud, dodge then hold attack button.
        You're likely just overwhelmed by being thrown too much at once in a relatively more difficult part of the game. Aerial attacking is a mile better than the first game.
    Yea, and look at your parties health, limited material and slots. It seems like we are well hampered. I’ve got to believe I’d have a couple 2 star HP-UPs by then. I’m going to bail on the serpent and go do combat unilateral to learn everyone’s fighting and hang it up until the release. 
The first part of the demo was awesome, the second was a cool area to show me how they take on open world, but I’m not about to grind the demo
    Also it's possible that in the full version once you get to that point your party might be better prepared with higher stats and stuff. My guess is that if one doesn't rush the main path then it's not so hard, aside of player skill of course.
    I'd say I also feel a but underleveled in Junon demo.

IIRC, SE said we'd start at average level that people left Midgar at. Thing is, I am just replaying the Remake and am already over 30, despite I haven't even reached Shin'ra HQ yet. Just finished *In search of hope* chapter. And can't say I didn't any level grinding either.
        That doesn't really make sense to me, do you have a source? It'd be weird to start at like, level 40.

Apparently i will be L21. Which is a bit low, but then number does seem rather cosmetic anyway.
    Yeah the combat in Rebirth is definitely more complex and challenging than Remake and will most likely take me some time to get used to. But, in terms of the difficulty curve, I read from multiple review sources that the game has quite a few extreme difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere.
Use Thundara linked with level up to get Thundaga. Give it to Aerith and use it on an Arcane Ward to double cast. Makes the boss very easy
    🙏🏾🙏🏾
    Where did you find the level up materia
        Not sure if it's obtainable in the wild but pretty sure it's a Chadley reward
            Think the vending machine at chocobo farm had one
        Through chadley he also has a bunch of other useful materia to buy or win including a Phoenix summon.
            I missed the Phoenix summon, guess I’m gonna have to start the whole demo over again lol

Edit: I found the thing
                Just reload the demo save point that's what I did. I missed one golden plume the first playthrough myself in addition to the summon so.
                    I ended up just replaying it and turns out that’s what I was missing the first time too lol. Haven’t taken down Phoenix to get the summon yet, fought em a few times on the hardest setting and just kinda gave up for a little break
                        You have to focus on the other monsters the Phoenix creates they protect him with their links, I used magic A LOT on them to make it easier by hitting them with their weaknesses. I wish comet didn't cost so much it would be helpful for aoe damage. Algic aura enemy skill from remake would help too
                            Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
                            Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
                                I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.
    For some reason my game won't let me change Aerith into the fighting line... I suppose it's because I initiated the cutscenes before that boss before I tried. Now it's locked to cloud, barrett and red for this fight. I can't find any way to back out and make changes. It just forces me
        [deleted]
            Does defeating that boss end the demo? I wasn't sure and kinda accidentally stumbled into the marker where a cutscene took over. Didn't exactly mean to as I had other wtuff still out in the open area I wanted to do
                [deleted]
                    damn ok guess I'm restarting

I knew that the demo didn't have any actual story quests (why would it?) so I assumed that blue marker was gonna be just a bit of dialogue to introduce us to the area further, not take us away from it, lol. Didn't think it would actually take me onto the main story in a demo...
                        This demo just focuses on combat and exploration

    You’re the man.
The demo throws a whole mess of new mechanics and characters at you that it’s feels very overwhelming when you start the Junon demo. 

I found going and doing chadleys battle simulator really helped to understand the new stuff and then returning to exploring I had a much easier time as I’d gotten used to the changes they’ve made. It doesn’t help that all the battles in the Junon area were genuinely challenging anyway on top of the new stuff. Enemies are more aggressive and have more unique abilities. .

Having totally completed the battle simulator I’m glad to say I think the changes and additions they’ve made are universally good. The synergy attacks are great; it encourages you to use all the characters in battle to get those little blue pips filled so you can unleash synergy on a stagger. I love how you have different level limit breaks based on what synergy you use aswell. It’s so much deeper than Remake.

The full game is obviously going to slowly roll out all the mechanics so it won’t be an issue.

Still, Full power Phoenix was no joke. Felt like hard mode already. Loved it. Took me 4 attempts and a lot of materia load out switching.
    This X100. I was a bit overwhelmed at first. did the battle sims and it helped a lot.
    I am pretty sure Phoenix was supposed to be hard mode, it even hinted at it on the text pre-fight
        Yeah, summons now have a full power fight you can do immediately upon entering the zone associated with them, which is insanely hard and a big challenge. By doing the side content in the area you gradually lower their difficulty, so they become a reward for doing everything.

Max Dood talked about it from his experience playing the Kalm area.
            I spent 2 hours yesterday on Phoenix and I still haven't been able to beat him. I left it at a pixel but my Tifa only had a pixel as well and I guess Phoenix was a quicker draw than me when we picked our attacks.

But it has been very fun and it shows the depth of the system, since you can be very strategic about it, not only with the items but also strategy in game, positioning, etc.
    Wait the limit levels change based on synergy moves? Im so lost haha
        There's an effect on some synergy abilities that raise the limit level for the characters. If you do one of those then use Limit you can choose from Lv 1 and Lv 2.
            Damn thats so wild, they really made the combat super intricate
                Yeah you get the second Remake limit breaks like “Ascension” for cloud, or “catastrophe” for Barret, as a level 2 limit breaks in rebirth. 

Certain Synergy attacks give the level 2 to the characters that that perform the move. You get a little yellow pip next to the limit bar to indicate you’ve got it.
                Yup. Best moment of the game so far for me was doing the cloud/aerith synergy into ascension and planetary protection. Granted... the Aerith Limit 2 wasn't necessary since Ascension killed the boss. BUT... it's the cool factor that counts.
    Great take, nailed it.
I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed lol especially by the synergy mechanics. I’d been playing bits of Remake waiting for this demo to drop.. but I’ve been playing my new game+ data on hard mode. So I have beefy, maxed-out characters, knowledge of all the monster encounters.. and I’m super conditioned to keep my healing to a minimum haha.

So reworking my strategic brain to make healing more prominent, but also have significantly less character strength has definitely been an adjustment.
    Dude same. I have been playing my handmade game so long I forgot items were even a thing.
    I am also very much in this club, just finished hard mode run on main story and DLC.  Going to take some time to get used to the expansion of all the mechanics, but they've clearly been very thoughtful with how the game is balanced with all the new things being introduced.  The items almost seem OP with the Mist stuff and how easy it is to craft, but there seems to be more difficulty elsewhere as a result.  Very excited to play it from the start so it ramps us up to the point of the demo.
I feel like they changed the aggro system too. In Remake, you could bounce around enemies a lot since they tended to focus on the one you were controlling.. but I swear in this demo, they kind of stick to certain characters for longer, especially Aerith.
    No literally. Every enemy stays targeting her and her ai is just as dumb as it was in Remake. Like girl, why are you leaving the wards I’m summoning for you?? Why are you getting up close and personal?? 😭
        Aerith said she got hands for they asses 😂
        sounds like it may be a xenoblade 1 melia situation, where she’s shit for brains level bad when controlled by AI but the best character in the game when controlled by the player
        What are you talking about? Aerith AI in demo always try to stay on the ward if there's one. She will only get off it when enemies move too far away from her as she will chase after them, or when those Elphadunk or something pull her to them with their ability.

Aggro in this game kinda work as it support to, character who deal most damage will be targeted, so the character you control won't be the aggro magnet anymore. Of course that gonna lead to another problems because range character trend to deal a lot of damage so they will aggro enemies very often.
        Lol so it wasn't just me then? I swear they hateeee her so much 😆
        Lol. Aerith said she wants all the smoke.
        Oh Jesus I hated that in the remake, especially in the freaking Haunted House fight, where she kept running up to the house and getting killed by melee attacks.
    You can use body guard synergy to block for Aerith….

Or if not the Eledunks will trample her :)
    Aerith: "They target the strongest prey!"
    Yeah ikr?! When I was doing that tonadu intel he Just kept focusing aerith and getting stun locked like jesus christ
The only thing that really bothers me is feeling like I'm losing control of my character constantly. I'm positive I could be better at dodging things, but it's like every time I try to cast a spell or charge a minor synergy skill something hits me and interrupts my cast.
    Thank you! A perfect description of how I feel. I feel like the combat is really floaty and like I'm just jumping around without much control
    Not being able to dodge out of blocking really hurts the feel of mobility in combat, though I’d guess once we get used to it, it will be fine.
I felt overwhelmed starting with no context with 5 different characters with unique gimmicks, fully loaded with different skills, materias, limits, synergy attacks...
    This. 

I love what this game looks and sounds like, and I’ll plug away at the demo to discover some stuff, but it’s too much all at once.
    Its fucking awesome though holy shit!!!!
I think they made the enemies more aggressive in this game
    I think it's because they throw you into the mix.  I decided to try and get platinums on FF7:R and Intermission so I *recently* played those and I struggled with the first enemies in the demo.  I assume when the actual game comes out people can ease into the new mechanics.
        A little maybe but every review says the game is way harder than remake.
    I've noticed the same thing. Some of them never seem to stop attacking, it's the opposite of 16.
i’m just coming off playing FF16 after Remake and reunion and i’m all over the place with controls 🥲
    Ff7 remake and FF16 was much easier. This one has much more complex combat
Some things I've learned that I like so far. 

-Aerith's Radiant Ward

-Cloud's Firebolt

-The dual element materials

-Buff and Debuff spells

-Press the touchpad when blocking

-Use Assess

-Set parties (I have a close combat, magic heavy and long range parties) you can switch between by pressing X before a battle.
    Did you put the dual element materia on Elemental?  I was wondering how it would work, and the answer seems to be: whichever way benefits the player.  That was pretty cool.
I feel like the devs were so insulted by the reputation JRPGs have for being "easy" that they made this game to punish us
    I knew from the fact that there are 6 characters that the game would be complex. And part 3 even more so with Vincent and Cid.
        Part 3 is gonna be insane
Lightning magic frees from the bubbles which, just like the OG. Combat is amazing though, much faster paced than remake and waaaay more tools to utilise. It’ll take a minute to learn how to pressure/stagger/dps effectively but it feels super satisfying.
    Aerith's regular attacks kept saying weakness damage Everytime I hit the bubbles
        Do you have elemental+thunder materia on her weapon?  You can hear the characters saying that magic will burst the bubbles quicker during the fight
            Just magic in general works on the bubbles I think.
            Ah mustve missed it when they said it, thanks. I also missed the Phoenix summon and the last chocobo stop first time around.
    I used aeriths regular attacks on the bubble to conserve mp for the monster

The game gave everyone shit mp points, so you need to use a cushion between each battle it felt like
    Any magic will pop the bubble in one hit, even on normal difficulty. Your characters will even say to use magic if you hit the bubbles with regular attacks.
Don’t sleep on assess! In this game, it gives consistent advice on how to pressure your opponents. It didnt do this as much in remake, and there are some very different and more varied pressure triggers than the last game.

We are also playing this demo with zero access to the folio and weapon enhancement systems, which will provide us with a lot more abilities, stats and other nice bonuses.

Also, bravery/faith as well as deprotect/Deshell are your friend. You will do a lot more damage with these. Protect/Debrave and Debrave/Defaith are also very solid. 

This game gives you more buffs and debuffs to deal a ton more damage or take way less. They presumably anticipate you using those. Support builds are gonna be pretty big in this game, especially compared to remake.
It took like 45 minutes but I've got the hang of it now. I think it's partially because they give you so many moves at the same time that you don't know what the flow should be until you play a bit 
    The word "flow" is exactly right. Remake had a definite flow that we all grew accustomed to. Rebirth clearly has a different flow, and I'm sure combat will far exceed Remake once we find that flow.
I havent yet tried terror of the deep, but most my combats have someone dying or nearly, I guess I have to get used to all the mechanics, but I am getting the hang of it, specially the synergy abilities
    Aga spells are still broken
        Even more broken!  They have a 100% hit rate now.  Charging 2 ATB for them is reasonable, though, I think.
            Wait for real? Im not sure if it needed 100% accuracy
            Oh does Blizzaga stick to the enemy like Aero now? I think Blizzard/Blizzara still stay in place.
It blew my mind when I went to the waters edge and actually started swimming! There's even a tiny rock you can swim to for resources and a chest!

And you can ride chocobos in the water!
    wait wut? u didn't go right into combat?

U CAN SPLORE?!
        I mean, it was only surprising because there was no swimming in the og. And of course, I went right into combat, lol. Can't really tell if you're being sardonic or not.
            no. i didn't realize u could swim either. i booted up just to see if i could get to the tiny island suuure enough i got there. thanks for the tip!!
                My bad 😆. I'm so used to snark on social media I just got defensive.
terror of the deep wrecked me a dozen times before I switched to Easy mode

The first half the fight when it's in the air I felt like I couldn't do anything but get locked down by bubbles and tail grabs
    I had to switch to Easy mode as well. I feel like I was losing a lot more HP when getting hit than in Remake, so either they made Normal mode a lot harder or the characters are way under-leveled in this part of the demo. I kept dying even in the open world research missions.
Yeah I can’t beat Terror of the Deep. I gave up after like five attempts. I have no idea why I suck this bad. 

Edit: I beat him. Finally figured out how to do aerial combos properly with Cloud.
I've only been getting into small to mid-sized fights until I fully get the hang of the combat. I can see that this is Remake on steroids, why with the faster pace, new moves and synergy attacks.
I didn’t think the games battle system could get better than Remake, but this game shows it did.

Loving this games variety in battle scenarios.
I'm glad we're all on the same page lmao, I just scraped through Remake and am really hyped for Rebirth (mostly for the story) and the Junon demo humbled me
Omg I’m glad it’s not just me 😂 

I really found this Junon demo tricky. Makes me excited to “get gud” when I have the full game though.
>Anyone else suck?

Yeah me, but that’s part of the fun in getting back into it. I wasn’t even great at remake and definitely wasn’t expecting to be an expert at the beginning of rebirth but am super excited for the new features, characters and customizable combat that it comes with.

We’ll get it eventually my friend
Yeah, the combat in Rebirth quite complex. It almost feels like Tekken, with 50+ moves at my disposal. I'm not complaining though, I much prefer this over an oversimplified combat system like FF16! I definitely felt overwhelmed at first becuase it has been years since I played Remake. But after a while you get used to it.
    FF16's combat isn't "oversimplified", it's streamlined. It's actually responsive and representative of player mechanical skill and input. It baffles me that people think these remakes spamming you with infinite menu-based skill options is good design compared to FF16.
        When you put it that way though all FF16 is, is button mashing and cycling the same abilities. I love both games, with their respective combat systems, both being complex in their own ways. 

Just because there are menus for ability usage, doesn’t make it bad. They do things this way because you can control several different characters, all with their own play styles. FF16 you play as 1 character. That’s it. The two games aren’t even comparable in my opinion other than they share names and lore.
            Only if you're average:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ)
            The thing about FF16's combat though is you CAN button mash, but it's not necessary. Just like DMC games, the combat is as shallow or deep as you're willing to make it. When I play DMC5 Bloody Palace, of course I could spam Vergil's AOE moves or Dante's Dr. Faust broken ass attacks. But, I don't HAVE to...I can instead go for crazily creative combos and emphasize style. Same with FF16; you can invent creative, extreme combos using pinpoint precise timing and inputs.

The problem I have with FF7R is it really doesn't allow for this level of creativity. Every enemy has a meta tactic that's almost hard enforced. You can't easily play around the "correct" approach to any particular encounter.
                Ah, I do get what you mean actually. It really just comes down to preference. You make some valid arguments though.
                They're two different games. FF16 = DMC. FF7R = Closer to classic JRPG
        Maybe if you are a DMC buff but for the average player the combat got pretty samey. Most people never had a reason to use something like charge magic or burning blade in their playthrough.
        You can literally go through the whole game doing the same thing. True, if you want to want to optimize your damage **for no reason at all** you can do that and it becomes more challenging, but I wouldn't call that good design by any stretch of imagination. I play a fair amount of fighting games, so I'm no stranger to action combat and frame-perfect inputs. But these games make you think and give you a reason to mixup your attacks and adapt your high level strategy based on the fight and matchups. FF16 does none of those. It's stupidly trivial, unless you want to make up your own personal challenges that the game doesn't reward.

It's too early for me to judge Rebirth's combat. Maybe it's not that deep either, or maybe it's too confusing and convoluted, I don't know yet. But it can't be worse than the boring combat of FF16.
            You can get through remake by mashing square. Player expression is up to...the player. FF16 has more in depth combat mechanics than FF7 but where ff7 shines is the multiple characters 
                I'd like to see you going through Remake on Normal difficulty mashing square and not using skills.
                    You can mash square and potion dump your way through any fight. And by skills you mean crappy menu "gameplay" and using the ATB you get from simply running around lmao. There is a reason they nerfed ATB gaining from running in rebirth because it was a shit way to compensate for the grounded combat. Fortunately they improved upon that in rebirth. To even use skills like a real game with peak combat you have to hot key them and you can only use 4. You lost all credibility because the way you are complaining about 16 combat is EXACTLY how you can play remake. Mash square ATB charge use a braindead skill. In 16 mash square eikon recharge use them
                        But you literally can’t. I’d like to see you beat Hell House with just mashing the attack button lmao.
                            ...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
                                Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
                        You can just spam stinger and holy waters in DMC and beat the game, but that doesn’t mean the game lacks depth. Refusing to engage with the mechanics just because it’s possible and then claiming the games design is bad is really not a strong argument.
                            Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
                Clives eikon moves felt the same to me overall so while there was more “depth” it felt very shallow to me peesonally
        Wrong sub. XVI is not fun.
            Fanboy alert.
        FF16 is a perfectly engineered game, not just combat but also world, story, etc. It wasn't overly ambitious. It's exactly the kind of game CBU3 does. The only downside is they scaled the difficulty too low.
        They think micromanaging and menu-diving for every attack is the same thing as complexity.
            Yeah the menu managing is ass. I try to stay away from the menu as much as possible with the shortcuts 
                I wish i was that good haha sometimes i hit the menu just for the slow down so i can plot what abilities i should use next. Gives it a strategic feel too
                    It really just muscle memory. I kept messing up in the demo because I usually have braver set to L1 triangle but in the demo its square. It becomes automatic lol
                        You can change the battle settings
                        You know you can change that lol
I suck at everything that flies.

I used Barret as my main and got him second try
    I hate fighting flying enemies.
        At least now they clearly indicate which skills will hit a flying enemy.
        Omg they were frustrating, they kept flying into me and moving the characters around the map

Its hard to believe they went from a masterpiece with remake's battle system and took a dump on it with the overcomplexity of rebirth

I hope the game is better with regards to mp and magic power (using cura only healed 4-600, what kind of shit is that???)
    Cloud is now a completely ranged character too, and can spam attack after a dodge or hold attack after a dodge to leap into the air for aerial combos. Tifa's synergies put her into aerial mode too. Only thing I can't stand is that Divekick doesn't seem to work in the air. You can still Whirling Uppercut into it to skip the animation but if you're actually in an airborne state, it doesn't work. She needs to land first.
I replayed remake pretty recently but them purple elphadunk things nearly wiped me, used pretty much all my meds on that fight, the battles are a huge step up in difficulty but at the same time they are so much fun. Fighting random mobs left me wanting more to kill, Red is an absolute monster, his attacks hit like a truck in vengeance mode, aeriths ability to set up a ward and instantly zip to it it’s pretty incredible too. 

Using your ATB abilities to build synergy levels up and unleashing them at the right time absolutely decimates enemies, once I figured how it worked to a degree, switching between characters regularly to keep on top of ATB building etc the battles got easier to the point I hardly struggled on the final boss. Actually found it way easier than them daft elephant things.
I'm stuck with remote play for the next two months so I'm probably going to have to hold off.  I tried the junon demo for a bit today and while it looks fine, the input lag is enough that I probably won't be able to deal with bosses and timing based mini games.
    There being an input lag actually sort of explains the weird floaty feeling .
Yeah I spent about 40mins in the combat sim doing missions solo with each character to get familiar with them. Still got a lot to learn on the synergy side of things it’s gonna be a rough ride for sure. I’m not the biggest fan of the higher focus on blocking. Using cloud and red in a team felt like just block counter play or parrying rather then attacking.
Unless you're a speed runner who hasn't put down their controller in 4 years--or you're a casual gamer who very recently replayed Remake from start to finish--you are probably rusty. Very rusty. Don't worry about it. Most of us are in the same boat. We'll just have to relearn the old battle mechanics once again, plus all the new stuff. As another commenter pointed out, Rebirth will most assuredly acclimate us to said mechanics. We already see evidence of that in the Nibelheim flashback portion of the demo.
The Bottomswell has bodied me several times. I'm still trying to figure this combat out. 😵‍💫
Same. I Platinum'd Remake twice (on release then the PS5 version) then played the demo of Rebirth and I sucked at it. I'll just wait for the full game on Thursday and maybe I just need a refresher.
I'mma be really honest....the ATB gauge combined with an action combat style is a terrible idea and is still as confused as ever. Nothing like having to ask permission to use your own damn items or be able to do anything, but Daddy ATB Gauge says "No...you must fill me first." Yeah, but that means running around with my thumb up my ass....but oh okay...so the MP gauge wasn't enough for you.

Kingdom Hearts REALLY shouldn't do anything better than this game and yet, here we are. XVI proved that you really don't need the ATB either. It's a relic of the past. And it should stay in the past. In a turn-based game.
I’m glad I’m not the only one. It feels different from Remake somehow.
The hunts and bosses do feel like more of a challenge in this game.  With Remake, I could usually just treat most of the bosses as I would trash mobs, and just jump straight in on Easy/Normal mode.

I think once you get used to some of the newer battle mechanics you'll be fine.  The game feels like it's trying to get you to utilise every aspect of the new additions like Synergies to your advantage.
It's not that much more complicated than remake, just  a few more tools to learn how to use. Played the demo for a few hours and managed to beat full powered Phoenix after a couple of attempts. Just takes a bit of time to get used to the new additions to the system.
Yeah it was mega over whelming tbh.
Am I the only one who thinks the Ai is just really stupid? Their ATB even barely fills if you don’t switch around or use those synergy attacks. It feels like I have to babysit them all the time. They seem to be attacking but it seems like the bar fills much much slower for npc attacks. Makes it kinda hard filling those bars for the synergy skills. 
    Pretty sure it was like that in part 1 too though ?
    Yes, it sucks. I use classic mode in addition to this and it just feels like I am being punished and potentially blocked from progressing in the game because of it.
    My guess is that the nerfed passive atb gain to balance for synergy attacks
Are the AI teammates still so fking braindead in the sequel
    It seems like it is still pretty much the same. They don't really build ATB on their own, and from what I saw they were not good at defending or dodging on their own. Unfortunately the enemy AI also still knows exactly which character you are controlling and they will all focus on you 9 times out of 10 and if you switch they seem to switch to you again faster than before.
    You’re not meant to rely on the AI!  You’re supposed to switch between them frequently, none of them should be your main character.  It’s one of the best parts of the game imo.
        Yea I'm forced to, cuz they can't even hold their own lol
        That kind of sucks though, because the optimal way to play involves switching characters the moment you use a skill/spell, so you don't even get to see the resulting animation.
i died once to that boss but it took me so long to beat it.. at least melee fighters now have a way to hit long range via sync skills and not having to rely on blocking and running around. i did die to that bird, and the 2 wind birds and the elephants too.. lolol
I can’t remember the name of the materia, parry maybe? But it let you block and do a much quicker dodge. That doesn’t seem to exist this time around
Attack the bubble dawg.
Bro, I'm in on easy mode cause I couldn't figure out wtf I was doing, still can't. ATB is trash for the members you're not controlling. There's gotta be a way in later game to get faster ATB charge.... right??
I feel bad for changing the difficulty to easy but the game is just a bit too challenging for me. I always play games on normal, This one is just so complex that I just couldn't get the hang of it. Still love the game though, I think if was a traditional turned based RPG, then I would probably have an easier time.
M8, the combat sucks, its not just you. Its possible to become good at it, sure. But it is a terrible system
it's not even about being good at the game, the combat itself just sucks. again. thankfully everything else other than the music application is amazing. (as in the music is good, but outside a few boss fights is just forgettable, nothing of impact to set the mood)
I feel old because im playing on normal difficulty and im on chapter 10 and still didnt beat a summon yet...game is a bit hard
Ill probably get downvoted 

Honestly, this game was more frustrating than fun

Everyone has shit magic stats and shit mp, the battle mechanics got too crazy and whenever I fought a bird monster they would fly into me and move me across the map.


I really hope the game is better than that shit show
I sucked so bad at remake that I couldn't finish it in hard mode :( literally wanted to plat the game and I cant get past the fight prior to the seph final fight.
    Are you using a fully leveled elemental materia paired with lightning on your armor?  That fight gets way easier if you let the thunder dude stay alive and heal you with his spells.
        Had no idea about the elementals being able to heal you! Tbh i mashed hard tru hard mode and didn't put a lot of thought into it. Also
Idk if its that way but my dmg was LOW.
    Yeah with hard mode I had to do my homework and watch youtube videos of how to best play your characters

Watching blitz videos helped alot
        I mashed my way through! But the guardians of destiny ..... i had no chance :( i ended up giving up on the plat.

I asked for some tips in a couple of communities and received responses like, HAHA hard mode was easy af 🤦🏻‍♂️🥲
            Well, you need to use the weapons with reprieve, basically and I had everyone with maxed revive and each character with a specific function, I also used elemental on my armor so the guardians healed my characters with their magic
                Dammnnn, i tried a few made up strats but honestly they were really fucking me up 😂
                    for the 3 sentinels I was too destroyed in seconds but BUILD tifa for atb fast regenerate and spam her move star shower,she carried me trough this bullshit
                        Ill try that out before rebirth comes out. Also ill be playing the dlc to get back into things
It fucking sucks. Combat is tedious unless you're a fucking master. 

Not hard, just incredibly tedious. 

Minigames are an impossible to avoid slog. 

World is 90% running around from boring side mission to boring side mission.


Just a fucking craptacular game. At this point I'm about ready to just beeline the main story then put this piece of shit down for forever. Massive let down.
    I'm really glad I played the demo before falling for hype.  The combat was annoying and all it did was make me angry.
You’re not alone lol. I’m getting my ass whooped at the 2 elephant-liked monster challenge, and that’s coming from someone who platinum Intergrade. The new combat mechanics isn’t making things simpler.
    If you're talking about the one near the beginning yeah I hate it cause it feels like it's impossible to beat in time unless I never switch off cloud and am only in punisher mode for the block counter
        Exactly. The flying bird (not sure what name it is) at the open field is pretty annoying too.
            Idk how to pressure it
                I’m on my second run of the Junon demo, and boy does Assess really help lol. Try assessing all the enemies during combat, and if you fail, just re-try the challenge again. I’m still figuring out how the synergy abilities work during combat
                    Yeah it says dodge a specific attack but idk which attack that is. is it cacophony?
                        Can’t remember the name of the attack, but it’s the one where the bird is gonna charge towards you. You’d have to dodge that one to get him pressured.
Everything felt pretty much the same to me but I also faught every single battle I could including getting the phoenix summon and whipped the water monster on the first try. Maybe takes a little bit of leveling
Yeah. I didn’t die to the final bosses at the end of Remake. I did game over to the Terror of the Deep. Maybe Terror of the Deep is the true threat to the Planet
they should have added an auto combo/battle option. so you can press button and win, and enjoy the story. What a BIG fail on Square Enix. This is why FFXVI is already better.
It's challenging, I'll admit. But I also need a little bit of time to get re-acclimated to the system. 

Like, I can beat Hell House and Weiss, but I'm gonna fumble alot if I've been away for awhile. Which I have.
Their insistence on committing to this in-between with the real time action and atb gauge in order to semi-appease turn-based sycophants while remaining somewhat contemporary is not really working tbh. It was ok, not great in remake, but it's overstuffed here. The block and dodge mechanics are subpar in comparison to other games. Coming off Granblue Fantasy Relink, FF16, God of War and some Lies of P to this and it feels like playing something that's trying to ape those kinds of games, but implemented way worse. 

My favorite part of the combat challenges was fighting with the camera and the (apparently industry-mandated at this point) awkward targeting system half the time. Camera is also pulled out so much on bigger enemies/larger groups that it's hard to tell what's happening.

The party AI also doesn't seem very smart, like the fact that they don't even attempt to dodge the very easy-to-dodge Water Cell in the demo unless you're controlling them feels like your own teammates griefing you and leads to so much wasted time and ATB.
I have a hard time believing that struggling with the game's combat means we "suck", but maybe I'm biased because of my time spent playing games like DMC which reward direct player input vs memorizing meta loadouts. The problem with these games is they rely on extreme over-complexity when it comes to managing your materia, party composition, and using the menu to select your skills. The game should have just been turn based. It's hard for me to embrace the strategic elements of the combat system when the game clearly presents itself and its controls as an action game, which it then makes abundantly clear that it's actually not. It's a turn based/strategy RPG masquerading as an action game. All of the precise button inputs and timing I mastered in FF16 or DMC are completely and utterly wasted here, and the game just wants me to spend all my time min maxing gear loadouts or using "synergy" attacks and whatnot. 

Can't imagine it actually being worth the time to learn all this crap.
The combat against flying enemies was the worst part about the first remake and this whole demo focuses on it. I didn't even finish. Pretty disappointed.
    The tutorial for cloud goes through how to initiate air attacks which may help you out here.
        How do I air attack with Tifa? I could do air attacks just fine with Cloud, but doing the same thing (dodge and then hold square) on Tifa just makes her do an uppercut for some reason.
            I believe she has a synergy with Barrett which throws her into the air. I’ve not played around with her much yet myself.
So you're telling me thats it's actually not for babies like Remake and that it has some challenge to it? Noice 
In Remake, you can still dodge or change to punisher mode while holding block. But in Rebirth if you do these, you will use the Synergy Skill instead. This messes up my movement the most, but I'll adapt, the game is super fun.
I did some sim battles in remake to get back into the groove. There have been heaps of times now that I’ve used Ward Shift when I wasn’t meant to. Definitely need to get into a new groove
Give everyone thunder or the thunder you get from combat simulator that's already level 2 or thunder and wind (the new combo materia) and use Ramuh for summon that does weakness damage or Phoenix also isn't a bad choice because it's ultimate heals the party and also deals damage with fire. I would use the level boost materia on comet or better yet on healing materia. Magnify on thunder would also be useful. Use fire bolt with cloud too. Use aerith for healing wind limit breaks. Tifa for stagger bonus or Red for DPS. Whenever you get held it's mouth switch to another character and spam thunder at it to break the hold hopefully.
Also cloud has the ranged attack with operator mode and his punish.mode attacks seem faster also
Take cloud, barret, and Aerith.  Give everyone lightning and cast wards as Aerith as others said.  I controlled Barret most of the fight until staggered then switched to cloud.  Throw in the synergy materia on someone 

I think just don't forget to access and you can always restart from before the fight if you don't have the ideal characters or builds.   I started with Tifa, Red 13, and Cloud and I am not sure I could've beat the fight that way (of it would've taken forever).
I'm stuck on that challenge where you can't let those birds go airborne. It's pretty tough!
I feel you. I just played Remake for the first time so I beat the water monster first try but when I started playing Remake I was god awful at the game since I hadn’t played it before. 

Seriously considered turning the difficulty down. I’m glad I didn’t.
Some of the move animations from your own characters feel too fast. So fast I can't even perceive what is being done but I see the damage numbers. Example, Red's Limit break. I know he dashes 3 times, but do I actually see him dash? Not really. I just see a red blur.
Boss fucked me up. I switched to aerith and Barrett and just range attacked the worm to death because I didn’t have thunder equipped
Its also worth noting that a lot of the enemies in the second part of the demo are special fights intended to be harder.
I've been enjoying the combat and playing around with the limited materia.

Synergy+comet has been fun.
Trying going from Crisis Core Reunion on switch to FFR on ps5.    I ALWAYS FUCK UP FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES CAUSE THE BUTTON CONFIGURATION LOL.
You're not alone. But they did add more complexity.
I’m glad I’m not the only one lol. Cloud and Co are getting punched in the face quite a bit more than I would like.
comet + synergy materia = discount meteorain being passively spammed while you fight
Just hold R1 and use the short cuts for the team attacks. You will eventually work up enough points to actually USE the synergy attacks. Much to my surprise, because I wasn’t great at remake, I didn’t die once on normal and beat the demo rather quickly. But I also meticulously went through all of the tutorials that they have available from Chadley
The new mechanics take some getting used to. Also if your like me your used to playing remake on hard mode and you’ve forgotten you can use items
It's not a nice feeling to lose a turn due to an enemy disrupting your command. I hope they do something about that. If I select a spell to cast, it should cast.
They have definitely made things move a lot quicker and you have to have a faster reaction time for sure. Also the special enemy challenges force you to play differently. For example I really never concerned myself with pressuring an enemy before but that giant eagle thing you have to and it’s a specific thing you have to do in order to pressure it.
I had to change my party. For me, Cloud, Aerith and Barret was the way to get it done. Any spell, even fire (which makes no sense) takes down the water prison thing and Barret has Thunder materia which works well on the Boss. Obviously use Ramuh whenever possible, etc. I died the first time with Cloud, Aerith and Tifa, but that was it. It's definitely more challenging (IMO) than the previous entry for an earlyish? Boss
I was having this exact problem and was really struggling, it was super disheartening given that I platinumed remake and consider myself to be pretty good at games, generally speaking.

Then, while I was in the map, I noticed the Chadley tab and saw that there were tutorials for every character listed there. I had been talking with Chadley and girl Chadley the whole demo but never actually stumbled across him. Turns out when you find him, you can then undertake the simulator missions, including all of the character tutorials. After playing these, I am feeling quite a bit more confident.

I had to call it a night after finishing the last tutorial but I feel like these are a great start if you are having trouble.
R1 synergy skills. Use Tifa to build up pressure/stagger/attack in the air with a side of Red XIII sucking HP out of enemies prior to dropping vengeance mode. Once you get the hang of it the combat isn’t THAT tough.
It takes a bit of getting used to because of how much faster the flow of combat is. Enemy attacks come out quickly and hit pretty hard.
I cant defeat the 2 elephants in time. I think its because my materia is still level 1 for starters.
    Just spam fire magic to stun them and use attacks like focused thrust, etc, to stagger them quickly. Fire+Synergy also helps a lot.
It feels like a completely different game...and that's because it is; the same general idea is still there, but if you try to play this game like Remake, it's gonna be rough. It took me a couple hours to really get it down, but I'm in love now.
Thundara + Ramuh
Like everyone else is saying, you’re basically thrown into the deep end immediately, and most of us are going to be rusty. That said, I think the emphasis on blocking, and especially perfect blocking, is going to be key.
It's gonna take me a good few playthroughs to feel completely confident as in I know what I'm doing, because the synergy attacks are such a whole different ball game and the combat feels so freaking smooth as well from Remake.
Just do the combat sim tutorial. Wonderfully explains it all. Synergy is amazing. Aerith and Tifa are beasts together. I guess my party is going to be the love triangle on first. I'm sure we are going to have enough insurances of using the others as well. The game is shaping up to be great! 
I was also surprised how hard it was. Managed to kill it on my second try, however, but it was not easy. The normal enemies also seemed to have quite much health.
I needed a few attempts myself, but I think the perceived difficulty is because you're thrown into a game with not a lot of time to learn the new mechanics, and you've done pretty much nothing on a macro level (e.g. leveling up materia, finding or buying equipment). I suspect the boss fight will go a lot smoother in the full game.
How are people playing already? Isn't there still 7 days until release?
    The demo updated to include a full open area with a boss.
        Oh nice! Thanks! :)
I sucked for awhile for sure and I’ve been playing remake for weeks, wasn’t rusty at all but Rebirth new systems take some getting used to. Like the fact your other party members will basically not gain ATB unless you are frequently doing synergy skills. Synergy abilties are absolutely amazing so getting those rdy for stagger another thing I had to get used to. The water boss was annoying af though he locked down party members constantly. One thing I did appreciate is the tips given by party members during battle. For instance if you try to melee the bubble any one of your party members will say “Magic would be more effective”, assess will tell you boss is weak to thunder, one normal thunder breaks the bubble immediately and the tail dies pretty fast from anything.
i lowered the difficulty to easy cos im soft. I had to have aerith and berret in my party cos NO ONE ELSE CAN FIGHT THINGS IN THE SKY! and everything in tha area was flying.
    As cloud, just press circle to dodge and then hold square. Cloud will then launch into the air towards the monster so you can do aerial combat.
Does anyone else feel overwhelmed at how large and realized this game seems? It’s almost like how I felt with Tears of the Kingdom - there’s SO much to do that idk what I want to do
More strategy, less Zerg rush. Love it
The one thing I keep doing wrong as a bad Remake habit is trying to go into Punisher Stance WHILE blocking as cloud... that doesn't work anymore.
I'm struggling a bit too. Really hoping the Grasslands area in the final game eases us into it a bit better. The VR tutorials suck because the enemies die too quickly to really practice with each character.
Same, and I haven't forgotten shit. I did a re-playthrough of the whole game in HARD MODE in the lead up to this. I was playing it just minutes before the demo and still, the demo kicks my ass.
I seventh this
Man I'm so afraid that this game will be a sweaty experience. Not a chill rpg, it's gonna be a bummer. I don't have fun in a rpg if I have to play like a maniac. Action rpg are the absolute worst for me.
I died a couple of times too 😅 but I felt the urge to figure it out! So I beat it and feel pretty happy about it =) that's the game I guess, ff has always made me feel like there's another way I didn't think of yet
1.) How the flying fuck does cloud do his long range blade beam-ish attacks? NOBODY CAN BUILD ATB IN THAT FIGHT EXCEPT BARRET. It's killing me I can't heal fast enough.

I feel like I just do it at random I can't figure it out.

2.) Ff16 block and dodge and ff7 block and dodge are different buttons and my muscle memory is killing me lol.

3.) There's so much going on at once the boss just *relentless* he slaps me out of so many spell and ability animations.
You probably just need practice. I had some trouble early on with the elephant things, but I kept fighting them until I got all the objectives and felt myself improving significantly every time. I also found the combat simulator helpful. 

Give yourself a break, the game isn’t even out yet. There’s some stuff to get used to, but I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it
I got pounded my first time too. Then picked up remake again for about 25 hours. Just turned on Rebirth demo again and played like a fuckin Dev. Lol
That water dragon was a beast it’s def gonna take 5-10 hrs to the full hang back. Everything else tho was getting stomped 
I started replaying Remake this Monday after years of not touching it.

Normal mode. I'm about Level 40-something (already beat the game years ago, doing Chapter Select to replay it all) with endgame gear and the Hellhouse almost killed me.
My husband forced me to shut the demo off after I started to yell at it which was wipe number 5 to that stupid water monster. I normally don't ever yell at my games no matter how often I wipe on a boss / raid so he knew it was getting bad.
The thing that got to me was like most attacks you just can't dodge. Once I figured out how to play around that it wasn't too difficult.
I beat Weiss and every hard challenge in Remake, yet on my first very unsuspecting Rebirth Junon Demo play through I almost got wiped a few times, and really struggled on the boss fight, but wasn't really taking it seriously. After equipping the right materia for each challenge, it was much much more manageable. I really like that they upped the baseline difficulty as it will keep the first real play through quite engaging.
I'm so glad to see it's not me.
Once I failed to stop the birds from launching 3 times in a row, I looked up if I needed to continue the demo. Didn't wanna minmax a demo😅
The game sounding harder than FF16 or FF7R is the only good news for this game so far for me.   
I'll take it gladly.
I'm now opening a lot of my battles with the R1 synergy skills since it raises ATB for both involved. 

Man. First strike was definitely a crutch materia for me in remake. Starting with atb gauges filled is pretty over powered lol.

The pip system for the synergy abilities is awesome. Encouraging ATB usage out of players who just spam square let's casuals experience some pretty awesome synergy abilities
Yeah Cloud has new aerial moves you gotta use, circle + hold square. Plus add Barret to your party. I really hope they’ll show us how to use everything deeper in the main game cuz yeah, it’s chaos😅
Damn I beat him on the first try
Finally got around to Crisis Core Reunion just before this. I keep trying to dodge with X...it's been a challenge.
Atb builds up slower, you have to use your teammate attacks (R1 + other button) to build up your atb bars and keep switching between the different characters. The game is pushing you towards synergy attacks, basically. 
I had to stop down to Easy to even stand a chance on Terror of the Deep, when I have more time I’ll go back and try that fight on Normal
I yeah I did the fight twice, the first time was an absolute struggle with Cloud, Barrett, and Tifa. Bad materia load out and it felt like I was resurrecting the entire time. I think when I got the kill I only had one person up. 

The second time I used Cloud, Aerith, and Barrett and made sure everyone had Lightning. It still felt like a pain in the ass because I’d have one stun locked in the bubble and I’d start casting lightning to break it and get interrupted. But I died a lot less. 
Junon demo had several airborne enemies after coming from FF7 R  or most recently Granblue Fantasy Relink, was caught offguard 

Boss had the bubble but other than that it was fine. Took a wipe tho due to materia setups
I wasn't hitting the aerial enemies in the demo, I died a bunch too. Aerial combos were automatic in remake, but here I think you have to keep square pressed or smth?
Yea struggling with the combat, it's my first day 😂 I've just finished FF16 so my head is stuck in that style.
Yes but it isnt just because I'm bad at the game, some of the enemies are really poorly made. They give you close to zero openings, they spam the same attacks rapidly, you get stunlocked... like for real some of the enemies I've come across just genuinely suck.
I’m struggling with it too, it feels weird.  I haven’t quite figured out dodge/block timing, I’m sure it would help lol.
<\_< Hate to admit that I didn't fully feel the battle system until Chapter 12 I think lol.

I was literally brute forcing all the bosses and not making the most of stagger abilities, heck I forgot to master the one Cloud gets on his Buster sword. Let's just saying fighting a certain boss solo was tedious lol.
It’s an easy game, all you need to know is what every materia does and equip them optimally and use assess materia to learn enemy weaknesses (water boss is weak to lightnjng)

Spam thundara on him with Aerith on an Arcane Ward

Summon titan 

Use enemy skill materia  (plasma discharge is good vs water boss)

Water cell is hard to avoid.. just switch to other member and get your trapped one out by attacking the cell

Give every member a healing materia so you always have cure ready when needed
Welcome brother.  I still haven't even start Rebirth yet.  I'm sucking in Intermission.  I'm about to go back and just play Remake again.
I swear the block doesn’t work 99% of the time. I’m losing battles on normal and I’ve played every final fantasy ever made. They definitely ramped up the difficulty. Also whatever character I play as it get attacked by every enemy. Constantly switching character is annoying
We must be playing a different game… the bosses on here are easier than Remake to me

Remake I actually struggled and on Rebirth.. u can become over-leveled quick

I switch to dynamic and still breezing

My attacks do wayyy to much damage
Dodging seems a lot less reliable this game
Yeah, I keep trying to tell myself that. I'm intimately familiar with Remake's combat, and feel that I could pick it up and play any time. Yet, playing Rebirth last night, I was getting stomped at every turn. I found the enemy AI much, much more aggressive than I remember, and I was simply unable to build up enough ATB through basic attacks to stay afloat. It was embarrassing.
    I'm in exactly the same boat, I've been playing through Remake Hard Mode to prepare for Remake and have been absolutely destroying, but I had a few game overs myself in the Junon demo. I think another thing to keep in mind is the addition of perfect guards to try and keep damage low. I've never been too good at timing them but it may well make the difference in whether I have to use a potion/cure with my ATB or if I can set up some more damage/pressure. 

Once we have a game's length of experience with Rebirth's combat under our belts, I bet we'll have the same feeling of understanding and expertise that we have with Remake's.
        maybe we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image properly but thats just me.
            There is a materia that gives you a bigger perfect block window if you're struggling with it
                I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.
                    It would have made Sephiroth a cake walk in episode 1
                        Tbh Cloud’s punisher stance block counters made Sephiroth quite easy in the first game too.
                            It didn't on Hard mode 😭
                im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
                    lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.
                        I can flex just fine. Its not my problem you couldn't actually comprehend what i was struggling with despite me spelling it out twice. Where did i say i struggle to find the perfect block window? and even my prior comment i clearly said ''im struggling to see, not block'' It is making my job harder because instead of %100 focusing on the battle i have to %50 focus on the image and then %50 focus on the battle. 

Lobotomy hitting hard i see if you cant even comprehend that. In my original comment also i said ''we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image'' meaning my issue is not doing perfect guards but the fact that image being blurry makes it harder than it should be and you're like just practice bro ? practice for what ? blurry IQ and shitty camera angles ?  this is such a stupid argument. 

And the advice was ''just make your experience game journalist difficulty by using materia bro'' when i can see the image, i can perfect block just fine but not every instance is the same, some sections of the game are affected less by the blur than others which causes inconsistency.

 Such an easy concept to understand but half the thread is too busy bootlicking. And what does your last sentence have to do with anything?  Did i say somewhere that i wanna beat the game without playing it or something ? thats like saying well you wouldn't be alive without breathing air. No shit sherlock thanks.
                            Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
                                Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better. 

Do you think Shroud would perform the same way as he does if he was playing with 480p at 45 fps ? No, he wouldn't. Is it his aim thats worse? Does he need to practice more? No, he needs proper vision to see and read his target on the screen. Case and point. Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
                    You're right. It's the game that's wrong, not you.
                        Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
            yeah,why we didn't see every move enemy telegraphed by red text? how I supposed to block this focusing on one monster moves meanwhile second monster can hit you off screen...
        I just finished replaying Remake, and having just finished FFXVI before it, I found myself missing the dodge and parry mechanics from XVI; Remake's combat felt simplistic by comparison.

But I got into the rhythm again and that feeling disappeared after just a couple chapters.

And then I tried the Junon demo, and...

Be careful what you wish for, people. That's all I'm saying.
    The lack of ATB guage is fucking insane. 

Combined with the insane levels of instant aggro on whichever character is being controlled and I have to say I just hate the fucking combat in this game. 

Oh and you never have enough gold for any items, the transmuter is a fucking shit system to make up for it, and the lack of MP means that any remotely hard battle is insanely costly. 

Fuck this shitshow.
        Rebirth has an ATB gauge, the transmuted is a great addition as it keeps you from having to spend Gil, and every character also has mp. And I have a surplus of gold. So....
        Everything you just said is wrong its almost impressive lol i have way too much money for everything, transmuter is sick especially when you get chips and levels, the combat system is way better and more complex now and sooo fun, you can also just use an aggro ability to pull aggro to your tank and mp is fine? Just use items or drain to get mp back. Not a problem at all. Idt ive ever ran out of mp once.
        lol I have so much money I can’t spend it all. Not sure what you’re talking about. Const is great. Aggro is a bit strong I agree
        Honestly, I blame all the couch potato no life whiners who have no job, no life, and said that Remake was either ‘too easy’ or ‘not hard enough’. Remake was fine difficulty-wise. Here, it’s hard, because they added new things. Artificial difficulty spike, I’m guessing.
            I got better at it as time went on, but Aerith still absolutely sucks to play. 

Insane aggro + fucking forever and a half to build up even one bar of ATB. Ugh.
        It's not that bad, you gotta strategise a bit more to beat your enemies. There are some fights that are really painful without a ranged fighter. Some fights benefit from heavy hitters, some require magic. It's just about figuring it out. You can't pick your favourite team and roll with them through the whole game because it'll punish you pretty hard.
        Do you mean the demo? Or the game? Bc the game I literally can’t spend my gold up lol
I'm all for it tbh. It's been a minute since I've felt this challenged on normal mode. Makes me think of how to set up material more and different party setups to beat specific enemy scenarios. I find myself switching from character to character often. I also didn't realize how cool Aeriths ward is that boosts her auto attack. Red XIII also seems pretty nuts once you get him going.
    Ward Shift and Radiant Ward have cemented Aerith as probably my favourite playable character for Rebirth. That's not even getting into how fleeting familiar is now part of her basic attack kit instead of needing ATB. 

With Remake, encounters were usually built around the party you would have at that part of the story. Now we're getting the opposite, where you'll put together a team that's a sort of counter pick to the boss.
        Aerith feels like a black mage from ff14 and im loving it, I missed my ley lines
    Coming into this comment a little bit late to the party because I'm playing the game soooooo slowly (I'm on chapter 8....) but you made a really good point about the different materia setups and different party setups.  I've now got a rule that if I die to the same boss/mechanic/section twice in a row, I need to sit down and start making adjustments.  The party setup isn't optimal, or I'm not taking advantage of materia, or there was some gimmick I missed.  Corel Prison example:  >!with the lil baby cactuars that stole my gysal greens, I realized I just needed to block with Cloud to build up limit break and murder them, because if I actually tried to attack them directly I'd die the first time they went 3,000 needles on me.!<
Honestly, the complexity is way too much. Red XIII has like some sort of secondary attack mode and a bunch of alternate attacks? But his basic attacks don’t hit as easily. And I beat all the fights on the first try.

My other complaint is that non-range party members don’t close distance on their targets with normal attack like they used to, and I don’t know how to aerial attack.

Something about the combat is weird. Remake just felt more…responsive?
    Reds as easy as going into sentinel stance, block to build vengeance while letting go of block and pressing square to counter, and then using siphon fang (think that’s what it’s called). He’s actually easier than people think.

As for non range party members, you can turn cloud into a ranged two ways.

1: dodge twice then press attack to throw out constant blade beams.

2: have Barret in party and do Cloud/Barret synergy which can be spammed. Barret literally shoots at cloud and Cloud deflects the bullets to the enemy.
        You only have to press dodge once to use Cloud's blade beams just FYI. Also Red does the same synergy skill as Cloud/Barrett, except it's magic.
            Noted. Yeah tried it out today after learning you can also hold square to launch into the air.
        Also if you hold Cloud's attack after a dodge instead of just attacking he'll dash up to the enemy and do air combos.
        Also it seems like Tifa/Barrett synergy skills launch tifa into the air, which could be helpful for aerials.
        Dodge then hold square for aerial attacks with cloud
    So Red XIII's basic attacks have little reach, but if you hold square to do his spin attack you can move him around with the left stick and send him straight towards the enemies. Vengeance Mode charges up from him guarding attacks, and he has a counter that you have to do manually by dropping guard and hitting square right after he blocks a hit. Changing into Vengeance Mode is its own attack, and it soups up his regular attacks as well as letting him do a move that heals him with triangle. Like all the characters, playing him well is all about knowing what he can do and getting experience doing.

Aerial combat for melee characters isn't automatic anymore, Cloud needs to attack right after dodging to start an aerial combo, and you need to use Tifa's Synergy Skills to launch her at enemies in the air, or use Reverse Gale to bring them down to the ground.
        It’s too much. Look at what you just wrote. How am I supposed to keep track of all that. Remake combat was perfect, I never found there was something I couldn’t do with a character. Yuffie kept it interesting with some new mechanics in Intergrade. But this is way too complex.
            Relax. Junon is a few chapters into the game. We'll get the hang of it as we play from the start.
            It’s only 4 button presses he wrote about for Red XIII, not exactly war and peace.
            Even the original FF7 was too much when you got all the characters, it's one of those games where I didn't use all the characters.

The confusion comes from the fact that there are now more than 4 characters. It gets a bit more complex with 6 characters, and in part 3 we will have Cid and Vincent too.
                So I got to play the Chadley missions and realized it flows well. There is a bit too much still — the extra synergy attacks are easy to forget about it, for instance, but overall it’s solid. I recant my complaint, actually.
            Just take it slowly. Replay the tutorial until you get the gist.
            Git Gud

Or just spam spells for stagger and pure damage tbh 

Or there’s always easy mode
            Sometimes describing something with words is more complicated than just doing it.  Just takes a bit of practice.

There are bound to be simpler characters and more complex characters.  I doubt there will be many points of the game where Red is mandatory.  Cosmo Canyon, probably, but not too much more than that.

A player who struggles with aerial combat can just use Barret and Aerith anytime they come up, or even for nearly the entire game if they like, and they'll be fine.
    I really hope they just crammed in a bunch of extra stuff from later in the game for the demo, and that the real game takes much longer to build up to that level of complexity.
        I saw multiple "first 4 hours preview" and that is 100% the case. You don't even have ANY synergy abilities and barely any synergy skills. You have to get them through the skill tree, so it should be a very balanced learning curve.
        Most likely. Remember that most of the abilities and materia you can use in the demo (espevially the sinergies attacks) won't be available from the start
        Nope.
            Hahah! Well, sort of, I mean there's 15+ hours of game you can do before you actually get to that point, and the difficulty is much lower in the actual game. And then there's the battle sim training and monster hunts which are good for practicing. Plus, they removed a bunch of the extra content they'd crammed into that small space for the demo, so overall I'm pretty happy with the final product. Even though I still feel the combat still has a bit too much going on. At least they got rid of the weapon upgrade sphere grid thing, or you could say changed it into the synergy vending machine, which I like a little better since it doesn't change when you change your equipment.
        I think that's likely,  as they did the same thing with the FF16 demo.
    Yep. Just block. Like the tutorials say. Go to chadley. And play them. They explain everything.
        Well kindaaaaaa


It’s a lot of trial and error.  And the tutorials just tell you what to do but if you kill the enemies with out even doing the teachable mechanic it goes on to the next tutorial.
            All I’m saying is. I just held block and pressed square and triangle and built up synergy and destroyed everything in my path. I actually have been feel v like this game is easier than remake. 

…no one is more shocked than myself about this.
    If you lock on targets the misses aren’t as much of an issue imo
    No one closes on targets because the characters move at about half the speed they should.

Flying enemies just wreck your party because 3 of the characters are useless, one is so fucking slow, and the last just sucks to play. 

I feel like combat was 1000 times better in Remake. Rebirth is just awful.
    Stop crying, I'm happy that they make the game more complex instead of dumbing it down for people like you
    Hamaguchi is tinkering with Nomura's perfection
        This is a group project.
    Ariel with Cloud, dodge then hold attack button.
    You're likely just overwhelmed by being thrown too much at once in a relatively more difficult part of the game. Aerial attacking is a mile better than the first game.
Yea, and look at your parties health, limited material and slots. It seems like we are well hampered. I’ve got to believe I’d have a couple 2 star HP-UPs by then. I’m going to bail on the serpent and go do combat unilateral to learn everyone’s fighting and hang it up until the release. 
The first part of the demo was awesome, the second was a cool area to show me how they take on open world, but I’m not about to grind the demo
Also it's possible that in the full version once you get to that point your party might be better prepared with higher stats and stuff. My guess is that if one doesn't rush the main path then it's not so hard, aside of player skill of course.
I'd say I also feel a but underleveled in Junon demo.

IIRC, SE said we'd start at average level that people left Midgar at. Thing is, I am just replaying the Remake and am already over 30, despite I haven't even reached Shin'ra HQ yet. Just finished *In search of hope* chapter. And can't say I didn't any level grinding either.
    That doesn't really make sense to me, do you have a source? It'd be weird to start at like, level 40.
        [https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/)

Apparently i will be L21. Which is a bit low, but then number does seem rather cosmetic anyway.
Yeah the combat in Rebirth is definitely more complex and challenging than Remake and will most likely take me some time to get used to. But, in terms of the difficulty curve, I read from multiple review sources that the game has quite a few extreme difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere.
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Where did you find the level up materia
    Not sure if it's obtainable in the wild but pretty sure it's a Chadley reward
        Think the vending machine at chocobo farm had one
    Through chadley he also has a bunch of other useful materia to buy or win including a Phoenix summon.
        I missed the Phoenix summon, guess I’m gonna have to start the whole demo over again lol

Edit: I found the thing
            Just reload the demo save point that's what I did. I missed one golden plume the first playthrough myself in addition to the summon so.
                I ended up just replaying it and turns out that’s what I was missing the first time too lol. Haven’t taken down Phoenix to get the summon yet, fought em a few times on the hardest setting and just kinda gave up for a little break
                    You have to focus on the other monsters the Phoenix creates they protect him with their links, I used magic A LOT on them to make it easier by hitting them with their weaknesses. I wish comet didn't cost so much it would be helpful for aoe damage. Algic aura enemy skill from remake would help too
                        Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
                        Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
                            I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.
For some reason my game won't let me change Aerith into the fighting line... I suppose it's because I initiated the cutscenes before that boss before I tried. Now it's locked to cloud, barrett and red for this fight. I can't find any way to back out and make changes. It just forces me
    [deleted]
        Does defeating that boss end the demo? I wasn't sure and kinda accidentally stumbled into the marker where a cutscene took over. Didn't exactly mean to as I had other wtuff still out in the open area I wanted to do
            [deleted]
                damn ok guess I'm restarting

I knew that the demo didn't have any actual story quests (why would it?) so I assumed that blue marker was gonna be just a bit of dialogue to introduce us to the area further, not take us away from it, lol. Didn't think it would actually take me onto the main story in a demo...
                    This demo just focuses on combat and exploration

You’re the man.
This X100. I was a bit overwhelmed at first. did the battle sims and it helped a lot.
I am pretty sure Phoenix was supposed to be hard mode, it even hinted at it on the text pre-fight
    Yeah, summons now have a full power fight you can do immediately upon entering the zone associated with them, which is insanely hard and a big challenge. By doing the side content in the area you gradually lower their difficulty, so they become a reward for doing everything.

Max Dood talked about it from his experience playing the Kalm area.
        I spent 2 hours yesterday on Phoenix and I still haven't been able to beat him. I left it at a pixel but my Tifa only had a pixel as well and I guess Phoenix was a quicker draw than me when we picked our attacks.

But it has been very fun and it shows the depth of the system, since you can be very strategic about it, not only with the items but also strategy in game, positioning, etc.
Wait the limit levels change based on synergy moves? Im so lost haha
    There's an effect on some synergy abilities that raise the limit level for the characters. If you do one of those then use Limit you can choose from Lv 1 and Lv 2.
        Damn thats so wild, they really made the combat super intricate
            Yeah you get the second Remake limit breaks like “Ascension” for cloud, or “catastrophe” for Barret, as a level 2 limit breaks in rebirth. 

Certain Synergy attacks give the level 2 to the characters that that perform the move. You get a little yellow pip next to the limit bar to indicate you’ve got it.
            Yup. Best moment of the game so far for me was doing the cloud/aerith synergy into ascension and planetary protection. Granted... the Aerith Limit 2 wasn't necessary since Ascension killed the boss. BUT... it's the cool factor that counts.
Great take, nailed it.
Dude same. I have been playing my handmade game so long I forgot items were even a thing.
I am also very much in this club, just finished hard mode run on main story and DLC.  Going to take some time to get used to the expansion of all the mechanics, but they've clearly been very thoughtful with how the game is balanced with all the new things being introduced.  The items almost seem OP with the Mist stuff and how easy it is to craft, but there seems to be more difficulty elsewhere as a result.  Very excited to play it from the start so it ramps us up to the point of the demo.
No literally. Every enemy stays targeting her and her ai is just as dumb as it was in Remake. Like girl, why are you leaving the wards I’m summoning for you?? Why are you getting up close and personal?? 😭
    Aerith said she got hands for they asses 😂
    sounds like it may be a xenoblade 1 melia situation, where she’s shit for brains level bad when controlled by AI but the best character in the game when controlled by the player
    What are you talking about? Aerith AI in demo always try to stay on the ward if there's one. She will only get off it when enemies move too far away from her as she will chase after them, or when those Elphadunk or something pull her to them with their ability.

Aggro in this game kinda work as it support to, character who deal most damage will be targeted, so the character you control won't be the aggro magnet anymore. Of course that gonna lead to another problems because range character trend to deal a lot of damage so they will aggro enemies very often.
    Lol so it wasn't just me then? I swear they hateeee her so much 😆
    Lol. Aerith said she wants all the smoke.
    Oh Jesus I hated that in the remake, especially in the freaking Haunted House fight, where she kept running up to the house and getting killed by melee attacks.
You can use body guard synergy to block for Aerith….

Or if not the Eledunks will trample her :)
Aerith: "They target the strongest prey!"
Yeah ikr?! When I was doing that tonadu intel he Just kept focusing aerith and getting stun locked like jesus christ
Thank you! A perfect description of how I feel. I feel like the combat is really floaty and like I'm just jumping around without much control
Not being able to dodge out of blocking really hurts the feel of mobility in combat, though I’d guess once we get used to it, it will be fine.
This. 

I love what this game looks and sounds like, and I’ll plug away at the demo to discover some stuff, but it’s too much all at once.
Its fucking awesome though holy shit!!!!
I think it's because they throw you into the mix.  I decided to try and get platinums on FF7:R and Intermission so I *recently* played those and I struggled with the first enemies in the demo.  I assume when the actual game comes out people can ease into the new mechanics.
    A little maybe but every review says the game is way harder than remake.
I've noticed the same thing. Some of them never seem to stop attacking, it's the opposite of 16.
Ff7 remake and FF16 was much easier. This one has much more complex combat
Did you put the dual element materia on Elemental?  I was wondering how it would work, and the answer seems to be: whichever way benefits the player.  That was pretty cool.
I knew from the fact that there are 6 characters that the game would be complex. And part 3 even more so with Vincent and Cid.
    Part 3 is gonna be insane
Aerith's regular attacks kept saying weakness damage Everytime I hit the bubbles
    Do you have elemental+thunder materia on her weapon?  You can hear the characters saying that magic will burst the bubbles quicker during the fight
        Just magic in general works on the bubbles I think.
        Ah mustve missed it when they said it, thanks. I also missed the Phoenix summon and the last chocobo stop first time around.
I used aeriths regular attacks on the bubble to conserve mp for the monster

The game gave everyone shit mp points, so you need to use a cushion between each battle it felt like
Any magic will pop the bubble in one hit, even on normal difficulty. Your characters will even say to use magic if you hit the bubbles with regular attacks.
The word "flow" is exactly right. Remake had a definite flow that we all grew accustomed to. Rebirth clearly has a different flow, and I'm sure combat will far exceed Remake once we find that flow.
Aga spells are still broken
    Even more broken!  They have a 100% hit rate now.  Charging 2 ATB for them is reasonable, though, I think.
        Wait for real? Im not sure if it needed 100% accuracy
        Oh does Blizzaga stick to the enemy like Aero now? I think Blizzard/Blizzara still stay in place.
wait wut? u didn't go right into combat?

U CAN SPLORE?!
    I mean, it was only surprising because there was no swimming in the og. And of course, I went right into combat, lol. Can't really tell if you're being sardonic or not.
        no. i didn't realize u could swim either. i booted up just to see if i could get to the tiny island suuure enough i got there. thanks for the tip!!
            My bad 😆. I'm so used to snark on social media I just got defensive.
I had to switch to Easy mode as well. I feel like I was losing a lot more HP when getting hit than in Remake, so either they made Normal mode a lot harder or the characters are way under-leveled in this part of the demo. I kept dying even in the open world research missions.
FF16's combat isn't "oversimplified", it's streamlined. It's actually responsive and representative of player mechanical skill and input. It baffles me that people think these remakes spamming you with infinite menu-based skill options is good design compared to FF16.
    When you put it that way though all FF16 is, is button mashing and cycling the same abilities. I love both games, with their respective combat systems, both being complex in their own ways. 

Just because there are menus for ability usage, doesn’t make it bad. They do things this way because you can control several different characters, all with their own play styles. FF16 you play as 1 character. That’s it. The two games aren’t even comparable in my opinion other than they share names and lore.
        Only if you're average:

  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJXxExdEWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJXxExdEWo)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ)
        The thing about FF16's combat though is you CAN button mash, but it's not necessary. Just like DMC games, the combat is as shallow or deep as you're willing to make it. When I play DMC5 Bloody Palace, of course I could spam Vergil's AOE moves or Dante's Dr. Faust broken ass attacks. But, I don't HAVE to...I can instead go for crazily creative combos and emphasize style. Same with FF16; you can invent creative, extreme combos using pinpoint precise timing and inputs.

The problem I have with FF7R is it really doesn't allow for this level of creativity. Every enemy has a meta tactic that's almost hard enforced. You can't easily play around the "correct" approach to any particular encounter.
            Ah, I do get what you mean actually. It really just comes down to preference. You make some valid arguments though.
            They're two different games. FF16 = DMC. FF7R = Closer to classic JRPG
    Maybe if you are a DMC buff but for the average player the combat got pretty samey. Most people never had a reason to use something like charge magic or burning blade in their playthrough.
    You can literally go through the whole game doing the same thing. True, if you want to want to optimize your damage **for no reason at all** you can do that and it becomes more challenging, but I wouldn't call that good design by any stretch of imagination. I play a fair amount of fighting games, so I'm no stranger to action combat and frame-perfect inputs. But these games make you think and give you a reason to mixup your attacks and adapt your high level strategy based on the fight and matchups. FF16 does none of those. It's stupidly trivial, unless you want to make up your own personal challenges that the game doesn't reward.

It's too early for me to judge Rebirth's combat. Maybe it's not that deep either, or maybe it's too confusing and convoluted, I don't know yet. But it can't be worse than the boring combat of FF16.
        You can get through remake by mashing square. Player expression is up to...the player. FF16 has more in depth combat mechanics than FF7 but where ff7 shines is the multiple characters 
            I'd like to see you going through Remake on Normal difficulty mashing square and not using skills.
                You can mash square and potion dump your way through any fight. And by skills you mean crappy menu "gameplay" and using the ATB you get from simply running around lmao. There is a reason they nerfed ATB gaining from running in rebirth because it was a shit way to compensate for the grounded combat. Fortunately they improved upon that in rebirth. To even use skills like a real game with peak combat you have to hot key them and you can only use 4. You lost all credibility because the way you are complaining about 16 combat is EXACTLY how you can play remake. Mash square ATB charge use a braindead skill. In 16 mash square eikon recharge use them
                    But you literally can’t. I’d like to see you beat Hell House with just mashing the attack button lmao.
                        ...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
                            Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
                    You can just spam stinger and holy waters in DMC and beat the game, but that doesn’t mean the game lacks depth. Refusing to engage with the mechanics just because it’s possible and then claiming the games design is bad is really not a strong argument.
                        Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
            Clives eikon moves felt the same to me overall so while there was more “depth” it felt very shallow to me peesonally
    Wrong sub. XVI is not fun.
        Fanboy alert.
    FF16 is a perfectly engineered game, not just combat but also world, story, etc. It wasn't overly ambitious. It's exactly the kind of game CBU3 does. The only downside is they scaled the difficulty too low.
    They think micromanaging and menu-diving for every attack is the same thing as complexity.
        Yeah the menu managing is ass. I try to stay away from the menu as much as possible with the shortcuts 
            I wish i was that good haha sometimes i hit the menu just for the slow down so i can plot what abilities i should use next. Gives it a strategic feel too
                It really just muscle memory. I kept messing up in the demo because I usually have braver set to L1 triangle but in the demo its square. It becomes automatic lol
                    You can change the battle settings
                    You know you can change that lol
I hate fighting flying enemies.
    At least now they clearly indicate which skills will hit a flying enemy.
    Omg they were frustrating, they kept flying into me and moving the characters around the map

Its hard to believe they went from a masterpiece with remake's battle system and took a dump on it with the overcomplexity of rebirth

I hope the game is better with regards to mp and magic power (using cura only healed 4-600, what kind of shit is that???)
Cloud is now a completely ranged character too, and can spam attack after a dodge or hold attack after a dodge to leap into the air for aerial combos. Tifa's synergies put her into aerial mode too. Only thing I can't stand is that Divekick doesn't seem to work in the air. You can still Whirling Uppercut into it to skip the animation but if you're actually in an airborne state, it doesn't work. She needs to land first.
There being an input lag actually sort of explains the weird floaty feeling .
Pretty sure it was like that in part 1 too though ?
Yes, it sucks. I use classic mode in addition to this and it just feels like I am being punished and potentially blocked from progressing in the game because of it.
My guess is that the nerfed passive atb gain to balance for synergy attacks
It seems like it is still pretty much the same. They don't really build ATB on their own, and from what I saw they were not good at defending or dodging on their own. Unfortunately the enemy AI also still knows exactly which character you are controlling and they will all focus on you 9 times out of 10 and if you switch they seem to switch to you again faster than before.
You’re not meant to rely on the AI!  You’re supposed to switch between them frequently, none of them should be your main character.  It’s one of the best parts of the game imo.
    Yea I'm forced to, cuz they can't even hold their own lol
    That kind of sucks though, because the optimal way to play involves switching characters the moment you use a skill/spell, so you don't even get to see the resulting animation.
Are you using a fully leveled elemental materia paired with lightning on your armor?  That fight gets way easier if you let the thunder dude stay alive and heal you with his spells.
    Had no idea about the elementals being able to heal you! Tbh i mashed hard tru hard mode and didn't put a lot of thought into it. Also
Idk if its that way but my dmg was LOW.
Yeah with hard mode I had to do my homework and watch youtube videos of how to best play your characters

Watching blitz videos helped alot
    I mashed my way through! But the guardians of destiny ..... i had no chance :( i ended up giving up on the plat.

I asked for some tips in a couple of communities and received responses like, HAHA hard mode was easy af 🤦🏻‍♂️🥲
        Well, you need to use the weapons with reprieve, basically and I had everyone with maxed revive and each character with a specific function, I also used elemental on my armor so the guardians healed my characters with their magic
            Dammnnn, i tried a few made up strats but honestly they were really fucking me up 😂
                for the 3 sentinels I was too destroyed in seconds but BUILD tifa for atb fast regenerate and spam her move star shower,she carried me trough this bullshit
                    Ill try that out before rebirth comes out. Also ill be playing the dlc to get back into things
I'm really glad I played the demo before falling for hype.  The combat was annoying and all it did was make me angry.
If you're talking about the one near the beginning yeah I hate it cause it feels like it's impossible to beat in time unless I never switch off cloud and am only in punisher mode for the block counter
    Exactly. The flying bird (not sure what name it is) at the open field is pretty annoying too.
        Idk how to pressure it
            I’m on my second run of the Junon demo, and boy does Assess really help lol. Try assessing all the enemies during combat, and if you fail, just re-try the challenge again. I’m still figuring out how the synergy abilities work during combat
                Yeah it says dodge a specific attack but idk which attack that is. is it cacophony?
                    Can’t remember the name of the attack, but it’s the one where the bird is gonna charge towards you. You’d have to dodge that one to get him pressured.
The tutorial for cloud goes through how to initiate air attacks which may help you out here.
    How do I air attack with Tifa? I could do air attacks just fine with Cloud, but doing the same thing (dodge and then hold square) on Tifa just makes her do an uppercut for some reason.
        I believe she has a synergy with Barrett which throws her into the air. I’ve not played around with her much yet myself.
Just spam fire magic to stun them and use attacks like focused thrust, etc, to stagger them quickly. Fire+Synergy also helps a lot.
The demo updated to include a full open area with a boss.
    Oh nice! Thanks! :)
As cloud, just press circle to dodge and then hold square. Cloud will then launch into the air towards the monster so you can do aerial combat.
I'm in exactly the same boat, I've been playing through Remake Hard Mode to prepare for Remake and have been absolutely destroying, but I had a few game overs myself in the Junon demo. I think another thing to keep in mind is the addition of perfect guards to try and keep damage low. I've never been too good at timing them but it may well make the difference in whether I have to use a potion/cure with my ATB or if I can set up some more damage/pressure. 

Once we have a game's length of experience with Rebirth's combat under our belts, I bet we'll have the same feeling of understanding and expertise that we have with Remake's.
    maybe we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image properly but thats just me.
        There is a materia that gives you a bigger perfect block window if you're struggling with it
            I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.
                It would have made Sephiroth a cake walk in episode 1
                    Tbh Cloud’s punisher stance block counters made Sephiroth quite easy in the first game too.
                        It didn't on Hard mode 😭
            im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
                lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.
                    I can flex just fine. Its not my problem you couldn't actually comprehend what i was struggling with despite me spelling it out twice. Where did i say i struggle to find the perfect block window? and even my prior comment i clearly said ''im struggling to see, not block'' It is making my job harder because instead of %100 focusing on the battle i have to %50 focus on the image and then %50 focus on the battle. 

Lobotomy hitting hard i see if you cant even comprehend that. In my original comment also i said ''we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image'' meaning my issue is not doing perfect guards but the fact that image being blurry makes it harder than it should be and you're like just practice bro ? practice for what ? blurry IQ and shitty camera angles ?  this is such a stupid argument. 

And the advice was ''just make your experience game journalist difficulty by using materia bro'' when i can see the image, i can perfect block just fine but not every instance is the same, some sections of the game are affected less by the blur than others which causes inconsistency.

 Such an easy concept to understand but half the thread is too busy bootlicking. And what does your last sentence have to do with anything?  Did i say somewhere that i wanna beat the game without playing it or something ? thats like saying well you wouldn't be alive without breathing air. No shit sherlock thanks.
                        Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
                            Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better. 

Do you think Shroud would perform the same way as he does if he was playing with 480p at 45 fps ? No, he wouldn't. Is it his aim thats worse? Does he need to practice more? No, he needs proper vision to see and read his target on the screen. Case and point. Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
                You're right. It's the game that's wrong, not you.
                    Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
        yeah,why we didn't see every move enemy telegraphed by red text? how I supposed to block this focusing on one monster moves meanwhile second monster can hit you off screen...
    I just finished replaying Remake, and having just finished FFXVI before it, I found myself missing the dodge and parry mechanics from XVI; Remake's combat felt simplistic by comparison.

But I got into the rhythm again and that feeling disappeared after just a couple chapters.

And then I tried the Junon demo, and...

Be careful what you wish for, people. That's all I'm saying.
The lack of ATB guage is fucking insane. 

Combined with the insane levels of instant aggro on whichever character is being controlled and I have to say I just hate the fucking combat in this game. 

Oh and you never have enough gold for any items, the transmuter is a fucking shit system to make up for it, and the lack of MP means that any remotely hard battle is insanely costly. 

Fuck this shitshow.
    Rebirth has an ATB gauge, the transmuted is a great addition as it keeps you from having to spend Gil, and every character also has mp. And I have a surplus of gold. So....
    Everything you just said is wrong its almost impressive lol i have way too much money for everything, transmuter is sick especially when you get chips and levels, the combat system is way better and more complex now and sooo fun, you can also just use an aggro ability to pull aggro to your tank and mp is fine? Just use items or drain to get mp back. Not a problem at all. Idt ive ever ran out of mp once.
    lol I have so much money I can’t spend it all. Not sure what you’re talking about. Const is great. Aggro is a bit strong I agree
    Honestly, I blame all the couch potato no life whiners who have no job, no life, and said that Remake was either ‘too easy’ or ‘not hard enough’. Remake was fine difficulty-wise. Here, it’s hard, because they added new things. Artificial difficulty spike, I’m guessing.
        I got better at it as time went on, but Aerith still absolutely sucks to play. 

Insane aggro + fucking forever and a half to build up even one bar of ATB. Ugh.
    It's not that bad, you gotta strategise a bit more to beat your enemies. There are some fights that are really painful without a ranged fighter. Some fights benefit from heavy hitters, some require magic. It's just about figuring it out. You can't pick your favourite team and roll with them through the whole game because it'll punish you pretty hard.
    Do you mean the demo? Or the game? Bc the game I literally can’t spend my gold up lol
Ward Shift and Radiant Ward have cemented Aerith as probably my favourite playable character for Rebirth. That's not even getting into how fleeting familiar is now part of her basic attack kit instead of needing ATB. 

With Remake, encounters were usually built around the party you would have at that part of the story. Now we're getting the opposite, where you'll put together a team that's a sort of counter pick to the boss.
    Aerith feels like a black mage from ff14 and im loving it, I missed my ley lines
Coming into this comment a little bit late to the party because I'm playing the game soooooo slowly (I'm on chapter 8....) but you made a really good point about the different materia setups and different party setups.  I've now got a rule that if I die to the same boss/mechanic/section twice in a row, I need to sit down and start making adjustments.  The party setup isn't optimal, or I'm not taking advantage of materia, or there was some gimmick I missed.  Corel Prison example:  >!with the lil baby cactuars that stole my gysal greens, I realized I just needed to block with Cloud to build up limit break and murder them, because if I actually tried to attack them directly I'd die the first time they went 3,000 needles on me.!<
Reds as easy as going into sentinel stance, block to build vengeance while letting go of block and pressing square to counter, and then using siphon fang (think that’s what it’s called). He’s actually easier than people think.

As for non range party members, you can turn cloud into a ranged two ways.

1: dodge twice then press attack to throw out constant blade beams.

2: have Barret in party and do Cloud/Barret synergy which can be spammed. Barret literally shoots at cloud and Cloud deflects the bullets to the enemy.
    You only have to press dodge once to use Cloud's blade beams just FYI. Also Red does the same synergy skill as Cloud/Barrett, except it's magic.
        Noted. Yeah tried it out today after learning you can also hold square to launch into the air.
    Also if you hold Cloud's attack after a dodge instead of just attacking he'll dash up to the enemy and do air combos.
    Also it seems like Tifa/Barrett synergy skills launch tifa into the air, which could be helpful for aerials.
    Dodge then hold square for aerial attacks with cloud
So Red XIII's basic attacks have little reach, but if you hold square to do his spin attack you can move him around with the left stick and send him straight towards the enemies. Vengeance Mode charges up from him guarding attacks, and he has a counter that you have to do manually by dropping guard and hitting square right after he blocks a hit. Changing into Vengeance Mode is its own attack, and it soups up his regular attacks as well as letting him do a move that heals him with triangle. Like all the characters, playing him well is all about knowing what he can do and getting experience doing.

Aerial combat for melee characters isn't automatic anymore, Cloud needs to attack right after dodging to start an aerial combo, and you need to use Tifa's Synergy Skills to launch her at enemies in the air, or use Reverse Gale to bring them down to the ground.
    It’s too much. Look at what you just wrote. How am I supposed to keep track of all that. Remake combat was perfect, I never found there was something I couldn’t do with a character. Yuffie kept it interesting with some new mechanics in Intergrade. But this is way too complex.
        Relax. Junon is a few chapters into the game. We'll get the hang of it as we play from the start.
        It’s only 4 button presses he wrote about for Red XIII, not exactly war and peace.
        Even the original FF7 was too much when you got all the characters, it's one of those games where I didn't use all the characters.

The confusion comes from the fact that there are now more than 4 characters. It gets a bit more complex with 6 characters, and in part 3 we will have Cid and Vincent too.
            So I got to play the Chadley missions and realized it flows well. There is a bit too much still — the extra synergy attacks are easy to forget about it, for instance, but overall it’s solid. I recant my complaint, actually.
        Just take it slowly. Replay the tutorial until you get the gist.
        Git Gud

Or just spam spells for stagger and pure damage tbh 

Or there’s always easy mode
        Sometimes describing something with words is more complicated than just doing it.  Just takes a bit of practice.

There are bound to be simpler characters and more complex characters.  I doubt there will be many points of the game where Red is mandatory.  Cosmo Canyon, probably, but not too much more than that.

A player who struggles with aerial combat can just use Barret and Aerith anytime they come up, or even for nearly the entire game if they like, and they'll be fine.
I really hope they just crammed in a bunch of extra stuff from later in the game for the demo, and that the real game takes much longer to build up to that level of complexity.
    I saw multiple "first 4 hours preview" and that is 100% the case. You don't even have ANY synergy abilities and barely any synergy skills. You have to get them through the skill tree, so it should be a very balanced learning curve.
    Most likely. Remember that most of the abilities and materia you can use in the demo (espevially the sinergies attacks) won't be available from the start
    Nope.
        Hahah! Well, sort of, I mean there's 15+ hours of game you can do before you actually get to that point, and the difficulty is much lower in the actual game. And then there's the battle sim training and monster hunts which are good for practicing. Plus, they removed a bunch of the extra content they'd crammed into that small space for the demo, so overall I'm pretty happy with the final product. Even though I still feel the combat still has a bit too much going on. At least they got rid of the weapon upgrade sphere grid thing, or you could say changed it into the synergy vending machine, which I like a little better since it doesn't change when you change your equipment.
    I think that's likely,  as they did the same thing with the FF16 demo.
Yep. Just block. Like the tutorials say. Go to chadley. And play them. They explain everything.
    Well kindaaaaaa


It’s a lot of trial and error.  And the tutorials just tell you what to do but if you kill the enemies with out even doing the teachable mechanic it goes on to the next tutorial.
        All I’m saying is. I just held block and pressed square and triangle and built up synergy and destroyed everything in my path. I actually have been feel v like this game is easier than remake. 

…no one is more shocked than myself about this.
If you lock on targets the misses aren’t as much of an issue imo
No one closes on targets because the characters move at about half the speed they should.

Flying enemies just wreck your party because 3 of the characters are useless, one is so fucking slow, and the last just sucks to play. 

I feel like combat was 1000 times better in Remake. Rebirth is just awful.
Stop crying, I'm happy that they make the game more complex instead of dumbing it down for people like you
Hamaguchi is tinkering with Nomura's perfection
    This is a group project.
Ariel with Cloud, dodge then hold attack button.
You're likely just overwhelmed by being thrown too much at once in a relatively more difficult part of the game. Aerial attacking is a mile better than the first game.
That doesn't really make sense to me, do you have a source? It'd be weird to start at like, level 40.
    [https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/)

Apparently i will be L21. Which is a bit low, but then number does seem rather cosmetic anyway.
Not sure if it's obtainable in the wild but pretty sure it's a Chadley reward
    Think the vending machine at chocobo farm had one
Through chadley he also has a bunch of other useful materia to buy or win including a Phoenix summon.
    I missed the Phoenix summon, guess I’m gonna have to start the whole demo over again lol

Edit: I found the thing
        Just reload the demo save point that's what I did. I missed one golden plume the first playthrough myself in addition to the summon so.
            I ended up just replaying it and turns out that’s what I was missing the first time too lol. Haven’t taken down Phoenix to get the summon yet, fought em a few times on the hardest setting and just kinda gave up for a little break
                You have to focus on the other monsters the Phoenix creates they protect him with their links, I used magic A LOT on them to make it easier by hitting them with their weaknesses. I wish comet didn't cost so much it would be helpful for aoe damage. Algic aura enemy skill from remake would help too
                    Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
                    Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
                        I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.
[deleted]
    Does defeating that boss end the demo? I wasn't sure and kinda accidentally stumbled into the marker where a cutscene took over. Didn't exactly mean to as I had other wtuff still out in the open area I wanted to do
        [deleted]
            damn ok guess I'm restarting

I knew that the demo didn't have any actual story quests (why would it?) so I assumed that blue marker was gonna be just a bit of dialogue to introduce us to the area further, not take us away from it, lol. Didn't think it would actually take me onto the main story in a demo...
                This demo just focuses on combat and exploration

Yeah, summons now have a full power fight you can do immediately upon entering the zone associated with them, which is insanely hard and a big challenge. By doing the side content in the area you gradually lower their difficulty, so they become a reward for doing everything.

Max Dood talked about it from his experience playing the Kalm area.
    I spent 2 hours yesterday on Phoenix and I still haven't been able to beat him. I left it at a pixel but my Tifa only had a pixel as well and I guess Phoenix was a quicker draw than me when we picked our attacks.

But it has been very fun and it shows the depth of the system, since you can be very strategic about it, not only with the items but also strategy in game, positioning, etc.
There's an effect on some synergy abilities that raise the limit level for the characters. If you do one of those then use Limit you can choose from Lv 1 and Lv 2.
    Damn thats so wild, they really made the combat super intricate
        Yeah you get the second Remake limit breaks like “Ascension” for cloud, or “catastrophe” for Barret, as a level 2 limit breaks in rebirth. 

Certain Synergy attacks give the level 2 to the characters that that perform the move. You get a little yellow pip next to the limit bar to indicate you’ve got it.
        Yup. Best moment of the game so far for me was doing the cloud/aerith synergy into ascension and planetary protection. Granted... the Aerith Limit 2 wasn't necessary since Ascension killed the boss. BUT... it's the cool factor that counts.
Aerith said she got hands for they asses 😂
sounds like it may be a xenoblade 1 melia situation, where she’s shit for brains level bad when controlled by AI but the best character in the game when controlled by the player
What are you talking about? Aerith AI in demo always try to stay on the ward if there's one. She will only get off it when enemies move too far away from her as she will chase after them, or when those Elphadunk or something pull her to them with their ability.

Aggro in this game kinda work as it support to, character who deal most damage will be targeted, so the character you control won't be the aggro magnet anymore. Of course that gonna lead to another problems because range character trend to deal a lot of damage so they will aggro enemies very often.
Lol so it wasn't just me then? I swear they hateeee her so much 😆
Lol. Aerith said she wants all the smoke.
Oh Jesus I hated that in the remake, especially in the freaking Haunted House fight, where she kept running up to the house and getting killed by melee attacks.
A little maybe but every review says the game is way harder than remake.
Part 3 is gonna be insane
Do you have elemental+thunder materia on her weapon?  You can hear the characters saying that magic will burst the bubbles quicker during the fight
    Just magic in general works on the bubbles I think.
    Ah mustve missed it when they said it, thanks. I also missed the Phoenix summon and the last chocobo stop first time around.
Even more broken!  They have a 100% hit rate now.  Charging 2 ATB for them is reasonable, though, I think.
    Wait for real? Im not sure if it needed 100% accuracy
    Oh does Blizzaga stick to the enemy like Aero now? I think Blizzard/Blizzara still stay in place.
I mean, it was only surprising because there was no swimming in the og. And of course, I went right into combat, lol. Can't really tell if you're being sardonic or not.
    no. i didn't realize u could swim either. i booted up just to see if i could get to the tiny island suuure enough i got there. thanks for the tip!!
        My bad 😆. I'm so used to snark on social media I just got defensive.
When you put it that way though all FF16 is, is button mashing and cycling the same abilities. I love both games, with their respective combat systems, both being complex in their own ways. 

Just because there are menus for ability usage, doesn’t make it bad. They do things this way because you can control several different characters, all with their own play styles. FF16 you play as 1 character. That’s it. The two games aren’t even comparable in my opinion other than they share names and lore.
    Only if you're average:

  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJXxExdEWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJXxExdEWo)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7EP74DsBQ)
    The thing about FF16's combat though is you CAN button mash, but it's not necessary. Just like DMC games, the combat is as shallow or deep as you're willing to make it. When I play DMC5 Bloody Palace, of course I could spam Vergil's AOE moves or Dante's Dr. Faust broken ass attacks. But, I don't HAVE to...I can instead go for crazily creative combos and emphasize style. Same with FF16; you can invent creative, extreme combos using pinpoint precise timing and inputs.

The problem I have with FF7R is it really doesn't allow for this level of creativity. Every enemy has a meta tactic that's almost hard enforced. You can't easily play around the "correct" approach to any particular encounter.
        Ah, I do get what you mean actually. It really just comes down to preference. You make some valid arguments though.
        They're two different games. FF16 = DMC. FF7R = Closer to classic JRPG
Maybe if you are a DMC buff but for the average player the combat got pretty samey. Most people never had a reason to use something like charge magic or burning blade in their playthrough.
You can literally go through the whole game doing the same thing. True, if you want to want to optimize your damage **for no reason at all** you can do that and it becomes more challenging, but I wouldn't call that good design by any stretch of imagination. I play a fair amount of fighting games, so I'm no stranger to action combat and frame-perfect inputs. But these games make you think and give you a reason to mixup your attacks and adapt your high level strategy based on the fight and matchups. FF16 does none of those. It's stupidly trivial, unless you want to make up your own personal challenges that the game doesn't reward.

It's too early for me to judge Rebirth's combat. Maybe it's not that deep either, or maybe it's too confusing and convoluted, I don't know yet. But it can't be worse than the boring combat of FF16.
    You can get through remake by mashing square. Player expression is up to...the player. FF16 has more in depth combat mechanics than FF7 but where ff7 shines is the multiple characters 
        I'd like to see you going through Remake on Normal difficulty mashing square and not using skills.
            You can mash square and potion dump your way through any fight. And by skills you mean crappy menu "gameplay" and using the ATB you get from simply running around lmao. There is a reason they nerfed ATB gaining from running in rebirth because it was a shit way to compensate for the grounded combat. Fortunately they improved upon that in rebirth. To even use skills like a real game with peak combat you have to hot key them and you can only use 4. You lost all credibility because the way you are complaining about 16 combat is EXACTLY how you can play remake. Mash square ATB charge use a braindead skill. In 16 mash square eikon recharge use them
                But you literally can’t. I’d like to see you beat Hell House with just mashing the attack button lmao.
                    ...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
                        Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
                You can just spam stinger and holy waters in DMC and beat the game, but that doesn’t mean the game lacks depth. Refusing to engage with the mechanics just because it’s possible and then claiming the games design is bad is really not a strong argument.
                    Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
        Clives eikon moves felt the same to me overall so while there was more “depth” it felt very shallow to me peesonally
Wrong sub. XVI is not fun.
    Fanboy alert.
FF16 is a perfectly engineered game, not just combat but also world, story, etc. It wasn't overly ambitious. It's exactly the kind of game CBU3 does. The only downside is they scaled the difficulty too low.
They think micromanaging and menu-diving for every attack is the same thing as complexity.
    Yeah the menu managing is ass. I try to stay away from the menu as much as possible with the shortcuts 
        I wish i was that good haha sometimes i hit the menu just for the slow down so i can plot what abilities i should use next. Gives it a strategic feel too
            It really just muscle memory. I kept messing up in the demo because I usually have braver set to L1 triangle but in the demo its square. It becomes automatic lol
                You can change the battle settings
                You know you can change that lol
At least now they clearly indicate which skills will hit a flying enemy.
Omg they were frustrating, they kept flying into me and moving the characters around the map

Its hard to believe they went from a masterpiece with remake's battle system and took a dump on it with the overcomplexity of rebirth

I hope the game is better with regards to mp and magic power (using cura only healed 4-600, what kind of shit is that???)
Yea I'm forced to, cuz they can't even hold their own lol
That kind of sucks though, because the optimal way to play involves switching characters the moment you use a skill/spell, so you don't even get to see the resulting animation.
Had no idea about the elementals being able to heal you! Tbh i mashed hard tru hard mode and didn't put a lot of thought into it. Also
Idk if its that way but my dmg was LOW.
I mashed my way through! But the guardians of destiny ..... i had no chance :( i ended up giving up on the plat.

I asked for some tips in a couple of communities and received responses like, HAHA hard mode was easy af 🤦🏻‍♂️🥲
    Well, you need to use the weapons with reprieve, basically and I had everyone with maxed revive and each character with a specific function, I also used elemental on my armor so the guardians healed my characters with their magic
        Dammnnn, i tried a few made up strats but honestly they were really fucking me up 😂
            for the 3 sentinels I was too destroyed in seconds but BUILD tifa for atb fast regenerate and spam her move star shower,she carried me trough this bullshit
                Ill try that out before rebirth comes out. Also ill be playing the dlc to get back into things
Exactly. The flying bird (not sure what name it is) at the open field is pretty annoying too.
    Idk how to pressure it
        I’m on my second run of the Junon demo, and boy does Assess really help lol. Try assessing all the enemies during combat, and if you fail, just re-try the challenge again. I’m still figuring out how the synergy abilities work during combat
            Yeah it says dodge a specific attack but idk which attack that is. is it cacophony?
                Can’t remember the name of the attack, but it’s the one where the bird is gonna charge towards you. You’d have to dodge that one to get him pressured.
How do I air attack with Tifa? I could do air attacks just fine with Cloud, but doing the same thing (dodge and then hold square) on Tifa just makes her do an uppercut for some reason.
    I believe she has a synergy with Barrett which throws her into the air. I’ve not played around with her much yet myself.
Oh nice! Thanks! :)
maybe we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image properly but thats just me.
    There is a materia that gives you a bigger perfect block window if you're struggling with it
        I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.
            It would have made Sephiroth a cake walk in episode 1
                Tbh Cloud’s punisher stance block counters made Sephiroth quite easy in the first game too.
                    It didn't on Hard mode 😭
        im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
            lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.
                I can flex just fine. Its not my problem you couldn't actually comprehend what i was struggling with despite me spelling it out twice. Where did i say i struggle to find the perfect block window? and even my prior comment i clearly said ''im struggling to see, not block'' It is making my job harder because instead of %100 focusing on the battle i have to %50 focus on the image and then %50 focus on the battle. 

Lobotomy hitting hard i see if you cant even comprehend that. In my original comment also i said ''we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image'' meaning my issue is not doing perfect guards but the fact that image being blurry makes it harder than it should be and you're like just practice bro ? practice for what ? blurry IQ and shitty camera angles ?  this is such a stupid argument. 

And the advice was ''just make your experience game journalist difficulty by using materia bro'' when i can see the image, i can perfect block just fine but not every instance is the same, some sections of the game are affected less by the blur than others which causes inconsistency.

 Such an easy concept to understand but half the thread is too busy bootlicking. And what does your last sentence have to do with anything?  Did i say somewhere that i wanna beat the game without playing it or something ? thats like saying well you wouldn't be alive without breathing air. No shit sherlock thanks.
                    Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
                        Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better. 

Do you think Shroud would perform the same way as he does if he was playing with 480p at 45 fps ? No, he wouldn't. Is it his aim thats worse? Does he need to practice more? No, he needs proper vision to see and read his target on the screen. Case and point. Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
            You're right. It's the game that's wrong, not you.
                Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
    yeah,why we didn't see every move enemy telegraphed by red text? how I supposed to block this focusing on one monster moves meanwhile second monster can hit you off screen...
I just finished replaying Remake, and having just finished FFXVI before it, I found myself missing the dodge and parry mechanics from XVI; Remake's combat felt simplistic by comparison.

But I got into the rhythm again and that feeling disappeared after just a couple chapters.

And then I tried the Junon demo, and...

Be careful what you wish for, people. That's all I'm saying.
Rebirth has an ATB gauge, the transmuted is a great addition as it keeps you from having to spend Gil, and every character also has mp. And I have a surplus of gold. So....
Everything you just said is wrong its almost impressive lol i have way too much money for everything, transmuter is sick especially when you get chips and levels, the combat system is way better and more complex now and sooo fun, you can also just use an aggro ability to pull aggro to your tank and mp is fine? Just use items or drain to get mp back. Not a problem at all. Idt ive ever ran out of mp once.
lol I have so much money I can’t spend it all. Not sure what you’re talking about. Const is great. Aggro is a bit strong I agree
Honestly, I blame all the couch potato no life whiners who have no job, no life, and said that Remake was either ‘too easy’ or ‘not hard enough’. Remake was fine difficulty-wise. Here, it’s hard, because they added new things. Artificial difficulty spike, I’m guessing.
    I got better at it as time went on, but Aerith still absolutely sucks to play. 

Insane aggro + fucking forever and a half to build up even one bar of ATB. Ugh.
It's not that bad, you gotta strategise a bit more to beat your enemies. There are some fights that are really painful without a ranged fighter. Some fights benefit from heavy hitters, some require magic. It's just about figuring it out. You can't pick your favourite team and roll with them through the whole game because it'll punish you pretty hard.
Do you mean the demo? Or the game? Bc the game I literally can’t spend my gold up lol
Aerith feels like a black mage from ff14 and im loving it, I missed my ley lines
You only have to press dodge once to use Cloud's blade beams just FYI. Also Red does the same synergy skill as Cloud/Barrett, except it's magic.
    Noted. Yeah tried it out today after learning you can also hold square to launch into the air.
Also if you hold Cloud's attack after a dodge instead of just attacking he'll dash up to the enemy and do air combos.
Also it seems like Tifa/Barrett synergy skills launch tifa into the air, which could be helpful for aerials.
Dodge then hold square for aerial attacks with cloud
It’s too much. Look at what you just wrote. How am I supposed to keep track of all that. Remake combat was perfect, I never found there was something I couldn’t do with a character. Yuffie kept it interesting with some new mechanics in Intergrade. But this is way too complex.
    Relax. Junon is a few chapters into the game. We'll get the hang of it as we play from the start.
    It’s only 4 button presses he wrote about for Red XIII, not exactly war and peace.
    Even the original FF7 was too much when you got all the characters, it's one of those games where I didn't use all the characters.

The confusion comes from the fact that there are now more than 4 characters. It gets a bit more complex with 6 characters, and in part 3 we will have Cid and Vincent too.
        So I got to play the Chadley missions and realized it flows well. There is a bit too much still — the extra synergy attacks are easy to forget about it, for instance, but overall it’s solid. I recant my complaint, actually.
    Just take it slowly. Replay the tutorial until you get the gist.
    Git Gud

Or just spam spells for stagger and pure damage tbh 

Or there’s always easy mode
    Sometimes describing something with words is more complicated than just doing it.  Just takes a bit of practice.

There are bound to be simpler characters and more complex characters.  I doubt there will be many points of the game where Red is mandatory.  Cosmo Canyon, probably, but not too much more than that.

A player who struggles with aerial combat can just use Barret and Aerith anytime they come up, or even for nearly the entire game if they like, and they'll be fine.
I saw multiple "first 4 hours preview" and that is 100% the case. You don't even have ANY synergy abilities and barely any synergy skills. You have to get them through the skill tree, so it should be a very balanced learning curve.
Most likely. Remember that most of the abilities and materia you can use in the demo (espevially the sinergies attacks) won't be available from the start
Nope.
    Hahah! Well, sort of, I mean there's 15+ hours of game you can do before you actually get to that point, and the difficulty is much lower in the actual game. And then there's the battle sim training and monster hunts which are good for practicing. Plus, they removed a bunch of the extra content they'd crammed into that small space for the demo, so overall I'm pretty happy with the final product. Even though I still feel the combat still has a bit too much going on. At least they got rid of the weapon upgrade sphere grid thing, or you could say changed it into the synergy vending machine, which I like a little better since it doesn't change when you change your equipment.
I think that's likely,  as they did the same thing with the FF16 demo.
Well kindaaaaaa


It’s a lot of trial and error.  And the tutorials just tell you what to do but if you kill the enemies with out even doing the teachable mechanic it goes on to the next tutorial.
    All I’m saying is. I just held block and pressed square and triangle and built up synergy and destroyed everything in my path. I actually have been feel v like this game is easier than remake. 

…no one is more shocked than myself about this.
This is a group project.
[https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-dynamic-difficulty-mode-level-scaling/)

Apparently i will be L21. Which is a bit low, but then number does seem rather cosmetic anyway.
Think the vending machine at chocobo farm had one
I missed the Phoenix summon, guess I’m gonna have to start the whole demo over again lol

Edit: I found the thing
    Just reload the demo save point that's what I did. I missed one golden plume the first playthrough myself in addition to the summon so.
        I ended up just replaying it and turns out that’s what I was missing the first time too lol. Haven’t taken down Phoenix to get the summon yet, fought em a few times on the hardest setting and just kinda gave up for a little break
            You have to focus on the other monsters the Phoenix creates they protect him with their links, I used magic A LOT on them to make it easier by hitting them with their weaknesses. I wish comet didn't cost so much it would be helpful for aoe damage. Algic aura enemy skill from remake would help too
                Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
                Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
                    I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.
Does defeating that boss end the demo? I wasn't sure and kinda accidentally stumbled into the marker where a cutscene took over. Didn't exactly mean to as I had other wtuff still out in the open area I wanted to do
    [deleted]
        damn ok guess I'm restarting

I knew that the demo didn't have any actual story quests (why would it?) so I assumed that blue marker was gonna be just a bit of dialogue to introduce us to the area further, not take us away from it, lol. Didn't think it would actually take me onto the main story in a demo...
            This demo just focuses on combat and exploration
I spent 2 hours yesterday on Phoenix and I still haven't been able to beat him. I left it at a pixel but my Tifa only had a pixel as well and I guess Phoenix was a quicker draw than me when we picked our attacks.

But it has been very fun and it shows the depth of the system, since you can be very strategic about it, not only with the items but also strategy in game, positioning, etc.
Damn thats so wild, they really made the combat super intricate
    Yeah you get the second Remake limit breaks like “Ascension” for cloud, or “catastrophe” for Barret, as a level 2 limit breaks in rebirth. 

Certain Synergy attacks give the level 2 to the characters that that perform the move. You get a little yellow pip next to the limit bar to indicate you’ve got it.
    Yup. Best moment of the game so far for me was doing the cloud/aerith synergy into ascension and planetary protection. Granted... the Aerith Limit 2 wasn't necessary since Ascension killed the boss. BUT... it's the cool factor that counts.
Just magic in general works on the bubbles I think.
Ah mustve missed it when they said it, thanks. I also missed the Phoenix summon and the last chocobo stop first time around.
Wait for real? Im not sure if it needed 100% accuracy
Oh does Blizzaga stick to the enemy like Aero now? I think Blizzard/Blizzara still stay in place.
no. i didn't realize u could swim either. i booted up just to see if i could get to the tiny island suuure enough i got there. thanks for the tip!!
    My bad 😆. I'm so used to snark on social media I just got defensive.
Only if you're average:

The thing about FF16's combat though is you CAN button mash, but it's not necessary. Just like DMC games, the combat is as shallow or deep as you're willing to make it. When I play DMC5 Bloody Palace, of course I could spam Vergil's AOE moves or Dante's Dr. Faust broken ass attacks. But, I don't HAVE to...I can instead go for crazily creative combos and emphasize style. Same with FF16; you can invent creative, extreme combos using pinpoint precise timing and inputs.

The problem I have with FF7R is it really doesn't allow for this level of creativity. Every enemy has a meta tactic that's almost hard enforced. You can't easily play around the "correct" approach to any particular encounter.
    Ah, I do get what you mean actually. It really just comes down to preference. You make some valid arguments though.
    They're two different games. FF16 = DMC. FF7R = Closer to classic JRPG
You can get through remake by mashing square. Player expression is up to...the player. FF16 has more in depth combat mechanics than FF7 but where ff7 shines is the multiple characters 
    I'd like to see you going through Remake on Normal difficulty mashing square and not using skills.
        You can mash square and potion dump your way through any fight. And by skills you mean crappy menu "gameplay" and using the ATB you get from simply running around lmao. There is a reason they nerfed ATB gaining from running in rebirth because it was a shit way to compensate for the grounded combat. Fortunately they improved upon that in rebirth. To even use skills like a real game with peak combat you have to hot key them and you can only use 4. You lost all credibility because the way you are complaining about 16 combat is EXACTLY how you can play remake. Mash square ATB charge use a braindead skill. In 16 mash square eikon recharge use them
            But you literally can’t. I’d like to see you beat Hell House with just mashing the attack button lmao.
                ...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
                    Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
            You can just spam stinger and holy waters in DMC and beat the game, but that doesn’t mean the game lacks depth. Refusing to engage with the mechanics just because it’s possible and then claiming the games design is bad is really not a strong argument.
                Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
    Clives eikon moves felt the same to me overall so while there was more “depth” it felt very shallow to me peesonally
Fanboy alert.
Yeah the menu managing is ass. I try to stay away from the menu as much as possible with the shortcuts 
    I wish i was that good haha sometimes i hit the menu just for the slow down so i can plot what abilities i should use next. Gives it a strategic feel too

        for the 3 sentinels I was too destroyed in seconds but BUILD tifa for atb fast regenerate and spam her move star shower,she carried me trough this bullshit
            Ill try that out before rebirth comes out. Also ill be playing the dlc to get back into things
Idk how to pressure it
    I’m on my second run of the Junon demo, and boy does Assess really help lol. Try assessing all the enemies during combat, and if you fail, just re-try the challenge again. I’m still figuring out how the synergy abilities work during combat
        Yeah it says dodge a specific attack but idk which attack that is. is it cacophony?
            Can’t remember the name of the attack, but it’s the one where the bird is gonna charge towards you. You’d have to dodge that one to get him pressured.
I believe she has a synergy with Barrett which throws her into the air. I’ve not played around with her much yet myself.
There is a materia that gives you a bigger perfect block window if you're struggling with it
    I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.

                It didn't on Hard mode 😭
    im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
        lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.

            Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
yeah,why we didn't see every move enemy telegraphed by red text? how I supposed to block this focusing on one monster moves meanwhile second monster can hit you off screen...
I got better at it as time went on, but Aerith still absolutely sucks to play. 

Insane aggro + fucking forever and a half to build up even one bar of ATB. Ugh.
Noted. Yeah tried it out today after learning you can also hold square to launch into the air.
Relax. Junon is a few chapters into the game. We'll get the hang of it as we play from the start.
It’s only 4 button presses he wrote about for Red XIII, not exactly war and peace.
Even the original FF7 was too much when you got all the characters, it's one of those games where I didn't use all the characters.

The confusion comes from the fact that there are now more than 4 characters. It gets a bit more complex with 6 characters, and in part 3 we will have Cid and Vincent too.
    So I got to play the Chadley missions and realized it flows well. There is a bit too much still — the extra synergy attacks are easy to forget about it, for instance, but overall it’s solid. I recant my complaint, actually.
Just take it slowly. Replay the tutorial until you get the gist.
Git Gud

Or just spam spells for stagger and pure damage tbh 

Or there’s always easy mode
Sometimes describing something with words is more complicated than just doing it.  Just takes a bit of practice.

There are bound to be simpler characters and more complex characters.  I doubt there will be many points of the game where Red is mandatory.  Cosmo Canyon, probably, but not too much more than that.

A player who struggles with aerial combat can just use Barret and Aerith anytime they come up, or even for nearly the entire game if they like, and they'll be fine.
Hahah! Well, sort of, I mean there's 15+ hours of game you can do before you actually get to that point, and the difficulty is much lower in the actual game. And then there's the battle sim training and monster hunts which are good for practicing. Plus, they removed a bunch of the extra content they'd crammed into that small space for the demo, so overall I'm pretty happy with the final product. Even though I still feel the combat still has a bit too much going on. At least they got rid of the weapon upgrade sphere grid thing, or you could say changed it into the synergy vending machine, which I like a little better since it doesn't change when you change your equipment.
All I’m saying is. I just held block and pressed square and triangle and built up synergy and destroyed everything in my path. I actually have been feel v like this game is easier than remake. 

…no one is more shocked than myself about this.
Just reload the demo save point that's what I did. I missed one golden plume the first playthrough myself in addition to the summon so.
    I ended up just replaying it and turns out that’s what I was missing the first time too lol. Haven’t taken down Phoenix to get the summon yet, fought em a few times on the hardest setting and just kinda gave up for a little break
        You have to focus on the other monsters the Phoenix creates they protect him with their links, I used magic A LOT on them to make it easier by hitting them with their weaknesses. I wish comet didn't cost so much it would be helpful for aoe damage. Algic aura enemy skill from remake would help too
            Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
            Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
                I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.

    damn ok guess I'm restarting

I knew that the demo didn't have any actual story quests (why would it?) so I assumed that blue marker was gonna be just a bit of dialogue to introduce us to the area further, not take us away from it, lol. Didn't think it would actually take me onto the main story in a demo...
        This demo just focuses on combat and exploration
Yeah you get the second Remake limit breaks like “Ascension” for cloud, or “catastrophe” for Barret, as a level 2 limit breaks in rebirth. 

Certain Synergy attacks give the level 2 to the characters that that perform the move. You get a little yellow pip next to the limit bar to indicate you’ve got it.
Yup. Best moment of the game so far for me was doing the cloud/aerith synergy into ascension and planetary protection. Granted... the Aerith Limit 2 wasn't necessary since Ascension killed the boss. BUT... it's the cool factor that counts.
My bad 😆. I'm so used to snark on social media I just got defensive.
Ah, I do get what you mean actually. It really just comes down to preference. You make some valid arguments though.
They're two different games. FF16 = DMC. FF7R = Closer to classic JRPG
I'd like to see you going through Remake on Normal difficulty mashing square and not using skills.
    You can mash square and potion dump your way through any fight. And by skills you mean crappy menu "gameplay" and using the ATB you get from simply running around lmao. There is a reason they nerfed ATB gaining from running in rebirth because it was a shit way to compensate for the grounded combat. Fortunately they improved upon that in rebirth. To even use skills like a real game with peak combat you have to hot key them and you can only use 4. You lost all credibility because the way you are complaining about 16 combat is EXACTLY how you can play remake. Mash square ATB charge use a braindead skill. In 16 mash square eikon recharge use them
        But you literally can’t. I’d like to see you beat Hell House with just mashing the attack button lmao.
            ...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
                Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
        You can just spam stinger and holy waters in DMC and beat the game, but that doesn’t mean the game lacks depth. Refusing to engage with the mechanics just because it’s possible and then claiming the games design is bad is really not a strong argument.
            Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
Clives eikon moves felt the same to me overall so while there was more “depth” it felt very shallow to me peesonally
I wish i was that good haha sometimes i hit the menu just for the slow down so i can plot what abilities i should use next. Gives it a strategic feel too
    It really just muscle memory. I kept messing up in the demo because I usually have braver set to L1 triangle but in the demo its square. It becomes automatic lol
        You can change the battle settings
        You know you can change that lol
Dammnnn, i tried a few made up strats but honestly they were really fucking me up 😂
    for the 3 sentinels I was too destroyed in seconds but BUILD tifa for atb fast regenerate and spam her move star shower,she carried me trough this bullshit
        Ill try that out before rebirth comes out. Also ill be playing the dlc to get back into things
I’m on my second run of the Junon demo, and boy does Assess really help lol. Try assessing all the enemies during combat, and if you fail, just re-try the challenge again. I’m still figuring out how the synergy abilities work during combat
    Yeah it says dodge a specific attack but idk which attack that is. is it cacophony?
        Can’t remember the name of the attack, but it’s the one where the bird is gonna charge towards you. You’d have to dodge that one to get him pressured.
I love perfect blocking things. Sekiro, Lies of P and now FFVII. So excited to do this in the full game.
    It would have made Sephiroth a cake walk in episode 1
        Tbh Cloud’s punisher stance block counters made Sephiroth quite easy in the first game too.
            It didn't on Hard mode 😭
im struggling to see. not block. im not about to take the easy way out, how would i enjoy that..i'm not gonna destory my pride as someone who beat sword saint isshin in his 3rd try lol. games camera is also janky ngl my camera kept going to the grass when i was fighting those griffin type fiends.
    lol you can’t try to flex after struggling to find the perfect block window. Practice! You wouldn’t have beaten Isshin before actually playing Sekiro for the first time.
        I can flex just fine. Its not my problem you couldn't actually comprehend what i was struggling with despite me spelling it out twice. Where did i say i struggle to find the perfect block window? and even my prior comment i clearly said ''im struggling to see, not block'' It is making my job harder because instead of %100 focusing on the battle i have to %50 focus on the image and then %50 focus on the battle. 

Lobotomy hitting hard i see if you cant even comprehend that. In my original comment also i said ''we could do more perfect guards if we could actually see the image'' meaning my issue is not doing perfect guards but the fact that image being blurry makes it harder than it should be and you're like just practice bro ? practice for what ? blurry IQ and shitty camera angles ?  this is such a stupid argument. 

And the advice was ''just make your experience game journalist difficulty by using materia bro'' when i can see the image, i can perfect block just fine but not every instance is the same, some sections of the game are affected less by the blur than others which causes inconsistency.

 Such an easy concept to understand but half the thread is too busy bootlicking. And what does your last sentence have to do with anything?  Did i say somewhere that i wanna beat the game without playing it or something ? thats like saying well you wouldn't be alive without breathing air. No shit sherlock thanks.
            Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
                Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better. 

Do you think Shroud would perform the same way as he does if he was playing with 480p at 45 fps ? No, he wouldn't. Is it his aim thats worse? Does he need to practice more? No, he needs proper vision to see and read his target on the screen. Case and point. Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
    You're right. It's the game that's wrong, not you.

Is it all a coincidence that whenever the image is clean and readable i can perfectly block just fine but whenever the blurriness hurts the readibility of the enemy, i struggle to see their animations and therefore lag behind in action ? That is clearly not my fault. Its funny to me you are defending something in the game that actually happens in real life too..Do you think you have the same reaction time in a sunny day with clear lighting in a park VS in a bad lit neighborhood at night ? If you do, congratulations, you are the first human in history to achieve that. Go to the hospital so that they can experiment with your brain so we can all benefit from that.

By the time i get to the end of rebirth, i will still perfectly block when the image doesn't affect how readible the animation is, and i will still struggle to do so when the image makes it hard to read enemy animations. In a dark area, with low contrast enemies, with bad lighting + blurry image you get = unreadiable enemy animations where you have to guess half the damn time.
Game has its own opinions ? Wow thats the first time i'm hearing it. What a revolutionary game indeed.

jokes aside what is your point ? are you arguing against the fact that game is somehow not super muddy ? What am i wrong about exactly ? At this point everybody acknowledges the blurry IQ being an issue...you dont wanna take my word for it ? you're welcome to do so. There are dozens of analysists out there who do this for a living saying the exact same thing. Again before typing comments like this, make sure you comprehend what im writing. Nowhere in my post, am i complaining about not being able to block but how the IQ is causing problems to do so. Why are people acting like as if FF7 is a hard game or something lmao.
Excellent advice, thank you for that. It also helps if you work it from the bottom up, kinda disappointing you get the Phoenix summon beating the weakest level but the step by steps help up to the full fight. Elemental and ice on Cloud helped a lot, braver punishes Phoenix when he’s staggered and so much yes on taking out the other monsters first.
Oh also thanks to someone else on this sub, you can link comet with synergy so Red or whoever has it linked will automatically cast it without consuming MP or ATB whenever you use magic. That feels like a hack and a half, super powerful Materia that can be spammed
    I wasn't aware that synergy didn't cost anything, nice.
...you can tho hell house isn't immune to physical damage even when he switches his magic States. You can just outlast him with a ton of potions 
    Sure, if you want the fight to last over an hour. That wouldn’t work against late game bosses like the Arsenal and Sephiroth though where you need to beat them within a time limit before they wipe out your entire party with an ultimate attack.
Not to mention that shit won't work on harder difficulties or on Bloody Palace.

FF16 was more forgiving than DMC but still offered the player very open ended options for creativity in combat. FF7R does to some extent but it's ultimately handicapped by how restrictive the resource management is, as well as the lack of direct input/output combat, lack of iframe dodging, etc.
It didn't on Hard mode 😭
Ironic that you can’t understand my last sentence when all you’re doing is complaining that people don’t understand you. We do understand you, we just know that you’re complaining because you’re struggling to perfect one of the mechanics of a game you’ve barely played, it’s alright, you’ll get better. Don’t blame the game for your timing issues.

My last sentence drew off the fact that you beat Isshin in 3 tries, which you compared to perfect blocking here. But you’ve played all of Sekiro before facing Isshin, whereas you’ve only played the demo of this. By the time you get to the end of rebirth, you’ll be perfect blocking as easily as you parried Isshin. It’s a pretty basic comparison.
    Before continuing, no, you clearly, do not understand me. As for your last sentence, i couldn't understand it because you worded it weirdly but now that you are contextualizing it in a better way. I see what you are saying but i don't agree with your take. While the comparison is indeed basic its not equal.

In no other souls game is the parrying the correct way to play. its optional. But in Sekiro, the correct way to play is parrying properly and on top of that Sekiro's combat was different than any other DS game while we are already familiar with FF7Reb's combat from Remake even if its a tad bit revamped..

Neither my nor your timing in Sekiro has gotten better from the start of the game to the end of it. You just learn the game, boss patterns and what you are suppose to do when you read their moves and you mistake that with as your ''my timing has gotten better'' which is half-true but its not your reaction time that improves its your reading of the opponent. Which actually explains why i did not struggle with isshin that much because isshin is the epitome of sekiro's combat, if you can read him, he is easy.

People struggle on it because they cant read him. Which is where the FF7Reb issue comes in, Im struggling to read the moves because the image is blurry as shit but when i can properly see the image, i can perfectly block just fine with no issue. So again, you are wrong, im not struggling to perfect the block, im struggling to perfect blurry, jagged image quality. Go tell someone who needs glasses to practice without them so he gets better.
