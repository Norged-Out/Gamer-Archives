[[The one downgrade in Rebirth is the party battle banter]]


I replayed Remake directly before Rebirth and I had forgotten how much the party talked to each other during/after battle. It happened enough that I can never bring myself to play in Japanese because they don't subtitle it. Remake didn't have the party focused side quests that Rebirth has so it was a surprisingly effective and economical way to characterize the party.

While I loved Rebirth as much as anybody else, I was surprised at how much I missed this. I understand with more party members and the ability to pretty much combine them however would have required more development, BUT it's made even worse with how many post-battle quips they reuse from Remake (and how few there seem to be at all anyway), except this time nobody reacts. I don't think you could fairly call any part of Rebirth "lazy", but it does seem like they cut a corner here.

The most frustrating one is Yuffie's "What's one word to describe me? I'm thinking legendary." Not only is it annoying that no one ever responds, Sonon's "mmmm...humble" was maybe the best example of this in Remake. (Also it's funny to imagine Yuffie being repeating herself and going crazy not only from grief about Sonon but also because her new friends never once humor her in battle like he did)

I know they said they aren't doing a Yuffie-style DLC for Rebirth, but I'm sure they're going to do some kind of polishing and light content updates for the PC release (and so they can re-release it on PS5 as a GOTY edition). More battle dialogue seems like something they could do if they were already bringing in actors to record for the next game or whatever.


Just like that okay?
    No surprises there.
        I’ll show you what I can do
            Could really use a shower.
                *Would kill for a shower
                    So you need me, huh?
                    *would kill you for a shower
            I'm coming!
    Sure thing coach !
        Why are all these so horny? Or am i just horny?
            Sounds like you could use a shower.
    I GOTCHA
I think probably Red had a word with Tifa offscreen about her hygiene, so she’s staying on top of her showering needs better in Rebirth
    When you get dunked in the lifestream it's like taking a super shower so you're good for a few months
        Honestly that feels grosser somehow, like if I just stayed clean on my own for months and didn’t need a shower? Something’s wrong there.
            The devs explain how it all works in the Ultimania that just came out but I don't think it's been translated yet. It's going to be really important to the plot in the next game when Cloud doesn't have to shower anymore either
                Cloud defeats Sephiroth by in a smelling good competition instead of a shirtless swordfight
                    god can you imagine how good Sephiroth smells down there? He's been marinating in lifestream for years!

        I smell a business idea: Lifestream body wash, hopes and dreams scented.
            Yeah I used to think the life stream was radioactive or something but anytime anyone falls into it it turns out really well for them.

“Hey buddy, you smell like you returned to the planet. Fix it with life stream body wash.”
The only time I noticed this was during the final boss gauntlet. I think it would have been worthwhile to record unique battle dialogue here considering what had just happened and the circumstances.

Going from Tifa crying and horribly distraught straight back into “give it your all!” and “You’re gonna feel this one!” felt a little out of place to me.
    My favourite was when using Cloud's limit on Sephiroth - something along the lines of "It's nothing personal". 

I'm pretty sure this one is personal, Cloud.
        I think the voiceline for Ascension is "let's dance asshole"
    I noticed this too. It’s particularly odd as they changed Barrett’s lines during the Dyne battle, so I thought they would do the same for the final battle after such a pivotal moment.
    Yeah I had the same feeling. Would’ve been a cool touch but oh well.
    I didnt like some of the dialog written for that battle. Caits quips about dropping in and swinging by seem out of place considering the horrible events that theu just witnessed before fighting the space alien.
I really liked how in Remake Barret and Cloud’s after-battle dialogue got more and more friendly as the game progressed. By the end of the game, they both compliment each other if you end a fight with high HP. If you’re low HP, Cloud says something like, “I’ll do better,” and Barret responds, “It’s all good, man.”
    Im pretty sure if you end a fight where tifa/aerith went down he calls himself a dumbass and berates himself
Briana mentioned in one of her streams that the reason for no new battle lines was so that it was a way to stay connected from remake.
    That’s a pretty weak excuse.
    Oh cool she started streaming Rebirth? How far into it is she?

So they wanted to retain continuity from remake by having the same battle lines? Interesting, I wonder if they'll do the same for part 3.

I thought they DID have some new battle voice lines, and that they just removed some from Remake (Tifa's shower line, others) and added in some new ones.
        She's got through the mythril mines and created a save. She said she's going to clean up the world Intel in the grasslands off stream. 

I wish she would stream it all or at least record it. A lot of charm in pretty much all the cut scenes that I'd like to see her reaction to
            Yeah I would love to see her reaction to the flower picking sidequest in the grasslands at least.
                Her streams are on YouTube already.
After hearing Tifa say she could really use a shower 8000 times. I’m fine with less party banter
    Was that a line that anyone in the party responded to? I don't remember anyone ever reacting to it, would have been great if Barret told Tifa she reeked or something lol
CHOKE ON IT ASSHOLE
Cloud saying “back to the planet” as I hit the Arial ability is pretty sick tho lol
I miss the after battle dialogue, they had so much personality. 

Cloud: Keep those gloves up.
Tifa: Sure thing coach.
I do miss how tight remake was with it being almost entirely linear, I know you don't have to do the side quests in rebirth but it does break the pacing when cloud won't actually talk to Aerith for 20 hours.
Keep those gloves up
    Sure thing coach
Barret: Hey, did you see me in action?!
Cloud: must have missed it.
Cloud: lets dance, asshole!

Tifa: hang in there!

Barret: firing one off!

Aerith: lemme show you what I can do!

Square…please, please, PLEASE have the actors record a shit ton more! There should be no excuses going into game 3. We should have basically brand new *everything* for this trilogies final hoorah.
I think there were complaints about how repetitive they were, tifa talking about showers became a meme for a reason lol, they probably heard how they got annoying after so many loops, and decided to cut it all, but most ppl wanted more variation or just a little less
The best thing you can do whenever Yuffie opens her mouth is to ignore her and act as if the dumbass doesn't exist.
No surprises there.
