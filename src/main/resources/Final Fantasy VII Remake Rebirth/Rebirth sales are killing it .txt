Famitsu reports that the March PHYSICAL sales of rebirth were the highest of all software sales  in Japan. Over 300k. 

Keep in mind this is just Japan. And just physical sales in a time when physical sales are a fraction of digital. Below are a source for how much physical sales in the US have declined despite large increase in overall sales of video game stuff. I imagine Japan is similar if not worse, especially since physical pace in japan is so limited and Japan has essentially become a handheld market instead of console.

Before people claim that rebirth sold less than 16, remember that rebirth sales were split between it and the twin-pack. In Feb, despite being only 1 day in, was the number 2 game, while twin-pack was number 8. One day into Feb.   https://x.com/mrpyo1/status/1770804261074468928?s=46

Edit: Per this article, rebirth sold in 1 day better than 16 did in 10 days. 

Respectfully, all of the content creators who jumped on the conjecture that rebirth sold bad need to really think twice before click-baiting, and instead wait for actual clear evidence. 




I feel like Square expects the trilogy to “sell over time”. And it absolutely will. There are still a ton of people that have Remake on their backlog, or haven’t jumped into Rebirth yet since it’s still so new. And on top of this, you have people playing through the entirety of FFVII and Crisis Core before jumping into the Remake series. Either way, Square is indirectly getting a lot of profit from these games, just as another commenter has mentioned. 

I also expect this game to win many awards, and that will definitely boost its sales too. While it’s my personal GOTY so far, if it doesn’t win at least Best Music or best RPG I’d be shocked. This game feels monumental for what it’s able to accomplish. It’s just not everyone has come around yet. But they will. Same story as Nier Automata. It’ll get there.
    Yeah, I feel like the trilogy was not only made to sell itself over time, but to sell the other relate products as well.

Between Remake and Rebirth we had: The Crisis Core Remaster, The Ever Crisis Mobile Game, and the (dead on arrival) Battle Royale.

Which does make me a little worried about part 3, unless they unveil a new product to also sell there, or are hoping the FF7 gacha will last a long time.
        I'm anticipating a Dirge of Cerberus remaster. It would make sense as a way to hype Vincent up before he becomes playable in part 3. And would match how they did CCR before Part 2 as a way to hype up Zack being relevant
            Its gonna be so bad but so good
            Is there any DLC planned for Rebirth? A Vincent DLC not unlike the Yuffie DPC could do the same.
                I believe they have confirmed there will not be any DLC between part 2 and 3
                    Dirge of Cerberus remaster it is then ha.
        That's what I'm a bit worried about. I think Square corporate is punking the FF Managment team for this multimedia hit and after Ever Crisis and adjacent sub-projects flopped they may not be as lenient with teh money spent on the big 3 games. I'm really fearful that Part 3 will be a departure in quality because I've just seen that so many time before. Uncharted 3, Jak 3, Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 3. Where the publisher is like "Y U no make more money!?!?" and start to impose ridiculous mandates that end up messing with the creative effort, and leading to a really rushed deadline.
            Yh I worry about this. Rebirth was great but as with every recent square rpg since the 00’s, there are massive issues with it. Issues that can be overlooked because the overall package is fantastic, but the open world tower design and repetitive icon hunting really became a drag by the time you get to gongaga/cosmo. I bloody loved the game, my GOTY for sure, nothing will come close. But I felt the same with 16. It was brilliant for different reasons but I had a bit of a sour taste in my mouth for everything it got so wrong. Rebirth is better than 16 imo but man they need to sort the repetition.

And as to your original point, it being a part 3 has me worried a lesser investment will lead to even more copy and paste side activity design. And we all know from game to game these publishers just HAVE to make it bigger. Way bigger. Can’t wait for all the “the overall map size is 2-3 times the size of rebirth”. That would be absolutely fine, but ONLY if that map is well designed with a frankly staggering amount of worthwhile content. Not time wasting. 

It’s very clear to me that things like the mako springs and divine intel were shoehorned in as filler. Would’ve been so much better if the divine intel was scrapped entirely and you just come across a small cave/dungeon that leads to a cool encounter with the summon in some ethereal way. Not being funny but if fort condor can pull me into some weird world, why can’t a summon entity. Make it make sense, it wouldn’t be difficult in this crazy world!
    It should absolutely win GOTY or its a robbery
        Dude, I'm rooting for rebirth to win goty as much as anyone else here... but it's still april.
            I know it when i see it brudda, stop the count
                Lol, low-key triggered when I see that phrase, stop the count.
                People said that about Zelda tears of the kingdom and then bg3 happened
                    I was one of the people saying BG3 would win months before it even released and everyone was calling me crazy saying there was no chance since it was too niche and TOTK already had it on lock lol. TOTK was way too repetitive and derivative of BOTW for me to think it would win.
                        I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
                            Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
                Sorry my money is on stellar blade.
                Yes, let's not see what other games have to offer, no, let's give the award for copying someone else's homework.

I'm sorry but originality should be a factor when considering games. Why should a remake be given credit when it's every existence is built off of something that worked prior and is selling BECAUSE of the name attached to it.

Seriously, if this game wasn't called FF7 would any of you actually give two hot cares after a month? No, not really. And prove to me otherwise if you can, you won't but you're welcome to try.
            Yeah I remember early on in 2023 everyone was debating if it would be FF16 or tears of the kingdom that would win GOTY. And it ended up being Baldurs gate 3 that swept
                The fact that you forgot about Starfield in there says a lot. It was supposed to be a three way brawl between TotK, FFXVI and Starfield, and then BG3 and Alan Wake 2 kicked out the latter two out of nowhere.
                    Eh unlike others I never bought into Starfield hype. Even the release trailers felt dull to me, and then it actually released and was somehow worse than I was thinking it would be. But yeah 2023 was very dynamic for gaming
            Gotta see what wukong looks like first.
            Your right, better wait till Steller Blade comes out, that ass might take GOTY!, we'll see!.
        The Game Awards is a joke, I still remember the robbery of 2020 (even Ghost of Tsushima deserved it more). Since then I only watched the show just to see new trailers, they lost every bit of reputation to my eyes.
        I don't even think it's game of the month. I finished it and felt like it was the most bloated, boring game I've played in a decade 

I was thoroughly excited. I mastered the original as a teen and couldn't contain my excitement with Remake ... Then I played rebirth. Nostalgia aside, this game feels 10 years past due. 

I really feel like the reviews are bought, its all fake news, and the only people that like the game are the same people who like everything. 

Sales are in the toilet. SE is changing strategy, and it's clear that Rebirth will be seen as a disappointment.
            This opinion is so shit i just down voted and moved on
    Also people that don't own a ps5 yet
    I know several people who are (IMO foolishly considering the amount of gaming involved) waiting for the trilogy to be done before diving in.
    I'm waiting like probably many people, for it to drop on steam
        The remake shot up in sales on steam when rebirth came out so I believe it.
        But, this game created in unreal engine, so there are high chances, again, that this will be on epic exclusive first, then steam. So players will have to wait longer and there are port issues as well.
    Especially since us PC players have to wait!
    I’m just barely getting around to playing Remake (playing on Steamdeck and it’s amazing) and will absolutely be buying Rebirth as well once I can get it on Steam so there is definitely a tail to sales on games like this.
    One of the best games I have ever played. I just finished at over 65 hours. And wasn't bored the whole damn time. They did rebirth (the remake) justice. And did not really deviate from the original story. If anything they made it better.
    There are a lot of people i remember, for both Remake and Rebirth, saying they would wait until the trilogy was done before picking it up. I feel like there will be a small but noticeable spike for Remake/Birth when part 3 comes out.
    'member when games could only physically ever "sell over time" ?

I feel like the last 10 years of gaming have seen decreased quality from established studios in pursuit of juicing quarterly profits.

I'm glad at least some pockets of SquareEnix are insulated from the CEO's bizarre bullshit.
    I'll tell you what. I am glad I waited until a few weeks before the release of Rebirth to sell my extra copy of Remake Deluxe Edition on eBay.
    >While it’s my personal GOTY so far, if it doesn’t win at least Best Music or best RPG I’d be shocked

This is a pretty hot take considering we're less than half way through
        It's a completely reasonable take, a tepid take even, the commenter even qualifies it with "so far" and then takes their expectations down for a future awards season. A hot take would be something like "this is the greatest RPG of the last decade" or something conversation worthy like that at least.
I hope you're right OP. Seeing those constant "Rebirth is not selling well" things was really making me sad because it's one of the best games I've ever played and I want it to do so well. Both to give other games a little inspiration, but also so SE will continue to allow them to go as huge and over the top as they did in Rebirth for the third game. I want 3 to have no compromises and be as good as it deserves to be. 

Spare no expense, if you will
    + OG FF7 shot up to the Top 20 or so on the Nintendo Store for Wii purely based on Rebirth hype. They're raking in hella direct revenue for Rebirth, twin pack sales, and a shitload just from remnant sales of OG.  It is bananas, let alone merchandising, licensing, etc.  Anyone who doesn't see how lucrative this is for SE needs to take a product marketing and econ class or something
    The only reason I'm still slightly concerned is because of Square not making any statements about it. Both 16 and Remake did. But I doubt it's selling badly.
        Does anyone really think Enix would have promoted Hamaguchi if this was disappointing to them?? Lmao people are stupid.
            A game can be a critical success but not necessarily a commercial success. Its widely recognised that this is a great game, and I'm certain that they are making money from it. But square was very quick to parade the sales of FF7 remake and FF16, so why the conspicuous silence here? But still, promoting your top talents is not a bad move from the company especially since Rebirth probably is making them a tidy profit overall, and that they seem to be committed to doing the 3rd part.
                Listen money and business are money and business. No one is being promoted to executive over cute reviews and good fan reception lol.
                    The consumer view of the brand is extraordinarily important. When its clear you've created a quality product, the company can leverage that to make a lot more money down the line through various other means. Lets say this game didn't meet sales expectations hypothetically, the question is does it matter? Well it might not, the fans that did buy are very positive so it raises new income avenues later. My point is, I believe that they are profiting from Rebirth, I don't believe they are meeting forecasts however. But either way, they can still use the quality of this product to make a reasonable sum overall
                        I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
            The promoted him over the critical reception which sits at 90+ on metacritic, the highest since FFX I think. They didn't expect that, they thought it will be similar to Remake's score. Hamaguchi exceeded their expectation. Sales is another matter, more often than not it doesn't reflect the quality of a game.
        It probably didn't break the 3 million sales mark yet, I think that's when they talked about FF16?
    The Rebirth not selling well arguments were all mostly done in bad faith because they didn’t take into account anything other than Japan nor considering the PS5 install base and just compared it to Remake as if Remake didn’t have the benefit of the much larger PS4 install base.
    i think for casual consumers its just too confusing between remake and rebirth and stuff. 

most people already find the way the final fantasy series works to be confusing. they see that theres 16 games and at first glance it looks like an mcu type situation where you have to start from the beginning. so theres already a hump you have to get people over. then people dont understand how the remake works. they thought remake was the entire game and dont understand why theres rebirth coming out. then they look it up and see intermission and intergrade and it makes it worse. then they look it up more and see all the reddit posts and reactions of overeager fan’s over explaining how “uh uh its actually a super meta sequel while also being a remake so honestly you should play the og and the psp game first ☝️🤓” it *is* a confusing story but you should find that out naturally by playing the game. barrier of entry is pretty high so lots of people just dont bother because it seems like too much of a headache
        Also a fair point, I know I avoided the series for a while for those exact reasons. I never played an FF game until Remake. Even then I've only played Remake, Rebirth, OG 7, 15, and 16. 

Either way, like I said I just want it to do really well because it's really special to me
        "Casual" consumers don't care about literally any of that stuff lmfaooo. Casual consumers pick up whatever looks interesting - no search required. This sub alone was full of people being confused because they started with Rebirth - aka they never looked it up and got turned away.

Just saying stuff to say stuff is not good for an argument
        Im a casual gamer and I know the difference.. it's not rocket science..
        No if you're a real casual you would think new game cool imma play it. If you're a "reddit casual" you do a deep dive of an hour to know where to start and than complain it doesn't make sense. Lmao do you understand what casual means? Looking shit up online or  on Reddit posts does not make you a casual ffs.
            in that case casuals arent touching an 80 hour long JRPG lol. clearly i meant more so gamers who arent familiar with FF
We will know soon enough either way but I certainly hope Rebirth is doing great.
    May 13 SE reports figures I don't think they will report anything before this. I think it sold well. Regardless of what the internet says about XVI, si many people beat it. They are likely to buy. It will do well with VII fans. It will do well with JRPG fans because of the crazy good reviews. It got amazing reviews praising its open world which will also be attractive to SP players in general. And not a ton of competition with other titles. I would be shocked if it sold less than 3 million in the quarter they will report on, I expect close to 4 million.
        Im not sure those are great sales. Tears of the kingdom sold 10 million in a weekend .

Sure the switch has a bigger install base still FF7 is one of the most important games of all time and this was a remake. It should have sold unprecedented numbers.

I like the game but I think the market is showing they didn’t like certain decisions square took
            Quick reminder that the Switch has roughly 130 Million Units sold,the PS5 50 Million. Considering that Rebirth is likely a smashing success,not to mention what happens once it hits PC's.
                Rebirth is a success but not a smashing one.  Its still selling less than dragons dogma 2 and helldivers which is a huge success
                    both those games are available for pc day 1, which has an even bigger install base than the switch
                        Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.  


Dragons dogma 2 I believe was third
            Zelda is bigger with casual audiences and is like the big budget swan song game of one of the most successful consoles of all time. I think reunion might eventually get to 10 million but it wont be in 2024 and probably not 2025.
            Final fantasy is just played out for people right now.  No one new wants to play the 16th game of a series or a remake of a 30 year old game
            JRPG audience is not even remotely close to LOZ's casual friendly open world sandbox audience. It's not a worthwhile comparison in the first place
It's funny how OP explains it correctly and some people in the comments still don't understand the Numbers (or anything at all) and make things up.
    Yeah. Not to be mean, but they didn’t read the post nor the sources/articles I posted. Or they didn’t understand.
        Dragon Dogma 2 sold 77k copies in JPN in March and it was said, that it sold 2.5 Million copies Worldwide. 

So, FFVII Rebirth, which sold 310k copies (which is roughly 4 times more then DG 2) in JPN, must have sold around 10 Million Copies Worldwide. 

I believe my Logic is flawless and ultimately the truth. 

/s
        I had a guy arguing with me about sales, telling me my numbers were wrong and thus I must be making it all up, and as proof, he linked me a fucking article that he obviously didn't read because it confirmed my numbers were correct almost exactly..

People are really, really stupid.
        Your math is really shit. Your EU sales is literally just 4% more, which could literally mean 2k copies or 5k copies.
    He's completely fucking wrong that's why.
    OP is making faulty conclusions. Numbers mean nothing in a vacuum. Rebirth sold less than half as much as Remake did in Japan - and Remake underperformed somewhat compared to expectations. Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

The PS5 has a much smaller install base than the PS4, but that doesn't mean Square Enix will be happy with the numbers for Rebirth. After all, it sold around the same as FF16, which also underperformed compared to their expectations.

We can also just look at https://psnprofiles.com/games?order=owners&platform=ps5, to see that Rebirth has a far lower player number than the biggest hits on PS5 - literally less than 10% of the sales of Spiderman: Miles Morales for example.
        >Numbers mean nothing in a vacuum.

He wrote, while looking at all his Numbers he wrote in a Vacuum. 

Breaking News:

FFVII Rebirth Daily Active User Peak was 2.2 Million on Launch on a Console that has around 1/3 of the Units (38 Million) sold, as the PS4 in 2020 (110 Million) when FFVII Remake sold 3.5  Million in a Week.
            Those numbers line up exactly and precisely with what I said. You actually thought they supported your argument and not mine?
                Your Numbers don't line up with what you said at all and than you bring PSN profiles as a Source into this and compare Miles Morales with which released 3,5 years ago with a Game that released a Month ago. This is a site only counts people who registered there and not actual players? You know that, right? You're making a fool out of yourself, if you believe that Sites Numbers mean anything.

>Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

You really try to compare 5,5 years of FFXV which released on PS and XBox with 4 years FFVII which is a PS exclusive?

FFXV released 2016, it took 5,5 years to reach 10 Million Sales and it was Multiplatform from the beginning. It was released on PC 2 years later. 

FFVII released while a Worldwide Lockdown happened and 3.5 Units have been sold in just a week, went to PS5 a year and PC 6 months later and then it reached 7 Million Sales October 2023 (3,5 years later after launch). The PS4 had an install Basis of approximately 110 Million Consoles at the time of the FFVII Remake launch in 2020. FFVII Remake will probably reach 8 or more Million by 2025.  
  
FFVII Rebirth released just now as a PS5 exclusive and has a Install Basis of only 1/3 of the PS4 when Remake released. FFVII Rebirth sold more copies in Europe on day one than FFXVI in 10 days. All that on the PS5 which has an install Basis of only \~40 Million, while Remake has had an install Basis of 108 Million at Launch of Remake. 

Lifetime Sales will be great for both FFVII Rebirth and FFXVI because more People will buy PS5s and some of them will buy at least one of the Main Series FF Titles.
                    Nothing of what you say is wrong (other than the poor wording and grammar of your post), but you're completely missing the point.

Square Enix doesn't make money based on how big the sales are relative to the install base or relative to expected sales in a pandemic or any other "relative to". They make money based on copies sold. When the copies sold are fewer, but they spent the same budget on the product, it does not matter one bit what the excuses are - they're losing money which is the bottom line. You need to stop seeing it as some kind of contest when it's not a contest, it's a business.

                            I did not move the goalposts. You just lack reading comprehension skills and the ability to understand numbers.

                                    You're not winning any arguments by hiding behind meme images, manchild.
        They probably know that it will sell more over time since many want to wait till the trilogy is over
            They hope that, for sure, and also that it will sell more on different platforms. Remake has been selling pretty well on Steam recently for example. It's by no means too late for these games to be a financial success in the end, but they're not there yet.
                But idk why they would make it a PS5 exclusive such a dumb decision for sales
        Cool story bro
That's really good to hear, thanks for the brief explanation
Can someone please explain why the digital copy sales are unknown? The game is a psn exclusive. This should be an incredibly easy statistic to pull. Does Sony make a point of not sharing stats until the quarterly reports?
    Sony is very cagey about revealing how much their games sell even when the amount is an insanely good number, The developer of Days Gone  claimed that they allegedly sold over 8 million copies and outsold Ghost of Tsushima for a certain time period but Sony never revealed how much it actually sold
        Because it didn't sell 8 million. It was 8 million who had the game. The game was on PS+ for a while and that's why it never got an official number like with Ghost of Tsushima who did sell 8 million. Sony have never been cagey when the sales are good. 

In this case I think it's more on Square than it is Sony. Why Square isn't releasing the numbers is anyones guess. They did do it for FF16, so hopefully we get one soon here.
            Square usually does, but not right away.

And yeah, Sony releases numbers when good. Days Gone was a flop by basically every sense of the word. It was a mediocre game by a dev only known for a really bad platformer 30 years ago. And the game felt like design by committee: post apocalyptic biker with a heart dealing with zombies. The reaction that triggers is the same reaction I had to seeing Kid G at the saucer for the first time - this is anachronistic and out of date.
                I bet you wouldn't mouth off straight to Kid G's face like that!
                    I probably would. Not in a mocking way, but in a "*dude,* I'm taking you to J. Crew (they're back in, roughly around the time skinny jeans became anachronistic and out of date), like right now because you need *help*."

Mostly because if I said in a mocking way, I'd probably be paste on a wall somewhere.
                Square released FFXVI sales 6 days after launch..
        Thank you for explaining. The example made the reasons behind it much clearer now!
    Good question
    correct sony, microsoft and nintendo do not show sales.
    People are coping. The digital sales are unknown because they aren't yet at a point that Square is comfortable at telling them publicly. It's simple as that.

Does this mean FF Rebirth is doomed and the world will end? No. But it's breaking all expectations and selling as much as Square predicted to it's investors? Also probably not.

But lets watch people downvoting me for telling facts that they don't like.
        I agree with you, nothing unreasonable about what you said. Anyone with eyes can see the engagement online isn't as big as it was in the Remake days. That coupled with unreleased sales numbers does make you worry. In the end who cares, the game is great, and as long as we get that part 3 thats all a fan really cares about
    Almost no one likes to share these numbers, even streaming services like Netflix don't like to share numbers. I don't know why, likely something to do with legal stuff or maybe stocks? I don't know, but I bet money is the reason. Good or bad.
        Dude they release XVI sales 6 days after release. Ya know, the game this sub loves to shit on..
            There's a lot of reasons companies do and do not release information and to just assume it's because of bad numbers is being a bit disingenuous.

For all we know Square Enix could have had massively unrealistic expectations with sales and the true number could actually be quite good but incredibly disappointing in lieu of their expectations, we don't know. Square Enix has had a long history of absurdly optimistic sales expectations.

It makes more sense to just wait until numbers do get released.

I also don't think it should go without saying that Square Enix is also likely aware of a segment of their fanbase that is vocal about not buying any ore installments until the entirety of FF7 is available.
In light of this article, I think rebirth isn't actually doing that well. Perhaps not bad, but definitely not fantastic:[https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/12/playstation-store-march-2024s-top-downloads/](https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/12/playstation-store-march-2024s-top-downloads/)
    It’s been over a month my guy. Basing your assumptions from this isnt really good. Ff7 rebirth maintained number 2 spot for weeks. Most of its downloads and sales were done. It’ll just be a slow sales and download from now on. It’s Slowing down now that’s why it’s being pushed down the list now with newer games released.
If the game didn’t sell well, they probably wouldn’t be promoting the people that worked on it no
    Right.  Hamaguchi got promoted for his accomplishments on rebirth.
    Probably because no one wants a promotion at square. Getting a promotion means you're going to have 50 projects dumped on you. Dude was probably the only person that would accept it lmfao.

But getting a promotion could mean nothing. It does not mean the game was successful. Sales numbers show how successful the game is, and they still haven't released them
The sales of VII Rebirth are, in my opinion, quite similar to XVI.

Games Industry said that VII Rebirth was ahead of XVI by 4% in his first week. In Japan, at launch, VII Rebirth have sold 70k less approximately in physical. 

We know that Dragon’s Dogma 2 sold 2.5 millions in his first 10 days. Rebirth have a better launch in Europe than DD2, and he also performs better in Japan on physical sales, by a huge margin (approximately 200k units more) 

The US Sales are unknown. If VII Rebirth was similar to Dragon’s Dogma in the US, then it’s sure he sold close to 3 millions at launch, which is the same result as XVI.

They probably expected a little bit more than XVI, but it’s not a complete fail either
    This makes sense. It's targeting the same demographic in the same platform. I would expect the numbers to be very similar.
    Your pronoun usage here is *wild*. What?
        Not English native, and i rushed that message, sorry
            No need to apologize. You applied gender to inanimate objects so it was very confusing at first but we got what you meant.
                Yea that happens, in many languages, there’s no pronouns. English is also my second language, we dont use pronouns on my first language, however we have nouns and adjectives that are gender based. Like for instance amerikano vs amerikana. And no spanish isnt my language lol
        You didn't hear? Dragons Dogma came out as a He/Blu Ray Disc/ephemeral download.
> Per this article, rebirth sold in 1 day better than 16 did in 10 days


This is not true, Rebirth sold a 4% more than FFXVI on launch week in Europe (source GSD). The source of that quote misread the data.


Still, I think that Rebirth is confortably above 3 million copies sold if we use Dragon's Dogma 2's sales as reference. DD2 sold 2.5 million copies worlwidely, across all platforms, 11 days after release. Rebirth narrowly outsold DD2 in Europe comparing both games' first 2 weeks after release. In Japan, Rebirth sold 4 times more than DD2, around 230k copies more. Unless DD2 greatly outsold Rebirth in the US, which I very much doubt, Rebirth is above 3 million copies sold for sure.
    Yeah, but this sub is so hopped up on copium that it's about as bad as the doomers in terms of exaggeration (edit: nvm, googled the 'content creators' he's referring to and fine they're still way worse)

I don't think it outsold Remake but I'd say it sold decently (and at least at par with FFXVI) and your estimate seems close which could also be why Square didnt post it since it isn't particulatly stellar

Just hope it's selling to expectations and has a longer tail (I sure as hell am buying it again on PC)
        Oh it absolutely didn't outsell Remake and 3M is stellar for most games but not for this game in particular, and I agree that's probably why they didn't post the results because the point of doing that is marketing, but not reaching a great milestone for this game won't work. In FFXVI's case it actually backfired and people (and journalists, which is worse) said it was a flop, so they learned their lesson.


Yeah, I've had discussions with people that said it didn't reach 1M, which is preposterous, though I think they have some kind of agenda, like hating the Remake project or wanting to criticize the exclusivity deal.
            This whole discussion is ridiculous to me. Square Enix have had orlutrageously optimistic/unrealistic sales expectations for nearly every game they have released in a decade. We have no idea what they expected FF7 Rebirth to do internally. If they expected upwards of 7-10 million copies, even 5 million would be embarrassing to them. All we know is that it's likely it didn't reach what they expected but that could be poor sales or just unattainable expectations.
>I imagine Japan is similar if not worse, especially since physical pace in japan is so limited and Japan has essentially become a handheld market instead of console.

Japan prefers physical games.

[CESA found that physical games accounted for about 70 percent of total sales in Japan in 2022, including 65 percent of PlayStation 5 games and 77 percent of Switch releases. By comparison, Sony says that 70 percent of full PS4 and PS5 game sales in 2022 were digital across the world.](https://www.theverge.com/24055863/akihabara-japan-retro-video-games-physical-media)

Also, those digital sales statistics are very misleading, because they include indie and dlc sales, which are inflating the numbers.

AAA games also generally sell better physically than digitally. There was that hack by Sony/Insomniac not too long ago which showed physical games for most AAA titles outselling digital.

>Before people claim that rebirth sold less than 16, remember that rebirth sales were split between it and the twin-pack.

Those sales were counted as Rebirth sales, at least in the UK. I would assume it's the same for the rest of the world.

>Edit: Per this article, rebirth sold in 1 day better than 16 did in 10 days.

For **Europe**. Not worldwide. In Japan FFXVI sold more in its first week than Rebirth did in its first month, [according to Audrey.](https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1778268214520328273) (physical only)

Relevant: [FFVII Rebirth daily players peaked at 2.21 million at launch according to Ampere.](https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/04/11/stellar-blade-demo-690k-dau-doubled-ffvii-rebirth)
    Crazy how no one will upvote this, because people would rather be delusional about that stuff.
    Silence from OP LMFAO
    The duel pack actually is considered separately. I think in the Uk Rebirth was number 2 or 3 and the twin pack was number 8
        They're listed separately in the charts, but that doesn't mean official numbers would recognize them separately, is what I'm saying.

I was mostly basing it on what [Chris Dring said,](https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1766153927727227344) where he combined Twin Pack + Rebirth sales and pointed out that Rebirth sold +6% over XVI at launch in the UK.
Frankly anyone who thoughts this game had even a sliver of a chance to sell poorly, is a damn idiot. This is a final fantasy SEVEN remake trilogy.
    haha, the first sane person in this thread.  I do find the discourse hilarious on this too.
        LOUDER PLZ
    Yeah, and it should have sold more than FFXVI then since it's FF7. Yet rebirth didn't sell more than XVI..
If this is true (and I have no reason not to trust your sources, OP) this makes me happy like a chocobo chick. The game has single-handedly climbed to the top of my personal JRPG pedestal. After finishing my first playthrough at just over 80 hours it felt like I had just started a day ago and I wouldn't have minded the game being another 80 hours either.
Lesson learned twice over: when people are saying big FF games are on a decline, DONT BELIEVE THEM.
I’ve been battling with click bait believers since launch. Literally paying these so-called-journalists to spread inaccurate, incomplete or just outright wrong information.

Edit: this game and series is going to sell well over its life. A much slower burn than shit like Elden ring and DD2 because JRPGs still have a stigma around them where as it’s much easier to market western RPGs or soulslikes at this point. 

The review scores and positive conversations of this series will carry it for years.

Also, Hamaguchi just got promoted to an executive position.. although just speculative, I feel that points to success on his part because of FF7.
    I think this is the right take, and its also important to remember the reality is that Square Enix just needs to earn back mainstream consumer trust. It's why they haven't hit numbers like GoW, Elden Ring, and other colossal heavy hitters.

They spent a lot of time overmarketing their low investment mid games like forspoken and other bullshit like that over the years and I think now when people hear Square they just don't think AAA games like they used to. Their games are never universal 9+ critically acclaimed GOTY contenders, even from fans, and often aren't even finalists. When not even your fans can agree, your games are good.. You have a problem. They've fallen into mid territory because they lost their identity. I think that all changes, starting now.

I think rebirth is, without a doubt, the best game they've made since FFX, and this will be the entry that puts them back on the map. It gave me the same feelings as GoW 2018, and I hold that game in extremely high regard. I think it's a GOTY contender, and I don't say that lightly. It's really that good. After playing it, and then playing remake again... the improvements are astounding. They've truly learned a lot
    I can basically guarantee that Elden ring will continue to sell well forever, but I do agree that JRPGs have a much smaller audience and that FF7 is probably going to sell a lot of copies over a long timeline
Also remember some of us did not get the disc copy because the shop fucked up(welcome to my country) and had to cancel the order and buy it online >< (at least I sit on a gigabit, so the download was fast)
I think one big factor is that a lot of people did NOT want spoilers for this game and bought digital to be able to get it right away. I’m sure this is true for Japan as well. I bought both, but I did buy digital first to ensure I could play day 1.
I'm happy because I just want third part asap considering I finished Rebirth like 20 minutes ago. As much as I enjoyed the game, FUCK THE LAST PHASE OF FINAL BATTLE
    I dont like that phase too, and the ending itself. Too cliffhanging over there…
[https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/04/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-has-sold-around-2-million-copies-ps5-player-data-suggests](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/04/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-has-sold-around-2-million-copies-ps5-player-data-suggests)
    The actual Ampere article says that Rebirth’s launch peak numbers were 2.21 million… at launch. That’s likely the first day sales or close to it.
        Probably the first week sales.
            Perhaps! But it’s been over a month since that number. So I think this is more evidence to support my point. Thank you for sharing.
                Sales dropped hard after the first week. You're acting like it's going to make more money than after release. That's not how game sales work.
I bought a PS5 because I couldn't wait a year or so for the PC port 😜.
> physical sales in the US have declined despite large increase in overall sales of video game stuff. I imagine Japan is similar if not worse, especially since physical pace in japan is so limited and Japan has essentially become a handheld market instead of console.

Well, you imagine wrong. Maybe you should've looked it up before making the post, because physical is still bigger than digital in Japan. It is not like the US.

In 2022, 70% of sales in Japan were physical. https://www.theverge.com/24055863/akihabara-japan-retro-video-games-physical-media

I really hope the game did well but there is very little evidence of anything concrete at the moment. All we know is Square haven't said anything yet, which is not a good sign.
Now imagine if the most expensive bundle included that tonberry butler....
I'm glad. Because at first, there were rumblings how FF7 Rebirth was underselling. Mainstream journalists just go by each other's headlines without actually ever doing any research.
I’m kind of hoping these sale figures will encourage them to create remakes for other games like FFVI and FFVIII.
I’ve just started FF7Rebirth and am like 50% of the way through Chapter 2 and I’m already like 7 hours in.

This game is so good and It’s built so perfectly on everything established in FF7Remake
They deserve all the success they are having. The last FFVII games have been a complete piece of art. I hope they win a lot of money and praise and everything so they can keep making great games.
Yes Killing the FF franchise 
This is the best game square has made since FFX, I can’t wait until they release all three parts together in the ultimate edition in 5 or 6 years
i believe this could be the kind of game that "sells" over time, especially then the part 3 is complete.
Also this is the year switch is sleeping as they build up for launch of the switch 2 next year. So yeah, it will sell. People also forget that when it hit a sale and goes down to 40 or 30 usd or so, it will sell again. This game will have legs. I suspect we will land on around 4-5 million copies before the next game is out, and that is for ps5 alone. With pc? probably gonna end up around 6-7.
The PS5 has shipped 50 million units at this point. The PS4 had shipped 50 million units when FFXV released. Certainly FFXV benefited from Xbox sales, but Xbox didn't have a strong presence globally. I am not sure we can continue making the case of a "limited market" anymore. Even when FFXV came out, people expected it to be a juggernaut, when it was really just a moderate success compared to other legacy titles released by other companies.


The disconnect with the "bad sales" articles and the data presented here, is that the sales are not bad, but they are just decent. Unfortunately, decent is not impressive for a legacy franchise, especially with the FF7 IP attached to it. It is indicative of a general trend with FF games over the last decade, that perhaps it's appeal among the broader gaming market is losing it's steam. This is by no means a referendum on the quality of the games. But it is telling that Square is silent on sales data, when they've been so willing to pat themselves on the back in the past. This is especially true when there has been so much negative press. 


You can make the case that it isn't an FF problem, but really a console problem. Or maybe it's the $70 price tag. Perhaps there is something to be unraveled there. But aside from FF14, the FF franchise has been unable to have that stratospheric hit Square so desperately desires. Unfortunately, each subsequent release appears to do a little worse. I'm sure overtime, after Steam let's players buy the game for $5-$10, it'll get a boost of sales. But Square wants it's Monster Hunter World moment, of easily passing 20 million units, and currently new games are struggling to surpass 5M, and lucky to hit 10M. Sustainable? Yes. Great? No. Disappointing for a classic game? Absolutely.
I’m not involved in marketing or statistics, but I can’t imagine a world where it takes 2 million sales of a game that was money-hatted by Sony to break even. I’m sure the game is profitable already. 

One can only hope that the internal expectations were within reason. Breaking the game up into a trilogy, they had to have known they would eat some of their own sales, especially for the middle section. 

If nothing else, I firmly believe that future Final Fantasy games will sell better as a direct result of FFVII Rebirth. It is a legitimate masterpiece that will age like fine wine. I don’t think anyone would be shocked if this won GOTY at TGA.
Sorry to say but the game is not killing it.......stop being fucking delusion.

SE are quick to shout out the sales of their games but this one they have kept hidden....something you don't do if the game sold big, its obvious it has under performed, being ps5 exclusive, a lot of people are still on PS4.

It sucks, as the game is phenomenal.
Nope it's not killing it actually lol.  SE has been relatively quiet about FFVII Rebirth sales compared to Remake, Intergrade, and XVI which they boasted about on Twitter and in press releases.  They announced XVI sales 7 days after release to quiet rumors that it wasn't meeting sales expectations.

The Remake project as a whole has only sold 7 million units.  Not good news for a project that 20 years of hype around it.   

Being exclusive to PS5 doesn't matter.  When they set sales expectations they do it based on the current PS5 user base, how other games are selling on PS5, and compared to other PS5 exclusives.  This determines if it's inline or below expectations.
I don't know if this is evidence of "killing it," either tbh lol. It seems to be selling on par with the original as the middle part of a trilogy at a $70 price point not adjusted for inflation 27 years later which is, acceptable, not disappointing mind you, but acceptable and positive. Killing it to me is the 10 million BG3 pulled in less than a year, the 20 million Elden Ring did, the 8 million Helldivers 2 is doing right now, or 15 million Palworld just did.

This is like [Disco Stu logic here](https://youtu.be/e6LOWKVq5sQ?si=uGRKf7ZyxVzfPrqU). Physical sales trend down 37% in the US therefore Japan is very similar so sales must be way up on the digital market, therefore, eeeeehy. Maybe RE4R is a good enough but imperfect comparison. That thing had two SKUs doing roughly 90K each in Japan in a week. It pushed to 7 million sales globally in about a year. 8.4 million for RE3R and 13.6 for RE2R to date.
    I agree with most of what you’re saying, but I do think palworld and helldivers isn’t a great comparison. They are significantly cheaper games. Much easier to get a much larger number of players to try them out.

Only bringing that up because I’ve seen the comparisons before and it seems a little unfair.

Also it’s much easier for me to convince a friend to spend 30-40 on a game we can play together, vs 70 on a game we play alone.
        Yeah. It cannot be understated the importance of being locked to PS5 vs PC for half the price makes a world of difference. I know of several people who borrowed their friends' consoles and copies which doesn't drive up sales. They're playing it- but why spend half of your monthly check on 1 game if you don't own a console with 0 exclusives.

Or- 1 exclusive and everything else coming multiplat later
            Another really good point.

I know that the team has been pretty adamant that the game they made wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t an exclusive, but I think we’ll see less games like Rebirth going forward in order to boost multiple platform sales.
                I think you're underestimating how much money Sony would pay Square for that exclusivity.  That type of revenue is far more important than sales to a company because it represents ZERO overhead.  They just need to delay releasing it on other platforms (which will launch as a game of the year pack or something sparking even more sales and coverage).
                    The help Sony provides is a short term financial solution for square. The money they get from Sony also does not offset a potential increase of 300k+ more sales on other platforms.

Releasing later doesn’t guarantee an equivalent number of sales, only delayed. People move on/lose interest. 

The biggest benefit Square has working with Sony is development support, and that hardware capability. Both Creative Buis. Unit 1 and 3 have been fairly public about that. Rebirth would not exist the way it does had it been developed for multiple platforms.

The issue square is having, that is increasing year over year, is brand recognition. The FF brand needs better reach than it does now for a long term solve. (Among other things it needs) This isn’t my conjecture. Yoshi P spoke adamantly about the problems with the FF brand and the aging fan base.

In short: this deal benefits Sony more than Square.

I’m fairly educated on this. I work in the entertainment industry as a director.
                        All good points.  I work in finance though, in a senior-level corporate setting, so I know how boards think, how budgets are managed and how the immediate and likely high eight- or NINE-FIGURE sum that Sony paid for FF exclusivity -- with **no cost** for overhead, human resource, real estate, R&D, utilities, insurance, tax etc. -- is a lot more attractive than the *potential* sales they could rake in and all the risk and huge costs involved with going multi-platform.

As I said, I think you're not quite realizing that that money is risk-free, guaranteed and immediate.  Put it this way:

1. $100 right in my pocket making interest for exclusivity + $100 in sales - $70 in costs

Or

2) $0 in my pocket not making interest + $200 (and this number is super variable/risky) in sales - $150 in costs (this number is based on your comment that the fact that they are single-platform makes it easier to develop).

100% of the time a corporation with any hint of risk management or even just an accounting department will choose #1.  And they're right to.
                            No, I definitely do realize it’s risk free and immediate. I said it’s a short term financial solution. 

What I’m saying is that the strategy is how square has been operating for some time now, and they’ve openly acknowledged the problem with the brand recently. 

These short term solutions don’t keep the brand alive, that they need to remain a studio of their size. It won’t matter how much money Sony gives them if the brand looses viability. And at a certain point Sony won’t see the value in dumping money into the exclusivity of a franchise that’s sales diminish year over year. 

Square has already acknowledged the poor sales, and is trying to solve the problem. They’ve even cited slow adoption of the PS5 as a contributing factor. They’ve also seen stock prices decline as a result of these marquee titles  not selling the larger numbers that other recent titles have.

A studio is only as valuable as the brands that it sells.

The question isn’t will they pull the plug on the deal, but who does it first.

EDIT: Looking at it financially, what’s the smarter option long term, assuming you’re capable of both…

Graduate high school and take a low skill, decent pay job at a factory, making 20-30 an hour?

Or going to med school, taking on the debt, and getting a job as a cardiologist or an equivalent profession?

Which person is more likely to be financially well off at 65?

You chose a pretty smart field (smarter than me TBH, lol), so I think you know the answer.
                                I didn't say that what the Boards (or Square) does is the best for long-term success. Having worked with people in very very high up positions, they are no smarter than any one else (the moment you realize that the chairman of the board of your company is just as much as a dumb-dumb as you are is a beautiful moment). What I am saying is that from an decision-makers will always go for money first and forego future profits to ensure that you are less exposed to risk.

There is also an argument that that IS the right move.  Taking a lump sum and investing it is 100% better than being paid out the lump sum over the course of 50 years.  In the first situation, you are making the interest, in the second THEY are making the interest.

So, to answer your question at the bottom. I actually think that the smarter move for most people is to take the low-skilled, well paying job and invest your excess money.  I know complete morons who earned their MBAs (fun fact, you can't 'fail' and MBA, so next time someone tries to wave it in your face, scoff and think to yourself 'you could be a moron who just so happened to have access to $120K in debt) and I'll tell you this: The moron who spent $120K on an MBA in their 30s will NOT be more financially well off at 65 than any person who brought in a steady income from the age of 18 (assuming they're not buying time shares in Florida, or renting sports cars).

That being said, the impressive person who gets an MBA in their 30s likely has a plan and will be better off than the moron with the MBA, or anyone who's worked since their 18 (but that person who's worked since their 18 will still be in a pretty good spot, honestly).

And here is where we converge: The 'impressive person' I talk about up there?  That's the brand.  If the brand is impressive, then the company will succeed.  If the brand is the moron who paid for an MBA, the company won't succeed. If the brand is the basic person who worked from 18 with OK pay, then you'll get, I suppose, the equivalent of a company that sells necessary staples (like flour, or soap); they bring in money, no one is dying of hunger, but their dead on the inside. I honestly think we're more in sync than this long exchange would have you believe.

Despite what I'll tell you at the end, I do not know enough about Square's statements to have a say in this.  If they're worried about the decline of their brand I think that's fair.  FF has never mattered more than it did with 7 and that was almost 30 years ago.  But sales? I think they need to take adjust expectations. 

And though I work in finance, I'm actually a journalist. I just sold out and went corporate. So believe me, I chose a pretty terrible field honestly.  But I learn a lot more about a wider range things and get to talk to more incredible people (and not so incredible) than most humans do, so it's kinda cool.

Cheers!

PS: The best case, I can think of is Sony buys Square and Capcom.  If Microsoft can dodge regulators and buy Bethesada and Activision Blizzard, then Sony should do the same.
                                    I get that. What I’m saying is what they have done, vs what they will do. 

So when I responded to what you said, that I’m underestimating the money they get with Sony exclusivity deals, it’s that I don’t think I am because Square I aware of the sales problem and does see it as a red flag, going as far as citing the platform as a part of that issue.

My suggestion is that it seems like their strategy will change as a result. Your original response seemed to suggest that it won’t. We don’t disagree on the points that each strategy has. We divert on what they Will be likely to do going forward.

So when I say they are likley to shift that strategy, it’s based off of their quarterly reports, as well as the evidence that square themselves has cited.

-

Side note. I don’t think you sold out, you made a smart call. Journalism ain’t easy friend. I can’t claim to be an expert in it, but I have to imagine our disciplines are similar in stability, and while I’ve managed to be lucky, I see how many people better than me haven’t been. You’re smart for having that back up.

Regarding the P.S. I think I agree.
    Also RE series is a good example of how the game quality often influences future sales more than sales of that title.

Re3r is a much worse reviewed and less acclaimed game than re4r, but re4r suffers more in sales.

Just goes to show that this 1:1 game comparison stuff is largely BS anyways. Ff16 and remake quality likely affected sales of Rebirth more than the quality of Rebirth itself did. The quality of Rebirth is probably going to influence sales of part 3.
A game can sell well and still be below expectations.
Question is gonna be what is their internal success point. 

This can sell 1m copies, and still be a failure if they need to sell 1.1m.

Comparing it against 16 is also slightly off as that game might have a different break even point vs ff7 rebirth.

You also need to consider the target audience differences between remake fans and those going for a new ff title, even if there is a lot of overlap.
Honest question : why do people on reddit care about the sales number? The third part is already in development, so it's not like the sales figure is going to affect it, even if it's low. I get why sales matter to the developer and publisher, but why are random people so concerned about it?
    Personally I care because I love the game and I want it to do well because that has an impact on the future of the franchise.

I think Rebirth should be the template going forward, as opposed to something like XVI which I really didn't vibe with.

Rebirth's sales matter tremendously in terms of communicating to Square Enix what people want from Final Fantasy. 

It matters in terms of potential directions for FF17 and beyond, it matters for the budget and resources that will be dedicated to Part 3, and it matters for the possibility of future remakes.

If a Remake of FF7 does not do well enough, the odds of getting something like FF6 or FF9 remade will go down tremendously. Or they will be low budget remakes.

The bottom line is sales obviously matter for the future of Final Fantasy.
        That's fair enough, I want it to do well too, but it seems like this is more of a FF16 vs FF7Re feud. I loved both games, albeit for entirely different reasons, but I think both are amazing games.

Personally, I don't think Rebirth should be the template, the same way I don't think 16 should be the template. I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, so I probably wouldn't care if they made FF17 into a third person shooter, tbh.

I also don't really want any other FF remakes, and I'd rather they'd focus on moving the series forward. I think 9 is great the way it is, and I personally didn't like 6, so I don't care much for it being remade.

I guess my confusion comes from the fact that every single conversation on this topic, over the past few weeks, had a strong focus on the numbers, and not much else. It was either "lmao this game flopped" or some random speculation about the actual sales figure, accompanied by paranoid theories like "the game sold poorly, that's why they're hiding the sales figure from us". It didn't really feel like people were concerned about, solely because of their love for the series.
            > I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, 

That's fair, but I do want to clarify what I meant by "template". I don't necessarily mean specific gameplay or combat systems.

I mean stuff like having a party with multiple playable characters, having some element of strategy even if the combat is action based, having beautiful and interesting towns that feel lively and full of activities, having fun side content like minigames and optional exploration, level / dungeon design that isn't just hallways, worthwhile loot and rewards to find, interesting gear and itemization systems, proper RPG elements, etc...

Those elements to me are essential to a Final Fantasy game, and Rebirth had all of them (and nailed all of them), while FF16 had literally none of them. Only one character, zero strategy, boring and empty towns with zero activities (the beautiful cities like Oriflamme aren't even explorable, we only get to visit bland places like Northreach and Martha's Rest), very minimal side content and what is there is mostly not good, almost no RPG systems or any kind of interesting gear or itemization, very linear hallway dungeons, etc...

To be clear, I didn't hate 16. I loved its characters, its art direction, its atmosphere, and its music. I thought the voice acting and English localization were very good. The lore was solid and pretty interesting. I enjoyed the darker, grittier tone of the game. And of course the game offers a lot of spectacle.

But the combat was too easy and too shallow, the world was bland and devoid of content despite being beautiful, and exploration was completely worthless. Those elements make it a big disappointment for me. I am okay with innovation and change, but some fundamentals need to be kept, and I think 16 is just too streamlined to actually scratch my FF itch. It needed more substance and more meat on its bones imo.
    people like to fight their pokemon in any way they can (I used that right, right? I've never played a pokemon game).

I remember when I was a child I cared a lot about sales too.  I think a lot of the people who care about sales are children, or have the mind of a child.  It is a way for their 'thing' to be validated.  As your grow up, you realize that's an incredibly sad way to live your life and you start caring about important things.

I'm not immune.  I want to see Rebirth sell well, I clikced on this thread, so did you and there are plenty of people here who are saying 'good, I really liked this game'.  But I think the flame wars that break out and the pearl-clutching that normies if something doesn't sell IMMEDIATELY is mostly kids who don't really know the world, or themselves, yet.

As I age, I actually think more about games that I don't like selling badly, because that might shift the market away from them.  Like anything from Rockstar, I would love to see GTA6 flop so we can stop having them suck up all the oxygen in the video game discussion and stop having other devs try to copy their crappy game design and juvenile mindset. EDIT: But you see how now I'm acting like a child, just as chided above?  It's the same things and both are sad.
    Because the sales info has a real impact on the future of the trilogy and future FF games at Square.
Why square Enix haven’t say anything compared to 16 then?
    Because OP is in denial and it most likely didn't meet squares expectations
No per your article rebirth sold better in 1 day than 16 did in 10 days IN EUROPE, not overall. Right now Rebirth has sold HALF of what Remake did over the same timeframe, congrats, all you have shown is that Final Fantasy 7 is more popular in Europe than the franchise as a whole, the vast majority of sales are NA, citing Japanese sales and Europe sales are trivial if the NA sales are not fleshing out at the same rate, which clearly they are not when its barely hit 2 million units sold worldwide.

  
[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is "underperforming", says industry analyst | Eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst)
sales are not good because they butchered a good story and the gameplay is mediocre at best.  I love the original and bought remake upon launch with no question because I'm such a fan but after finishing remake, I lost interest in continuing.  there a lot of ppl out there like me who have ps5s, bought remake, and decided NOT to buy rebirth.  oh and below is a link for anyone whose questioning how bad sales really are.

Your edit is wrong. Who tf is upvoting this garbage? If sales were better than XVI. They would have announced it. These numbers mean nothing until square actually released the numbers.. and for some reason they don't want to. I wonder why...
Being the #1 selling game does not mean it’s killing it. It just mean it’s up against wretched competition. In fact, Rebirth sales are garbage. I hope SE goes under so we never have to see another beloved story get bastardized like this again. So sick of POS’s who are handed control of a beloved franchise and think them adding in their own stupid twists some how improves it. 

https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-underperforming-report/
    One hundred million times this. 

Nomura is a garbage writer that couldn't even wrap up his own convoluted series in a coherent, satisfactory way (KH3). Now he's using FF7 Remake as his narcissistic passion project in order to tie into his own shitty movie Advent Children.
I don't know.

Rebirth sold 300k copies in a 34 days.

FF16 sold 330k copies in 7 days.

I do get the issue with the Twin Pack/Bundle, but even so.

So even if you do think it's a good number, it's pretty clear at this point that Rebirth will sell less than FF16.  
Which is weird, because Rebirth felt much more targeted towards Japanese audiences than 16 is...  
I could see maybe 16 outselling Rebirth in the West, but not in Japan.

So, my hope is that this doesn't mean Square will cut off this "Classic JRPG" that FF Rebirth symbolizes, and focus even more on the "action with JRPG elements" that FF16 represents.

Another worry is, of course, ir Rebirth sells 1/3 of what Remake sold, can we really expect the same investment in part 3 as they had in part 2?   
Remake and Rebirth also had a lot of 'side-products' riding in their wake: Crisis Core Reunion, the Mobile Game.  
Will Square really risk it with a big budget for Part 3? How many sales do a game of Rebirth's magnitude needs to even break even? 2 million?

I think these are reasonable worries.

But I will tell you, I can not imagine any other game in 2024 deserving to sell anywhere as close to Rebirth. I think it's one of the greatest games of all time, period.

But I suppose different folks different strokes.
    Rebirth is also a direct sequel to another game where 16 is standalone. The fact that it performed only a little worse than 16 despite the audience for the game being constrained by those who bought into FF7 Remake tells me it's doing just fine.
    I think Final Fantasy is just on a downward trend in Japan, regardless of the quality of the title or who it’s marketed towards. FF15 sold more than FF7 Remake which sold more than FF16 which sold more than FF7 Rebirth.

Also, apparently game sales for PlayStation are faltering in Japan in general. It will be interesting to see how KH4 and DQ12 perform with this in mind, though it may be quite a while before we see either of those (specifically the latter).
    ![gif](giphy|AKg48AT4Ai8ei8uHhf|downsized)
    Read the post and data carefully. You are reading only physical sales which are in downward trend compared to digital. In Europe, rebirth sold more in 1 day than 16 did in 10 days. https://twitter.com/mrpyo1/status/1770804261074468928

I also explained that Rebirth was split between two SKUs: 1) the standalone rebirth game and 2) the twin pack.  Please look carefully.
        And I addressed your comments about twin pack. I don't think it changes the sales figure that much for japan.

And in Japan Physical Sales outsell Digital by a lot. And of course I'm reading Physical Sales, that's what the new Famitsu Report is all about and it's the only numerical sales value we do have.

And this "UK" Report Tweet is a mess, I have read it many many times before, and read the links it cites.

Edit: Also "FF16 sold in 10 days what FF7 Rebirth sold in 1" has no reference,  as someone else in this TWEET you're linking pointed out: [https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525](https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525)

Again, we're free to interpret and speculate about these data as much as we want, but unless Square releases official statements, it's all speculations.

So let's just accept that neither you nor me have facts, and that nobody has to "please look carefully because I'm the authority here", cool? :)
    You people need to respect OPs and actually engage with the material they post before you just say whatever you want that is very clearly misinformed 😭
        They are. You guys are just plugging your ears and ignoring the facts.
    Did you bother to read the fucking post?
        Yes.

What part of my breakdown of it you disagree?
Gamers are a weird breed, and the fact this is a 150-hour sequel or part 2 of a trilogy based on a 30-40 hour 1997 game, it’s sort of like a Hobbit, where they grab a short story and stretched it to 3 movies.

Meaning, they want this game to fail. So any spin on a story that will help that narrative works for them. Also, this game is exclusive to PS5 currently, so that also works against it in among a very vocal crowd.

This game has a ton of love poured into it and I hope more players get to play it, since I feel like they don’t make games like this anymore.
Is this the new cope? FF7 rebirth sold worse than ff16, is literally the reason why they haven't announced sales. I seen numbers being between 2.1-2.5m copies.
    Ikr? It's amazing how much they are in denial. At least FFXVI fans weren't this nutty.
100% agree with the fact that people need to stop twitching at sales numbers. And that Rebirth almost certainly is doing well for itself.

But I do feel that some of this is still reaching without hard evidence.

You’ve taken a couple of tweets (what do we even call these nowadays?) regarding declining trends for physical sales in the US and then applied it to Japan as having a similar or worse deterioration. Might be true, might not be true. Certainly there’s no numerical evidence for that being the case in the tweets you linked. So it’s speculative.

I saw the ranking table for the Feb sales the other day so I agree that’s what the rankings were. But iirc there weren’t any numbers attached to them. So the Twin-Pack being 8th is relatively meaningless at the moment because we don’t know what that actually correlates to. And that far down the list I’d expect some severe drop off relative to the top 2-3. 

Given that the Twin-Pack’s appeal is specifically for entirely new players, or PC players jumping off to PS5. And that this is a Sequel so most of it’s day 1 playerbase will already own Remake. I’d definitely be leery in the absence of comparative numbers (I.E. what #7 and #9 did) of the Twin Pack being a sizeable proportion of Rebirth sales because for most of us rolling into this game day 1, it’d be unnecessary.

And as for that Rebirth sold more in 1 day than XVI in 10 days (Europe)? Literally just a comment. No supporting evidence for that at all in the linked tweets. Anyone could have made that statement no?

Edit - For Clarity, I’m no Statistician and I’m not even going to attempt it. But as the average layperson, I do not find the evidence provided to be particularly cohesive and compelling of the point being made.
    Bingo, seems like OP is trying to paint a skewed narrative based off some loose comments and tweets. If it was the case that rebirth outsold FF16, square would’ve come out by now and said so. FF7R probably sold just below FF16 all things considered.
It's April and I can already tell this is GOTY across the board.

It's gonna sell a lot lol
    Rebirth is good, but I think this year Helldivers 2 has a good shot at taking a lot of GotY awards. Yeah, it's a multiplayer game which typically don't have a chance at GotY, but if Arrowhead continues to kill it through the end of the year with their storytelling I think it's got a shot.

FF7 Rebirth has too many small execution errors to get GotY especially with all the other strong games coming out.
        Not a chance. 

Helldivers is fun but it's nowhere NEAR the experience rebirth is.

What you're saying is *literally* false lmao hot take of the century
            We shall see :) I look forward to who gets to say "I told you so" at the end of the year.
            You can't call an opinion false..
    Nah, helldivers will 100% be GOTY. I enjoyed rebirth but helldivers is so fun
I wonder if the percentage of physical copies skews for rebirth because of the 2 cd nostalgia.  I preordered digital but plan on getting physical as a keepsake
Thanks for posting this, good to see its selling well or at least not selling poorly like so many claim, I also think the trilogy will continue to sell well for many years, seems like it is the main entry point for people new to FF, I feel like Remake is where most newcomers start now. In terms of how well Square is doing out of this we should also consider that Sony will have paid them an absolutely huge sum of money for the PS5 exclusivity, so I think they will consider it a success and whatever happens I think they will still put a huge amount into Part 3, which I expect will also be PS5 exclusive.
Would be nice if they could just release it on PC
I hope Rebirth sells well, it deserves it.  I think the sale (number of copies) of Rebirth will be less than Remake, that is inevitable.
Happy to see this!
I'm really not that worried regardless eh.  They've got Sony backing the fuck out of this (feather in the cap comments)  and they would be making an absolute BOATLOAD of cash of merchandise, AND, playing the long game.

There's still people that are like, "eh, I'll buy it when all three are out."

And that includes some streamers popular with the younger demographic.  And we've seen other games pop off when newer streamers play to their younger crowds.  (It's an odd world, but it works)

Ff7 fans will fork out money hand over fist for good merchandise, that and playing the long game, Sony's backing, potential for part 3 going gangbusters, etc.


It's good.  It'll be sweet.
W
Too bad it’s not on pc :/ I rlly would love to play it
If only they released it on pc already 😪
You know where sales will come in? When they sell all 3 games as the Deluxe Edition when part 3 comes out 😈
Idk how many this game sold but but Idk neither why ff xvi has less than 6M been so great game
I think it's weird that I see Rebirth as something of a crowd pleaser and FF16 as something more niche. But it's obvious that that was the opposite intention of each dev team. 

They want FF16 to be as mainstream as GoT, to not be a typical weeb JPRG because it will turn off the more casual players. And then make it a simple action game and very cinematic for accessibility. 

Rebirth on the other hand is not afraid to be its genuine self, a very weebish JRPG, with deep and complex battle system, 100 hours of gameplay, and a confusing anime story. 

But the result is generally more people love Rebirth than FF16, and FF16 is considered more niche, FF16 is an acquired taste whereas Rebirth is more easy to like by the general gamers because it's so gamey, fun and goofy while FF16 is too serious, too cinematic, and with gameplay restrictions. I enjoyed both, but it's interesting to see the contrast.
    Yet FFXVI is selling more.. shit in FFXVI all you want, but they clearly did something right that caused it to sell more. I think it's the darker setting with older characters.

Not many people in the west want to play as some teenage anime characters. Western audiences like darker games with more grown-up characters. I'm surprised that XVI sold more in Japan. But I also think it's because they wanted to try out a more western game. Usually the Japanese audience don't play dark games besides souls games.  So FFXVI was a nice change. While rebirth is a great game, it doesn't do anything new.
This is already great by itself, but I think people often ignore that Rebirth (and any sequel in a series) doesn't just sell itself, but it also sells Remake, CCR, even OG. There are a number of people who will be starting from the beginning, and this will be happening with each new entry. So I think that's a factor that's always considered while making multi-parters, there are bigger numbers and sales that can be attributed to Rebirth that are not *just* its own sales.
I bought the physical version too and I bought the physical version of the remake together with it. Sadly only the ps4  version for the remake. But the ps4 version was very cheap at this moment. And most people who played rebirth did buy the physical too. So this number will go up even more. Honestly I prefer physical games. Lastly I bought the physical versions of dragons dogma 2 and rise of the ronin too. Then I own at least something. I really like that Sony doesn't go the same route as Microsoft...I own a series x too and never bought a single game for it. I mean thats cool because the ps5 is my main console and so I have more money for games there. But it would really annoy me when I would play mostly on the Series X. 

the only downside of physical games is the space... I have already two long storage bags full of ps4 and ps5 games. Abd that I have to change disc's lol I'm so lazy...
people's were just expecting an unreasonable number. rebirth's potential target audience is fairly small at the end of the day; its literaly just PS5 owners who have finished FF7 remake. remake sold 7 million, and maybe another 2 to 3 million played it for free on Plus. so we take those 10 million or so...how many of those were on PS5 and not PS4 or PC? and of those, how many finished the game?

when you take all that into account you start realizing the total potential market is small. thats one of the big drawbacks of having the game being PS5 exclusive AND a direct sequel.

  
i'm sure rebirth HAS sales to people outside of that target (like, maybe someone who just watched a summary of remake. or someone who didnt have  a PS5 but bought it for rebirth). but frankly those are likely such small exceptions that i odnt think it'd be reasonable to even include them in calculations.
The numbers for FF7 Remake were actually good. FF7 Rebirth can't even beat FFXVI. That fact  is going to haunt the development team forever.
I wasn't aware of any discourse surrounding the sales of this game whatsoever.  I know there was with 16, though.

It just seemed like a given this would outsell 16 regardless of its quality considering it's a direct sequel to a popular game, and also has a 26-year built up install base from the original game.  And then you factor in that the game got universal glowing reviews, way better than 16, and was also a really good game.  I just kinda assumed it'd do well.  So, it's honestly a bit surprising to me that the sales for both games sound somewhat similar, even it's just on the physical side.

Also, Hamaguchi was just promoted.  There is no way that would have happened if Square was displeased with Rebirth's reception in any way.
Gacha's are "killing it". Console JRPG's are fighting for their lives.
    gacha games are keeping aaa games alive, lmao... and FF14 is still making tons for SE.
I bought the game twice. One as digital, the other a special edition. I really wanna support the devs, this game overdelivered magnificantly.
It was just estimated by a third company that it’s sold roughly 2 million so far
Daily active user peaked at launch by 2.21 million players according to Ampere Analytics , I guess rebirth hit 4 mio copies already , which if it’s true are still amazing numbers without PC version . pc version will give rebirth a second hype and I think it can reach easily remake numbers over time or even surpass
    Yeah, I’d guess between 3.5 and 4.
>310k after a month on a 5 million installbase

>FFXVI sold 336k in one week

>Remake sold 700k in one week on an installbase of 10 million PS4s

This represents an objective shrinking of the FF audience in Japan, why are people celebrating this
is this what delusional looks like? 

No it is not killing it, it is still the worst perfoming big budget Final Fantasy game ever made sales wise, it being a better seller than niche games is not the win you think it is, and it is selling worse than XVI, the double pack isn't doing anything to boost sales as you think, and that Mrpyo guy is a literal PS5 console warrior fanboy account and nothing he says is trustworthy or the truth.
Those are wrong assumptions and conclusions. Rebirth isn't selling terribly, but it's only selling as much as FF16, which underperformed compared to expectations. It's selling far, far less than the big AAA titles on PS5 that Square Enix was hoping to compete with. And worst of all, it's PS5-exclusive - it has fewer owners than Helldivers on PS5 according to https://psnprofiles.com/games?order=owners&platform=ps5, and Helldivers is a game that has most of its players on PC. Rebirth also has less than 10% of the sales of Spiderman: Miles Morales so far. 

Trust me, if Rebirth sales were "killing it", Square Enix would have announced the numbers, like they always do within a month for their big games.
    Killing it in terms of being a Final Fantasy game lmao. It will always have lower numbers than fucking Spiderman (especially in the MCU era) and a fucking FPS multiplayer. That should be extremely obvious, but I guess not.
        Square Enix desperately wants Final Fantasy to be a mainstream AAA gigahit, which it used to be, and spends that level of budget on it. It's not a sustainable franchise with current sales vs budget. It doesn't matter how it performs versus YOUR expectations when the facts are that it's underperforming compared to how it has to perform in order to be successful, and Square Enix stocks are flagging.
            It really never used to be an AAA gigahit on the more modern age. And you guys playing investors without the necessary data is extremely laughable, so thanks for that
    Where did you read that FF16 underperformed? This kind of baseless comment is my problem.
        Square Enix earnings report to their investors.
            Check again. I think you’ll find the truth is different than what you’re saying.
        Square Enix themselves literally said it was a bit below their projections, but they have an 18-month plan to make up those sales.
            Receipts, please. https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1704139141192003834
Physical sales don’t really mean a lot in 2024. Whether people like it or not, digital sales are a majority of every big release now.
    Yeah but it’s still good to see physical doing better, there should always be an insensitive to keep both keeping competition in sale.
    Not for ps studios or nintendo and especially not in Japan. Insomniac leak showed us the real split. I think final fantasy games still have a majority of its sales phsyical.
    70% of game sales in Japan are physical. So you're wrong.
        over three-quarters of the global console gaming market share is in the US, UK, and France alone, where digital is king, so they're not wrong
        Like someone else stated. Japan doesn’t reflect the rest of the world. It’s a tiny market compared to most others and In most others, digital dominates.
Coping 
“Respectfully, all of the content creators who jumped on the conjecture that rebirth sold bad need to really think twice before click-baiting, and instead wait for actual clear evidence.”

Not gonna happen.  They got their clicks, truth be damned. 
Honestly the game didnt sell well for different factors which is sad, I love the final fantasy series, but I havnt played the game and I don't plan to as it deviates from the original story.
Im not so sure op
Stellar Blade will clear FF7 Rebirth sales easily
I'm curious what the "end" numbers or long term numbers will be in a year or two or even as far as right before part 3. Direct sequels can sometimes take a hit in sales (some will drop or newcomers have harder time jumping in) and wondering if VIIR will also see that pattern.
Imagine if they cancelled part 3 because of sales lmao
I know quite a few people who finally bought PS5 just to play Rebirth, I think that says something.
    Exactly what i did. I was waiting for the pro but said F it and bought the slim. So, i ran through Intermission a week before Rebirth lol. Also knocked out HFW:BS which didnt disappoint.
        Would be interesting to see how ps5 sales increased due to Rebirth.
"rEbiRtH wAs A fLoP iN JApEN"
Phsyical sales are not a fraction of digital sales(on playstation and nintendo), that's just propaganda from the console manufactors. We saw the real split with the insomniac leaks. 65% of playststion studios sales were physical. In Japan there are even less digital sales. In 2022, 70% of the sales In Japan were physical.
    Source?
        https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/5j5RhCc9Ml
            Ok, but this is Sony studios, right, which is only one studio among many? The overall trend in the market as per May Priscilla is an entirely different stat.
                Multiple studios but yes Sony first party games. But I would be very very surprised if Square Enix had a bigger % digital sales than ps studios.
Yeah, I feel like the trilogy was not only made to sell itself over time, but to sell the other relate products as well.

Between Remake and Rebirth we had: The Crisis Core Remaster, The Ever Crisis Mobile Game, and the (dead on arrival) Battle Royale.

Which does make me a little worried about part 3, unless they unveil a new product to also sell there, or are hoping the FF7 gacha will last a long time.
    I'm anticipating a Dirge of Cerberus remaster. It would make sense as a way to hype Vincent up before he becomes playable in part 3. And would match how they did CCR before Part 2 as a way to hype up Zack being relevant
        Its gonna be so bad but so good
        Is there any DLC planned for Rebirth? A Vincent DLC not unlike the Yuffie DPC could do the same.
            I believe they have confirmed there will not be any DLC between part 2 and 3
                Dirge of Cerberus remaster it is then ha.
    That's what I'm a bit worried about. I think Square corporate is punking the FF Managment team for this multimedia hit and after Ever Crisis and adjacent sub-projects flopped they may not be as lenient with teh money spent on the big 3 games. I'm really fearful that Part 3 will be a departure in quality because I've just seen that so many time before. Uncharted 3, Jak 3, Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 3. Where the publisher is like "Y U no make more money!?!?" and start to impose ridiculous mandates that end up messing with the creative effort, and leading to a really rushed deadline.
        Yh I worry about this. Rebirth was great but as with every recent square rpg since the 00’s, there are massive issues with it. Issues that can be overlooked because the overall package is fantastic, but the open world tower design and repetitive icon hunting really became a drag by the time you get to gongaga/cosmo. I bloody loved the game, my GOTY for sure, nothing will come close. But I felt the same with 16. It was brilliant for different reasons but I had a bit of a sour taste in my mouth for everything it got so wrong. Rebirth is better than 16 imo but man they need to sort the repetition.

And as to your original point, it being a part 3 has me worried a lesser investment will lead to even more copy and paste side activity design. And we all know from game to game these publishers just HAVE to make it bigger. Way bigger. Can’t wait for all the “the overall map size is 2-3 times the size of rebirth”. That would be absolutely fine, but ONLY if that map is well designed with a frankly staggering amount of worthwhile content. Not time wasting. 

It’s very clear to me that things like the mako springs and divine intel were shoehorned in as filler. Would’ve been so much better if the divine intel was scrapped entirely and you just come across a small cave/dungeon that leads to a cool encounter with the summon in some ethereal way. Not being funny but if fort condor can pull me into some weird world, why can’t a summon entity. Make it make sense, it wouldn’t be difficult in this crazy world!
It should absolutely win GOTY or its a robbery
    Dude, I'm rooting for rebirth to win goty as much as anyone else here... but it's still april.
        I know it when i see it brudda, stop the count
            Lol, low-key triggered when I see that phrase, stop the count.
            People said that about Zelda tears of the kingdom and then bg3 happened
                I was one of the people saying BG3 would win months before it even released and everyone was calling me crazy saying there was no chance since it was too niche and TOTK already had it on lock lol. TOTK was way too repetitive and derivative of BOTW for me to think it would win.
                    I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
                        Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
            Sorry my money is on stellar blade.
            Yes, let's not see what other games have to offer, no, let's give the award for copying someone else's homework.

I'm sorry but originality should be a factor when considering games. Why should a remake be given credit when it's every existence is built off of something that worked prior and is selling BECAUSE of the name attached to it.

Seriously, if this game wasn't called FF7 would any of you actually give two hot cares after a month? No, not really. And prove to me otherwise if you can, you won't but you're welcome to try.
        Yeah I remember early on in 2023 everyone was debating if it would be FF16 or tears of the kingdom that would win GOTY. And it ended up being Baldurs gate 3 that swept
            The fact that you forgot about Starfield in there says a lot. It was supposed to be a three way brawl between TotK, FFXVI and Starfield, and then BG3 and Alan Wake 2 kicked out the latter two out of nowhere.
                Eh unlike others I never bought into Starfield hype. Even the release trailers felt dull to me, and then it actually released and was somehow worse than I was thinking it would be. But yeah 2023 was very dynamic for gaming
        Gotta see what wukong looks like first.
        Your right, better wait till Steller Blade comes out, that ass might take GOTY!, we'll see!.
    The Game Awards is a joke, I still remember the robbery of 2020 (even Ghost of Tsushima deserved it more). Since then I only watched the show just to see new trailers, they lost every bit of reputation to my eyes.
    I don't even think it's game of the month. I finished it and felt like it was the most bloated, boring game I've played in a decade 

I was thoroughly excited. I mastered the original as a teen and couldn't contain my excitement with Remake ... Then I played rebirth. Nostalgia aside, this game feels 10 years past due. 

I really feel like the reviews are bought, its all fake news, and the only people that like the game are the same people who like everything. 

Sales are in the toilet. SE is changing strategy, and it's clear that Rebirth will be seen as a disappointment.
        This opinion is so shit i just down voted and moved on
Also people that don't own a ps5 yet
I know several people who are (IMO foolishly considering the amount of gaming involved) waiting for the trilogy to be done before diving in.
I'm waiting like probably many people, for it to drop on steam
    The remake shot up in sales on steam when rebirth came out so I believe it.
    But, this game created in unreal engine, so there are high chances, again, that this will be on epic exclusive first, then steam. So players will have to wait longer and there are port issues as well.
Especially since us PC players have to wait!
I’m just barely getting around to playing Remake (playing on Steamdeck and it’s amazing) and will absolutely be buying Rebirth as well once I can get it on Steam so there is definitely a tail to sales on games like this.
One of the best games I have ever played. I just finished at over 65 hours. And wasn't bored the whole damn time. They did rebirth (the remake) justice. And did not really deviate from the original story. If anything they made it better.
There are a lot of people i remember, for both Remake and Rebirth, saying they would wait until the trilogy was done before picking it up. I feel like there will be a small but noticeable spike for Remake/Birth when part 3 comes out.
'member when games could only physically ever "sell over time" ?

I feel like the last 10 years of gaming have seen decreased quality from established studios in pursuit of juicing quarterly profits.

I'm glad at least some pockets of SquareEnix are insulated from the CEO's bizarre bullshit.
I'll tell you what. I am glad I waited until a few weeks before the release of Rebirth to sell my extra copy of Remake Deluxe Edition on eBay.
>While it’s my personal GOTY so far, if it doesn’t win at least Best Music or best RPG I’d be shocked

This is a pretty hot take considering we're less than half way through
    It's a completely reasonable take, a tepid take even, the commenter even qualifies it with "so far" and then takes their expectations down for a future awards season. A hot take would be something like "this is the greatest RPG of the last decade" or something conversation worthy like that at least.
+ OG FF7 shot up to the Top 20 or so on the Nintendo Store for Wii purely based on Rebirth hype. They're raking in hella direct revenue for Rebirth, twin pack sales, and a shitload just from remnant sales of OG.  It is bananas, let alone merchandising, licensing, etc.  Anyone who doesn't see how lucrative this is for SE needs to take a product marketing and econ class or something
The only reason I'm still slightly concerned is because of Square not making any statements about it. Both 16 and Remake did. But I doubt it's selling badly.
    Does anyone really think Enix would have promoted Hamaguchi if this was disappointing to them?? Lmao people are stupid.
        A game can be a critical success but not necessarily a commercial success. Its widely recognised that this is a great game, and I'm certain that they are making money from it. But square was very quick to parade the sales of FF7 remake and FF16, so why the conspicuous silence here? But still, promoting your top talents is not a bad move from the company especially since Rebirth probably is making them a tidy profit overall, and that they seem to be committed to doing the 3rd part.
            Listen money and business are money and business. No one is being promoted to executive over cute reviews and good fan reception lol.
                The consumer view of the brand is extraordinarily important. When its clear you've created a quality product, the company can leverage that to make a lot more money down the line through various other means. Lets say this game didn't meet sales expectations hypothetically, the question is does it matter? Well it might not, the fans that did buy are very positive so it raises new income avenues later. My point is, I believe that they are profiting from Rebirth, I don't believe they are meeting forecasts however. But either way, they can still use the quality of this product to make a reasonable sum overall
                    I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
        The promoted him over the critical reception which sits at 90+ on metacritic, the highest since FFX I think. They didn't expect that, they thought it will be similar to Remake's score. Hamaguchi exceeded their expectation. Sales is another matter, more often than not it doesn't reflect the quality of a game.
    It probably didn't break the 3 million sales mark yet, I think that's when they talked about FF16?
The Rebirth not selling well arguments were all mostly done in bad faith because they didn’t take into account anything other than Japan nor considering the PS5 install base and just compared it to Remake as if Remake didn’t have the benefit of the much larger PS4 install base.
i think for casual consumers its just too confusing between remake and rebirth and stuff. 

most people already find the way the final fantasy series works to be confusing. they see that theres 16 games and at first glance it looks like an mcu type situation where you have to start from the beginning. so theres already a hump you have to get people over. then people dont understand how the remake works. they thought remake was the entire game and dont understand why theres rebirth coming out. then they look it up and see intermission and intergrade and it makes it worse. then they look it up more and see all the reddit posts and reactions of overeager fan’s over explaining how “uh uh its actually a super meta sequel while also being a remake so honestly you should play the og and the psp game first ☝️🤓” it *is* a confusing story but you should find that out naturally by playing the game. barrier of entry is pretty high so lots of people just dont bother because it seems like too much of a headache
    Also a fair point, I know I avoided the series for a while for those exact reasons. I never played an FF game until Remake. Even then I've only played Remake, Rebirth, OG 7, 15, and 16. 

Either way, like I said I just want it to do really well because it's really special to me
    "Casual" consumers don't care about literally any of that stuff lmfaooo. Casual consumers pick up whatever looks interesting - no search required. This sub alone was full of people being confused because they started with Rebirth - aka they never looked it up and got turned away.

Just saying stuff to say stuff is not good for an argument
    Im a casual gamer and I know the difference.. it's not rocket science..
    No if you're a real casual you would think new game cool imma play it. If you're a "reddit casual" you do a deep dive of an hour to know where to start and than complain it doesn't make sense. Lmao do you understand what casual means? Looking shit up online or  on Reddit posts does not make you a casual ffs.
        in that case casuals arent touching an 80 hour long JRPG lol. clearly i meant more so gamers who arent familiar with FF
May 13 SE reports figures I don't think they will report anything before this. I think it sold well. Regardless of what the internet says about XVI, si many people beat it. They are likely to buy. It will do well with VII fans. It will do well with JRPG fans because of the crazy good reviews. It got amazing reviews praising its open world which will also be attractive to SP players in general. And not a ton of competition with other titles. I would be shocked if it sold less than 3 million in the quarter they will report on, I expect close to 4 million.
    Im not sure those are great sales. Tears of the kingdom sold 10 million in a weekend .

Sure the switch has a bigger install base still FF7 is one of the most important games of all time and this was a remake. It should have sold unprecedented numbers.

I like the game but I think the market is showing they didn’t like certain decisions square took
        Quick reminder that the Switch has roughly 130 Million Units sold,the PS5 50 Million. Considering that Rebirth is likely a smashing success,not to mention what happens once it hits PC's.
            Rebirth is a success but not a smashing one.  Its still selling less than dragons dogma 2 and helldivers which is a huge success
                both those games are available for pc day 1, which has an even bigger install base than the switch
                    Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.  


Dragons dogma 2 I believe was third
        Zelda is bigger with casual audiences and is like the big budget swan song game of one of the most successful consoles of all time. I think reunion might eventually get to 10 million but it wont be in 2024 and probably not 2025.
        Final fantasy is just played out for people right now.  No one new wants to play the 16th game of a series or a remake of a 30 year old game
        JRPG audience is not even remotely close to LOZ's casual friendly open world sandbox audience. It's not a worthwhile comparison in the first place
Yeah. Not to be mean, but they didn’t read the post nor the sources/articles I posted. Or they didn’t understand.
    Dragon Dogma 2 sold 77k copies in JPN in March and it was said, that it sold 2.5 Million copies Worldwide. 

So, FFVII Rebirth, which sold 310k copies (which is roughly 4 times more then DG 2) in JPN, must have sold around 10 Million Copies Worldwide. 

I believe my Logic is flawless and ultimately the truth. 

/s
    I had a guy arguing with me about sales, telling me my numbers were wrong and thus I must be making it all up, and as proof, he linked me a fucking article that he obviously didn't read because it confirmed my numbers were correct almost exactly..

People are really, really stupid.
    Your math is really shit. Your EU sales is literally just 4% more, which could literally mean 2k copies or 5k copies.
He's completely fucking wrong that's why.
OP is making faulty conclusions. Numbers mean nothing in a vacuum. Rebirth sold less than half as much as Remake did in Japan - and Remake underperformed somewhat compared to expectations. Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

The PS5 has a much smaller install base than the PS4, but that doesn't mean Square Enix will be happy with the numbers for Rebirth. After all, it sold around the same as FF16, which also underperformed compared to their expectations.

We can also just look at https://psnprofiles.com/games?order=owners&platform=ps5, to see that Rebirth has a far lower player number than the biggest hits on PS5 - literally less than 10% of the sales of Spiderman: Miles Morales for example.
    >Numbers mean nothing in a vacuum.

He wrote, while looking at all his Numbers he wrote in a Vacuum. 

Breaking News:

FFVII Rebirth Daily Active User Peak was 2.2 Million on Launch on a Console that has around 1/3 of the Units (38 Million) sold, as the PS4 in 2020 (110 Million) when FFVII Remake sold 3.5  Million in a Week.
        Those numbers line up exactly and precisely with what I said. You actually thought they supported your argument and not mine?
            Your Numbers don't line up with what you said at all and than you bring PSN profiles as a Source into this and compare Miles Morales with which released 3,5 years ago with a Game that released a Month ago. This is a site only counts people who registered there and not actual players? You know that, right? You're making a fool out of yourself, if you believe that Sites Numbers mean anything.

>Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

You really try to compare 5,5 years of FFXV which released on PS and XBox with 4 years FFVII which is a PS exclusive?

FFXV released 2016, it took 5,5 years to reach 10 Million Sales and it was Multiplatform from the beginning. It was released on PC 2 years later. 

FFVII released while a Worldwide Lockdown happened and 3.5 Units have been sold in just a week, went to PS5 a year and PC 6 months later and then it reached 7 Million Sales October 2023 (3,5 years later after launch). The PS4 had an install Basis of approximately 110 Million Consoles at the time of the FFVII Remake launch in 2020. FFVII Remake will probably reach 8 or more Million by 2025.  
  
FFVII Rebirth released just now as a PS5 exclusive and has a Install Basis of only 1/3 of the PS4 when Remake released. FFVII Rebirth sold more copies in Europe on day one than FFXVI in 10 days. All that on the PS5 which has an install Basis of only \~40 Million, while Remake has had an install Basis of 108 Million at Launch of Remake. 

Lifetime Sales will be great for both FFVII Rebirth and FFXVI because more People will buy PS5s and some of them will buy at least one of the Main Series FF Titles.
                Nothing of what you say is wrong (other than the poor wording and grammar of your post), but you're completely missing the point.

Square Enix doesn't make money based on how big the sales are relative to the install base or relative to expected sales in a pandemic or any other "relative to". They make money based on copies sold. When the copies sold are fewer, but they spent the same budget on the product, it does not matter one bit what the excuses are - they're losing money which is the bottom line. You need to stop seeing it as some kind of contest when it's not a contest, it's a business.
                    ![gif](giphy|pfHBWCCOySoRq|downsized)
                        I did not move the goalposts. You just lack reading comprehension skills and the ability to understand numbers.
                            ![gif](giphy|xUA7bazBa69nSu6lPy)
                                You're not winning any arguments by hiding behind meme images, manchild.
    They probably know that it will sell more over time since many want to wait till the trilogy is over
        They hope that, for sure, and also that it will sell more on different platforms. Remake has been selling pretty well on Steam recently for example. It's by no means too late for these games to be a financial success in the end, but they're not there yet.
            But idk why they would make it a PS5 exclusive such a dumb decision for sales
    Cool story bro
Sony is very cagey about revealing how much their games sell even when the amount is an insanely good number, The developer of Days Gone  claimed that they allegedly sold over 8 million copies and outsold Ghost of Tsushima for a certain time period but Sony never revealed how much it actually sold
    Because it didn't sell 8 million. It was 8 million who had the game. The game was on PS+ for a while and that's why it never got an official number like with Ghost of Tsushima who did sell 8 million. Sony have never been cagey when the sales are good. 

In this case I think it's more on Square than it is Sony. Why Square isn't releasing the numbers is anyones guess. They did do it for FF16, so hopefully we get one soon here.
        Square usually does, but not right away.

And yeah, Sony releases numbers when good. Days Gone was a flop by basically every sense of the word. It was a mediocre game by a dev only known for a really bad platformer 30 years ago. And the game felt like design by committee: post apocalyptic biker with a heart dealing with zombies. The reaction that triggers is the same reaction I had to seeing Kid G at the saucer for the first time - this is anachronistic and out of date.
            I bet you wouldn't mouth off straight to Kid G's face like that!
                I probably would. Not in a mocking way, but in a "*dude,* I'm taking you to J. Crew (they're back in, roughly around the time skinny jeans became anachronistic and out of date), like right now because you need *help*."

Mostly because if I said in a mocking way, I'd probably be paste on a wall somewhere.
            Square released FFXVI sales 6 days after launch..
    Thank you for explaining. The example made the reasons behind it much clearer now!
Good question
correct sony, microsoft and nintendo do not show sales.
People are coping. The digital sales are unknown because they aren't yet at a point that Square is comfortable at telling them publicly. It's simple as that.

Does this mean FF Rebirth is doomed and the world will end? No. But it's breaking all expectations and selling as much as Square predicted to it's investors? Also probably not.

But lets watch people downvoting me for telling facts that they don't like.
    I agree with you, nothing unreasonable about what you said. Anyone with eyes can see the engagement online isn't as big as it was in the Remake days. That coupled with unreleased sales numbers does make you worry. In the end who cares, the game is great, and as long as we get that part 3 thats all a fan really cares about
Almost no one likes to share these numbers, even streaming services like Netflix don't like to share numbers. I don't know why, likely something to do with legal stuff or maybe stocks? I don't know, but I bet money is the reason. Good or bad.
    Dude they release XVI sales 6 days after release. Ya know, the game this sub loves to shit on..
        There's a lot of reasons companies do and do not release information and to just assume it's because of bad numbers is being a bit disingenuous.

For all we know Square Enix could have had massively unrealistic expectations with sales and the true number could actually be quite good but incredibly disappointing in lieu of their expectations, we don't know. Square Enix has had a long history of absurdly optimistic sales expectations.

It makes more sense to just wait until numbers do get released.

I also don't think it should go without saying that Square Enix is also likely aware of a segment of their fanbase that is vocal about not buying any ore installments until the entirety of FF7 is available.
It’s been over a month my guy. Basing your assumptions from this isnt really good. Ff7 rebirth maintained number 2 spot for weeks. Most of its downloads and sales were done. It’ll just be a slow sales and download from now on. It’s Slowing down now that’s why it’s being pushed down the list now with newer games released.
Right.  Hamaguchi got promoted for his accomplishments on rebirth.
Probably because no one wants a promotion at square. Getting a promotion means you're going to have 50 projects dumped on you. Dude was probably the only person that would accept it lmfao.

But getting a promotion could mean nothing. It does not mean the game was successful. Sales numbers show how successful the game is, and they still haven't released them
This makes sense. It's targeting the same demographic in the same platform. I would expect the numbers to be very similar.
Your pronoun usage here is *wild*. What?
    Not English native, and i rushed that message, sorry
        No need to apologize. You applied gender to inanimate objects so it was very confusing at first but we got what you meant.
            Yea that happens, in many languages, there’s no pronouns. English is also my second language, we dont use pronouns on my first language, however we have nouns and adjectives that are gender based. Like for instance amerikano vs amerikana. And no spanish isnt my language lol
    You didn't hear? Dragons Dogma came out as a He/Blu Ray Disc/ephemeral download.
Yeah, but this sub is so hopped up on copium that it's about as bad as the doomers in terms of exaggeration (edit: nvm, googled the 'content creators' he's referring to and fine they're still way worse)

I don't think it outsold Remake but I'd say it sold decently (and at least at par with FFXVI) and your estimate seems close which could also be why Square didnt post it since it isn't particulatly stellar

Just hope it's selling to expectations and has a longer tail (I sure as hell am buying it again on PC)
    Oh it absolutely didn't outsell Remake and 3M is stellar for most games but not for this game in particular, and I agree that's probably why they didn't post the results because the point of doing that is marketing, but not reaching a great milestone for this game won't work. In FFXVI's case it actually backfired and people (and journalists, which is worse) said it was a flop, so they learned their lesson.


Yeah, I've had discussions with people that said it didn't reach 1M, which is preposterous, though I think they have some kind of agenda, like hating the Remake project or wanting to criticize the exclusivity deal.
        This whole discussion is ridiculous to me. Square Enix have had orlutrageously optimistic/unrealistic sales expectations for nearly every game they have released in a decade. We have no idea what they expected FF7 Rebirth to do internally. If they expected upwards of 7-10 million copies, even 5 million would be embarrassing to them. All we know is that it's likely it didn't reach what they expected but that could be poor sales or just unattainable expectations.
Crazy how no one will upvote this, because people would rather be delusional about that stuff.
Silence from OP LMFAO
The duel pack actually is considered separately. I think in the Uk Rebirth was number 2 or 3 and the twin pack was number 8
    They're listed separately in the charts, but that doesn't mean official numbers would recognize them separately, is what I'm saying.

I was mostly basing it on what [Chris Dring said,](https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1766153927727227344) where he combined Twin Pack + Rebirth sales and pointed out that Rebirth sold +6% over XVI at launch in the UK.
haha, the first sane person in this thread.  I do find the discourse hilarious on this too.
    LOUDER PLZ
Yeah, and it should have sold more than FFXVI then since it's FF7. Yet rebirth didn't sell more than XVI..
I think this is the right take, and its also important to remember the reality is that Square Enix just needs to earn back mainstream consumer trust. It's why they haven't hit numbers like GoW, Elden Ring, and other colossal heavy hitters.

They spent a lot of time overmarketing their low investment mid games like forspoken and other bullshit like that over the years and I think now when people hear Square they just don't think AAA games like they used to. Their games are never universal 9+ critically acclaimed GOTY contenders, even from fans, and often aren't even finalists. When not even your fans can agree, your games are good.. You have a problem. They've fallen into mid territory because they lost their identity. I think that all changes, starting now.

I think rebirth is, without a doubt, the best game they've made since FFX, and this will be the entry that puts them back on the map. It gave me the same feelings as GoW 2018, and I hold that game in extremely high regard. I think it's a GOTY contender, and I don't say that lightly. It's really that good. After playing it, and then playing remake again... the improvements are astounding. They've truly learned a lot
I can basically guarantee that Elden ring will continue to sell well forever, but I do agree that JRPGs have a much smaller audience and that FF7 is probably going to sell a lot of copies over a long timeline
I dont like that phase too, and the ending itself. Too cliffhanging over there…
The actual Ampere article says that Rebirth’s launch peak numbers were 2.21 million… at launch. That’s likely the first day sales or close to it.
    Probably the first week sales.
        Perhaps! But it’s been over a month since that number. So I think this is more evidence to support my point. Thank you for sharing.
            Sales dropped hard after the first week. You're acting like it's going to make more money than after release. That's not how game sales work.
I agree with most of what you’re saying, but I do think palworld and helldivers isn’t a great comparison. They are significantly cheaper games. Much easier to get a much larger number of players to try them out.

Only bringing that up because I’ve seen the comparisons before and it seems a little unfair.

Also it’s much easier for me to convince a friend to spend 30-40 on a game we can play together, vs 70 on a game we play alone.
    Yeah. It cannot be understated the importance of being locked to PS5 vs PC for half the price makes a world of difference. I know of several people who borrowed their friends' consoles and copies which doesn't drive up sales. They're playing it- but why spend half of your monthly check on 1 game if you don't own a console with 0 exclusives.

Or- 1 exclusive and everything else coming multiplat later
        Another really good point.

I know that the team has been pretty adamant that the game they made wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t an exclusive, but I think we’ll see less games like Rebirth going forward in order to boost multiple platform sales.
            I think you're underestimating how much money Sony would pay Square for that exclusivity.  That type of revenue is far more important than sales to a company because it represents ZERO overhead.  They just need to delay releasing it on other platforms (which will launch as a game of the year pack or something sparking even more sales and coverage).
                The help Sony provides is a short term financial solution for square. The money they get from Sony also does not offset a potential increase of 300k+ more sales on other platforms.

Releasing later doesn’t guarantee an equivalent number of sales, only delayed. People move on/lose interest. 

The biggest benefit Square has working with Sony is development support, and that hardware capability. Both Creative Buis. Unit 1 and 3 have been fairly public about that. Rebirth would not exist the way it does had it been developed for multiple platforms.

The issue square is having, that is increasing year over year, is brand recognition. The FF brand needs better reach than it does now for a long term solve. (Among other things it needs) This isn’t my conjecture. Yoshi P spoke adamantly about the problems with the FF brand and the aging fan base.

In short: this deal benefits Sony more than Square.

I’m fairly educated on this. I work in the entertainment industry as a director.
                    All good points.  I work in finance though, in a senior-level corporate setting, so I know how boards think, how budgets are managed and how the immediate and likely high eight- or NINE-FIGURE sum that Sony paid for FF exclusivity -- with **no cost** for overhead, human resource, real estate, R&D, utilities, insurance, tax etc. -- is a lot more attractive than the *potential* sales they could rake in and all the risk and huge costs involved with going multi-platform.

As I said, I think you're not quite realizing that that money is risk-free, guaranteed and immediate.  Put it this way:

1. $100 right in my pocket making interest for exclusivity + $100 in sales - $70 in costs

Or

2) $0 in my pocket not making interest + $200 (and this number is super variable/risky) in sales - $150 in costs (this number is based on your comment that the fact that they are single-platform makes it easier to develop).

100% of the time a corporation with any hint of risk management or even just an accounting department will choose #1.  And they're right to.
                        No, I definitely do realize it’s risk free and immediate. I said it’s a short term financial solution. 

What I’m saying is that the strategy is how square has been operating for some time now, and they’ve openly acknowledged the problem with the brand recently. 

These short term solutions don’t keep the brand alive, that they need to remain a studio of their size. It won’t matter how much money Sony gives them if the brand looses viability. And at a certain point Sony won’t see the value in dumping money into the exclusivity of a franchise that’s sales diminish year over year. 

Square has already acknowledged the poor sales, and is trying to solve the problem. They’ve even cited slow adoption of the PS5 as a contributing factor. They’ve also seen stock prices decline as a result of these marquee titles  not selling the larger numbers that other recent titles have.

A studio is only as valuable as the brands that it sells.

The question isn’t will they pull the plug on the deal, but who does it first.

EDIT: Looking at it financially, what’s the smarter option long term, assuming you’re capable of both…

Graduate high school and take a low skill, decent pay job at a factory, making 20-30 an hour?

Or going to med school, taking on the debt, and getting a job as a cardiologist or an equivalent profession?

Which person is more likely to be financially well off at 65?

You chose a pretty smart field (smarter than me TBH, lol), so I think you know the answer.
                            I didn't say that what the Boards (or Square) does is the best for long-term success. Having worked with people in very very high up positions, they are no smarter than any one else (the moment you realize that the chairman of the board of your company is just as much as a dumb-dumb as you are is a beautiful moment). What I am saying is that from an decision-makers will always go for money first and forego future profits to ensure that you are less exposed to risk.

There is also an argument that that IS the right move.  Taking a lump sum and investing it is 100% better than being paid out the lump sum over the course of 50 years.  In the first situation, you are making the interest, in the second THEY are making the interest.

So, to answer your question at the bottom. I actually think that the smarter move for most people is to take the low-skilled, well paying job and invest your excess money.  I know complete morons who earned their MBAs (fun fact, you can't 'fail' and MBA, so next time someone tries to wave it in your face, scoff and think to yourself 'you could be a moron who just so happened to have access to $120K in debt) and I'll tell you this: The moron who spent $120K on an MBA in their 30s will NOT be more financially well off at 65 than any person who brought in a steady income from the age of 18 (assuming they're not buying time shares in Florida, or renting sports cars).

That being said, the impressive person who gets an MBA in their 30s likely has a plan and will be better off than the moron with the MBA, or anyone who's worked since their 18 (but that person who's worked since their 18 will still be in a pretty good spot, honestly).

And here is where we converge: The 'impressive person' I talk about up there?  That's the brand.  If the brand is impressive, then the company will succeed.  If the brand is the moron who paid for an MBA, the company won't succeed. If the brand is the basic person who worked from 18 with OK pay, then you'll get, I suppose, the equivalent of a company that sells necessary staples (like flour, or soap); they bring in money, no one is dying of hunger, but their dead on the inside. I honestly think we're more in sync than this long exchange would have you believe.

Despite what I'll tell you at the end, I do not know enough about Square's statements to have a say in this.  If they're worried about the decline of their brand I think that's fair.  FF has never mattered more than it did with 7 and that was almost 30 years ago.  But sales? I think they need to take adjust expectations. 

And though I work in finance, I'm actually a journalist. I just sold out and went corporate. So believe me, I chose a pretty terrible field honestly.  But I learn a lot more about a wider range things and get to talk to more incredible people (and not so incredible) than most humans do, so it's kinda cool.

Cheers!

PS: The best case, I can think of is Sony buys Square and Capcom.  If Microsoft can dodge regulators and buy Bethesada and Activision Blizzard, then Sony should do the same.
                                I get that. What I’m saying is what they have done, vs what they will do. 

So when I responded to what you said, that I’m underestimating the money they get with Sony exclusivity deals, it’s that I don’t think I am because Square I aware of the sales problem and does see it as a red flag, going as far as citing the platform as a part of that issue.

My suggestion is that it seems like their strategy will change as a result. Your original response seemed to suggest that it won’t. We don’t disagree on the points that each strategy has. We divert on what they Will be likely to do going forward.

So when I say they are likley to shift that strategy, it’s based off of their quarterly reports, as well as the evidence that square themselves has cited.

Side note. I don’t think you sold out, you made a smart call. Journalism ain’t easy friend. I can’t claim to be an expert in it, but I have to imagine our disciplines are similar in stability, and while I’ve managed to be lucky, I see how many people better than me haven’t been. You’re smart for having that back up.

Regarding the P.S. I think I agree.
Also RE series is a good example of how the game quality often influences future sales more than sales of that title.

Re3r is a much worse reviewed and less acclaimed game than re4r, but re4r suffers more in sales.

Just goes to show that this 1:1 game comparison stuff is largely BS anyways. Ff16 and remake quality likely affected sales of Rebirth more than the quality of Rebirth itself did. The quality of Rebirth is probably going to influence sales of part 3.
Personally I care because I love the game and I want it to do well because that has an impact on the future of the franchise.

I think Rebirth should be the template going forward, as opposed to something like XVI which I really didn't vibe with.

Rebirth's sales matter tremendously in terms of communicating to Square Enix what people want from Final Fantasy. 

It matters in terms of potential directions for FF17 and beyond, it matters for the budget and resources that will be dedicated to Part 3, and it matters for the possibility of future remakes.

If a Remake of FF7 does not do well enough, the odds of getting something like FF6 or FF9 remade will go down tremendously. Or they will be low budget remakes.

The bottom line is sales obviously matter for the future of Final Fantasy.
    That's fair enough, I want it to do well too, but it seems like this is more of a FF16 vs FF7Re feud. I loved both games, albeit for entirely different reasons, but I think both are amazing games.

Personally, I don't think Rebirth should be the template, the same way I don't think 16 should be the template. I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, so I probably wouldn't care if they made FF17 into a third person shooter, tbh.

I also don't really want any other FF remakes, and I'd rather they'd focus on moving the series forward. I think 9 is great the way it is, and I personally didn't like 6, so I don't care much for it being remade.

I guess my confusion comes from the fact that every single conversation on this topic, over the past few weeks, had a strong focus on the numbers, and not much else. It was either "lmao this game flopped" or some random speculation about the actual sales figure, accompanied by paranoid theories like "the game sold poorly, that's why they're hiding the sales figure from us". It didn't really feel like people were concerned about, solely because of their love for the series.
        > I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, 

That's fair, but I do want to clarify what I meant by "template". I don't necessarily mean specific gameplay or combat systems.

I mean stuff like having a party with multiple playable characters, having some element of strategy even if the combat is action based, having beautiful and interesting towns that feel lively and full of activities, having fun side content like minigames and optional exploration, level / dungeon design that isn't just hallways, worthwhile loot and rewards to find, interesting gear and itemization systems, proper RPG elements, etc...

Those elements to me are essential to a Final Fantasy game, and Rebirth had all of them (and nailed all of them), while FF16 had literally none of them. Only one character, zero strategy, boring and empty towns with zero activities (the beautiful cities like Oriflamme aren't even explorable, we only get to visit bland places like Northreach and Martha's Rest), very minimal side content and what is there is mostly not good, almost no RPG systems or any kind of interesting gear or itemization, very linear hallway dungeons, etc...

To be clear, I didn't hate 16. I loved its characters, its art direction, its atmosphere, and its music. I thought the voice acting and English localization were very good. The lore was solid and pretty interesting. I enjoyed the darker, grittier tone of the game. And of course the game offers a lot of spectacle.

But the combat was too easy and too shallow, the world was bland and devoid of content despite being beautiful, and exploration was completely worthless. Those elements make it a big disappointment for me. I am okay with innovation and change, but some fundamentals need to be kept, and I think 16 is just too streamlined to actually scratch my FF itch. It needed more substance and more meat on its bones imo.
people like to fight their pokemon in any way they can (I used that right, right? I've never played a pokemon game).

I remember when I was a child I cared a lot about sales too.  I think a lot of the people who care about sales are children, or have the mind of a child.  It is a way for their 'thing' to be validated.  As your grow up, you realize that's an incredibly sad way to live your life and you start caring about important things.

I'm not immune.  I want to see Rebirth sell well, I clikced on this thread, so did you and there are plenty of people here who are saying 'good, I really liked this game'.  But I think the flame wars that break out and the pearl-clutching that normies if something doesn't sell IMMEDIATELY is mostly kids who don't really know the world, or themselves, yet.

As I age, I actually think more about games that I don't like selling badly, because that might shift the market away from them.  Like anything from Rockstar, I would love to see GTA6 flop so we can stop having them suck up all the oxygen in the video game discussion and stop having other devs try to copy their crappy game design and juvenile mindset. EDIT: But you see how now I'm acting like a child, just as chided above?  It's the same things and both are sad.
Because the sales info has a real impact on the future of the trilogy and future FF games at Square.
Because OP is in denial and it most likely didn't meet squares expectations
One hundred million times this. 

Nomura is a garbage writer that couldn't even wrap up his own convoluted series in a coherent, satisfactory way (KH3). Now he's using FF7 Remake as his narcissistic passion project in order to tie into his own shitty movie Advent Children.
Rebirth is also a direct sequel to another game where 16 is standalone. The fact that it performed only a little worse than 16 despite the audience for the game being constrained by those who bought into FF7 Remake tells me it's doing just fine.
I think Final Fantasy is just on a downward trend in Japan, regardless of the quality of the title or who it’s marketed towards. FF15 sold more than FF7 Remake which sold more than FF16 which sold more than FF7 Rebirth.

Also, apparently game sales for PlayStation are faltering in Japan in general. It will be interesting to see how KH4 and DQ12 perform with this in mind, though it may be quite a while before we see either of those (specifically the latter).
![gif](giphy|AKg48AT4Ai8ei8uHhf|downsized)
Read the post and data carefully. You are reading only physical sales which are in downward trend compared to digital. In Europe, rebirth sold more in 1 day than 16 did in 10 days. https://twitter.com/mrpyo1/status/1770804261074468928

I also explained that Rebirth was split between two SKUs: 1) the standalone rebirth game and 2) the twin pack.  Please look carefully.
    And I addressed your comments about twin pack. I don't think it changes the sales figure that much for japan.

And in Japan Physical Sales outsell Digital by a lot. And of course I'm reading Physical Sales, that's what the new Famitsu Report is all about and it's the only numerical sales value we do have.

And this "UK" Report Tweet is a mess, I have read it many many times before, and read the links it cites.

Edit: Also "FF16 sold in 10 days what FF7 Rebirth sold in 1" has no reference,  as someone else in this TWEET you're linking pointed out: [https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525](https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525)

Again, we're free to interpret and speculate about these data as much as we want, but unless Square releases official statements, it's all speculations.

So let's just accept that neither you nor me have facts, and that nobody has to "please look carefully because I'm the authority here", cool? :)
You people need to respect OPs and actually engage with the material they post before you just say whatever you want that is very clearly misinformed 😭
    They are. You guys are just plugging your ears and ignoring the facts.
Did you bother to read the fucking post?
    Yes.

What part of my breakdown of it you disagree?
Ikr? It's amazing how much they are in denial. At least FFXVI fans weren't this nutty.
Bingo, seems like OP is trying to paint a skewed narrative based off some loose comments and tweets. If it was the case that rebirth outsold FF16, square would’ve come out by now and said so. FF7R probably sold just below FF16 all things considered.
Rebirth is good, but I think this year Helldivers 2 has a good shot at taking a lot of GotY awards. Yeah, it's a multiplayer game which typically don't have a chance at GotY, but if Arrowhead continues to kill it through the end of the year with their storytelling I think it's got a shot.

FF7 Rebirth has too many small execution errors to get GotY especially with all the other strong games coming out.
    Not a chance. 

Helldivers is fun but it's nowhere NEAR the experience rebirth is.

What you're saying is *literally* false lmao hot take of the century
        We shall see :) I look forward to who gets to say "I told you so" at the end of the year.
        You can't call an opinion false..
Nah, helldivers will 100% be GOTY. I enjoyed rebirth but helldivers is so fun
Yet FFXVI is selling more.. shit in FFXVI all you want, but they clearly did something right that caused it to sell more. I think it's the darker setting with older characters.

Not many people in the west want to play as some teenage anime characters. Western audiences like darker games with more grown-up characters. I'm surprised that XVI sold more in Japan. But I also think it's because they wanted to try out a more western game. Usually the Japanese audience don't play dark games besides souls games.  So FFXVI was a nice change. While rebirth is a great game, it doesn't do anything new.
gacha games are keeping aaa games alive, lmao... and FF14 is still making tons for SE.
Yeah, I’d guess between 3.5 and 4.
Killing it in terms of being a Final Fantasy game lmao. It will always have lower numbers than fucking Spiderman (especially in the MCU era) and a fucking FPS multiplayer. That should be extremely obvious, but I guess not.
    Square Enix desperately wants Final Fantasy to be a mainstream AAA gigahit, which it used to be, and spends that level of budget on it. It's not a sustainable franchise with current sales vs budget. It doesn't matter how it performs versus YOUR expectations when the facts are that it's underperforming compared to how it has to perform in order to be successful, and Square Enix stocks are flagging.
        It really never used to be an AAA gigahit on the more modern age. And you guys playing investors without the necessary data is extremely laughable, so thanks for that
Where did you read that FF16 underperformed? This kind of baseless comment is my problem.
    Square Enix earnings report to their investors.
        Check again. I think you’ll find the truth is different than what you’re saying.
    Square Enix themselves literally said it was a bit below their projections, but they have an 18-month plan to make up those sales.
        Receipts, please. https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1704139141192003834
Yeah but it’s still good to see physical doing better, there should always be an insensitive to keep both keeping competition in sale.
Not for ps studios or nintendo and especially not in Japan. Insomniac leak showed us the real split. I think final fantasy games still have a majority of its sales phsyical.
70% of game sales in Japan are physical. So you're wrong.
    over three-quarters of the global console gaming market share is in the US, UK, and France alone, where digital is king, so they're not wrong
    Like someone else stated. Japan doesn’t reflect the rest of the world. It’s a tiny market compared to most others and In most others, digital dominates.
Exactly what i did. I was waiting for the pro but said F it and bought the slim. So, i ran through Intermission a week before Rebirth lol. Also knocked out HFW:BS which didnt disappoint.
    Would be interesting to see how ps5 sales increased due to Rebirth.
Source?
    https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/5j5RhCc9Ml
        Ok, but this is Sony studios, right, which is only one studio among many? The overall trend in the market as per May Priscilla is an entirely different stat.
            Multiple studios but yes Sony first party games. But I would be very very surprised if Square Enix had a bigger % digital sales than ps studios.
I'm anticipating a Dirge of Cerberus remaster. It would make sense as a way to hype Vincent up before he becomes playable in part 3. And would match how they did CCR before Part 2 as a way to hype up Zack being relevant
    Its gonna be so bad but so good
    Is there any DLC planned for Rebirth? A Vincent DLC not unlike the Yuffie DPC could do the same.
        I believe they have confirmed there will not be any DLC between part 2 and 3
            Dirge of Cerberus remaster it is then ha.
That's what I'm a bit worried about. I think Square corporate is punking the FF Managment team for this multimedia hit and after Ever Crisis and adjacent sub-projects flopped they may not be as lenient with teh money spent on the big 3 games. I'm really fearful that Part 3 will be a departure in quality because I've just seen that so many time before. Uncharted 3, Jak 3, Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 3. Where the publisher is like "Y U no make more money!?!?" and start to impose ridiculous mandates that end up messing with the creative effort, and leading to a really rushed deadline.
    Yh I worry about this. Rebirth was great but as with every recent square rpg since the 00’s, there are massive issues with it. Issues that can be overlooked because the overall package is fantastic, but the open world tower design and repetitive icon hunting really became a drag by the time you get to gongaga/cosmo. I bloody loved the game, my GOTY for sure, nothing will come close. But I felt the same with 16. It was brilliant for different reasons but I had a bit of a sour taste in my mouth for everything it got so wrong. Rebirth is better than 16 imo but man they need to sort the repetition.

And as to your original point, it being a part 3 has me worried a lesser investment will lead to even more copy and paste side activity design. And we all know from game to game these publishers just HAVE to make it bigger. Way bigger. Can’t wait for all the “the overall map size is 2-3 times the size of rebirth”. That would be absolutely fine, but ONLY if that map is well designed with a frankly staggering amount of worthwhile content. Not time wasting. 

It’s very clear to me that things like the mako springs and divine intel were shoehorned in as filler. Would’ve been so much better if the divine intel was scrapped entirely and you just come across a small cave/dungeon that leads to a cool encounter with the summon in some ethereal way. Not being funny but if fort condor can pull me into some weird world, why can’t a summon entity. Make it make sense, it wouldn’t be difficult in this crazy world!
Dude, I'm rooting for rebirth to win goty as much as anyone else here... but it's still april.
    I know it when i see it brudda, stop the count
        Lol, low-key triggered when I see that phrase, stop the count.
        People said that about Zelda tears of the kingdom and then bg3 happened
            I was one of the people saying BG3 would win months before it even released and everyone was calling me crazy saying there was no chance since it was too niche and TOTK already had it on lock lol. TOTK was way too repetitive and derivative of BOTW for me to think it would win.
                I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
                    Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
        Sorry my money is on stellar blade.
        Yes, let's not see what other games have to offer, no, let's give the award for copying someone else's homework.

I'm sorry but originality should be a factor when considering games. Why should a remake be given credit when it's every existence is built off of something that worked prior and is selling BECAUSE of the name attached to it.

Seriously, if this game wasn't called FF7 would any of you actually give two hot cares after a month? No, not really. And prove to me otherwise if you can, you won't but you're welcome to try.
    Yeah I remember early on in 2023 everyone was debating if it would be FF16 or tears of the kingdom that would win GOTY. And it ended up being Baldurs gate 3 that swept
        The fact that you forgot about Starfield in there says a lot. It was supposed to be a three way brawl between TotK, FFXVI and Starfield, and then BG3 and Alan Wake 2 kicked out the latter two out of nowhere.
            Eh unlike others I never bought into Starfield hype. Even the release trailers felt dull to me, and then it actually released and was somehow worse than I was thinking it would be. But yeah 2023 was very dynamic for gaming
    Gotta see what wukong looks like first.
    Your right, better wait till Steller Blade comes out, that ass might take GOTY!, we'll see!.
The Game Awards is a joke, I still remember the robbery of 2020 (even Ghost of Tsushima deserved it more). Since then I only watched the show just to see new trailers, they lost every bit of reputation to my eyes.
I don't even think it's game of the month. I finished it and felt like it was the most bloated, boring game I've played in a decade 

I was thoroughly excited. I mastered the original as a teen and couldn't contain my excitement with Remake ... Then I played rebirth. Nostalgia aside, this game feels 10 years past due. 

I really feel like the reviews are bought, its all fake news, and the only people that like the game are the same people who like everything. 

Sales are in the toilet. SE is changing strategy, and it's clear that Rebirth will be seen as a disappointment.
    This opinion is so shit i just down voted and moved on
The remake shot up in sales on steam when rebirth came out so I believe it.
But, this game created in unreal engine, so there are high chances, again, that this will be on epic exclusive first, then steam. So players will have to wait longer and there are port issues as well.
It's a completely reasonable take, a tepid take even, the commenter even qualifies it with "so far" and then takes their expectations down for a future awards season. A hot take would be something like "this is the greatest RPG of the last decade" or something conversation worthy like that at least.
Does anyone really think Enix would have promoted Hamaguchi if this was disappointing to them?? Lmao people are stupid.
    A game can be a critical success but not necessarily a commercial success. Its widely recognised that this is a great game, and I'm certain that they are making money from it. But square was very quick to parade the sales of FF7 remake and FF16, so why the conspicuous silence here? But still, promoting your top talents is not a bad move from the company especially since Rebirth probably is making them a tidy profit overall, and that they seem to be committed to doing the 3rd part.
        Listen money and business are money and business. No one is being promoted to executive over cute reviews and good fan reception lol.
            The consumer view of the brand is extraordinarily important. When its clear you've created a quality product, the company can leverage that to make a lot more money down the line through various other means. Lets say this game didn't meet sales expectations hypothetically, the question is does it matter? Well it might not, the fans that did buy are very positive so it raises new income avenues later. My point is, I believe that they are profiting from Rebirth, I don't believe they are meeting forecasts however. But either way, they can still use the quality of this product to make a reasonable sum overall
                I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
    The promoted him over the critical reception which sits at 90+ on metacritic, the highest since FFX I think. They didn't expect that, they thought it will be similar to Remake's score. Hamaguchi exceeded their expectation. Sales is another matter, more often than not it doesn't reflect the quality of a game.
It probably didn't break the 3 million sales mark yet, I think that's when they talked about FF16?
Also a fair point, I know I avoided the series for a while for those exact reasons. I never played an FF game until Remake. Even then I've only played Remake, Rebirth, OG 7, 15, and 16. 

Either way, like I said I just want it to do really well because it's really special to me
"Casual" consumers don't care about literally any of that stuff lmfaooo. Casual consumers pick up whatever looks interesting - no search required. This sub alone was full of people being confused because they started with Rebirth - aka they never looked it up and got turned away.

Just saying stuff to say stuff is not good for an argument
Im a casual gamer and I know the difference.. it's not rocket science..
No if you're a real casual you would think new game cool imma play it. If you're a "reddit casual" you do a deep dive of an hour to know where to start and than complain it doesn't make sense. Lmao do you understand what casual means? Looking shit up online or  on Reddit posts does not make you a casual ffs.
    in that case casuals arent touching an 80 hour long JRPG lol. clearly i meant more so gamers who arent familiar with FF
Im not sure those are great sales. Tears of the kingdom sold 10 million in a weekend .

Sure the switch has a bigger install base still FF7 is one of the most important games of all time and this was a remake. It should have sold unprecedented numbers.

I like the game but I think the market is showing they didn’t like certain decisions square took
    Quick reminder that the Switch has roughly 130 Million Units sold,the PS5 50 Million. Considering that Rebirth is likely a smashing success,not to mention what happens once it hits PC's.
        Rebirth is a success but not a smashing one.  Its still selling less than dragons dogma 2 and helldivers which is a huge success
            both those games are available for pc day 1, which has an even bigger install base than the switch
                Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.  


Dragons dogma 2 I believe was third
    Zelda is bigger with casual audiences and is like the big budget swan song game of one of the most successful consoles of all time. I think reunion might eventually get to 10 million but it wont be in 2024 and probably not 2025.
    Final fantasy is just played out for people right now.  No one new wants to play the 16th game of a series or a remake of a 30 year old game
    JRPG audience is not even remotely close to LOZ's casual friendly open world sandbox audience. It's not a worthwhile comparison in the first place
Dragon Dogma 2 sold 77k copies in JPN in March and it was said, that it sold 2.5 Million copies Worldwide. 

So, FFVII Rebirth, which sold 310k copies (which is roughly 4 times more then DG 2) in JPN, must have sold around 10 Million Copies Worldwide. 

I believe my Logic is flawless and ultimately the truth. 

/s
I had a guy arguing with me about sales, telling me my numbers were wrong and thus I must be making it all up, and as proof, he linked me a fucking article that he obviously didn't read because it confirmed my numbers were correct almost exactly..

People are really, really stupid.
Your math is really shit. Your EU sales is literally just 4% more, which could literally mean 2k copies or 5k copies.
>Numbers mean nothing in a vacuum.

He wrote, while looking at all his Numbers he wrote in a Vacuum. 

Breaking News:

FFVII Rebirth Daily Active User Peak was 2.2 Million on Launch on a Console that has around 1/3 of the Units (38 Million) sold, as the PS4 in 2020 (110 Million) when FFVII Remake sold 3.5  Million in a Week.
    Those numbers line up exactly and precisely with what I said. You actually thought they supported your argument and not mine?
        Your Numbers don't line up with what you said at all and than you bring PSN profiles as a Source into this and compare Miles Morales with which released 3,5 years ago with a Game that released a Month ago. This is a site only counts people who registered there and not actual players? You know that, right? You're making a fool out of yourself, if you believe that Sites Numbers mean anything.

>Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

You really try to compare 5,5 years of FFXV which released on PS and XBox with 4 years FFVII which is a PS exclusive?

FFXV released 2016, it took 5,5 years to reach 10 Million Sales and it was Multiplatform from the beginning. It was released on PC 2 years later. 

FFVII released while a Worldwide Lockdown happened and 3.5 Units have been sold in just a week, went to PS5 a year and PC 6 months later and then it reached 7 Million Sales October 2023 (3,5 years later after launch). The PS4 had an install Basis of approximately 110 Million Consoles at the time of the FFVII Remake launch in 2020. FFVII Remake will probably reach 8 or more Million by 2025.  
  
FFVII Rebirth released just now as a PS5 exclusive and has a Install Basis of only 1/3 of the PS4 when Remake released. FFVII Rebirth sold more copies in Europe on day one than FFXVI in 10 days. All that on the PS5 which has an install Basis of only \~40 Million, while Remake has had an install Basis of 108 Million at Launch of Remake. 

Lifetime Sales will be great for both FFVII Rebirth and FFXVI because more People will buy PS5s and some of them will buy at least one of the Main Series FF Titles.
            Nothing of what you say is wrong (other than the poor wording and grammar of your post), but you're completely missing the point.

Square Enix doesn't make money based on how big the sales are relative to the install base or relative to expected sales in a pandemic or any other "relative to". They make money based on copies sold. When the copies sold are fewer, but they spent the same budget on the product, it does not matter one bit what the excuses are - they're losing money which is the bottom line. You need to stop seeing it as some kind of contest when it's not a contest, it's a business.

                    I did not move the goalposts. You just lack reading comprehension skills and the ability to understand numbers.

                            You're not winning any arguments by hiding behind meme images, manchild.
They probably know that it will sell more over time since many want to wait till the trilogy is over
    They hope that, for sure, and also that it will sell more on different platforms. Remake has been selling pretty well on Steam recently for example. It's by no means too late for these games to be a financial success in the end, but they're not there yet.
        But idk why they would make it a PS5 exclusive such a dumb decision for sales
Cool story bro
Because it didn't sell 8 million. It was 8 million who had the game. The game was on PS+ for a while and that's why it never got an official number like with Ghost of Tsushima who did sell 8 million. Sony have never been cagey when the sales are good. 

In this case I think it's more on Square than it is Sony. Why Square isn't releasing the numbers is anyones guess. They did do it for FF16, so hopefully we get one soon here.
    Square usually does, but not right away.

And yeah, Sony releases numbers when good. Days Gone was a flop by basically every sense of the word. It was a mediocre game by a dev only known for a really bad platformer 30 years ago. And the game felt like design by committee: post apocalyptic biker with a heart dealing with zombies. The reaction that triggers is the same reaction I had to seeing Kid G at the saucer for the first time - this is anachronistic and out of date.
        I bet you wouldn't mouth off straight to Kid G's face like that!
            I probably would. Not in a mocking way, but in a "*dude,* I'm taking you to J. Crew (they're back in, roughly around the time skinny jeans became anachronistic and out of date), like right now because you need *help*."

Mostly because if I said in a mocking way, I'd probably be paste on a wall somewhere.
        Square released FFXVI sales 6 days after launch..
Thank you for explaining. The example made the reasons behind it much clearer now!
I agree with you, nothing unreasonable about what you said. Anyone with eyes can see the engagement online isn't as big as it was in the Remake days. That coupled with unreleased sales numbers does make you worry. In the end who cares, the game is great, and as long as we get that part 3 thats all a fan really cares about
Dude they release XVI sales 6 days after release. Ya know, the game this sub loves to shit on..
    There's a lot of reasons companies do and do not release information and to just assume it's because of bad numbers is being a bit disingenuous.

For all we know Square Enix could have had massively unrealistic expectations with sales and the true number could actually be quite good but incredibly disappointing in lieu of their expectations, we don't know. Square Enix has had a long history of absurdly optimistic sales expectations.

It makes more sense to just wait until numbers do get released.

I also don't think it should go without saying that Square Enix is also likely aware of a segment of their fanbase that is vocal about not buying any ore installments until the entirety of FF7 is available.
Not English native, and i rushed that message, sorry
    No need to apologize. You applied gender to inanimate objects so it was very confusing at first but we got what you meant.
        Yea that happens, in many languages, there’s no pronouns. English is also my second language, we dont use pronouns on my first language, however we have nouns and adjectives that are gender based. Like for instance amerikano vs amerikana. And no spanish isnt my language lol
You didn't hear? Dragons Dogma came out as a He/Blu Ray Disc/ephemeral download.
Oh it absolutely didn't outsell Remake and 3M is stellar for most games but not for this game in particular, and I agree that's probably why they didn't post the results because the point of doing that is marketing, but not reaching a great milestone for this game won't work. In FFXVI's case it actually backfired and people (and journalists, which is worse) said it was a flop, so they learned their lesson.


Yeah, I've had discussions with people that said it didn't reach 1M, which is preposterous, though I think they have some kind of agenda, like hating the Remake project or wanting to criticize the exclusivity deal.
    This whole discussion is ridiculous to me. Square Enix have had orlutrageously optimistic/unrealistic sales expectations for nearly every game they have released in a decade. We have no idea what they expected FF7 Rebirth to do internally. If they expected upwards of 7-10 million copies, even 5 million would be embarrassing to them. All we know is that it's likely it didn't reach what they expected but that could be poor sales or just unattainable expectations.
They're listed separately in the charts, but that doesn't mean official numbers would recognize them separately, is what I'm saying.

I was mostly basing it on what [Chris Dring said,](https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1766153927727227344) where he combined Twin Pack + Rebirth sales and pointed out that Rebirth sold +6% over XVI at launch in the UK.
LOUDER PLZ
Probably the first week sales.
    Perhaps! But it’s been over a month since that number. So I think this is more evidence to support my point. Thank you for sharing.
        Sales dropped hard after the first week. You're acting like it's going to make more money than after release. That's not how game sales work.
Yeah. It cannot be understated the importance of being locked to PS5 vs PC for half the price makes a world of difference. I know of several people who borrowed their friends' consoles and copies which doesn't drive up sales. They're playing it- but why spend half of your monthly check on 1 game if you don't own a console with 0 exclusives.

Or- 1 exclusive and everything else coming multiplat later
    Another really good point.

I know that the team has been pretty adamant that the game they made wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t an exclusive, but I think we’ll see less games like Rebirth going forward in order to boost multiple platform sales.
        I think you're underestimating how much money Sony would pay Square for that exclusivity.  That type of revenue is far more important than sales to a company because it represents ZERO overhead.  They just need to delay releasing it on other platforms (which will launch as a game of the year pack or something sparking even more sales and coverage).
            The help Sony provides is a short term financial solution for square. The money they get from Sony also does not offset a potential increase of 300k+ more sales on other platforms.

Releasing later doesn’t guarantee an equivalent number of sales, only delayed. People move on/lose interest. 

The biggest benefit Square has working with Sony is development support, and that hardware capability. Both Creative Buis. Unit 1 and 3 have been fairly public about that. Rebirth would not exist the way it does had it been developed for multiple platforms.

The issue square is having, that is increasing year over year, is brand recognition. The FF brand needs better reach than it does now for a long term solve. (Among other things it needs) This isn’t my conjecture. Yoshi P spoke adamantly about the problems with the FF brand and the aging fan base.

In short: this deal benefits Sony more than Square.

I’m fairly educated on this. I work in the entertainment industry as a director.
                All good points.  I work in finance though, in a senior-level corporate setting, so I know how boards think, how budgets are managed and how the immediate and likely high eight- or NINE-FIGURE sum that Sony paid for FF exclusivity -- with **no cost** for overhead, human resource, real estate, R&D, utilities, insurance, tax etc. -- is a lot more attractive than the *potential* sales they could rake in and all the risk and huge costs involved with going multi-platform.

As I said, I think you're not quite realizing that that money is risk-free, guaranteed and immediate.  Put it this way:

1. $100 right in my pocket making interest for exclusivity + $100 in sales - $70 in costs

Or

2) $0 in my pocket not making interest + $200 (and this number is super variable/risky) in sales - $150 in costs (this number is based on your comment that the fact that they are single-platform makes it easier to develop).

100% of the time a corporation with any hint of risk management or even just an accounting department will choose #1.  And they're right to.
                    No, I definitely do realize it’s risk free and immediate. I said it’s a short term financial solution. 

What I’m saying is that the strategy is how square has been operating for some time now, and they’ve openly acknowledged the problem with the brand recently. 

These short term solutions don’t keep the brand alive, that they need to remain a studio of their size. It won’t matter how much money Sony gives them if the brand looses viability. And at a certain point Sony won’t see the value in dumping money into the exclusivity of a franchise that’s sales diminish year over year. 

Square has already acknowledged the poor sales, and is trying to solve the problem. They’ve even cited slow adoption of the PS5 as a contributing factor. They’ve also seen stock prices decline as a result of these marquee titles  not selling the larger numbers that other recent titles have.

A studio is only as valuable as the brands that it sells.

The question isn’t will they pull the plug on the deal, but who does it first.

EDIT: Looking at it financially, what’s the smarter option long term, assuming you’re capable of both…

Graduate high school and take a low skill, decent pay job at a factory, making 20-30 an hour?

Or going to med school, taking on the debt, and getting a job as a cardiologist or an equivalent profession?

Which person is more likely to be financially well off at 65?

You chose a pretty smart field (smarter than me TBH, lol), so I think you know the answer.
                        I didn't say that what the Boards (or Square) does is the best for long-term success. Having worked with people in very very high up positions, they are no smarter than any one else (the moment you realize that the chairman of the board of your company is just as much as a dumb-dumb as you are is a beautiful moment). What I am saying is that from an decision-makers will always go for money first and forego future profits to ensure that you are less exposed to risk.

There is also an argument that that IS the right move.  Taking a lump sum and investing it is 100% better than being paid out the lump sum over the course of 50 years.  In the first situation, you are making the interest, in the second THEY are making the interest.

So, to answer your question at the bottom. I actually think that the smarter move for most people is to take the low-skilled, well paying job and invest your excess money.  I know complete morons who earned their MBAs (fun fact, you can't 'fail' and MBA, so next time someone tries to wave it in your face, scoff and think to yourself 'you could be a moron who just so happened to have access to $120K in debt) and I'll tell you this: The moron who spent $120K on an MBA in their 30s will NOT be more financially well off at 65 than any person who brought in a steady income from the age of 18 (assuming they're not buying time shares in Florida, or renting sports cars).

That being said, the impressive person who gets an MBA in their 30s likely has a plan and will be better off than the moron with the MBA, or anyone who's worked since their 18 (but that person who's worked since their 18 will still be in a pretty good spot, honestly).

And here is where we converge: The 'impressive person' I talk about up there?  That's the brand.  If the brand is impressive, then the company will succeed.  If the brand is the moron who paid for an MBA, the company won't succeed. If the brand is the basic person who worked from 18 with OK pay, then you'll get, I suppose, the equivalent of a company that sells necessary staples (like flour, or soap); they bring in money, no one is dying of hunger, but their dead on the inside. I honestly think we're more in sync than this long exchange would have you believe.

Despite what I'll tell you at the end, I do not know enough about Square's statements to have a say in this.  If they're worried about the decline of their brand I think that's fair.  FF has never mattered more than it did with 7 and that was almost 30 years ago.  But sales? I think they need to take adjust expectations. 

And though I work in finance, I'm actually a journalist. I just sold out and went corporate. So believe me, I chose a pretty terrible field honestly.  But I learn a lot more about a wider range things and get to talk to more incredible people (and not so incredible) than most humans do, so it's kinda cool.

Cheers!

PS: The best case, I can think of is Sony buys Square and Capcom.  If Microsoft can dodge regulators and buy Bethesada and Activision Blizzard, then Sony should do the same.
                            I get that. What I’m saying is what they have done, vs what they will do. 

So when I responded to what you said, that I’m underestimating the money they get with Sony exclusivity deals, it’s that I don’t think I am because Square I aware of the sales problem and does see it as a red flag, going as far as citing the platform as a part of that issue.

My suggestion is that it seems like their strategy will change as a result. Your original response seemed to suggest that it won’t. We don’t disagree on the points that each strategy has. We divert on what they Will be likely to do going forward.

So when I say they are likley to shift that strategy, it’s based off of their quarterly reports, as well as the evidence that square themselves has cited.

Side note. I don’t think you sold out, you made a smart call. Journalism ain’t easy friend. I can’t claim to be an expert in it, but I have to imagine our disciplines are similar in stability, and while I’ve managed to be lucky, I see how many people better than me haven’t been. You’re smart for having that back up.

Regarding the P.S. I think I agree.
That's fair enough, I want it to do well too, but it seems like this is more of a FF16 vs FF7Re feud. I loved both games, albeit for entirely different reasons, but I think both are amazing games.

Personally, I don't think Rebirth should be the template, the same way I don't think 16 should be the template. I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, so I probably wouldn't care if they made FF17 into a third person shooter, tbh.

I also don't really want any other FF remakes, and I'd rather they'd focus on moving the series forward. I think 9 is great the way it is, and I personally didn't like 6, so I don't care much for it being remade.

I guess my confusion comes from the fact that every single conversation on this topic, over the past few weeks, had a strong focus on the numbers, and not much else. It was either "lmao this game flopped" or some random speculation about the actual sales figure, accompanied by paranoid theories like "the game sold poorly, that's why they're hiding the sales figure from us". It didn't really feel like people were concerned about, solely because of their love for the series.
    > I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, 

That's fair, but I do want to clarify what I meant by "template". I don't necessarily mean specific gameplay or combat systems.

I mean stuff like having a party with multiple playable characters, having some element of strategy even if the combat is action based, having beautiful and interesting towns that feel lively and full of activities, having fun side content like minigames and optional exploration, level / dungeon design that isn't just hallways, worthwhile loot and rewards to find, interesting gear and itemization systems, proper RPG elements, etc...

Those elements to me are essential to a Final Fantasy game, and Rebirth had all of them (and nailed all of them), while FF16 had literally none of them. Only one character, zero strategy, boring and empty towns with zero activities (the beautiful cities like Oriflamme aren't even explorable, we only get to visit bland places like Northreach and Martha's Rest), very minimal side content and what is there is mostly not good, almost no RPG systems or any kind of interesting gear or itemization, very linear hallway dungeons, etc...

To be clear, I didn't hate 16. I loved its characters, its art direction, its atmosphere, and its music. I thought the voice acting and English localization were very good. The lore was solid and pretty interesting. I enjoyed the darker, grittier tone of the game. And of course the game offers a lot of spectacle.

But the combat was too easy and too shallow, the world was bland and devoid of content despite being beautiful, and exploration was completely worthless. Those elements make it a big disappointment for me. I am okay with innovation and change, but some fundamentals need to be kept, and I think 16 is just too streamlined to actually scratch my FF itch. It needed more substance and more meat on its bones imo.
And I addressed your comments about twin pack. I don't think it changes the sales figure that much for japan.

And in Japan Physical Sales outsell Digital by a lot. And of course I'm reading Physical Sales, that's what the new Famitsu Report is all about and it's the only numerical sales value we do have.

And this "UK" Report Tweet is a mess, I have read it many many times before, and read the links it cites.

Edit: Also "FF16 sold in 10 days what FF7 Rebirth sold in 1" has no reference,  as someone else in this TWEET you're linking pointed out: [https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525](https://twitter.com/FfMeryll/status/1770804494449676525)

Again, we're free to interpret and speculate about these data as much as we want, but unless Square releases official statements, it's all speculations.

So let's just accept that neither you nor me have facts, and that nobody has to "please look carefully because I'm the authority here", cool? :)
They are. You guys are just plugging your ears and ignoring the facts.
Yes.

What part of my breakdown of it you disagree?
Not a chance. 

Helldivers is fun but it's nowhere NEAR the experience rebirth is.

What you're saying is *literally* false lmao hot take of the century
    We shall see :) I look forward to who gets to say "I told you so" at the end of the year.
    You can't call an opinion false..
Square Enix desperately wants Final Fantasy to be a mainstream AAA gigahit, which it used to be, and spends that level of budget on it. It's not a sustainable franchise with current sales vs budget. It doesn't matter how it performs versus YOUR expectations when the facts are that it's underperforming compared to how it has to perform in order to be successful, and Square Enix stocks are flagging.
    It really never used to be an AAA gigahit on the more modern age. And you guys playing investors without the necessary data is extremely laughable, so thanks for that
Square Enix earnings report to their investors.
    Check again. I think you’ll find the truth is different than what you’re saying.
Square Enix themselves literally said it was a bit below their projections, but they have an 18-month plan to make up those sales.
    Receipts, please. https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1704139141192003834
over three-quarters of the global console gaming market share is in the US, UK, and France alone, where digital is king, so they're not wrong
Like someone else stated. Japan doesn’t reflect the rest of the world. It’s a tiny market compared to most others and In most others, digital dominates.
Would be interesting to see how ps5 sales increased due to Rebirth.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/5j5RhCc9Ml
    Ok, but this is Sony studios, right, which is only one studio among many? The overall trend in the market as per May Priscilla is an entirely different stat.
        Multiple studios but yes Sony first party games. But I would be very very surprised if Square Enix had a bigger % digital sales than ps studios.
Its gonna be so bad but so good
Is there any DLC planned for Rebirth? A Vincent DLC not unlike the Yuffie DPC could do the same.
    I believe they have confirmed there will not be any DLC between part 2 and 3
        Dirge of Cerberus remaster it is then ha.
Yh I worry about this. Rebirth was great but as with every recent square rpg since the 00’s, there are massive issues with it. Issues that can be overlooked because the overall package is fantastic, but the open world tower design and repetitive icon hunting really became a drag by the time you get to gongaga/cosmo. I bloody loved the game, my GOTY for sure, nothing will come close. But I felt the same with 16. It was brilliant for different reasons but I had a bit of a sour taste in my mouth for everything it got so wrong. Rebirth is better than 16 imo but man they need to sort the repetition.

And as to your original point, it being a part 3 has me worried a lesser investment will lead to even more copy and paste side activity design. And we all know from game to game these publishers just HAVE to make it bigger. Way bigger. Can’t wait for all the “the overall map size is 2-3 times the size of rebirth”. That would be absolutely fine, but ONLY if that map is well designed with a frankly staggering amount of worthwhile content. Not time wasting. 

It’s very clear to me that things like the mako springs and divine intel were shoehorned in as filler. Would’ve been so much better if the divine intel was scrapped entirely and you just come across a small cave/dungeon that leads to a cool encounter with the summon in some ethereal way. Not being funny but if fort condor can pull me into some weird world, why can’t a summon entity. Make it make sense, it wouldn’t be difficult in this crazy world!
I know it when i see it brudda, stop the count
    Lol, low-key triggered when I see that phrase, stop the count.
    People said that about Zelda tears of the kingdom and then bg3 happened
        I was one of the people saying BG3 would win months before it even released and everyone was calling me crazy saying there was no chance since it was too niche and TOTK already had it on lock lol. TOTK was way too repetitive and derivative of BOTW for me to think it would win.
            I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
                Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
    Sorry my money is on stellar blade.
    Yes, let's not see what other games have to offer, no, let's give the award for copying someone else's homework.

I'm sorry but originality should be a factor when considering games. Why should a remake be given credit when it's every existence is built off of something that worked prior and is selling BECAUSE of the name attached to it.

Seriously, if this game wasn't called FF7 would any of you actually give two hot cares after a month? No, not really. And prove to me otherwise if you can, you won't but you're welcome to try.
Yeah I remember early on in 2023 everyone was debating if it would be FF16 or tears of the kingdom that would win GOTY. And it ended up being Baldurs gate 3 that swept
    The fact that you forgot about Starfield in there says a lot. It was supposed to be a three way brawl between TotK, FFXVI and Starfield, and then BG3 and Alan Wake 2 kicked out the latter two out of nowhere.
        Eh unlike others I never bought into Starfield hype. Even the release trailers felt dull to me, and then it actually released and was somehow worse than I was thinking it would be. But yeah 2023 was very dynamic for gaming
Gotta see what wukong looks like first.
Your right, better wait till Steller Blade comes out, that ass might take GOTY!, we'll see!.
This opinion is so shit i just down voted and moved on
A game can be a critical success but not necessarily a commercial success. Its widely recognised that this is a great game, and I'm certain that they are making money from it. But square was very quick to parade the sales of FF7 remake and FF16, so why the conspicuous silence here? But still, promoting your top talents is not a bad move from the company especially since Rebirth probably is making them a tidy profit overall, and that they seem to be committed to doing the 3rd part.
    Listen money and business are money and business. No one is being promoted to executive over cute reviews and good fan reception lol.
        The consumer view of the brand is extraordinarily important. When its clear you've created a quality product, the company can leverage that to make a lot more money down the line through various other means. Lets say this game didn't meet sales expectations hypothetically, the question is does it matter? Well it might not, the fans that did buy are very positive so it raises new income avenues later. My point is, I believe that they are profiting from Rebirth, I don't believe they are meeting forecasts however. But either way, they can still use the quality of this product to make a reasonable sum overall
            I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
The promoted him over the critical reception which sits at 90+ on metacritic, the highest since FFX I think. They didn't expect that, they thought it will be similar to Remake's score. Hamaguchi exceeded their expectation. Sales is another matter, more often than not it doesn't reflect the quality of a game.
in that case casuals arent touching an 80 hour long JRPG lol. clearly i meant more so gamers who arent familiar with FF
Quick reminder that the Switch has roughly 130 Million Units sold,the PS5 50 Million. Considering that Rebirth is likely a smashing success,not to mention what happens once it hits PC's.
    Rebirth is a success but not a smashing one.  Its still selling less than dragons dogma 2 and helldivers which is a huge success
        both those games are available for pc day 1, which has an even bigger install base than the switch
            Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.  


Dragons dogma 2 I believe was third
Zelda is bigger with casual audiences and is like the big budget swan song game of one of the most successful consoles of all time. I think reunion might eventually get to 10 million but it wont be in 2024 and probably not 2025.
Final fantasy is just played out for people right now.  No one new wants to play the 16th game of a series or a remake of a 30 year old game
JRPG audience is not even remotely close to LOZ's casual friendly open world sandbox audience. It's not a worthwhile comparison in the first place
Those numbers line up exactly and precisely with what I said. You actually thought they supported your argument and not mine?
    Your Numbers don't line up with what you said at all and than you bring PSN profiles as a Source into this and compare Miles Morales with which released 3,5 years ago with a Game that released a Month ago. This is a site only counts people who registered there and not actual players? You know that, right? You're making a fool out of yourself, if you believe that Sites Numbers mean anything.

>Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

You really try to compare 5,5 years of FFXV which released on PS and XBox with 4 years FFVII which is a PS exclusive?

FFXV released 2016, it took 5,5 years to reach 10 Million Sales and it was Multiplatform from the beginning. It was released on PC 2 years later. 

FFVII released while a Worldwide Lockdown happened and 3.5 Units have been sold in just a week, went to PS5 a year and PC 6 months later and then it reached 7 Million Sales October 2023 (3,5 years later after launch). The PS4 had an install Basis of approximately 110 Million Consoles at the time of the FFVII Remake launch in 2020. FFVII Remake will probably reach 8 or more Million by 2025.  
  
FFVII Rebirth released just now as a PS5 exclusive and has a Install Basis of only 1/3 of the PS4 when Remake released. FFVII Rebirth sold more copies in Europe on day one than FFXVI in 10 days. All that on the PS5 which has an install Basis of only \~40 Million, while Remake has had an install Basis of 108 Million at Launch of Remake. 

Lifetime Sales will be great for both FFVII Rebirth and FFXVI because more People will buy PS5s and some of them will buy at least one of the Main Series FF Titles.
        Nothing of what you say is wrong (other than the poor wording and grammar of your post), but you're completely missing the point.

Square Enix doesn't make money based on how big the sales are relative to the install base or relative to expected sales in a pandemic or any other "relative to". They make money based on copies sold. When the copies sold are fewer, but they spent the same budget on the product, it does not matter one bit what the excuses are - they're losing money which is the bottom line. You need to stop seeing it as some kind of contest when it's not a contest, it's a business.
            ![gif](giphy|pfHBWCCOySoRq|downsized)
                I did not move the goalposts. You just lack reading comprehension skills and the ability to understand numbers.
                    ![gif](giphy|xUA7bazBa69nSu6lPy)
                        You're not winning any arguments by hiding behind meme images, manchild.
They hope that, for sure, and also that it will sell more on different platforms. Remake has been selling pretty well on Steam recently for example. It's by no means too late for these games to be a financial success in the end, but they're not there yet.
    But idk why they would make it a PS5 exclusive such a dumb decision for sales
Square usually does, but not right away.

And yeah, Sony releases numbers when good. Days Gone was a flop by basically every sense of the word. It was a mediocre game by a dev only known for a really bad platformer 30 years ago. And the game felt like design by committee: post apocalyptic biker with a heart dealing with zombies. The reaction that triggers is the same reaction I had to seeing Kid G at the saucer for the first time - this is anachronistic and out of date.
    I bet you wouldn't mouth off straight to Kid G's face like that!
        I probably would. Not in a mocking way, but in a "*dude,* I'm taking you to J. Crew (they're back in, roughly around the time skinny jeans became anachronistic and out of date), like right now because you need *help*."

Mostly because if I said in a mocking way, I'd probably be paste on a wall somewhere.
    Square released FFXVI sales 6 days after launch..
There's a lot of reasons companies do and do not release information and to just assume it's because of bad numbers is being a bit disingenuous.

For all we know Square Enix could have had massively unrealistic expectations with sales and the true number could actually be quite good but incredibly disappointing in lieu of their expectations, we don't know. Square Enix has had a long history of absurdly optimistic sales expectations.

It makes more sense to just wait until numbers do get released.

I also don't think it should go without saying that Square Enix is also likely aware of a segment of their fanbase that is vocal about not buying any ore installments until the entirety of FF7 is available.
No need to apologize. You applied gender to inanimate objects so it was very confusing at first but we got what you meant.
    Yea that happens, in many languages, there’s no pronouns. English is also my second language, we dont use pronouns on my first language, however we have nouns and adjectives that are gender based. Like for instance amerikano vs amerikana. And no spanish isnt my language lol
This whole discussion is ridiculous to me. Square Enix have had orlutrageously optimistic/unrealistic sales expectations for nearly every game they have released in a decade. We have no idea what they expected FF7 Rebirth to do internally. If they expected upwards of 7-10 million copies, even 5 million would be embarrassing to them. All we know is that it's likely it didn't reach what they expected but that could be poor sales or just unattainable expectations.
Perhaps! But it’s been over a month since that number. So I think this is more evidence to support my point. Thank you for sharing.
    Sales dropped hard after the first week. You're acting like it's going to make more money than after release. That's not how game sales work.
Another really good point.

I know that the team has been pretty adamant that the game they made wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t an exclusive, but I think we’ll see less games like Rebirth going forward in order to boost multiple platform sales.
    I think you're underestimating how much money Sony would pay Square for that exclusivity.  That type of revenue is far more important than sales to a company because it represents ZERO overhead.  They just need to delay releasing it on other platforms (which will launch as a game of the year pack or something sparking even more sales and coverage).
        The help Sony provides is a short term financial solution for square. The money they get from Sony also does not offset a potential increase of 300k+ more sales on other platforms.

Releasing later doesn’t guarantee an equivalent number of sales, only delayed. People move on/lose interest. 

The biggest benefit Square has working with Sony is development support, and that hardware capability. Both Creative Buis. Unit 1 and 3 have been fairly public about that. Rebirth would not exist the way it does had it been developed for multiple platforms.

The issue square is having, that is increasing year over year, is brand recognition. The FF brand needs better reach than it does now for a long term solve. (Among other things it needs) This isn’t my conjecture. Yoshi P spoke adamantly about the problems with the FF brand and the aging fan base.

In short: this deal benefits Sony more than Square.

I’m fairly educated on this. I work in the entertainment industry as a director.
            All good points.  I work in finance though, in a senior-level corporate setting, so I know how boards think, how budgets are managed and how the immediate and likely high eight- or NINE-FIGURE sum that Sony paid for FF exclusivity -- with **no cost** for overhead, human resource, real estate, R&D, utilities, insurance, tax etc. -- is a lot more attractive than the *potential* sales they could rake in and all the risk and huge costs involved with going multi-platform.

As I said, I think you're not quite realizing that that money is risk-free, guaranteed and immediate.  Put it this way:

1. $100 right in my pocket making interest for exclusivity + $100 in sales - $70 in costs

Or

2) $0 in my pocket not making interest + $200 (and this number is super variable/risky) in sales - $150 in costs (this number is based on your comment that the fact that they are single-platform makes it easier to develop).

100% of the time a corporation with any hint of risk management or even just an accounting department will choose #1.  And they're right to.
                No, I definitely do realize it’s risk free and immediate. I said it’s a short term financial solution. 

What I’m saying is that the strategy is how square has been operating for some time now, and they’ve openly acknowledged the problem with the brand recently. 

These short term solutions don’t keep the brand alive, that they need to remain a studio of their size. It won’t matter how much money Sony gives them if the brand looses viability. And at a certain point Sony won’t see the value in dumping money into the exclusivity of a franchise that’s sales diminish year over year. 

Square has already acknowledged the poor sales, and is trying to solve the problem. They’ve even cited slow adoption of the PS5 as a contributing factor. They’ve also seen stock prices decline as a result of these marquee titles  not selling the larger numbers that other recent titles have.

A studio is only as valuable as the brands that it sells.

The question isn’t will they pull the plug on the deal, but who does it first.

EDIT: Looking at it financially, what’s the smarter option long term, assuming you’re capable of both…

Graduate high school and take a low skill, decent pay job at a factory, making 20-30 an hour?

Or going to med school, taking on the debt, and getting a job as a cardiologist or an equivalent profession?

Which person is more likely to be financially well off at 65?

You chose a pretty smart field (smarter than me TBH, lol), so I think you know the answer.
                    I didn't say that what the Boards (or Square) does is the best for long-term success. Having worked with people in very very high up positions, they are no smarter than any one else (the moment you realize that the chairman of the board of your company is just as much as a dumb-dumb as you are is a beautiful moment). What I am saying is that from an decision-makers will always go for money first and forego future profits to ensure that you are less exposed to risk.

There is also an argument that that IS the right move.  Taking a lump sum and investing it is 100% better than being paid out the lump sum over the course of 50 years.  In the first situation, you are making the interest, in the second THEY are making the interest.

So, to answer your question at the bottom. I actually think that the smarter move for most people is to take the low-skilled, well paying job and invest your excess money.  I know complete morons who earned their MBAs (fun fact, you can't 'fail' and MBA, so next time someone tries to wave it in your face, scoff and think to yourself 'you could be a moron who just so happened to have access to $120K in debt) and I'll tell you this: The moron who spent $120K on an MBA in their 30s will NOT be more financially well off at 65 than any person who brought in a steady income from the age of 18 (assuming they're not buying time shares in Florida, or renting sports cars).

That being said, the impressive person who gets an MBA in their 30s likely has a plan and will be better off than the moron with the MBA, or anyone who's worked since their 18 (but that person who's worked since their 18 will still be in a pretty good spot, honestly).

And here is where we converge: The 'impressive person' I talk about up there?  That's the brand.  If the brand is impressive, then the company will succeed.  If the brand is the moron who paid for an MBA, the company won't succeed. If the brand is the basic person who worked from 18 with OK pay, then you'll get, I suppose, the equivalent of a company that sells necessary staples (like flour, or soap); they bring in money, no one is dying of hunger, but their dead on the inside. I honestly think we're more in sync than this long exchange would have you believe.

Despite what I'll tell you at the end, I do not know enough about Square's statements to have a say in this.  If they're worried about the decline of their brand I think that's fair.  FF has never mattered more than it did with 7 and that was almost 30 years ago.  But sales? I think they need to take adjust expectations. 

And though I work in finance, I'm actually a journalist. I just sold out and went corporate. So believe me, I chose a pretty terrible field honestly.  But I learn a lot more about a wider range things and get to talk to more incredible people (and not so incredible) than most humans do, so it's kinda cool.

Cheers!

PS: The best case, I can think of is Sony buys Square and Capcom.  If Microsoft can dodge regulators and buy Bethesada and Activision Blizzard, then Sony should do the same.
                        I get that. What I’m saying is what they have done, vs what they will do. 

So when I responded to what you said, that I’m underestimating the money they get with Sony exclusivity deals, it’s that I don’t think I am because Square I aware of the sales problem and does see it as a red flag, going as far as citing the platform as a part of that issue.

My suggestion is that it seems like their strategy will change as a result. Your original response seemed to suggest that it won’t. We don’t disagree on the points that each strategy has. We divert on what they Will be likely to do going forward.

So when I say they are likley to shift that strategy, it’s based off of their quarterly reports, as well as the evidence that square themselves has cited.

-

Side note. I don’t think you sold out, you made a smart call. Journalism ain’t easy friend. I can’t claim to be an expert in it, but I have to imagine our disciplines are similar in stability, and while I’ve managed to be lucky, I see how many people better than me haven’t been. You’re smart for having that back up.

Regarding the P.S. I think I agree.
> I like the fact that every FF game is different, and has a unique combat system, 

That's fair, but I do want to clarify what I meant by "template". I don't necessarily mean specific gameplay or combat systems.

I mean stuff like having a party with multiple playable characters, having some element of strategy even if the combat is action based, having beautiful and interesting towns that feel lively and full of activities, having fun side content like minigames and optional exploration, level / dungeon design that isn't just hallways, worthwhile loot and rewards to find, interesting gear and itemization systems, proper RPG elements, etc...

Those elements to me are essential to a Final Fantasy game, and Rebirth had all of them (and nailed all of them), while FF16 had literally none of them. Only one character, zero strategy, boring and empty towns with zero activities (the beautiful cities like Oriflamme aren't even explorable, we only get to visit bland places like Northreach and Martha's Rest), very minimal side content and what is there is mostly not good, almost no RPG systems or any kind of interesting gear or itemization, very linear hallway dungeons, etc...

To be clear, I didn't hate 16. I loved its characters, its art direction, its atmosphere, and its music. I thought the voice acting and English localization were very good. The lore was solid and pretty interesting. I enjoyed the darker, grittier tone of the game. And of course the game offers a lot of spectacle.

But the combat was too easy and too shallow, the world was bland and devoid of content despite being beautiful, and exploration was completely worthless. Those elements make it a big disappointment for me. I am okay with innovation and change, but some fundamentals need to be kept, and I think 16 is just too streamlined to actually scratch my FF itch. It needed more substance and more meat on its bones imo.
We shall see :) I look forward to who gets to say "I told you so" at the end of the year.
You can't call an opinion false..
It really never used to be an AAA gigahit on the more modern age. And you guys playing investors without the necessary data is extremely laughable, so thanks for that
Check again. I think you’ll find the truth is different than what you’re saying.
Receipts, please. https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1704139141192003834
Ok, but this is Sony studios, right, which is only one studio among many? The overall trend in the market as per May Priscilla is an entirely different stat.
    Multiple studios but yes Sony first party games. But I would be very very surprised if Square Enix had a bigger % digital sales than ps studios.
I believe they have confirmed there will not be any DLC between part 2 and 3
    Dirge of Cerberus remaster it is then ha.
Lol, low-key triggered when I see that phrase, stop the count.
People said that about Zelda tears of the kingdom and then bg3 happened
    I was one of the people saying BG3 would win months before it even released and everyone was calling me crazy saying there was no chance since it was too niche and TOTK already had it on lock lol. TOTK was way too repetitive and derivative of BOTW for me to think it would win.
        I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
            Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
Sorry my money is on stellar blade.
Yes, let's not see what other games have to offer, no, let's give the award for copying someone else's homework.

I'm sorry but originality should be a factor when considering games. Why should a remake be given credit when it's every existence is built off of something that worked prior and is selling BECAUSE of the name attached to it.

Seriously, if this game wasn't called FF7 would any of you actually give two hot cares after a month? No, not really. And prove to me otherwise if you can, you won't but you're welcome to try.
The fact that you forgot about Starfield in there says a lot. It was supposed to be a three way brawl between TotK, FFXVI and Starfield, and then BG3 and Alan Wake 2 kicked out the latter two out of nowhere.
    Eh unlike others I never bought into Starfield hype. Even the release trailers felt dull to me, and then it actually released and was somehow worse than I was thinking it would be. But yeah 2023 was very dynamic for gaming
Listen money and business are money and business. No one is being promoted to executive over cute reviews and good fan reception lol.
    The consumer view of the brand is extraordinarily important. When its clear you've created a quality product, the company can leverage that to make a lot more money down the line through various other means. Lets say this game didn't meet sales expectations hypothetically, the question is does it matter? Well it might not, the fans that did buy are very positive so it raises new income avenues later. My point is, I believe that they are profiting from Rebirth, I don't believe they are meeting forecasts however. But either way, they can still use the quality of this product to make a reasonable sum overall
        I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
Rebirth is a success but not a smashing one.  Its still selling less than dragons dogma 2 and helldivers which is a huge success
    both those games are available for pc day 1, which has an even bigger install base than the switch
        Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.  


Dragons dogma 2 I believe was third
Your Numbers don't line up with what you said at all and than you bring PSN profiles as a Source into this and compare Miles Morales with which released 3,5 years ago with a Game that released a Month ago. This is a site only counts people who registered there and not actual players? You know that, right? You're making a fool out of yourself, if you believe that Sites Numbers mean anything.

>Square Enix wants their tentpole games to sell 10 million, something FFXV actually managed to pull off despite being a mess of a game, but Remake has only sold 7 million after several years.

You really try to compare 5,5 years of FFXV which released on PS and XBox with 4 years FFVII which is a PS exclusive?

FFXV released 2016, it took 5,5 years to reach 10 Million Sales and it was Multiplatform from the beginning. It was released on PC 2 years later. 

FFVII released while a Worldwide Lockdown happened and 3.5 Units have been sold in just a week, went to PS5 a year and PC 6 months later and then it reached 7 Million Sales October 2023 (3,5 years later after launch). The PS4 had an install Basis of approximately 110 Million Consoles at the time of the FFVII Remake launch in 2020. FFVII Remake will probably reach 8 or more Million by 2025.  
  
FFVII Rebirth released just now as a PS5 exclusive and has a Install Basis of only 1/3 of the PS4 when Remake released. FFVII Rebirth sold more copies in Europe on day one than FFXVI in 10 days. All that on the PS5 which has an install Basis of only \~40 Million, while Remake has had an install Basis of 108 Million at Launch of Remake. 

Lifetime Sales will be great for both FFVII Rebirth and FFXVI because more People will buy PS5s and some of them will buy at least one of the Main Series FF Titles.
    Nothing of what you say is wrong (other than the poor wording and grammar of your post), but you're completely missing the point.

Square Enix doesn't make money based on how big the sales are relative to the install base or relative to expected sales in a pandemic or any other "relative to". They make money based on copies sold. When the copies sold are fewer, but they spent the same budget on the product, it does not matter one bit what the excuses are - they're losing money which is the bottom line. You need to stop seeing it as some kind of contest when it's not a contest, it's a business.
        ![gif](giphy|pfHBWCCOySoRq|downsized)
            I did not move the goalposts. You just lack reading comprehension skills and the ability to understand numbers.
                ![gif](giphy|xUA7bazBa69nSu6lPy)
                    You're not winning any arguments by hiding behind meme images, manchild.
But idk why they would make it a PS5 exclusive such a dumb decision for sales
I bet you wouldn't mouth off straight to Kid G's face like that!
    I probably would. Not in a mocking way, but in a "*dude,* I'm taking you to J. Crew (they're back in, roughly around the time skinny jeans became anachronistic and out of date), like right now because you need *help*."

Mostly because if I said in a mocking way, I'd probably be paste on a wall somewhere.
Square released FFXVI sales 6 days after launch..
Yea that happens, in many languages, there’s no pronouns. English is also my second language, we dont use pronouns on my first language, however we have nouns and adjectives that are gender based. Like for instance amerikano vs amerikana. And no spanish isnt my language lol
Sales dropped hard after the first week. You're acting like it's going to make more money than after release. That's not how game sales work.
I think you're underestimating how much money Sony would pay Square for that exclusivity.  That type of revenue is far more important than sales to a company because it represents ZERO overhead.  They just need to delay releasing it on other platforms (which will launch as a game of the year pack or something sparking even more sales and coverage).

A studio is only as valuable as the brands that it sells.

The question isn’t will they pull the plug on the deal, but who does it first.

EDIT: Looking at it financially, what’s the smarter option long term, assuming you’re capable of both…

Graduate high school and take a low skill, decent pay job at a factory, making 20-30 an hour?

Or going to med school, taking on the debt, and getting a job as a cardiologist or an equivalent profession?

Which person is more likely to be financially well off at 65?

You chose a pretty smart field (smarter than me TBH, lol), so I think you know the answer.
            I didn't say that what the Boards (or Square) does is the best for long-term success. Having worked with people in very very high up positions, they are no smarter than any one else (the moment you realize that the chairman of the board of your company is just as much as a dumb-dumb as you are is a beautiful moment). What I am saying is that from an decision-makers will always go for money first and forego future profits to ensure that you are less exposed to risk.

There is also an argument that that IS the right move.  Taking a lump sum and investing it is 100% better than being paid out the lump sum over the course of 50 years.  In the first situation, you are making the interest, in the second THEY are making the interest.

So, to answer your question at the bottom. I actually think that the smarter move for most people is to take the low-skilled, well paying job and invest your excess money.  I know complete morons who earned their MBAs (fun fact, you can't 'fail' and MBA, so next time someone tries to wave it in your face, scoff and think to yourself 'you could be a moron who just so happened to have access to $120K in debt) and I'll tell you this: The moron who spent $120K on an MBA in their 30s will NOT be more financially well off at 65 than any person who brought in a steady income from the age of 18 (assuming they're not buying time shares in Florida, or renting sports cars).

That being said, the impressive person who gets an MBA in their 30s likely has a plan and will be better off than the moron with the MBA, or anyone who's worked since their 18 (but that person who's worked since their 18 will still be in a pretty good spot, honestly).

And here is where we converge: The 'impressive person' I talk about up there?  That's the brand.  If the brand is impressive, then the company will succeed.  If the brand is the moron who paid for an MBA, the company won't succeed. If the brand is the basic person who worked from 18 with OK pay, then you'll get, I suppose, the equivalent of a company that sells necessary staples (like flour, or soap); they bring in money, no one is dying of hunger, but their dead on the inside. I honestly think we're more in sync than this long exchange would have you believe.

Despite what I'll tell you at the end, I do not know enough about Square's statements to have a say in this.  If they're worried about the decline of their brand I think that's fair.  FF has never mattered more than it did with 7 and that was almost 30 years ago.  But sales? I think they need to take adjust expectations. 

And though I work in finance, I'm actually a journalist. I just sold out and went corporate. So believe me, I chose a pretty terrible field honestly.  But I learn a lot more about a wider range things and get to talk to more incredible people (and not so incredible) than most humans do, so it's kinda cool.

Cheers!

PS: The best case, I can think of is Sony buys Square and Capcom.  If Microsoft can dodge regulators and buy Bethesada and Activision Blizzard, then Sony should do the same.
                I get that. What I’m saying is what they have done, vs what they will do. 

So when I responded to what you said, that I’m underestimating the money they get with Sony exclusivity deals, it’s that I don’t think I am because Square I aware of the sales problem and does see it as a red flag, going as far as citing the platform as a part of that issue.

My suggestion is that it seems like their strategy will change as a result. Your original response seemed to suggest that it won’t. We don’t disagree on the points that each strategy has. We divert on what they Will be likely to do going forward.

So when I say they are likley to shift that strategy, it’s based off of their quarterly reports, as well as the evidence that square themselves has cited.

Side note. I don’t think you sold out, you made a smart call. Journalism ain’t easy friend. I can’t claim to be an expert in it, but I have to imagine our disciplines are similar in stability, and while I’ve managed to be lucky, I see how many people better than me haven’t been. You’re smart for having that back up.

Regarding the P.S. I think I agree.
I actually think totk was amazing and I didn’t really
Love botw, but bg3 is in a league of its own
    Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed TOTK as well, but it did start to drag for me about halfway through when I felt like I had already seen most of what the game had to offer, especially since I had just gotten my switch about a year before its release so I still had beating BOTW for the first time relatively fresh in my memory. Also the decision not to do a master mode dlc was kind of disappointing since I felt that was one of the cooler things about BOTW.
I think what I hear you saying is it doesn’t have to do gang buster numbers like remake to be considered a success. Totally agree; traditionally ff sequels make less anyway. I guess what I’m saying is, the game at the very least hit their projections.
Rebirth is the 11th most downloaded game in ps5 in March.

All good points.  I work in finance though, in a senior-level corporate setting, so I know how boards think, how budgets are managed and how the immediate and likely high eight- or NINE-FIGURE sum that Sony paid for FF exclusivity -- with **no cost** for overhead, human resource, real estate, R&D, utilities, insurance, tax etc. -- is a lot more attractive than the *potential* sales they could rake in and all the risk and huge costs involved with going multi-platform.

As I said, I think you're not quite realizing that that money is risk-free, guaranteed and immediate.  Put it this way:

1. $100 right in my pocket making interest for exclusivity + $100 in sales - $70 in costs

Or

2) $0 in my pocket not making interest + $200 (and this number is super variable/risky) in sales - $150 in costs (this number is based on your comment that the fact that they are single-platform makes it easier to develop).

100% of the time a corporation with any hint of risk management or even just an accounting department will choose #1.  And they're right to.
    No, I definitely do realize it’s risk free and immediate. I said it’s a short term financial solution. 

What I’m saying is that the strategy is how square has been operating for some time now, and they’ve openly acknowledged the problem with the brand recently. 

These short term solutions don’t keep the brand alive, that they need to remain a studio of their size. It won’t matter how much money Sony gives them if the brand looses viability. And at a certain point Sony won’t see the value in dumping money into the exclusivity of a franchise that’s sales diminish year over year. 

Square has already acknowledged the poor sales, and is trying to solve the problem. They’ve even cited slow adoption of the PS5 as a contributing factor. They’ve also seen stock prices decline as a result of these marquee titles  not selling the larger numbers that other recent titles have.
