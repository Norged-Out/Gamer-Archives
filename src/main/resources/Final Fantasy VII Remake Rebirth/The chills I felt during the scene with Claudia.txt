[[The chills I felt during the scene with Claudia]]


“You’re my son, of course I’ll always be-“ (proud of you)

Cloud needs a hug.


Cloud is like the best written Final Fantasy character ever, and this new iteration really adds a lot of depth to it. Say what you want about anything else but in narrative terms and characterization these remakes are almost unmatched in videogames (only thing close for me is the TLOU games)
    I’ve always adored Cloud.  His big spikey 90s anime hair, ridiculous giant 90s anime sword, how much of a badass he is, and how his quest is just as much a journey of self-discovery and growth as it is about saving the world.  

Despite all that, I would have rated Tidus as the best FF protagonist because his journey of transformation is so compelling.  But the Remake series is really elevating Cloud for me.  It’s just great.  
        It's easy to be a more complex character when you have so much extra work to help.
You just know they're saving the entirety of those snippets for when eventually we revisit those fateful days and it will be absolutely heart wrenching.
    Damn…
There's some fans like me that definitely needed a moment after that. I lost my mom in 2012, and that scene still hit me in the gut.
The remake is adding these kinds of moments with all sorts of people I didn't care about in the OG. Jessie was another that I didn't really care about before, now I'm more sad about her than anyone else.
    I think it’s amazing how the writers made me actually like and care about Claudia with such little dialogue and screen time. Reminds me of Sarah in the last of us 1.
I wish my mom felt that way about me. 🥲
You think she was about to say (proud of you)?

I assumed it was you’re my son so of course I’ll always be asking about when you’re going to provide grandchildren
    Yeah because he probably told her he didn’t make soldier so she was reassuring him.

    Why?

No, Cloud really did visit his mom. The only part of that scene that is false is where she mentions that he’s a soldier which is why it does that weird glitch effect thing when she says soldier. The reason she didn’t hug him is presumably because she knows her son is quite guarded and isn’t very comfortable with physical affection. Cloud in that full scene actually tells her he didn’t make it as a soldier, and in the end that’s why she says “you’re my son, of course I’ll always be-“ (proud of you) and then it cuts and the scene ends because this part of his memory strongly contradicts his new identity.
                I like how you can watch the Rebirth Flasback and try and work out where the real memories and manipulated ones overlap. I suspect that it was Grunt Cloud on the water tower, his body language was far more closed up and looked like he felt shame - poor baby.
                    This makes me so sad for him, ugh 🥺🥺

I can’t wait for this game to come out
                Yup, She asks something like “is that you cloud?”. He has the grunt helmet on (in reality).
            I don’t think that’s correct. The memory of visiting Clouds mother comes from Cloud’s actual memory.
