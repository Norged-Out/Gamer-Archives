[[Will FF7 REBIRTH win any game awards ]]


Back in 2020 game awards FF7 REMAKE won multiple awards for best RPG and best soundtrack, do you think FF7 REBIRTH will win more awards and possibly Game of the year of 2024?


I think it's got a great shout for GOTY, looking at the releases for the rest of the year, but it's always difficult to tell, you never know what might pop up.

It will have best soundtrack sewn up already. Rebirth has a shout at best soundtrack of all time let alone this year.
I think it can genuinely win goty
It will most likely win best soundtrack, and maybe best rpg, but there has been a lot of good rpg games this year so it going to be hard for ff7 rebirth. When it comes to goty maybe, but we haven’t seen all the games in 2024 yet, so it hard to tell at the moment until we are closer to the game awards show.
    There’s no obvious contenders in my eyes, but there’s always dark horse candidates that come outta nowhere, and recency bias is a helluva drug. 
        As of now, I think Rebirth's worst enemy is the amount of time it will take to get to the game awards. People move on fast in this industry, and like you said, recency bias is big problem.

That and it's part of a remake.
Maybe/who cares as long as you enjoyed it?

Metaphor will probably be really good and I really hope SMTV Vengeance is a banger but unless Metaphor is a P5 style anomaly with an explosion of sales I can't imagine either being nom'd beyond OST/RPG/Art stuff but it's also like...idk, why do people care if their favourite piece of plastic wins an award or not? Rebirth has stupendous banger OST, so do a bunch of games.

As for overall GOTY...idk. I might love Rebirth then be caught by surprise by something and feel like while I loved Rebirth it was Game B that resonated in a surprising way and thus made more of an impression etc. Also if it doesn't completely fall off a cliff I could see Helldivers 2 being a GOTY nom for a lot of people.
For now the only other candidate is DD2, but with 6 months to go there is still room for surprises (yes, I'm looking at you Metaphor)
Something like 90% of votes for GOTY come from critical reviewers etc and only 10% come from public. Based on that, Rebirth is already set to win GOTY (I know there’s a long way to go) and there’s not really a huge list of big games coming this year.
I haven’t seen anything yet that will challenge it for Game of the Year and nothing that we know of coming soon, I think will either.
Yeah probably. There are many outlets that host game of the year, it isnt just geoff keighlys. His is just the most famous one.  But more than likely it will win a few categories across various outlets. My money is on winning multiple musical categories minimum.   But it is also early in the year. Who knows what may surprise us later on. I dont think anyone predicted Baldurs Gate 3 would come out of nowhere and absolutely dominate a lot of awards across so many outlets. So time will tell
it’s definitely winning Best OST and Best RPG

its real contenders for GOTY is:

- Black Myth: Wukong

- Sony’s big hit

- Nintendo’s big hit

- or some random game that’s not getting enough attention until release


possibly nominated for:

- game direction

- art direction

- narrative

- action

- action/adventure

- audio design
Best soundtrack it just has to win. If the Elden Ring DLC is applicable for awards, I feel like that automatically puts another name in the bag just cause its a clear fan favourite already (for obvious reasons). I for one will be rooting for Rebirth as GOTY tho, one of the best games I've ever played fs, let alone this year
    DLC won’t qualify for the overall GOTY award, but can qualify for “best continuous game”, like cyberpunk won that award last year over FF14….
        Did some research about this. The DLC makes it possible for Elden ring to win goty again from my understanding
            Well that’s some bullshit then. Elden ring nut huggers gonna be happy as it’ll win just because of its name.
Imo it will win GOTY. Geoff got the scoop on Rebirth on his summer game fest show and this is a critical reviewed title 

Might be bias but it has it in the bag
I’ve always held the relatively unpopular position that neither the last of us part 2 nor ghost of Tsushima deserved to win GOTY by any stretch, I think both were mediocre games. 
Remake was absolutely robbed in 2020 as far as I’m concerned, so it wouldn’t surprise me if rebirth also gets robbed.
It has a good chance.  I think it should be in serious contention for Best RPG, Action Game, Voice Acting, Sound track, art direction, and audio design.


I'm on the fence on GotY, while it's a really, really good game, I don't feel it's universal masterpiece level.  That being said, maybe really good is good enough this year.
There really aren't that many big game releases this year. So I wouldn't be surprised if it won GOTY.

The only competition it might realistically have would be Hellblade 2.
It's April. Far too early to make any reasonable predictions.
It can definitely win awards but for goty i don't know, i've look at 2024 game announced right now and it doesn't look like there is too much competition but even without to much competition it think Helldivers 2 have more chance to win goty.

And i don't think they'll put Elden ring dlc in Goty but it may appears in some categories.
There’s always a chance of FF7RB winning GOTY. I would be surprised if they don’t have at least a nomination in this category. I am very certain the game will win some awards at the same event.
So far it’s the strongest GOTY runner. Followed by Dragons Dogma 2. But I think game awards gonna count Elden Ring dlc as a new game and push that for GOTY. Call me crazy but I can see happening.
I think Remake should've won in 2020 and Rebirth is even better. At the very least if it doesn't win best soundtrack again then it's gotta be rigged.
it already won GOTY and GOT Decade for me.
Besides maybe Hades 2 and any out of nowhere titles to release this year I don't see why it shouldn't.  An RPG that is at its core Japanese to Anime based is long overdue for a GOTY sweep on the mainstream stages.
It will 100%
You would have a really tough time convincing me any game is critically better than rebirth this year. Personally for me it's game of the 2020s so far.
    That's quite a bold claim..
Currently yes.  All the biggest heavy hitters were last year and there doesnt seem to be anything else huge on the horizon for this year
Who gives a shit
