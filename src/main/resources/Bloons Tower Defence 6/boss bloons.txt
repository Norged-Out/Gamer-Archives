Ah yes, the four horsemen of BTD6:  Pestilence, Famine, War, and Racism.
    Basically geometry dash

Without pedophiles
        I‚Äôm sorry what
            Yeah, geometry dash only has pedophiles not whatever the hell those are
                wait wdym pedophiles
                    It feels like every other month one of the biggest community members is exposed as a pedophile or something
                        I can vouch this tbh
                            I think y‚Äôall r confusing it with FNF
                                Nahh there both as bad as each other trust me
                                    they‚Äôre trying to fight over second place game

truly one of the trends of all time
                                    I know

    Damn, that's literally my classmates
        Have you considered changing class
            They are cursed and will always arrive to a new class with the same things

Vore, Theft, EMPs, and Segregation

Very cool NK :)
    vortex is speeding too smh my head
        so EMPs plus Free Bird solo
    Bloonarius neither eats Bloons or monkeys. You could probably find a better word.
        its reverse vore
Y'know  vortex probably uses an imaginary bat to break knee caps
    As a vortex profile user, you probably know your stuff
        I didnt say I used a imaginary bat
            Probably worded it poorly but I was kinda trying to make a joke about you having a vortex profile picture so you would be most knowledgeable about vortex
                Ik and I said that i dont use the imaginary bat but other vortexes do
                    Ahhhh‚Ä¶ a family of vortexes, explains why there‚Äôs always so many‚Ä¶ is it like a puppy mill or do they give more humane ways of birthing new vortexes
                        Honestly I dont know where the others come from. But aging are humane, each tier is a different age
                            Ahhhh‚Ä¶ to be honest, probably shouldn‚Äôt had asked that question‚Ä¶ it was kinda distasteful and I apologize for it‚Ä¶
                                No your good
                                    Alright‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more just ‚Äúpuppy mills‚Äù are a serious topic so using it in a more joking manner is distasteful‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know the exact rules here but don‚Äôt want to get banned for being insensitive already now
I just want Bloonarius on a Beginner map with absolutely no restrictions.
    Too bad, Double HP Moabs on Skates
        That was just as easy
            Double the health, double the fall
    It's always interesting see how varied the opinions on bosses are in here. Some ppl want buffs to bosses and others want them to be more attainable to beat.
        Maybe an easy mode for bosses would help with this Personally, I'd like to see Bloonarius being more unique. Right now his only ability is spawning bloons across the map, which is still less interesting than Dreadbloons Rockbloons and Lychs soul + resurrected blimps, which are just one of their multiple abilites and properties. It made sense back when he was the tutorial boss, but now he gets outshined by all the other bosses having multiple unique traits and abilities.

Maybe the ceramics and blimps he spawns regenerate by covering their holes with slime, that would be something new and make him a bit more than a just a dps check (you might want to get anti regrow towers to help against this). Perhaps he could speed up a little bit after each skull, since he has less bloons inside of him.
        Regular mode is just boss on map. Elite is the bullshit time
    First Week Bloonarius lol. I thought he was so hard
"Just like it should be"üë¥
I think dreadbloon is my favorite boss now
    Definitely. It‚Äôs awesome how it makes you diversify your defense instead of just using a specific meta strat
        honestly, A tier boss without the damn rock bloons
            The rocks are kinda op sometimes
                the stage 2 rocks for elite dreadbloon have like 2k health
                    Yeah that shit‚Äôs insane. Harder than the actual boss depending on your setup
                        And the shield regens
it is a game about monkeys after all.
    I dont know whether to upvote This or downvote it
        As a black person, upvote
            Ok
    Monkeys secretly being imperium of Monke with True Sun God their god emperor and the mysterious four chaos god of bloons
hell naw, dreadbloon is racistüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ /s
My MAD monkey looking at the sky as I slowly hover my finger over the sell button when Dreadbloon loses the first skull

üòß
I dont get dreadbloon
    It divides towers so that one class is always restricted from hurting the ...master bloon.
        Oh that makes sense

I was thinking bloons segregation
I hate lych
    still the hardest boss

    Nah cripple. Some vortexes use an imaginary bat to take some kneecaps
Perfectly unbalanced, as all things should be‚Ä¶
Mm
I've seen a lot of *erotic* illustrations. Porn if you will.
What is the bottom right one? I haven't played Bloons in a while.
    Dreadbloon the newest boss. He has by far the lowest hp but has unique traits to try to make up for it. He reduces all incoming damage by 1, has lead bloons traits and is immune to one tower category (primary, military, magic, support) at a time, which switches after every skull (this is also what the joke is about). After every skull he gains a rock layer that needs to be destroyed first in order to damage him. This layer doesn't have lead properties and slows him down but while it's up rockbloons get spawned which can't be slowed down, have very high hp and also possess the current immunity.
        Elite should have 7 skulls so they're double immune
Hehehehe, vomits blood. And uhh steal your balls. And uhhhh electric chair. And uhhhh se-
Just a quick question, do I need to be a specific level to fight bosses? I can‚Äôt seem to find where to fight them.
Imagine if they used their respective abilities with each other around
