[[R.I.P. Continue Money]]





Sunk cost fallacy 63 levels into imp muddy poodles and suddenly im in my own personal monkey money crisis.

I really ought to use guides
    Nah guides are cringe, that's just someone beating the game for you at that point
        [deleted]
            Hot take but "learning" this game is one of the best ways to ruin it. Unless you're doing chimps on expert maps and need specific dart placements for early round snipes you can really use one meta for the whole game and ruin things quickly for yourself. This isn't really a difficult game and trying to figure things out on your own is much more fulfilling.
                I did "learn" but I don't feel like it ruined anything for me.
                    I guess I "learned" last when striker Jones recursive cluster spam was the meta. Got some chimps wins I didn't deserve and stopped having fun. Maybe the meta is different now but using the same towers every time has to get tiring right?
                        I suppose. I play in a pace where the broken strats get fixed or at least more balanced before I could try them out haha

Wait, now I see you mention recursive cluster spam, that was a long time ago. I first thought of 130 bomb spam without reading it properly.
                That's the thing tho, different maps have different metas. It's easy to say that when you're looking at beginner maps, but a map like Ouch has a different meta than a map like dark castle
                Exactly why I eventually stopped playing, too much of the game can be beaten with just an alchemist and a ninja
                    I make a point not to use top alch for this reason.

Edit: this is why I look forward to battles 2. I never played the first but I'm hoping a competitive angle will give this game life for me again. So long as it isn't just one meta rules all.
                        If you think the meta is bad for this game then you should look at Battles
                            That bad eh?
                                I mean the game revolves around beating an opponent, of course you're going to heavily need the meta to be successful
                                    Well there's a difference between a healthy and unhealthy meta. I don't think any random tower combination should be viable but there should be enough space there for variety.
                    ninjalch is overrated lol

dies r40 on a lot of maps and deals like 0 superceram damage

not much of a reason to choose it over sub/spalls alch unless you’re planning to get gmn
                        Man, I just am not seeing the ninja hype. Every time I try to use ninjas it just turns out horribly disappointing. I hear about them being so good, but they just seem to deal with some of the harder rounds absolutely abysmally.
                            ninjas aren't good at hard rounds but they make the easy rounds so easy that you can focus on setting up for the harder rounds.
                    i also stopped playing normal games except expert maps and now im just doing challenge browser challenges, some are pretty interesting
                This is why reddit is useless for this game tbh
            What's the point on learning if the challenge is already done?
                Did you ask me what the point of learning is?
                    ? What's the point in learning how to beat a challenge from a guide if the guide already tells you the answers? And if you say general game knowledge then why not just ask the community or look it up? Do i needa spell it all out for you lmao?
                        Consider this case: you beat a map with a guide, then apply what you did there (or something similar) on other maps.

It must be fun to figure everything out on our own, but some people don't have the patience for that, or not as lucky with their attempts as others, and end up looking up some guides. Then, with the knowledge from there they can continue to enjoy the game and go on different maps now without guides. This can be also fun.
                            But again, that ruins the challenge made by the devs, and is inorganic to how the game's supposed to be played
                                I seriously doubt the devs are so naïve as to think that people will not share guides, walkthroughs, tips and tricks with one another. Is everyone supposed to come up with their own strategy independent of each other for bloody puddles chimps? It is not ruining the game to help other people out.

                            BUt looking up a guide spoils that challenge, so why visually learn from a guide is my point
                                [deleted]
                                    I mean from a guide specifically, not visually learning from some other source
            you don't learn how to solve a puzzle by looking up the solution. that's called cheating.

                        How can you be so smooth brained you can’t understand how to take something you learned from doing one thing and apply it to a similar thing without exact copying? Did you pass 3rd grade math?
                            [removed]
                                That’s not even remotely what I’m saying. What I’m saying is you can do a math problem you’ve never seen before because you know how to add, multiply, divide, and subtract. Have you done the exact problem 108.3 x 7.9? Probably not. Could you? Yes. Because you know how to multiply, because you were taught how.

Also gotta say the specific words straw man fallacy in this comment because redditors really like logical fallacies
                                    [removed]
                True, but consider this: we have 100 similar puzzles and you can't do them, but I show you how to do one of them. You now will find it easier to attempt the rest of the puzzles. You may have "cheated" on puzzle 1, but treating this as a learning experience can help you with puzzles 2-100
        Who the fuck cares, it's a game. Play how you want
            We care

It is not a game

It is the Bloons lifestyle
        But sometimes you just gotta learn what towers are good.
            Learn by playing otherwise what’s the point of the game? Gets kinda boring once it’s just the grind of using the towers you already know are good to beat every map in every mode
        I learned that the hard way with sekiro
Back in BTD5 you could close the app to reset the round without paying money. Not sure if that still works.
    still works, you just have to go back to the menu. it's sort of official now actually since it gives you a black border if you beat chimps without doing that (if you do you get a golden border)
        No, that’s not it, in BTD5 you could close the game *after dying* and you’d still be alive when you went back in, that’s no longer a thing in BTD6, or at least wasn’t when I started playing, expecting it to work
            ohhhhh okay
        I wish gold was changed to Red
    Well, normally going to menu before dying is enough... but I am too slow or naive to do it
    It still works if you do it before your lives hit zero
Yep.
There should be a cheaper continue that doesn't give you any money. I don't care for the 5k or so they give me (in fact it feels like cheating), just let me reorganise what I do have!
    You can save and reload before you die to reset the round.
        I can, but I don't expect to die before I do. Otherwise I would have spent the thousands of dollars that I typically have saved up before dying. I just want a cheaper continue that doesn't give me thousands of dollars extra.
    I buy and sell a farm a few times to revert the bonus
        That is serious dedication.
I always get continues because I have more MM than i'll ever spend so there's no point wasting my time to save a bit of MM
    Yes especially when grinding for eggs at this moment
Round 63 and 95 in a nutshell
    I usually just accept my death at 95 and just plan what I'll do for my next game
    Pre Emptive has done 95 a joke for me.
For 63 I kindaaa recommend a 402 druid but eh difficult placements.
Multilane maps though...
Yea.
Have you ever lost on the round bought the continue lost again but another continue lost again but didn't have the money for the continued so you were happy that 3500 monkey money was for sale for 299. You finally be the level and you have less than $1,000 and  then die. you get so frustrated at the game you just don't want to play anymore that day
    No?

        They paid $3. Unless they're extremely broke, that's no worse than buying any other unnecessary thing that people want.
        Wire for supporting the Developers?
            1. You bought monkey money
2. If you lost twice it just means you didn’t have good enough defenses
3. Ninja kiwi is worth over 100m dollars. They aren’t Indie, and you’re not helping them in any way. It’s a drop in the bucket.
                Still supporting them. Trying to reach the highest round possible is quite difficult especially if you're not in coop
One reason I have never spent MM to do this... Obviously if I died now my defenses weren't good enough to keep going!
    Problem with this is: You could micro your towers (sometimes doesn't even have to be too complicated), use abilities (often times I lose just because I don't pay attention and thus miss using my abilities) or use the extra 4k the game gives you when continuing. Furthermore you still have the possibilities of selling towers for different ones and using powers or instas.

As you can see, just because you died doesn't mean you necessarily aren't able to defeat the wave
        Or, like me, you have $30k sitting in your banks that you could use
            And think...maybe I'll buy another mid tower before that t5
                Exactly. It's the worst when you lose while saving up for a big upgrade! I don't need to continue with even more money, I just need another chance to spend the money I do have
    They give you money from the round you died on so that you can add more towers. I agree that it's usually not worth the monkey money, but the idea is that you can get a chance to add some extra towers or upgrades.
    But time is money
Noooooooooo, this is too much relatable :(
No...... I died on the NEXT round
    Happened to me once of Blood Puddles on Hard

Died on R61 -> Continue -> Dies from Fortifed Moabs on R62
Me spending a ton to get past a hard map or forgetting a key round (camo leads usually).
I play where if I’m about to die I close out of the app so I can restart the round and work with what I have but I don’t continue if I die.
I haven't used my free one. It's more so just me being stubborn and not wanting to "waste" it but I know I'll never use it.
You ever spent monkey money to continue a co-op but everybody just ragequits anyway?
yes. very much yes
*exiting to main menu* fastest hand in the west
I relate to this so much
Me who died on round 40 three times on 2 seperate occasions
Ah making a meme about your own tweet nice
That hits waay to close to home
Happened to me recently. Double HP MOABS on underground, SLAMMED down a 0-4-2 boomerang and 0-2-4 dartling insta at the start, thought I'd be fine if I just buffed them and then saved for Permacharge. Died to reinforced MOABS on round 70 something a few thousand short of Parma, continued and died again trying to get enough money.
Thousands dude I’ve lost thousands
I remember spending 5k on round 98 of FV Impoppable. The win didn't even feel worth it and the 1,300 MM I got as a reward felt like a joke.
Round 95 I’m looking at you.
Isn't this what the monkey money is for?
    no you're not supposed to use it because it makes the game easier reeeee
    used for a lot of other stuff as well so people want to avoid using continues
This is why I never spend all of my money at once
Continues just make me angry, they never ever work since you start on the same round and you just end up wasting an insane amount of MM.
Half cash pain
Yup.
Yes
never bought a single continue. Not worth it.
if u see them coming close, save and reload to reset the round, with a better setup
happened to me today after attempting dark castle half cash
Balance - Impoppable R100

Was too slow on Using the Sabo and Died from DDTs
It hurts
I had experienced that once... And twice to continue the round
Ever do a race, go back to try something, then come back?
I bought 22 continues on ouch 98
Nah i go to home whenever im about to loose and continue on the save
So true
Join my team on BTD6: here's the code; SSSZGHPB
🗿
As somebody who plays often, I 100% understand this and it is so frustrating when that happens
😭
Nah guides are cringe, that's just someone beating the game for you at that point

    you don't learn how to solve a puzzle by looking up the solution. that's called cheating.

                How can you be so smooth brained you can’t understand how to take something you learned from doing one thing and apply it to a similar thing without exact copying? Did you pass 3rd grade math?

                        That’s not even remotely what I’m saying. What I’m saying is you can do a math problem you’ve never seen before because you know how to add, multiply, divide, and subtract. Have you done the exact problem 108.3 x 7.9? Probably not. Could you? Yes. Because you know how to multiply, because you were taught how.

Also gotta say the specific words straw man fallacy in this comment because redditors really like logical fallacies

        True, but consider this: we have 100 similar puzzles and you can't do them, but I show you how to do one of them. You now will find it easier to attempt the rest of the puzzles. You may have "cheated" on puzzle 1, but treating this as a learning experience can help you with puzzles 2-100
Who the fuck cares, it's a game. Play how you want
    We care

It is not a game

It is the Bloons lifestyle
But sometimes you just gotta learn what towers are good.
    Learn by playing otherwise what’s the point of the game? Gets kinda boring once it’s just the grind of using the towers you already know are good to beat every map in every mode
I learned that the hard way with sekiro
No, that’s not it, in BTD5 you could close the game *after dying* and you’d still be alive when you went back in, that’s no longer a thing in BTD6, or at least wasn’t when I started playing, expecting it to work
    ohhhhh okay
I wish gold was changed to Red
I can, but I don't expect to die before I do. Otherwise I would have spent the thousands of dollars that I typically have saved up before dying. I just want a cheaper continue that doesn't give me thousands of dollars extra.
That is serious dedication.
They paid $3. Unless they're extremely broke, that's no worse than buying any other unnecessary thing that people want.
Wire for supporting the Developers?
    1. You bought monkey money
2. If you lost twice it just means you didn’t have good enough defenses
3. Ninja kiwi is worth over 100m dollars. They aren’t Indie, and you’re not helping them in any way. It’s a drop in the bucket.
        Still supporting them. Trying to reach the highest round possible is quite difficult especially if you're not in coop
Or, like me, you have $30k sitting in your banks that you could use
    And think...maybe I'll buy another mid tower before that t5
        Exactly. It's the worst when you lose while saving up for a big upgrade! I don't need to continue with even more money, I just need another chance to spend the money I do have
Hot take but "learning" this game is one of the best ways to ruin it. Unless you're doing chimps on expert maps and need specific dart placements for early round snipes you can really use one meta for the whole game and ruin things quickly for yourself. This isn't really a difficult game and trying to figure things out on your own is much more fulfilling.
    I did "learn" but I don't feel like it ruined anything for me.
        I guess I "learned" last when striker Jones recursive cluster spam was the meta. Got some chimps wins I didn't deserve and stopped having fun. Maybe the meta is different now but using the same towers every time has to get tiring right?
            I suppose. I play in a pace where the broken strats get fixed or at least more balanced before I could try them out haha

Wait, now I see you mention recursive cluster spam, that was a long time ago. I first thought of 130 bomb spam without reading it properly.
    That's the thing tho, different maps have different metas. It's easy to say that when you're looking at beginner maps, but a map like Ouch has a different meta than a map like dark castle
    Exactly why I eventually stopped playing, too much of the game can be beaten with just an alchemist and a ninja
        I make a point not to use top alch for this reason.

Edit: this is why I look forward to battles 2. I never played the first but I'm hoping a competitive angle will give this game life for me again. So long as it isn't just one meta rules all.
            If you think the meta is bad for this game then you should look at Battles
                That bad eh?
                    I mean the game revolves around beating an opponent, of course you're going to heavily need the meta to be successful
                        Well there's a difference between a healthy and unhealthy meta. I don't think any random tower combination should be viable but there should be enough space there for variety.
        ninjalch is overrated lol

dies r40 on a lot of maps and deals like 0 superceram damage

not much of a reason to choose it over sub/spalls alch unless you’re planning to get gmn
            Man, I just am not seeing the ninja hype. Every time I try to use ninjas it just turns out horribly disappointing. I hear about them being so good, but they just seem to deal with some of the harder rounds absolutely abysmally.
                ninjas aren't good at hard rounds but they make the easy rounds so easy that you can focus on setting up for the harder rounds.
        i also stopped playing normal games except expert maps and now im just doing challenge browser challenges, some are pretty interesting
    This is why reddit is useless for this game tbh
What's the point on learning if the challenge is already done?
    Did you ask me what the point of learning is?
        ? What's the point in learning how to beat a challenge from a guide if the guide already tells you the answers? And if you say general game knowledge then why not just ask the community or look it up? Do i needa spell it all out for you lmao?
            Consider this case: you beat a map with a guide, then apply what you did there (or something similar) on other maps.

It must be fun to figure everything out on our own, but some people don't have the patience for that, or not as lucky with their attempts as others, and end up looking up some guides. Then, with the knowledge from there they can continue to enjoy the game and go on different maps now without guides. This can be also fun.
                But again, that ruins the challenge made by the devs, and is inorganic to how the game's supposed to be played
                    I seriously doubt the devs are so naïve as to think that people will not share guides, walkthroughs, tips and tricks with one another. Is everyone supposed to come up with their own strategy independent of each other for bloody puddles chimps? It is not ruining the game to help other people out.
