[[what your tower that you use the most in chimp]]





130 druid, aka axis of early game
    sauda, 130 druid and 302 ninja w alch
        Are the caltrops worth it? I tend to go 3/4-0-1
            Usually if Caltrops are worth it, you'll notice by dieing in the early game, so honestly, it's not something worth thinking about
            they dont affect attack speed so i get it on casual runs
                Oh yeah, I'm talking chimps only. Normal game caltrops are no more than 500 so don't exactly break the bank, but it all counts in chimps.
                    well in intermediate or below maps dont sweat it too much, if youâ€™re worried just dont get it but i personally dont like seeing green upgrade available when i can buy it
            Yep, itâ€™s basically a 000 spactory for half the cost.
            On a diff note, if you make a gmaster army, I recommend against upgrading to caltrops. Holy fuck I did it for fun on my recent phayze run and it made the game 3 times slower due to lag.
            No. The ninja base attack and alch on their own are enough to carry you to your next major purchase. Any budget cuts possible are good. Unless you absolutely need them to pass a certain round, donâ€™t buy
    130 druid is goated
    Druid needs a camo buff
This guy is so powerfulâ€¦ THAT HE CAN SELL IN CHIMPS
    How?
        he said CHIMP not CHIMPS, chimps stands for Cool heckin insane monkey poop selling /j
            For anyone who doesn't know CHIMPS stands for no: Continues, Hearts lost, Income, Monkey knowledge, Powers, and Selling
                yeah i said that
    heli? ice?
        I donâ€™t think you get the money from that, so itâ€™s more like vanishing than selling
            Adora is the closest because you can get hero XP from the sacrifice
    Adora or x3/4/5x ice monkey ?
        Like I said before, sacrificing isnâ€™t selling you arenâ€™t getting any money from those methods, one is sacrificing towers and the other is making them vanish
            Technically you can sacrifice a x3/4/5x ice monkey and it will sell anything that was placed on its ice
                Selling: to give or hand over something in exchange for money, with adora ice, you donâ€™t get money
                    R u sure?
                        Iâ€™m positive
                            Test it out
                                I did
                                    Send proof
I just cannot for the life of me go through an entire game of CHIMPS without spunking stickiness all ova Bloons.
    What?? i am scared
        Glue gunna

        I agree
Alch, probably the most commonly used in CHIMPS.

                SOTF has hidden camo detection
                    (Me when round 78:)
                    2 questions: sotf is 2xx ? And if yes: why did no one ever told me
                        Soft is 0-5-0 and you porbably just didnt know
                            I was just like "yea the road thorns hit everything makes sense" 

Still doesn't answer why I should go for 250 instead of 150
                                Extra damage + idk if the thorns pop lead
                                    030 can't pop lead, 130 can
                                Ummm because it only costs ~1k so why not?
                                    1k much money
                                    If you ever played harder maps, 1k is alot.
                    Yo did you mean DOTF (idk what SOTF)

Wizard, PoD be specific, I hate DDTs and itâ€™s easy to get while focusing on other towers

024 druid, life saver
I can't really choose one since I only do chimps on beginner maps I only do expert chimps with a tutorial but I use sauda 025 glue Gunner 520 glue Gunner and a 250 dartling
I can't choose just one cus I alllways use 250 glue 025 glue sauda and 250 dartling
Wizard. Use to be spike factory, but then April update hit and well...
I like etn because I can run a couple 320 boats an get away with round 63/78 pretty  easily if I set 2 of them on strong alongside my other favorites the 240 wizard an 2 230 druids for cleanup then going into later rounds I can pick whatever t5 or 2 t5s I wanna go for.
Sniper, plant and forgetðŸ˜Œ
Spirit of the Forest.  
it's probably far from efficient but just... never having to worry about strays
I end up getting a 0-2-4 mortor. Useful for late game when alot of fortified bloons start showing up. Otherwise proabbly 4-2-0 Sub if there is a good sub spot.

Probably 3 or 4 x/x wizard, pretty powerful for its cost
420 or 520 glue. the buff is just too good.
Im half way through the intermediate maps for chimps, and right now my teams consist of 502 archmage, 420 alchemist, and 042 tech terror. Heros typically Psi. Only recently started using the tech terror but hes been dope for chimps for the last like 5 intermediate chimps

2 questions: sotf is 2xx ? And if yes: why did no one ever told me
    Soft is 0-5-0 and you porbably just didnt know
        I was just like "yea the road thorns hit everything makes sense" 

Still doesn't answer why I should go for 250 instead of 150
            Extra damage + idk if the thorns pop lead
                030 can't pop lead, 130 can
            Ummm because it only costs ~1k so why not?
                1k much money
                If you ever played harder maps, 1k is alot.
Yo did you mean DOTF (idk what SOTF)
