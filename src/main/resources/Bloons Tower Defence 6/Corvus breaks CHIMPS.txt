[[Corvus breaks CHIMPS]]





Yeah I'm low-key shocked this actually works hella cool
Honestly the soul shield is more like LOTN to me because it's temporary. I think legend works in CHIMPS but too expensive to use. This one gets a pass >>
    Yeah from what I've seen it looks like a mini LOTN portal you can get before freeplay (in CHIMPS at least)
CIMPS
    Is it pronounced as SIMPS or KIMPS
        TIMPS
            TI*S
        C as in Celsius
            Never heard anyone pronounce celsius as celsius before, sounds weird
                I do it too, and its kind of cool (2 meanings) it doesnt sound that bad and also its cold outside.
            r/tomorrow flashbacks
        Squirrels in my pants??
        grammatically, the first one. c + vowel
            There are rules? I thought you had to memorise it individually
                i mean, usually. english has lots of exceptions built within it since it's an abomination but if you make up a word in English it'd probably be pronounced with c + vowel = s
                    Not any vowel. Specifically e or i
                        ohhh right cat, cut. company,... well, y too, right? cycle?

honestly who who cares about other vowels anyway riiight
                            Y only counts as a vowel if there‚Äôs no other vowels in the word. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs A,E,I,O,U and *sometimes* Y.

God I sound like an English teacher
                                I'm pretty sure Y counts as a vowel as long as it is pronounced like a vowel
                                still a vowel sometimes :) also wrong, cycle has a silent e, and cycling is still c as a vowel pronounciation ;)
                                    Something something, exception not the rule I guess? 


I‚Äôm so glad that English is my first language, even if I‚Äôm bad with it it would be hell on earth to learn
                            Y is not a vowel anyway, so it is a moot point. It merely takes the place of a vowel, but is not a vowel in its own right
                                That's like saying s isn't a consonant lol
                                    Why wouldn't s be a consonant?
            Corvus.
                looool
        No, its not pronounced greg
        Tjimps
        √áƒ∞MPS
        Pronounce it like the C in cancer
            that's probably not english-originated
        it‚Äôs pronounced the same as the g in gif
            so "Gee"? since gif is spelled out when pronounced?
                yea let‚Äôs go with that why not
                    Geeimps
                        gee-aye-em-pee-es
                            that's messed up O\_o
                                wdym it‚Äôs perfect
I consider it balanced because you need to time it correctly for it to be effective. It‚Äôs not like it activates automatically or is permanently active.
I'm curious if losing Corvus lives triggers the Bomb Blitz ability. I will report back.

Edit: I am sad to report that losing Corvus lives does not trigger the Bomb Blitz ability. Unfortunately, Bomb Blitz is still missing a key feature in CHIMPS mode.
    Which is a shame because Recursive Cluster is far and away my favorite T4 Bomb.
        Blitz is still a solid T5 tho regardless of its ability
            excuse me sir, what are you on? and can I have some of it? Blitz is trash bro
                Blitz does a ton of damage with all of the recursive explosions, and benefits a lot from alch buff due to it being a slower firing tower. It performs pretty damn well overall, but yeah saying super strong is definitely an exaggeration.
    I wish they'd buff it the same way they did in Battles, make it trigger a couple seconds before they reach the exit.
I think its balanced. The H in chimps stands gor no health right, but thats not health, its a kind of mana shield. Also, its apparently short term, which makes it kind of less op then the manashiekd MK, even though it shields more.
    Still disappointed they took mana shield away from impoppable.
        At least we still have road spikes
        They did???

It's a mk tho, that's not cool
            I mean it was years ago, but yeah.
                16.0, that‚Äôs like 2020 irrc
                    Nice I've played since release, we basically have BTD7 vs 2018 BTD6
                    I feel so old, why have you done this
                I dont play impop often
                    I don't play as much as I'd like. Getting through hard and alt rounds to unlock it can take annoyingly long.

Probably my favorite base game mode though.
    yeh its very balanced and the max you can get is only enough to tank one moab
peak soulbind at home moment
    soulbind *but good
        Why was soulbind bad? It sounded pretty OP if you linked it to a super monkey or something like that
            The money you put into buying soulbind/sacrificing a tower to use soulbind was much better spent on literally buying any defense, the ability was essentially useless
            It was at a rate of $100 to 1 life. If you soulbinded all of the towers possible with all money spent on chimps mode now that would be less than 2,000 lives. Taking down maybe a couple moabs was not good for a tier 5 tower.
this is balanced its really doesn't break it , 397 isnt that much especially when its temporary and still isnt enough to leak moabs and stuff
    the max is 760 i think

i think it is just the amount of "soul" he has, the max is 800 and the spell cost 40 to cast, so you could leak a MOAB, but also it allow to leak the camo if you forgot to have a camo tower on round 24 and don't have enough money
        yeah, i like that use, i use it to leak leads on round 30
Wait what is this? I haven't played in a few months now and I'm confused af
    It‚Äôs one of the abilities from the newest hero, who‚Äôs super complicated. When you use it (it takes up mana, which is a resource of his. Learn about him more to figure out the interkacies of mana but it‚Äôs kinda like another form of money for him), it gives mana shield for a very limited amount of time, like a few seconds, and the amount of shield it gives depends on how much mana he has. It has a long recharge too. Think of it as a sort of LOTN
        I still can't figure out the Geraldo and NK dropped an even more complex hero. Damn.
            Thankfully they said that they're going back to simpler towers and heros
            I can‚Äôt figure out Geraldo either, but Corvus is way simpler. Sure the skill ceiling may be higher but Corvus can also be effective as a global range damage dealer with many abilities. I think he‚Äôs still effective even if you just spam a couple of his spells.
                Corvus is much like the Magus. Micro, combos, and a high skill set.

Geraldo can be better compared to cluster spam. High skillet to know how to keep it going, keep it op, but easy to make it far.
        Intricacies
    The new hero, Corvus the Spirit Walker has it's own currency system called "mana". The hero is similar to Geraldo with the shop, but instead uses mana instead of money. One of the spells you can cast in Corvus' Spellbook will temporarily turn mana into extra lives.
It feels kind of strange given Corvus now suddenly manages to bend "No Lives Lost" rule but who knows, maybe the spell wont do anything in patch.

I dont think we should be overly optimistic
    Legend of the Night does that too, obv you can't afford it in normal chimps but if you go into freeplay chimps and get it, its black hole ability works too
    I mean it is an ability, it really isn't that different than putting a spike factory at the end of the track and calling that extra lives.
        To be frank its true. The mana you spend on this is usually better spend somewhere else.
    It doesn't break any rules suddenly, you're not losing any hearts and it's not giving you any lives, it's just a shield the same as LotN which has always worked in CHIMPS as well
        Oh, thank you for clearance, when I used soul barrier for real i noticed that its temporary.
Honestly think its pretty fair. Cause it is part of his kit and they aren't real lifes and don't last that long
I feel like they‚Äôre either gonna patch it to be disabled altogether or at least significantly limited in CHIMPS
    Thats what i also think will happen. Propably the former
LES GO!
Corvus might get nerfed soon so get your chimps medals while it‚Äôs still good
    i don't think, he seems good but not broken or at least is so hard to use that it balance him
‚ÄúNo hearts lost‚Äù mfs when I pull out the soul barrier:
I think it makes sense that it doesn't trigger life-loss effects and works in CHIMPS. It's a shield using Corvus' mana, not giving you bonus lives. 

It only shows with the lives to give you a clean understanding of how much shielding you're getting.
Isn't this just a different form of road spikes?
What the hell is that
Why must I be flat brokeüò≠üò≠üò≠
Wow guys the new micro hell hero is op ,almost as if that didn't just happened with the last one , call me Nostradamus cuz I aaw that comming milles away
This is unbalanced as fuck what
Definetly gonna be changed/fixed, the H literally stands for lives lost
    But lives lost doesn‚Äôt start with an H

Hahahahaa

Now laugh please
        This is a BIG laugh.
            #HAHAHA.                        
MY LAUGH IS BIGGER
    from what i know, it‚Äôs a temporary shield like LoTN‚Äôs blackhole passive, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs extra permanent lives and needs to be used effectively to avoid having leaks when the ability is on cooldown. probably explained it shittly though
    yeah it stands for hearts lost
What is his early level counter for purple bloons besides Trample?
    [deleted]
        Um...id have to test this
        It looks like it does but its super slow.
Bruh shhhhh now they know and are gonna patch it bruhhhhhh
C in chimps stands for Corvus
Who the heckin heck is Corvus?
    New hero
        Yeah I saw him and goddamn is he expense to get
QUICK! Black border everything before it gets patched
why does this even work in CHIMPS and Impoppable

isn't the whole point of those two modes not losing lives? even mana shield doesn't work in impoppable
So does legend of the knights black hole, effectively the same
    Good luck getting him in chimps
        Yes yes I know, but the point still stands, you could already theoretically leak in chilmps and live
            Fair enough
only problem is I dont ha e enough monkey money to  buy him, nor do I have the skill to use him
shits broken tbh, it shouldn‚Äôt work in chimps.
Kinda useless. By the time you unlock the spell the rounds are too dense and if stuff passes itll be entire blimps or ceramic swarms. Or rather, veryyy situational. Id rather a Geraldo maelstrom at the end
I thought this said Corona when I saw it at first
I was about to say you could combine that with Ben to give even more of an effective life buffer through stalling, but it's safe to say you won't be doing that solo.
Using only corvus I was able to get to round 95 on chimps, he definitely breaks it, and the shield can rank entire early rounds
Yeah from what I've seen it looks like a mini LOTN portal you can get before freeplay (in CHIMPS at least)

                Y is not a vowel anyway, so it is a moot point. It merely takes the place of a vowel, but is not a vowel in its own right
                    That's like saying s isn't a consonant lol
                        Why wouldn't s be a consonant?
Corvus.
    looool
that's probably not english-originated
so "Gee"? since gif is spelled out when pronounced?
    yea let‚Äôs go with that why not
        Geeimps
            gee-aye-em-pee-es
                that's messed up O\_o
                    wdym it‚Äôs perfect
excuse me sir, what are you on? and can I have some of it? Blitz is trash bro
    Blitz does a ton of damage with all of the recursive explosions, and benefits a lot from alch buff due to it being a slower firing tower. It performs pretty damn well overall, but yeah saying super strong is definitely an exaggeration.
I mean it was years ago, but yeah.
    16.0, that‚Äôs like 2020 irrc
        Nice I've played since release, we basically have BTD7 vs 2018 BTD6
        I feel so old, why have you done this
    I dont play impop often
        I don't play as much as I'd like. Getting through hard and alt rounds to unlock it can take annoyingly long.

Probably my favorite base game mode though.
The money you put into buying soulbind/sacrificing a tower to use soulbind was much better spent on literally buying any defense, the ability was essentially useless
It was at a rate of $100 to 1 life. If you soulbinded all of the towers possible with all money spent on chimps mode now that would be less than 2,000 lives. Taking down maybe a couple moabs was not good for a tier 5 tower.
Thankfully they said that they're going back to simpler towers and heros
I can‚Äôt figure out Geraldo either, but Corvus is way simpler. Sure the skill ceiling may be higher but Corvus can also be effective as a global range damage dealer with many abilities. I think he‚Äôs still effective even if you just spam a couple of his spells.
    Corvus is much like the Magus. Micro, combos, and a high skill set.

Geraldo can be better compared to cluster spam. High skillet to know how to keep it going, keep it op, but easy to make it far.
#HAHAHA.                        
MY LAUGH IS BIGGER
Fair enough
I do it too, and its kind of cool (2 meanings) it doesnt sound that bad and also its cold outside.
i mean, usually. english has lots of exceptions built within it since it's an abomination but if you make up a word in English it'd probably be pronounced with c + vowel = s
    Not any vowel. Specifically e or i
        ohhh right cat, cut. company,... well, y too, right? cycle?

honestly who who cares about other vowels anyway riiight
            Y only counts as a vowel if there‚Äôs no other vowels in the word. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs A,E,I,O,U and *sometimes* Y.

God I sound like an English teacher
                I'm pretty sure Y counts as a vowel as long as it is pronounced like a vowel
                still a vowel sometimes :) also wrong, cycle has a silent e, and cycling is still c as a vowel pronounciation ;)
