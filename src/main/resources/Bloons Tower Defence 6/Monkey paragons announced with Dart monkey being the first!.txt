[[Monkey paragons announced with Dart monkey being the first!]]





Do we need Polymerization?
    no it's a contact fusion
        Ah, so we should use Neo Space so it doesn't get sent back to the deck
            Gladiator beast varient
                So they'll leave field and we'll need special summon other monkeys from our deck?
    Guys it's Xyzs.  Black background.  Also it's probs gonna have an ability we can only use 3 times.

Unless we sacrifice more tier 5 monkeys after summoning?🤔🤯
    1. I love everyone in this thread. 
2. If it was an archetype made today it would have it's own archetypal fusion card called Monkey Fusion. Which would probably go something like this: 
Special summon one "Monkey" fusion card from your extra deck by sending cards you control or from your hand to the graveyard. If you control the face up Field Spell Card "Monkey Sandbox" you can send cards from your deck instead. If this card is in your graveyard, you can shuffle it back into the deck and draw 1 card.

Great now I want to make Dart monkey themed custom YuGiOh cards.
        No it would just fusion summon two field spells from two completely unrelated archetypes
        Just do, for example on the Dark Souls 1 sub someone posts dark souls stuff as Magic: The Gathering cards
    I would just use Future Fusion or Magical Scientist tbh
        Isn’t magical scientist banned?
            Extremely
    Uhh yes we do

I wonder if it will be at all CHIMPS viable. New mode maybe?
    I don't think the money checks out for normal CHIMPS. Even if you could afford it, that would mean basically no support.
        That's great actually because beating CHIMPS while getting one of them will make for great new challenges
        Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. If not, there are a number of towers that you can get all T5's for in Chimps.

And support won't be that expensive for such a powerful tower as a T6. It's ~$4000 for a camo village + a hero, or ~$12000 with an MIB. That still leaves ~$120,000 before round 90.
            NGL any tier 6 that needs an MIB isn't gonna be worth using imo
                The vengeful temple needs MIB tho
                    No it doesn't lol, it just needs radar village for camos. It can pop any bloon type
            > Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. 

It would probably have to cost something for balance, a cost that varies between towers. Consider the sniper, it's cheaper than some other paragons (if the merging doesn't cost anything) while at the same time being incredibly strong because of how well all three paths synergize with each other.
        It will be affordable for Sniper pretty easily.
            Oh my good a bouncing, stunning Elite Defender. Holy fucking shit.
                Which would also deal 80 (!!!) damage per shot, shrapnel damage 12. Holy shit indeed
                    No way in hell would they allow that
                        A full-auto sniper that can stun moabs, yeah they are not going to allow it
                            Not unless it’s as expensive as a vengeful temple
                            maybe the paragons will have a unique effect
                                Yeah, I feel like this is what will happen. It's just fun to imagine the concept of a full auto Cripple MOAB with shrapnel lol
                            Good point on limits. They could limit one paragon per game. Like you're allowed a 5-5-5 sniper, but then you can't buy a 5-5-5 dartling. They could do something like you need to buy each tier 5, and then the game asks do you wish to create paragon, and then asks for heap'o'money. So they basically become late game towers.
                        Even a 504 sniper would be completely OP, there’s no way they will have a 555 sniper
                            Bouncing bullets would be fucked with maim Moab or even elite defender maximum damage and stun
            Axis of Havoc moment
            Sniper would be op with his speed from elite diffender and atrack from from 1 an 2 path
            im going to assume there would be a very high cost to combine the 3
        Tack shooter could work, though!
        Depends if their extending rounds past 100 is for a new, harder, longer mode or not.
            Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder
                > Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder

that was because of the early game
                I would really enjoy a harder mode to play on easier maps.
                It’s not like it was hard past that relative to some of the other Expert maps. Some people went in challenge editor for one extra life and beat it.
                That was toxic earlygame though, the endgame has gotten way too easy these days. So many towers that can basically solo 90-99 with basic support.
        There's literally an achievement for getting all T5 Snipers in CHIMPS, so definitely possible for some towers.
    Something cheap like sniper maybe
        Paragon sniper would also be op as crud
    yeah, probably wouldn't work money-wise, plus, the fact that Ninja Kiwi's showing these things as cards makes me think that paragons would fail the Monkey Knowledge or Powers part of CHI**MP**S. But I was very, very wrong about what this update would be, so take my logic with several big grains of salt!
    I feel like it’s be too expensive for it to be viable
    Am I the only one who's really skeptical of this?

CHIMPS is already way too long as far as game modes go. The final levels are suitably climactic but they take way too much time to add more of the same. Adding some sort of super late game content to CHIMPS meant to be handled with merged T5's sounds awful, honestly. A super late game deflation might be okay.

I'm also really concerned about balance. The current system is quite deep and polished and got that way after loads of careful tweaks. Now they need to suddenly balance an entire extra tier on each tower? That's the sort of thing you save for a new version, screw up for a few months, and slowly fix in a series of patches.

On the other hand I expect a change like this will result in a lot of new creative challenge maps taking advantage of new mechanics. That sounds fun.
    I feel like it would be monkey knowledge
        But that would be 22 more monkey knowledge points which would take literal DAYS to get.
    I feel like it would be monkey knowledge
    Well, they've standardized 101-140. 163 has always been standardized, so has 263. Maybe we're finally getting CHAMPIONS or something equivalent?

Also, VTSG requires Monkey Knowledge, and that's basically a Paragon already (minus the Black Hole, Dark Shift, and Bloon Annihalation), so maybe it'll be a Monkey Knowledge thing, preventing it from even being used in CHIMPS.
Tier 6 Banana Farm should let you buy out rounds to delete/skip them
    Even the BAD falls before the power of capitalism!
    Bribe the bloons into instantly ending the game
    Or play again for money abilities to go brrrr
        Repeat 49 for stonks
5-5-5 sniper and 5-5-5 tack shooter though

Also I technically got my wish of more crosspathing possibilities. I wonder, though, changing freeplay rounds and now tier 5 fusion... surely a harder game mode is soon to follow too right?
    Well that begs the question of what could be introduced that would be harder than CHIMPS
        Maybe mastery mode?
            Oh god mastery mode would be brutal
            [deleted]
                The thing with mastery mode in btd5 though was the fact that you got less money. I don't remember exactly how it worked but I do know the money didn't equal the bloons RBE (pretty sure a yeloow bloon would only give you 2 cash instead of 4). I don't think it'd be out of the blue for them to do the same thing in this game.
                    [deleted]
                        it gave quite a bit less than half iirc
                In Mastery, you get half cash per pop, and the first 0.5x cash reduction happens at round 31 instead of 51, meaning you get 25% of the cash per pop that you would get in a normal game from round 31 to round 50. If they wanted to maintain the reduced cash flow all the way throughout, they could push the other cash reduction points further back as well.
        A.P.E.S
            All Primates Eat Shat
            All Pops Extra Suffering

You would have to choose a tower to get all tier 5s of but you can only use 3 and only that tower. You are forced to get a paragon to weaken a Boss Bloon at the last round (round 120). Also True C.H.I.M.P.S rules are applied.
        Chimps halfcash appopalipse double hp moabs impopable combined lol
            And support towers only
Nice! Now I wonder what will happen to the TOTVM, whether they still get a paragon (and an alternative to the Temple) or the Temple will be considered the paragon.
    I’m assuming the temple will be considered a paragon because of the sheer strength it has and I cannot imagine an even powerful version
        I instantly assumed that it would look similar to the TOTVM, which could mean that it's non-CHIMPS.
            Would you need knowledge to merge them, ya think?
                There definitely won't be a knowledge for each tower, wouldn't be surprised if there was one knowledge per tower category though.

I'd rather see them use tower xp to unlock individually.
                    You think they'd put the knowledge at the end of the tree, like a connector for every branch? Or around where the VTSG knowledge is? Honestly, I think they're not going to need knowledge, or if they do, it'll be an early one; it'd be weird if they gated this big, hyped thing behind a lot of MK!
                    That'd be a use for all the extra tower xp I have.
                I'm gonna guess that they're swapping out the vengeful knowledge for paragon knowledge
        That and it already takes three T5 Super Monkey towers to craft. They can't make something that's TSG+Anti+LotN when they already HAVE a tower that's TSG+Anti+LotN.
    I mean vengeful temple is already basically a paragon
The dream has been fulfilled this is literally basically tier 6 and man I love it.
    This is 5-5-5, I think.
        so… tier 15
            Tier 5^3
                so… tier 125
                    [deleted]
                        Idc, I would love the ability to get more than 1 crosspath for exchange of not a t5.
                            I vote for Tier 5 by 5 by 5

                                    yeah i saw it for a little bit then he deleted it i think he did say smth like that
                    No, it’s 53. He just has bad handwriting.
            YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

DO NOT DO TIER 15.
        So kinda like vengeful sun god?
            I think so.
        The picture kind of indicated that it will be more unique than just 5-5-5 imo.
            5-5-5 in the same way the Vengeful Temple is.
        \-5
Everyone's going on about spactories and snipers, while I'm over here picturing a 5-5-5 dartling gunner spewing out an infinite beam of buckshot-spread MAD missles
    With auto targeting
        *Six-barreled independent* auto targeting.
    Just the BEZ but with 2 cannons being lasers and 2 being MAD missiles. Yes please.

            The god is unbound
            vengeful true sun god is basically already 5-5-5
                It's more like a 6xx Super Monkey. It doesn't have the abilities of the Anti-Bloon or Legend of the Night, it's just a stronger True Sun God.
            I think vengeful temple will be renamed to the super monkey paragon
            I feel like that's too much? VTSG essentially already *is* a paragon.
                _We’re reaching levels of paragon that shouldn’t even be possible!_
            super monkey paragon is just a vengeful sun god. that literally already exists.

what do those symbols around it say? wasn't there some sort of code used for update teasers?
    Yes this is the same code. The letters say "PARAGON"
        ah ok that's what i thought based on the amount of letter
    It means "Paragon"
BOOMERANG PARAGON.       Edit: this comment aged well
"with the dart monkey being the first", will they be split between multiple updates or is this just because they showed us the para-dart first ?
    Probably split between mini updates not whole ones
    I’ve heard some people think they will do what they do with special trophy store items. They are included in the same update, but they still don’t show up or are accessible until a certain date. Maybe they will release one a week.
        Probably not once a week. These towers must take way longer than once a week to program and such, so the only way to do a weekly release would be to have them all done already, but if they had them all done then they'd just release all of them at once
            Why would they just release them all at once if they had them all done? It would bring in so much more hype and excitement by slowly releasing them. Just take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows, even though they are completed they slowly release them and just by looking at the fan reaction you can tell it brings more hype.
                >take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows

That's just how shows work. Adding only 1 merge tower is like releasing a new hero, but only the first level, and adding the other 19 later. It just feels like you're releasing an unfinished update.    
As for hype, I'd be a lot more excited to get back into btd6 if I knew a bunch of new upgrades were added, whereas if only one upgrade is added at a time it would be much less exciting.
    Maybe they’ll do it by category? Start with primary towers and move on to military, magic, and support later?
Tier 6 sniper monkey on it's way to remove moabs from the game

                    Maybe on a very long map like logs but probably not
        Don’t worry, you forgot about snipers firing range pal, big brother dartling gun
            Laser of hurt
    Not just moabs, literally everything
That is like a mass buff for every tower. I can’t think of a single 5-5-5 tower that won’t be good. I’m just imagining a 5-5-5 tac. Super mael-ring-zone. Props to the team that is making these towers.
    > I can’t think of a single 5-5-5 tower that won’t be good. 

5/5/5 alchemist doesn't sound very impressive because the paths doesn't synergize well (at least in comparison to the other 5/5/5 towers).
        5x5 would be good. I’m not exactly sure how the middle path works, so if this is wrong, correct me, but if you used a bunch of middle path 4th tiers, it would be good with 5-5-5
        Concoction could buff all towers in range of the explosion and cover all bloons hit by it in gold, perhaps.
    I’m trying to think of the more niche towers during this. Like what would a 5-5-5 ice monkey be like and how would it work
        Probably shoots the Icicle Impale bullets that also create a short "snowstorm" near the point of impact. Basically a giant icy explosion that slows bloons in the area for a short while after exploding.
So, is 5-5-5 Super gonna be a thing or is that technically already covered by VTSG?
    My guess is that VTSG will be the paragon, but it depends on how they are implemented.
    I think it'll get a rework, right now it is just a stronger top path, not really a culmination of all three.
I want banana farm paragon because why not
    Would it just be the Trump tower? Lol

Ahhhhhh tewtiy has now been shot down of one video idea.
    But think of all the paragon testing videos
        Indeed. Nice point. A video for every tower is like what? 15 videos?
            Yep. Plus he gets to redo all towers he’s done so far
                yup

then compare them.

then make a hype vid
            21 new videos I believe
                that could get him like a million subs. dont believe me? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

thats a channel that achieved it
                    <3 you XD
    Why do I feel like nk are getting their ideas from isab and tewity /j
        This is the first update ive felt it for.
Let's all agree that we never new that they where going to add a 6 tier tower
    Its super hype though
so we're getting 5-5-5 towers. Neat.

(Also I think that means that super monkey won't be getting a paragon, cause from what I've heard the projectiles from the VTSG are called "5-5-5" projectiles)
    I imagine vengeful TSG will be reworked into the paragon. There’s no way super monkey won’t get one.
        I don’t even think it’ll be reworked, just renamed. Because I don’t think there would be anything stronger then VTSG, paragons included.
            I could see minor changes to include a bit more of the flavour of the other two t5s. Maybe just an ability to teleport the temple that destroys all bloons near the old location, and a change to how it's created.
            It will have to be reworked because the paragons are definitely not going to have the same methods of obtaining them as the vtsg. The only way it won’t be reworked is if all paragons are obtained in different ways.
    Hello Judas The Binding of Isaac
Also I'm so confused what is VTSG
    It means [Vengeful True Sun God](https://bloons.fandom.com/wiki/Vengeful_True_Sun_God)
        Ok thanks
I was so hyped to see what the towers could do so I went in to sandbox and now I'm sitting here with 3 tier 5 boomerang monkeys and searching for how to merge them
    You can't merge in Sandbox unfortunately
        why can't we have this power in sandbox? WHY?
            Challenge editor however is fiar game
    you can't do it in sandbox
    How do you do it?
        Ok first you gotta have 500,000 dart monkey XP, and buy the upgrade. Next you gotta hop into an easy game and cash farm the shit outta it. Next you get all 3 tier 5 dart monkeys. Then once you save up enough you can buy the paragon upgrade from any of them. Keep in mind it will sacrifice all dart monkeys on the stage and determined by the total value of the sacrificed monkeys (other than the 3 tier 5s), as well as their pop count, the paragon will gain levels, from 1 to 100. Hope this helps.
    do you have the t6 unlocked?
O S H I T
We asked for Bloon Chipper. We got Bloon Demolisher. I guess that works.
    Fuck Bloonchipper! No one wants Bloonchipper! They won't be adding Bloonchipper! No!
As someone who loves to spam crossbow monkeys... **YES.**
    Wait, so is it going to be a crossbow shooting 3 ultra juggernaut balls that can crit? 👁👃👁
        No, it's obviously going to be a catapult that fires spiked balls that explode into crossbows wielded by plasma super monkeys.
    I agree, but the crossbow master art is cooler, IMO.

Nobody is asking the important questions, what is the release date, NK?
Now we need a wizard paragon
I can't wait to crash the monkey economy with a 5-5-5 banana farm
    Money printer go brrrr
    It'll be interesting to see how that works. I mean at that point it's just generating money 3 different ways. Unless they combine their money generating together and pump a massive amount into a bank every round with a huge capacity
        Maybe we can bribe the Bloons to skip rounds? Capitalism baby.
How busted would the spactory paragon be?
    And sniper paragon.
    Carpet of Perma-Supermines. That sounds busted to me.
    Imagine alchemist paragon
        Nah , its paths don't synergize that well
why do I have a feeling the Paragon Sniper Monkey is going to be dual-wielding Assault Rifles on full-auto?
Poor spike ball monkey, your design will be in vain
I want to know how to merge them now that they are out but all the Internet says is "the new paragon tier is a new tier of monkey made by being merged" but I don't know HOW to merge them
    You can't merge them on sandbox, you need to do it in game, trust me I've tried
        How though
            upgrade 3 monkeys into tier 5 of all 3 paths and you will see that there is an extra path to upgrade
                Oooohhh ill try to get that then thx your the only one that actually told me HOW to do it
    same
“I am now Sans Undertale go into my eyes”
So a VTSG for every tower type?
    I may misunderstand, but a VTSG combines several different types of towers, whereas this update only allows intra-tower combinations? Like a VTSG combines military, magic, primary, and support (not tier 5's necessarily, but amounts invested into towers), while this update allows a 5xx, x5x, and xx5 dart to combine into a paragon representation of that tower?
        I think they mean that every tower has a VTSG-like upgrade, with you putting all tier 5s of a monkey into one super-powerful tower.
        Remember how the difference between TSG and VTSG is that you have to include x/5/x and x/x/5 Super Monkey...
            yeah, that's right.
        TSG already combines primary, military, magic, and support. VTSG is the step beyond that combines all the paths of the Super Monkey when each T5 is in play. That's the similarity to these paragons.
Why’d you pin this again? Is the update not coming out today?
    Probably just to show us who haven’t seen the leak.
        It was pinned for a whole week.
            The message I remember being pinned was the 'teaser' one, not the actual reveal
                Nah, this one was pinned for a couple of days too.
                    It's been pinned 2 days at this point

            4 2-0-0 banana farms then sell once you can afford 2 merchantmen. Then spam favored trades and sell everything at round 60. So not quite round 50 but pretty close
It's all coming together. I was concerned when they started hinting at standardized levels past 100 thinking maps were going to have an additional difficulty setting that'd make the Impoppable/CHIMPS grind feel like a medium difficulty game comparatively. It makes sense when adjusting the difficulty with new high-end towers though.  

I bet they'll come out with other difficulties and game modes to supplement this, since they'd be unaffordable in a normal game. Most likely a new difficulty that starts at a very high level already, similar to deflation.
    
>I bet they'll come out with other difficulties and game modes to supplement this, since they'd be unaffordable in a normal game.

I bet you're right, but in any non-chimps mode you can greed pretty hard and be set up quite nicely for Round 100+
        Yeah you can vengeful before round 100 on easier maps and difficulties by greeding with middle path druid
This post got pinned so the update is really close
    FINALLY
    I think it means the opposite. They’d unpin the post if the update were close.
Anyone know when the update is supposed to drop?
    NK always drops updates either the day of the new race or when the race is over, so at soonest tomorrow, Wednesday/Thursday next week, so on. They generally reveal things a week or 2 before release though
        Not always after a race, but usually. My guess is update tomorrow.
Bloons might as well give up
Sentry paragon: "am I a joke to you?"
What the fuck
    -literally everyone's reaction right now summed up perfectly
Sans dart 😳
I want 5-5-5 Heli Pilot. It can push back bloons and moabs. Shred everything, Has a few additional support Heli's. Maybe an improved gunner?!
    The apache with 3 smaller apaches would kick so much ass
        What about a spike factory (a carpet of exploding spikes that are permenant)
So, Plasma Juggernaut Crossbow? I’m down.

Tack shooter next please, I want to see a fiery blade malestrom of doom
    Wait, does that mean it’s a crossbow firing 3 ultra juggernaut balls that can crit? Sign me the fuck up.
        And it can turn those projectiles to plasma and increase its attack speed
Everyone: Ho boy this sounds cool and I can't wait for the 555 Sniper and the 555...

Me: Wait, what threat could possibly require a 555 unit to be places unless... \*Looks at Round 140+\*
    Boss Bloons? We don't know it might happen soon
        This comment aged well.
            It aged so very well
P3s when bananagon gets released: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Imagine plane if it was a 5-5-5
    Pretty op but not too balanced, so there would have to be extreme changes to many, MANY towers to make it more balanced
        It would be powerful no doubt, but I'd imagine it would be unbelievably expensive
I imagine that VTSG will be retconned into being a Paragon.
    Nah, you'll just be able to make a Paragon out of a VTSG + Anti-Bloon + LotN
    VTSG is a non-official name. It was named that by the community. NK actually calls it differently.
    [deleted]
SUPER MONKEY PARAGON WOULD BE SOOOOO OP!
    VTSG is almost a paragon
        Imagine having to sacrifice a VTSG
>"dart monkey being the first"

Vengeful:
Late game is unfortunately, not very mobile friendly. Hopefully these Paragons will be reasonably obtainable because it’d be a shame if I could only use these for a few rounds before the game starts crashing.
    Hopefully they add super MOABS for like round 200+ 

I mean by that point stuff either deals good moab damage or is insignificant.
        they have. fortified speedy B. A. D.'s
        So a MOAB variant of super ceramics? Interesting idea; it may just work out as a small solution but it might require some balancing to make up for the fact that they don’t have anymore ceramics that other towers may target. Especially if they excel in damaging MOAB class Bloons but have poor ceramic cleanup, such as M.A.D or MOAB Dom.
    Depends how old or budget your phone is, I guess. Anything with at least 4gb of ram should do fine for some TIME. My last phone had 3gb off ram and was fine up to well over round 100
        I’ve got 4 GB RAM, but like one of the other users said, the experience isn’t the best because the phone gets heated and it becomes really laggy getting into late game. I’ve actually made it to Round 400 but not without crashing at least once every round and after doing some tower optimization. My phone holds up okay when going through the predetermined rounds but anything after is a lagfest. Maybe at some point I’ll have Bloons on better hardware but mobile is just way too convenient for me at the moment.
Uuuh, actually Paragon Sentry Engineer Monkey was the first!
    uhhh, actually Vengeful True Sun God (or whatever the official name is) was the first
5-5-5 wizard  


  
return of the king
Doesn't the super monkey already have this? Or is the dark temple its own thing?
    It's its own thing with a monkey knowledge upgrade
Sentry Paragon paragon
It took me longer to translate the hieroglyphs than it should've but it just says paragon.
I just would like to say thanks to all those who made up memes showing combined monkeys. I wonder if they gave  NK the idea for this.
I had a nightmare. What if the update will bring Monkey Academy and its middle path will be creating paragons from monkeys on the map?
    New Support tower? Seems more like a dream to me
        It was leaked back when the game was first released, but recently in a blog NK staff said that they have different plans for it. So it's coming (and yeah, it's support type), but the question is when.
f\*\*\* holy sh\*t i really really really really really really really need to see tack shooter paragon i really hope its cool
***I AM NOW SANS UNDERTALE, GO INTO MY EYE***
when is monkeyopolis gonna make an article on this? Lol
    I'm so exited for that one !
What the fuck would a 5-5-5 Monkey village do
    Infinite primary monkey buffs
Who wanna see a paragon super soloing round 500
    you mean the Vengeful True Sun God?
        You would need max god boosted sun VTSG
Yo and nobody's even mentioned the ice, mortar, or buccaneer. Y'all sleeping on those.

(Fr, the MOAB damage dealt by burny stuff big one is already nuts. Plus Blooncin? Plus arty battery? Shit's gonna be *wild*.)
    Can’t forget glue gunner. With bloon solver and superglue, you can destroy anything below a BAD. Then on top of that, you have an ability to cover the entire map in glue that fully stops everything that isn’t a BAD. 

Now that I think about it, it’s not really gonna be good against the BAD.

But it still sounds badass
    Pop and Awe for that one is gonna be absolutly insane
Finally, a use for x5x dart!
basically you will never have enough gold in chimp for paragon,
Either this is going to be nefred SO FAST or it'll cost more than 10 TSGs combined. Also how will vengeful temples work with this?
    Vengeful temple wont work with this
        Imagine a VTSMPG though, that acronym is scary...
        You would just have to keep the cost of the monkey god below 100k in every category, this way it would work
Now i wonder how that works out.
 Time to merge 3 crossbow masters in coop to create the ultimate overrated paragon
    “Tower unlocked: Triple overrated dart monkey”
i ADORE this idea. It will probably be 1 paragon if i were to guess and personally im excited to see how this is balanced.
Paraglue Gang
    Super high damage, attack speed, bloons are immobilized on hit, AND can apply this to the whole screen for a limited time with the ability

Thinking about these is way too much fun
What of Engineer's Sentry Paragon, though?
Imagine the speed of a crossbow master, with the pierce and bounce of an ultra juggernaut, with the triple projectiles and ability to turn nearby dart monkies into vengeful sun avatars.
In the pipe, 5 by 5 (by 5)
Can’t wait for the Cargo Pirate Aircraft Carrier
banana farm paragon hype
    Wait, auto collecting free 10k? With crates in a bank???
*Space invaders by teminite and mdk intensifies*
So we got a fast shooting-triple-high pierce-projectile splitting monkey that can transform into an even faster shooting laser projectile monkey. Interesting
wait what happens if u mix engi it already has sentry paragon
Its beautiful! Its a walking mecha crossbow!
The eyes... sans monkey confirmed?!?!?!
5-5-5 towers. Sweet.
this is how you make players stay in the game!!
wouldn't the first be TVSG
Y'all talking about tacks, spactories, and sniper, but I can think of a few more broken towers.

* Mortar. Blooncin plus Biggest One with the fire rate of an artillery battery.
* Ninja. Grandmaster with bombs, distraction, self-Tactics, caltrops, seeking, and sabo. One-monkey all-purpose engine of doom.
* Glue. Solver but it slows MOABs and can hose the entire board.
* Helicopter. Apache Prime with downdraft, MOAB Shove, and mini helis? Move over, Etienne.
* Bomb. Recursive stunning MOAB Assassins. Boy howdy.
How would you even get them before freeplay? Is there going to be a new 200-round mode?
    NK has actually been working on making the late game more interesting, they've made rounds 101-140 predetermined instead of how Freeplay rounds are just randomized (basically, on every map r1-140 are the same but afterwards they're randomly generated)
It’s only been a year?
    no
sentry paragon was already added to the game before dart paragon tho…




sarcasm if you couldn’t tell
Ok so from what I can tell this gonna kinda break super late game. So just a guess here, they are adding these to balance boss Bloons they plan on adding.
    I mean they added so many rounds that only apply in free play , so they might add another game mode that lasts till forever
Hot hot hot
Love it
Helllll yeah! Mystery over
W H A T
Ace will be busted
Does anyone know how to translate those glyphs in the back

I think there were similar ones on adora’s temple, geared, and a teaser
    According to other people, it says "Paragon"
        The consistency checks out
Well the engineer won’t get it he already has one
Farm: moni
Spike Factory Paragons, hell yeah
I wonder what will happen to tewtiy teir 6 series lol
I remember seeing a post for the guy who predicted this, I'd like to give him a round of applause
tewity gonna have an advantage with all the t5 tower merging mods he's done
Imagine a 5-5-5 darling gunner

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We are reaching levels of blood popping that shouldn't be possible
Knew it, all 3 teir fives combined
I haven’t seen any comments talking about the insane synergy of towers besides spacctory and sniper. How about mortar and ace? Or perhaps the strongest merge, besides VTSG, dartling gunner
huhn?
Looks like a mage engineer that’s using a hose to drink his bananas while he pops bloons.
This is the best update yet! Was kinda hoping they would do something like this ever since I got this game on July 2018.
everybody gangsta til permaspike is better than spactory paragon
The first paragon is the vengeful temple
imagine a wizard monkey paragon for a sec.
This guy be looking like he praises the Omnissiah if you know what i mean.
Neva miss targetting on sky shredder lol
Imagine spike factory...
    Sure they’ll balance all of them, but yeah…
Idk how they’re going to do that.
does this mean the VTSG will get reworked?
    I hope so
Perma spiked mine storm 😥
Imagine sun god with darkshift
Towers I'm looking forward to:  
1) 555 sniper: I think each of the sniper tier5s complement each other really well, and given it's tier5s are cheap. Could be usable in more scenarios.  
2) 555 ice:  a tower that debuffs, slows, and damages at same time. I'm curious what NK will come up with  
3) 555 glue: 50dmg per tick with tick speed of 5xx glue, with a clickable power of x5x to do it over entire map, could be carnage.  
4) 555 druid: basically a whole of map damage aura that does significant dmg to all bloon types incl moabs. Looking forward to it.  
5) 555 spike factory: a 5xx spike ball that's distributed over entire map every so often that then hangs over multiple rounds. gimme gimme

I look forward to end product.

I'm curious about limits NK may use. I think some limits could be:

1. Max of one paragon per game (hope not)
2. Maybe timed allowance, like first week of the month you're allowed dartling paragon, second week, you're allowed tack paragons, etc... Again I hope this isn't the case.
3. you need to place each tier 5 first, then game prompts if you wish to combine for paragon, and then there's an extra cost
4. You need to have some experience already in the game. Like your account needs to be level 100. Or you're only allowed paragons after level 100 on a map. I can't imagine these towers being available to people who just purchased the game.
    I could never see #2 happening as that is extremely limiting and NK normally does not limit players to that degree. 


I could easily see #1 and #3 happen, #3 more-so than #1. 


And along the lines of #4 I could see instead of it being the account level maybe a sizable amount of tower xp like all other tower upgrades.
does anyone know roughly when this would come out
Bet you need a monkey knowledge to make paragon towers
    Aww I hope not
    What-would you need an Mk point for every monkey? 22+? No, i don’t think so
        Maybe an mk for each type of tower? Being military, magic, support, ect
            If anything, I think there would just be one node to unlock all paragons
Oooh... can't wait to test this merge tower!
This is cool but is it just a vengeful sun god for a dart monke?
    for all towers, although dart monkey is the first.
Wait is this like vengeful sung god?!?
Yooooo pog
oh boy
can't wait for tack shooter
Unlimited power
So it was a T6, or what basically is a T6
Definitely excited for the carpet of perma-supermines.
Ah yes, the great monkey triumvirate.
False. The Dart Monkey is not the first paragon. The Vengeful Temple is.
How would the dart monkey one work with double cross? Would only of them be merged or would both be taken?
    One of the m owuld be merged due to the fact that you need the other Tier 5s in order to merge into a 5-5-5 tower
i cant wait to see what these do
Question, is this chimps viable? Possibly cuz I think they are extending the rounds
super monkey paragon gonna be literal god
HOLY SHIT I THINK MY THOUGHT MY RIGHT CAUSE I SAID SOME LIKE THAT HOLY FUCKING SHIT HELL TEA BITCHES
You mean a vengeful tower?
I’m… so… fucking… HAPPY
Yeah, as expected.
5-5-5 ace...
Holy shit I guessed correctly
Oh wow.
holy shit the only think more powerful then a t6 is a 555 and this is that
Sentry Paragon Paragon??
OMG ITS HAPPENING, 555 CARPET OF PERMANENT SUPER MINES
This just in: Bloons Tower Defense 7 will take place in Monkey Venezuela because someone used too many 5-5-5 Banana Farms
5-5-5 is happening. We meme about this shit all the time, but it's real now.
So will Ninja Kiwi be dropping like 1-3 Paragons every update? Or are they going to drop them all at once?
    I’m assuming like a few every update since balancing the game would be trickier all at once
Perma-mine-carpet
This will bring meny casual players back I'd imagine.
    Also that paragon looks like a time lord
Finally! My 1,000,000 Experience points on dart monkey will pay off!
thats probably why they extended freeplay to 140 instead of 120
Can't wait for Super Monkey Paragon!!
I fricking called called they added merging into mechs reading the blog is fricking great
ok
Will this work by getting each different tier 5 path sperately in one game and the merging is free. Or will there be a cost. Also you could incorporate the leaked monkey academy tower. In which you get that to Tier 5 and it allows you to combine your monkes into paragons.
Holy fuck I actually got the prediction I literally posted a question about BTD6 merging on last week's blog
Do you remember the fact that you can merge monkeys in bloons pop ?! It was a hint !!
Wait, we already have vengeful sun god, he basicaly Is a paragon
I wonder how it will work. I suppose first make all 5th tier towers, then "merge them" together like a sacrifice by choosing the one you want to be the paragon. I'm mostly curious if we will be able to build again the 5th tiers or if it's something like VSG where "there can only be one". If it's the latter, depending on the map you can maybe legitimately argue if it's better to have one 6th tier or three 5th tiers due to positioning.

Since we start with the dart monkey, I'm wondering how the "two crossbow masters" MK will work (that is, if it works like VSG).
I wonder if these will be added in Battles 2 as well.
So, the Paragon Dart fires three Ultra-Juggernaut Ball at the Speed of a crossbow Master, and can make other monkeys fire Plasma thanks to PMFC?
This fanmade looks amazing!





Wait...
Ya’ll are forgetting the first paragon, it’s the Vengeful True Sun God
Hold up: Vengeful god is basically a super monkey paragon
dart: is the first 555 tower,  


VTSG: am i a joke to you
There’s is a sentry paragon
I bet youll only be allowed a single Paragon in a game and that itll be hella expensive
I feel like harder modes are coming to accommodate these upgrades as well? Like, unpoppable to round 120 or 140 and a CHIMPS version? And a new border to go along with the harder modes, diamond for instance.
Fuck me right in the ass. I love it!!
    \*Unzips pants\* o-... ok.
technically the dark sun god was first
NOW WE DON’T NEED MODS!
Do the symbols behind the monkey spell "paragon?"
NONONO NOT NOW IT'S HAPPENING AGAI-

happened to already make a comment on a post 7 days ago

https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/ocr4r7/tier\_list\_based\_on\_how\_big\_would\_be\_the\_synergies/h3wk5p9/?context=3
they're probably going to just be the ultimate version of the monkey rather than a combination
it appears to be a ballista- a siege weapon firing large bolts, so that's 1st and 3rd paths, and appears to be firing some sort of plasma, so that's 2nd path. it's ability would probably turn nearby dm's into crossbow monkeys firing plasma bolts.
*2nd*
Sniper finna be op
Vengeful Sun God now is not the only 5-5-5 tower
*so the vengeful temple but they aren’t vengeful?*
So... does this mean that dark temple is one of these Paragons, or is super monkey going to get an entirely new combination of all three that'll cost an ungodly amount of money?
technically the vengeful son god was the first
There was a dude who said it's impossible to be a tier 6 and it's from their new game. Where are you now?
    This isn’t a tier 6. It’s 5/5/5.
YES

I KNEW IT

I WAS RIGHT
What are paragons exactly
    Combination of all tier five paths of that monkey. As the dictionary reads, “a person or thing regarded as a perfect example of a particular quality” So basically, the most powerful, best form you can get of that tower.
        Yo that sounds insane thanks
OH MY GOODNESS I CANT BELIEVE IT I CANT BELIEVE IT I CANT BELIEVE IT I CANT BELIEVE NO WAY NO WAY NO WAY I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT ITS A DREAM COME TRUE FINALLY YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!
Aint the vengeful temple the first paragon? So technically the Dart Monke is the 2nd
    It is technically not a paragon
        In the files. Vengeful Temple is called 5-5-5 True Sun God
Ah yes, finally a actual use for the 2 nearly useless dart paths
The useless ones are the ultra jug and PMFC
    Tell that to every single person in coop 😂
This is kinda lame ngl. Too many mods do the same idea, and it's gonna be way to unlikely to ever get. I'm grateful NK supports the game the way they do so this will be like one of the only times I complain but I just wish it was something that changes the game more like the boss fights from monkey city or something, basically a separate mode.
everyone who said they’re not doing tier 6 is eating their words right now lmao, but seriously i’m hella excited that thing looks fucking amazing
Paragons????!
What paragon is this supposed to be? It doesn’t look like the dart monkey
    There’s a **crossbow** machine that he’s standing on, with **plasma** coming out of it, and will most likely shoot plasma **juggernauts.**
I'm guessing you have to get at least one of the paths to tier 5 before unlocking the path that normally gets blocked off again. Certain towers would make early game kind of broken with all 3 paths available simultaneously.
no it's a contact fusion
    Ah, so we should use Neo Space so it doesn't get sent back to the deck
        Gladiator beast varient
            So they'll leave field and we'll need special summon other monkeys from our deck?
Guys it's Xyzs.  Black background.  Also it's probs gonna have an ability we can only use 3 times.

Unless we sacrifice more tier 5 monkeys after summoning?🤔🤯
1. I love everyone in this thread. 
2. If it was an archetype made today it would have it's own archetypal fusion card called Monkey Fusion. Which would probably go something like this: 
Special summon one "Monkey" fusion card from your extra deck by sending cards you control or from your hand to the graveyard. If you control the face up Field Spell Card "Monkey Sandbox" you can send cards from your deck instead. If this card is in your graveyard, you can shuffle it back into the deck and draw 1 card.

Great now I want to make Dart monkey themed custom YuGiOh cards.
    No it would just fusion summon two field spells from two completely unrelated archetypes
    Just do, for example on the Dark Souls 1 sub someone posts dark souls stuff as Magic: The Gathering cards
I would just use Future Fusion or Magical Scientist tbh
    Isn’t magical scientist banned?
        Extremely
Uhh yes we do

#ENGINEER GAMING
I don't think the money checks out for normal CHIMPS. Even if you could afford it, that would mean basically no support.
    That's great actually because beating CHIMPS while getting one of them will make for great new challenges
    Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. If not, there are a number of towers that you can get all T5's for in Chimps.

And support won't be that expensive for such a powerful tower as a T6. It's ~$4000 for a camo village + a hero, or ~$12000 with an MIB. That still leaves ~$120,000 before round 90.
        NGL any tier 6 that needs an MIB isn't gonna be worth using imo
            The vengeful temple needs MIB tho
                No it doesn't lol, it just needs radar village for camos. It can pop any bloon type
        > Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. 

It would probably have to cost something for balance, a cost that varies between towers. Consider the sniper, it's cheaper than some other paragons (if the merging doesn't cost anything) while at the same time being incredibly strong because of how well all three paths synergize with each other.
    It will be affordable for Sniper pretty easily.
        Oh my good a bouncing, stunning Elite Defender. Holy fucking shit.
            Which would also deal 80 (!!!) damage per shot, shrapnel damage 12. Holy shit indeed
                No way in hell would they allow that
                    A full-auto sniper that can stun moabs, yeah they are not going to allow it
                        Not unless it’s as expensive as a vengeful temple
                        maybe the paragons will have a unique effect
                            Yeah, I feel like this is what will happen. It's just fun to imagine the concept of a full auto Cripple MOAB with shrapnel lol
                        Good point on limits. They could limit one paragon per game. Like you're allowed a 5-5-5 sniper, but then you can't buy a 5-5-5 dartling. They could do something like you need to buy each tier 5, and then the game asks do you wish to create paragon, and then asks for heap'o'money. So they basically become late game towers.
                    Even a 504 sniper would be completely OP, there’s no way they will have a 555 sniper
                        Bouncing bullets would be fucked with maim Moab or even elite defender maximum damage and stun
        Axis of Havoc moment
        Sniper would be op with his speed from elite diffender and atrack from from 1 an 2 path
        im going to assume there would be a very high cost to combine the 3
    Tack shooter could work, though!
    Depends if their extending rounds past 100 is for a new, harder, longer mode or not.
        Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder
            > Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder

that was because of the early game
            I would really enjoy a harder mode to play on easier maps.
            It’s not like it was hard past that relative to some of the other Expert maps. Some people went in challenge editor for one extra life and beat it.
            That was toxic earlygame though, the endgame has gotten way too easy these days. So many towers that can basically solo 90-99 with basic support.
    There's literally an achievement for getting all T5 Snipers in CHIMPS, so definitely possible for some towers.
Something cheap like sniper maybe
    Paragon sniper would also be op as crud
yeah, probably wouldn't work money-wise, plus, the fact that Ninja Kiwi's showing these things as cards makes me think that paragons would fail the Monkey Knowledge or Powers part of CHI**MP**S. But I was very, very wrong about what this update would be, so take my logic with several big grains of salt!
I feel like it’s be too expensive for it to be viable
Am I the only one who's really skeptical of this?

CHIMPS is already way too long as far as game modes go. The final levels are suitably climactic but they take way too much time to add more of the same. Adding some sort of super late game content to CHIMPS meant to be handled with merged T5's sounds awful, honestly. A super late game deflation might be okay.

I'm also really concerned about balance. The current system is quite deep and polished and got that way after loads of careful tweaks. Now they need to suddenly balance an entire extra tier on each tower? That's the sort of thing you save for a new version, screw up for a few months, and slowly fix in a series of patches.

On the other hand I expect a change like this will result in a lot of new creative challenge maps taking advantage of new mechanics. That sounds fun.
I feel like it would be monkey knowledge
    But that would be 22 more monkey knowledge points which would take literal DAYS to get.
I feel like it would be monkey knowledge
Well, they've standardized 101-140. 163 has always been standardized, so has 263. Maybe we're finally getting CHAMPIONS or something equivalent?

Also, VTSG requires Monkey Knowledge, and that's basically a Paragon already (minus the Black Hole, Dark Shift, and Bloon Annihalation), so maybe it'll be a Monkey Knowledge thing, preventing it from even being used in CHIMPS.
Even the BAD falls before the power of capitalism!
Bribe the bloons into instantly ending the game
Or play again for money abilities to go brrrr
    Repeat 49 for stonks
Well that begs the question of what could be introduced that would be harder than CHIMPS
    Maybe mastery mode?
        Oh god mastery mode would be brutal
        [deleted]
            The thing with mastery mode in btd5 though was the fact that you got less money. I don't remember exactly how it worked but I do know the money didn't equal the bloons RBE (pretty sure a yeloow bloon would only give you 2 cash instead of 4). I don't think it'd be out of the blue for them to do the same thing in this game.
                [deleted]
                    it gave quite a bit less than half iirc
            In Mastery, you get half cash per pop, and the first 0.5x cash reduction happens at round 31 instead of 51, meaning you get 25% of the cash per pop that you would get in a normal game from round 31 to round 50. If they wanted to maintain the reduced cash flow all the way throughout, they could push the other cash reduction points further back as well.

You would have to choose a tower to get all tier 5s of but you can only use 3 and only that tower. You are forced to get a paragon to weaken a Boss Bloon at the last round (round 120). Also True C.H.I.M.P.S rules are applied.
    Chimps halfcash appopalipse double hp moabs impopable combined lol
        And support towers only
I’m assuming the temple will be considered a paragon because of the sheer strength it has and I cannot imagine an even powerful version
    I instantly assumed that it would look similar to the TOTVM, which could mean that it's non-CHIMPS.
        Would you need knowledge to merge them, ya think?
            There definitely won't be a knowledge for each tower, wouldn't be surprised if there was one knowledge per tower category though.

I'd rather see them use tower xp to unlock individually.
                You think they'd put the knowledge at the end of the tree, like a connector for every branch? Or around where the VTSG knowledge is? Honestly, I think they're not going to need knowledge, or if they do, it'll be an early one; it'd be weird if they gated this big, hyped thing behind a lot of MK!
                That'd be a use for all the extra tower xp I have.
            I'm gonna guess that they're swapping out the vengeful knowledge for paragon knowledge
    That and it already takes three T5 Super Monkey towers to craft. They can't make something that's TSG+Anti+LotN when they already HAVE a tower that's TSG+Anti+LotN.
I mean vengeful temple is already basically a paragon
This is 5-5-5, I think.
    so… tier 15
        Tier 5^3
            so… tier 125

                No, it’s 53. He just has bad handwriting.
        YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

DO NOT DO TIER 15.
    So kinda like vengeful sun god?
        I think so.
    The picture kind of indicated that it will be more unique than just 5-5-5 imo.
        5-5-5 in the same way the Vengeful Temple is.

        vengeful true sun god is basically already 5-5-5
            It's more like a 6xx Super Monkey. It doesn't have the abilities of the Anti-Bloon or Legend of the Night, it's just a stronger True Sun God.
        I think vengeful temple will be renamed to the super monkey paragon
        I feel like that's too much? VTSG essentially already *is* a paragon.
            _We’re reaching levels of paragon that shouldn’t even be possible!_
        super monkey paragon is just a vengeful sun god. that literally already exists.

It means "Paragon"
Probably split between mini updates not whole ones
I’ve heard some people think they will do what they do with special trophy store items. They are included in the same update, but they still don’t show up or are accessible until a certain date. Maybe they will release one a week.
    Probably not once a week. These towers must take way longer than once a week to program and such, so the only way to do a weekly release would be to have them all done already, but if they had them all done then they'd just release all of them at once
        Why would they just release them all at once if they had them all done? It would bring in so much more hype and excitement by slowly releasing them. Just take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows, even though they are completed they slowly release them and just by looking at the fan reaction you can tell it brings more hype.
            >take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows

That's just how shows work. Adding only 1 merge tower is like releasing a new hero, but only the first level, and adding the other 19 later. It just feels like you're releasing an unfinished update.    
As for hype, I'd be a lot more excited to get back into btd6 if I knew a bunch of new upgrades were added, whereas if only one upgrade is added at a time it would be much less exciting.
Maybe they’ll do it by category? Start with primary towers and move on to military, magic, and support later?

> I can’t think of a single 5-5-5 tower that won’t be good. 

5/5/5 alchemist doesn't sound very impressive because the paths doesn't synergize well (at least in comparison to the other 5/5/5 towers).
    5x5 would be good. I’m not exactly sure how the middle path works, so if this is wrong, correct me, but if you used a bunch of middle path 4th tiers, it would be good with 5-5-5
    Concoction could buff all towers in range of the explosion and cover all bloons hit by it in gold, perhaps.
I’m trying to think of the more niche towers during this. Like what would a 5-5-5 ice monkey be like and how would it work
    Probably shoots the Icicle Impale bullets that also create a short "snowstorm" near the point of impact. Basically a giant icy explosion that slows bloons in the area for a short while after exploding.
My guess is that VTSG will be the paragon, but it depends on how they are implemented.
I think it'll get a rework, right now it is just a stronger top path, not really a culmination of all three.
Would it just be the Trump tower? Lol
    Benjamin Tower

    Stronks
But think of all the paragon testing videos
    Indeed. Nice point. A video for every tower is like what? 15 videos?
        Yep. Plus he gets to redo all towers he’s done so far
            yup

then compare them.

then make a hype vid
        21 new videos I believe
            that could get him like a million subs. dont believe me? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

thats a channel that achieved it
                <3 you XD
Why do I feel like nk are getting their ideas from isab and tewity /j
    This is the first update ive felt it for.
Its super hype though
I imagine vengeful TSG will be reworked into the paragon. There’s no way super monkey won’t get one.
    I don’t even think it’ll be reworked, just renamed. Because I don’t think there would be anything stronger then VTSG, paragons included.
        I could see minor changes to include a bit more of the flavour of the other two t5s. Maybe just an ability to teleport the temple that destroys all bloons near the old location, and a change to how it's created.
        It will have to be reworked because the paragons are definitely not going to have the same methods of obtaining them as the vtsg. The only way it won’t be reworked is if all paragons are obtained in different ways.
Hello Judas The Binding of Isaac
It means [Vengeful True Sun God](https://bloons.fandom.com/wiki/Vengeful_True_Sun_God)
    Ok thanks
You can't merge in Sandbox unfortunately
    why can't we have this power in sandbox? WHY?
        Challenge editor however is fiar game
you can't do it in sandbox
How do you do it?
    Ok first you gotta have 500,000 dart monkey XP, and buy the upgrade. Next you gotta hop into an easy game and cash farm the shit outta it. Next you get all 3 tier 5 dart monkeys. Then once you save up enough you can buy the paragon upgrade from any of them. Keep in mind it will sacrifice all dart monkeys on the stage and determined by the total value of the sacrificed monkeys (other than the 3 tier 5s), as well as their pop count, the paragon will gain levels, from 1 to 100. Hope this helps.
do you have the t6 unlocked?
Fuck Bloonchipper! No one wants Bloonchipper! They won't be adding Bloonchipper! No!
Wait, so is it going to be a crossbow shooting 3 ultra juggernaut balls that can crit? 👁👃👁
    No, it's obviously going to be a catapult that fires spiked balls that explode into crossbows wielded by plasma super monkeys.
I agree, but the crossbow master art is cooler, IMO.
fr
Money printer go brrrr
It'll be interesting to see how that works. I mean at that point it's just generating money 3 different ways. Unless they combine their money generating together and pump a massive amount into a bank every round with a huge capacity
    Maybe we can bribe the Bloons to skip rounds? Capitalism baby.
And sniper paragon.
Carpet of Perma-Supermines. That sounds busted to me.
Imagine alchemist paragon
    Nah , its paths don't synergize that well
You can't merge them on sandbox, you need to do it in game, trust me I've tried
    How though
        upgrade 3 monkeys into tier 5 of all 3 paths and you will see that there is an extra path to upgrade
            Oooohhh ill try to get that then thx your the only one that actually told me HOW to do it
same
I may misunderstand, but a VTSG combines several different types of towers, whereas this update only allows intra-tower combinations? Like a VTSG combines military, magic, primary, and support (not tier 5's necessarily, but amounts invested into towers), while this update allows a 5xx, x5x, and xx5 dart to combine into a paragon representation of that tower?
    I think they mean that every tower has a VTSG-like upgrade, with you putting all tier 5s of a monkey into one super-powerful tower.
    Remember how the difference between TSG and VTSG is that you have to include x/5/x and x/x/5 Super Monkey...
        yeah, that's right.
    TSG already combines primary, military, magic, and support. VTSG is the step beyond that combines all the paths of the Super Monkey when each T5 is in play. That's the similarity to these paragons.
Probably just to show us who haven’t seen the leak.
    It was pinned for a whole week.
        The message I remember being pinned was the 'teaser' one, not the actual reveal
            Nah, this one was pinned for a couple of days too.
                It's been pinned 2 days at this point
            happy cake day
ammmm....no its actually chep u can farm and get it around round 50
    r/agedlikemilk
    Explain how
        4 2-0-0 banana farms then sell once you can afford 2 merchantmen. Then spam favored trades and sell everything at round 60. So not quite round 50 but pretty close

>I bet they'll come out with other difficulties and game modes to supplement this, since they'd be unaffordable in a normal game.

I bet you're right, but in any non-chimps mode you can greed pretty hard and be set up quite nicely for Round 100+
    Yeah you can vengeful before round 100 on easier maps and difficulties by greeding with middle path druid
FINALLY
I think it means the opposite. They’d unpin the post if the update were close.
NK always drops updates either the day of the new race or when the race is over, so at soonest tomorrow, Wednesday/Thursday next week, so on. They generally reveal things a week or 2 before release though
    Not always after a race, but usually. My guess is update tomorrow.
-literally everyone's reaction right now summed up perfectly
The apache with 3 smaller apaches would kick so much ass
    What about a spike factory (a carpet of exploding spikes that are permenant)
Wait, does that mean it’s a crossbow firing 3 ultra juggernaut balls that can crit? Sign me the fuck up.
    And it can turn those projectiles to plasma and increase its attack speed
Boss Bloons? We don't know it might happen soon
    This comment aged well.
        It aged so very well
Pretty op but not too balanced, so there would have to be extreme changes to many, MANY towers to make it more balanced
    It would be powerful no doubt, but I'd imagine it would be unbelievably expensive
Nah, you'll just be able to make a Paragon out of a VTSG + Anti-Bloon + LotN
VTSG is a non-official name. It was named that by the community. NK actually calls it differently.
[deleted]
VTSG is almost a paragon
    Imagine having to sacrifice a VTSG
Hopefully they add super MOABS for like round 200+ 

I mean by that point stuff either deals good moab damage or is insignificant.
    they have. fortified speedy B. A. D.'s
    So a MOAB variant of super ceramics? Interesting idea; it may just work out as a small solution but it might require some balancing to make up for the fact that they don’t have anymore ceramics that other towers may target. Especially if they excel in damaging MOAB class Bloons but have poor ceramic cleanup, such as M.A.D or MOAB Dom.
Depends how old or budget your phone is, I guess. Anything with at least 4gb of ram should do fine for some TIME. My last phone had 3gb off ram and was fine up to well over round 100
    I’ve got 4 GB RAM, but like one of the other users said, the experience isn’t the best because the phone gets heated and it becomes really laggy getting into late game. I’ve actually made it to Round 400 but not without crashing at least once every round and after doing some tower optimization. My phone holds up okay when going through the predetermined rounds but anything after is a lagfest. Maybe at some point I’ll have Bloons on better hardware but mobile is just way too convenient for me at the moment.
uhhh, actually Vengeful True Sun God (or whatever the official name is) was the first
It's its own thing with a monkey knowledge upgrade
New Support tower? Seems more like a dream to me
    It was leaked back when the game was first released, but recently in a blog NK staff said that they have different plans for it. So it's coming (and yeah, it's support type), but the question is when.
I'm so exited for that one !
Infinite primary monkey buffs
you mean the Vengeful True Sun God?
    You would need max god boosted sun VTSG
Can’t forget glue gunner. With bloon solver and superglue, you can destroy anything below a BAD. Then on top of that, you have an ability to cover the entire map in glue that fully stops everything that isn’t a BAD. 

Now that I think about it, it’s not really gonna be good against the BAD.

But it still sounds badass
Pop and Awe for that one is gonna be absolutly insane
Vengeful temple wont work with this
    Imagine a VTSMPG though, that acronym is scary...
    You would just have to keep the cost of the monkey god below 100k in every category, this way it would work
“Tower unlocked: Triple overrated dart monkey”
Super high damage, attack speed, bloons are immobilized on hit, AND can apply this to the whole screen for a limited time with the ability

Thinking about these is way too much fun
Wait, auto collecting free 10k? With crates in a bank???
NK has actually been working on making the late game more interesting, they've made rounds 101-140 predetermined instead of how Freeplay rounds are just randomized (basically, on every map r1-140 are the same but afterwards they're randomly generated)
no
I mean they added so many rounds that only apply in free play , so they might add another game mode that lasts till forever
According to other people, it says "Paragon"
    The consistency checks out
Sure they’ll balance all of them, but yeah…
Idk how they’re going to do that.
I hope so
I could never see #2 happening as that is extremely limiting and NK normally does not limit players to that degree. 


I could easily see #1 and #3 happen, #3 more-so than #1. 


And along the lines of #4 I could see instead of it being the account level maybe a sizable amount of tower xp like all other tower upgrades.
Aww I hope not
What-would you need an Mk point for every monkey? 22+? No, i don’t think so
    Maybe an mk for each type of tower? Being military, magic, support, ect
        If anything, I think there would just be one node to unlock all paragons
for all towers, although dart monkey is the first.
One of the m owuld be merged due to the fact that you need the other Tier 5s in order to merge into a 5-5-5 tower
I’m assuming like a few every update since balancing the game would be trickier all at once
Also that paragon looks like a time lord
\*Unzips pants\* o-... ok.
This isn’t a tier 6. It’s 5/5/5.
Combination of all tier five paths of that monkey. As the dictionary reads, “a person or thing regarded as a perfect example of a particular quality” So basically, the most powerful, best form you can get of that tower.
    Yo that sounds insane thanks
It is technically not a paragon
    In the files. Vengeful Temple is called 5-5-5 True Sun God
Tell that to every single person in coop 😂
There’s a **crossbow** machine that he’s standing on, with **plasma** coming out of it, and will most likely shoot plasma **juggernauts.**
Ah, so we should use Neo Space so it doesn't get sent back to the deck
    Gladiator beast varient
        So they'll leave field and we'll need special summon other monkeys from our deck?
No it would just fusion summon two field spells from two completely unrelated archetypes

That's great actually because beating CHIMPS while getting one of them will make for great new challenges
Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. If not, there are a number of towers that you can get all T5's for in Chimps.

And support won't be that expensive for such a powerful tower as a T6. It's ~$4000 for a camo village + a hero, or ~$12000 with an MIB. That still leaves ~$120,000 before round 90.
    NGL any tier 6 that needs an MIB isn't gonna be worth using imo
        The vengeful temple needs MIB tho
            No it doesn't lol, it just needs radar village for camos. It can pop any bloon type
    > Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. 

It would probably have to cost something for balance, a cost that varies between towers. Consider the sniper, it's cheaper than some other paragons (if the merging doesn't cost anything) while at the same time being incredibly strong because of how well all three paths synergize with each other.
It will be affordable for Sniper pretty easily.
    Oh my good a bouncing, stunning Elite Defender. Holy fucking shit.
        Which would also deal 80 (!!!) damage per shot, shrapnel damage 12. Holy shit indeed
            No way in hell would they allow that
                A full-auto sniper that can stun moabs, yeah they are not going to allow it
                    Not unless it’s as expensive as a vengeful temple
                    maybe the paragons will have a unique effect
                        Yeah, I feel like this is what will happen. It's just fun to imagine the concept of a full auto Cripple MOAB with shrapnel lol
                    Good point on limits. They could limit one paragon per game. Like you're allowed a 5-5-5 sniper, but then you can't buy a 5-5-5 dartling. They could do something like you need to buy each tier 5, and then the game asks do you wish to create paragon, and then asks for heap'o'money. So they basically become late game towers.
                Even a 504 sniper would be completely OP, there’s no way they will have a 555 sniper
                    Bouncing bullets would be fucked with maim Moab or even elite defender maximum damage and stun
    Axis of Havoc moment
    Sniper would be op with his speed from elite diffender and atrack from from 1 an 2 path
    im going to assume there would be a very high cost to combine the 3
Tack shooter could work, though!
Depends if their extending rounds past 100 is for a new, harder, longer mode or not.
    Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder
        > Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder

that was because of the early game
        I would really enjoy a harder mode to play on easier maps.
        It’s not like it was hard past that relative to some of the other Expert maps. Some people went in challenge editor for one extra life and beat it.
        That was toxic earlygame though, the endgame has gotten way too easy these days. So many towers that can basically solo 90-99 with basic support.
There's literally an achievement for getting all T5 Snipers in CHIMPS, so definitely possible for some towers.
Paragon sniper would also be op as crud
But that would be 22 more monkey knowledge points which would take literal DAYS to get.
Repeat 49 for stonks
Maybe mastery mode?
    Oh god mastery mode would be brutal
    [deleted]
        The thing with mastery mode in btd5 though was the fact that you got less money. I don't remember exactly how it worked but I do know the money didn't equal the bloons RBE (pretty sure a yeloow bloon would only give you 2 cash instead of 4). I don't think it'd be out of the blue for them to do the same thing in this game.
            [deleted]
                it gave quite a bit less than half iirc
        In Mastery, you get half cash per pop, and the first 0.5x cash reduction happens at round 31 instead of 51, meaning you get 25% of the cash per pop that you would get in a normal game from round 31 to round 50. If they wanted to maintain the reduced cash flow all the way throughout, they could push the other cash reduction points further back as well.
A.P.E.S
    All Primates Eat Shat
    All Pops Extra Suffering

You would have to choose a tower to get all tier 5s of but you can only use 3 and only that tower. You are forced to get a paragon to weaken a Boss Bloon at the last round (round 120). Also True C.H.I.M.P.S rules are applied.
Chimps halfcash appopalipse double hp moabs impopable combined lol
    And support towers only
I instantly assumed that it would look similar to the TOTVM, which could mean that it's non-CHIMPS.
    Would you need knowledge to merge them, ya think?
        There definitely won't be a knowledge for each tower, wouldn't be surprised if there was one knowledge per tower category though.

I'd rather see them use tower xp to unlock individually.
            You think they'd put the knowledge at the end of the tree, like a connector for every branch? Or around where the VTSG knowledge is? Honestly, I think they're not going to need knowledge, or if they do, it'll be an early one; it'd be weird if they gated this big, hyped thing behind a lot of MK!
            That'd be a use for all the extra tower xp I have.
        I'm gonna guess that they're swapping out the vengeful knowledge for paragon knowledge
That and it already takes three T5 Super Monkey towers to craft. They can't make something that's TSG+Anti+LotN when they already HAVE a tower that's TSG+Anti+LotN.
so… tier 15
    Tier 5^3

            No, it’s 53. He just has bad handwriting.
    YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

DO NOT DO TIER 15.
So kinda like vengeful sun god?
    I think so.
The picture kind of indicated that it will be more unique than just 5-5-5 imo.
    5-5-5 in the same way the Vengeful Temple is.
\-5
*Six-barreled independent* auto targeting.
OR SUPERMONKEY WHICH IS JUST A TEMPLE TELEPORTING AROUND WHILE DELETING NEARBY BLOONS
    Elite defender.

With maim moab.

And shrapnel shots.
        it can already have shrapnel, it would also have bouncing bullets
        Perma charge
With moab domination
And glaive lord for the bloons
        And money drops with elite targeting
        oh god oh fuck
    The god is unbound
    vengeful true sun god is basically already 5-5-5
        It's more like a 6xx Super Monkey. It doesn't have the abilities of the Anti-Bloon or Legend of the Night, it's just a stronger True Sun God.
    I think vengeful temple will be renamed to the super monkey paragon
    I feel like that's too much? VTSG essentially already *is* a paragon.
        _We’re reaching levels of paragon that shouldn’t even be possible!_
    super monkey paragon is just a vengeful sun god. that literally already exists.
Darling Gun: everything your finger touches **dies**
If you insist
ah ok that's what i thought based on the amount of letter
Probably not once a week. These towers must take way longer than once a week to program and such, so the only way to do a weekly release would be to have them all done already, but if they had them all done then they'd just release all of them at once
    Why would they just release them all at once if they had them all done? It would bring in so much more hype and excitement by slowly releasing them. Just take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows, even though they are completed they slowly release them and just by looking at the fan reaction you can tell it brings more hype.
        >take a look at how Disney releases their Disney+ shows

That's just how shows work. Adding only 1 merge tower is like releasing a new hero, but only the first level, and adding the other 19 later. It just feels like you're releasing an unfinished update.    
As for hype, I'd be a lot more excited to get back into btd6 if I knew a bunch of new upgrades were added, whereas if only one upgrade is added at a time it would be much less exciting.
They will care about insanely fast and high damage at infinite range
    "laughs in round 140"
        tier 6 sniper will not able to solo 140? bruhhhh
            Maybe on a very long map like logs but probably not
Don’t worry, you forgot about snipers firing range pal, big brother dartling gun
    Laser of hurt
5x5 would be good. I’m not exactly sure how the middle path works, so if this is wrong, correct me, but if you used a bunch of middle path 4th tiers, it would be good with 5-5-5
Concoction could buff all towers in range of the explosion and cover all bloons hit by it in gold, perhaps.
Probably shoots the Icicle Impale bullets that also create a short "snowstorm" near the point of impact. Basically a giant icy explosion that slows bloons in the area for a short while after exploding.
Benjamin Tower
Stronks
Indeed. Nice point. A video for every tower is like what? 15 videos?
    Yep. Plus he gets to redo all towers he’s done so far
        yup

then compare them.

then make a hype vid
    21 new videos I believe
        that could get him like a million subs. dont believe me? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

thats a channel that achieved it
            <3 you XD
This is the first update ive felt it for.
I don’t even think it’ll be reworked, just renamed. Because I don’t think there would be anything stronger then VTSG, paragons included.
    I could see minor changes to include a bit more of the flavour of the other two t5s. Maybe just an ability to teleport the temple that destroys all bloons near the old location, and a change to how it's created.
    It will have to be reworked because the paragons are definitely not going to have the same methods of obtaining them as the vtsg. The only way it won’t be reworked is if all paragons are obtained in different ways.
Ok thanks
why can't we have this power in sandbox? WHY?
    Challenge editor however is fiar game
Ok first you gotta have 500,000 dart monkey XP, and buy the upgrade. Next you gotta hop into an easy game and cash farm the shit outta it. Next you get all 3 tier 5 dart monkeys. Then once you save up enough you can buy the paragon upgrade from any of them. Keep in mind it will sacrifice all dart monkeys on the stage and determined by the total value of the sacrificed monkeys (other than the 3 tier 5s), as well as their pop count, the paragon will gain levels, from 1 to 100. Hope this helps.
No, it's obviously going to be a catapult that fires spiked balls that explode into crossbows wielded by plasma super monkeys.
Maybe we can bribe the Bloons to skip rounds? Capitalism baby.
Nah , its paths don't synergize that well
How though
    upgrade 3 monkeys into tier 5 of all 3 paths and you will see that there is an extra path to upgrade
        Oooohhh ill try to get that then thx your the only one that actually told me HOW to do it
I think they mean that every tower has a VTSG-like upgrade, with you putting all tier 5s of a monkey into one super-powerful tower.
Remember how the difference between TSG and VTSG is that you have to include x/5/x and x/x/5 Super Monkey...
    yeah, that's right.
TSG already combines primary, military, magic, and support. VTSG is the step beyond that combines all the paths of the Super Monkey when each T5 is in play. That's the similarity to these paragons.
It was pinned for a whole week.
    The message I remember being pinned was the 'teaser' one, not the actual reveal
        Nah, this one was pinned for a couple of days too.
            It's been pinned 2 days at this point
        happy cake day
r/agedlikemilk
Explain how
    4 2-0-0 banana farms then sell once you can afford 2 merchantmen. Then spam favored trades and sell everything at round 60. So not quite round 50 but pretty close
Yeah you can vengeful before round 100 on easier maps and difficulties by greeding with middle path druid
Not always after a race, but usually. My guess is update tomorrow.
What about a spike factory (a carpet of exploding spikes that are permenant)
And it can turn those projectiles to plasma and increase its attack speed
This comment aged well.
    It aged so very well
It would be powerful no doubt, but I'd imagine it would be unbelievably expensive
Imagine having to sacrifice a VTSG
they have. fortified speedy B. A. D.'s
So a MOAB variant of super ceramics? Interesting idea; it may just work out as a small solution but it might require some balancing to make up for the fact that they don’t have anymore ceramics that other towers may target. Especially if they excel in damaging MOAB class Bloons but have poor ceramic cleanup, such as M.A.D or MOAB Dom.
I’ve got 4 GB RAM, but like one of the other users said, the experience isn’t the best because the phone gets heated and it becomes really laggy getting into late game. I’ve actually made it to Round 400 but not without crashing at least once every round and after doing some tower optimization. My phone holds up okay when going through the predetermined rounds but anything after is a lagfest. Maybe at some point I’ll have Bloons on better hardware but mobile is just way too convenient for me at the moment.
It was leaked back when the game was first released, but recently in a blog NK staff said that they have different plans for it. So it's coming (and yeah, it's support type), but the question is when.
You would need max god boosted sun VTSG
Imagine a VTSMPG though, that acronym is scary...
You would just have to keep the cost of the monkey god below 100k in every category, this way it would work
The consistency checks out
Maybe an mk for each type of tower? Being military, magic, support, ect
    If anything, I think there would just be one node to unlock all paragons
Yo that sounds insane thanks
In the files. Vengeful Temple is called 5-5-5 True Sun God
Gladiator beast varient
    So they'll leave field and we'll need special summon other monkeys from our deck?

NGL any tier 6 that needs an MIB isn't gonna be worth using imo
    The vengeful temple needs MIB tho
        No it doesn't lol, it just needs radar village for camos. It can pop any bloon type
> Cost will depend on if the T6 merge costs anything. 

It would probably have to cost something for balance, a cost that varies between towers. Consider the sniper, it's cheaper than some other paragons (if the merging doesn't cost anything) while at the same time being incredibly strong because of how well all three paths synergize with each other.
Oh my good a bouncing, stunning Elite Defender. Holy fucking shit.
    Which would also deal 80 (!!!) damage per shot, shrapnel damage 12. Holy shit indeed
        No way in hell would they allow that
            A full-auto sniper that can stun moabs, yeah they are not going to allow it
                Not unless it’s as expensive as a vengeful temple
                maybe the paragons will have a unique effect
                    Yeah, I feel like this is what will happen. It's just fun to imagine the concept of a full auto Cripple MOAB with shrapnel lol
                Good point on limits. They could limit one paragon per game. Like you're allowed a 5-5-5 sniper, but then you can't buy a 5-5-5 dartling. They could do something like you need to buy each tier 5, and then the game asks do you wish to create paragon, and then asks for heap'o'money. So they basically become late game towers.
            Even a 504 sniper would be completely OP, there’s no way they will have a 555 sniper
                Bouncing bullets would be fucked with maim Moab or even elite defender maximum damage and stun
Axis of Havoc moment
Sniper would be op with his speed from elite diffender and atrack from from 1 an 2 path
im going to assume there would be a very high cost to combine the 3
Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder
    > Ravine chimps literally wasn’t even possible until they put something in the map that kills a bloon lol we don’t need anything harder

that was because of the early game
    I would really enjoy a harder mode to play on easier maps.
    It’s not like it was hard past that relative to some of the other Expert maps. Some people went in challenge editor for one extra life and beat it.
    That was toxic earlygame though, the endgame has gotten way too easy these days. So many towers that can basically solo 90-99 with basic support.
Oh god mastery mode would be brutal
[deleted]
    The thing with mastery mode in btd5 though was the fact that you got less money. I don't remember exactly how it worked but I do know the money didn't equal the bloons RBE (pretty sure a yeloow bloon would only give you 2 cash instead of 4). I don't think it'd be out of the blue for them to do the same thing in this game.
        [deleted]
            it gave quite a bit less than half iirc
    In Mastery, you get half cash per pop, and the first 0.5x cash reduction happens at round 31 instead of 51, meaning you get 25% of the cash per pop that you would get in a normal game from round 31 to round 50. If they wanted to maintain the reduced cash flow all the way throughout, they could push the other cash reduction points further back as well.
All Primates Eat Shat
All Pops Extra Suffering

You would have to choose a tower to get all tier 5s of but you can only use 3 and only that tower. You are forced to get a paragon to weaken a Boss Bloon at the last round (round 120). Also True C.H.I.M.P.S rules are applied.
And support towers only
Would you need knowledge to merge them, ya think?
    There definitely won't be a knowledge for each tower, wouldn't be surprised if there was one knowledge per tower category though.

I'd rather see them use tower xp to unlock individually.
        You think they'd put the knowledge at the end of the tree, like a connector for every branch? Or around where the VTSG knowledge is? Honestly, I think they're not going to need knowledge, or if they do, it'll be an early one; it'd be weird if they gated this big, hyped thing behind a lot of MK!
        That'd be a use for all the extra tower xp I have.
    I'm gonna guess that they're swapping out the vengeful knowledge for paragon knowledge
