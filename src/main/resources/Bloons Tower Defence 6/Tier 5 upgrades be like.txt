            Bloons a problem? Here's the solution
                The Bloons will wish they had never come.
                    For when you’re too big to fail...
                        Tremble before the AWESOME power of the TRUE Sun God!!
                            The Apache Prime leaves most Bloons wishing they’d never been inflated.

                                    When all hope is lost we return to him...
                                    that one makes sense since it's a robot therefore running (what seems to be c++) commands to destroy many bloons
                                    Many, many tacks...

                            Do you wish to summon the TRUE SUN GOD!!??
                Actually that's the worst one of then all, except for maybe "for when you're too big to fail"
                    To be fair, the bloon solver does solve the problem of all non moab class, so that one is at least half decent of a description.
                        It’s also a good pun as solution is both the answer to the bloom problem, and also referring to acidic chemical solutions
                        who cares about anything but fortified ceramic magic resistant lead zebra B.A.D's in round 300?
                    >For when you’re too big to fail…

This one actually pretty accurate, as it gives you loans you don’t have to pay back like what happened during 2007 (to my understanding, basically a bunch of companies were about to go out of business but the government had deemed them “too big to fail” and claimed them going out of business would be more trouble than it’s worth, so they gave them loans and bailed them out)

It’s just, you know, a reference to a time most of the target audience either wasn’t born yet or too young to remember.
                        Was too young at the time to know what the hell was happening except that my parents were straight up, not having a good time and were working near 50ish, even up to 60 hours a week.
                        Yep yep. Nowadays, the economy is mostly based on confidence. If people are confident things are going well, they invest money and everything keeps going well. If they aren’t confident, they pull their money out and you get a bank run. In the 2008 crash, a giant investment bank (Lehmen) was essentially bankrupt, and the govt. let it go down. Of course if Lehmen can fail, why not all the other giant investment banks? If people lost all confidence in the investment banks, the resulting crash could have been on the level of the Great Depression. So the government restored confidence by essentially saying they were gonna give the banks as much cash as they needed to stay solvent. The cash came with some tighter regulations that prevented the banks from making the kind of super risky bets that caused the crash in the first place, but not enough imo

    i accually don't know what thr banana central does i just get it when i go for factorys
        Banana central increases production of 4xx farms by 25%
            *oh my god thats actually really good i should use that more*
                Very good for Bloonarius runs.
                It also makes the crates it gives out worth more too.
            only 4xx? Ive been using it in combination with banks! Oh my god NO!
                Doesnt the buff not show if you get a bank?
                    It does but the guy above said it doesn't work that way.
                        if you look up on wiki, it does say that only 4xx farms get boosted.
            Holy shit , they do have banana
        it makes other farms better+ gives more money
            Only factories, not all farms.
        Banana Central produces tons of banana crates, and also boosts income of all Banana Research Facilities
            Does it boost income of villages too?

                    Tbh the monkeyopolis kinda sucks... Why do I have to manually pick up the crates? Where my interest/healthy bananas?
                        Enter boss bloons
                    Monkey City works on it though? I almost always use it with Monkeyopolis, on my 100+ runs, so it makes me more money.. You said about Monkey Town though so yeah, Monkey Town doesn't work, but Monkey City does.
                        can confirm

        The worst part is that the middle tier upgrades are actually simple. For simplicity, I'll explain without cross paths or monkey knowledge...

Banks (x3x) generate 230 per round plus 15% interest, and hold up to 7k. Nice and simple, just like BTD5.

The IMF Loan (x4x) buffs the capacity to 10k, and gives you a loan ability. The ability gives you an immediate 10k, but you have to gradually pay it off - and if you have an active loan, further activations only give you 5k. Loans are paid off by using 50% of all income to decrease your debt amount until it hits zero. The net amount of money from the ability is 0, but you get it now - which is great if you need that 10k for a big round.

Then, Monkeynomics just removes the debt part and reduces the ability cooldown. Now, you just get 10k whenever you activate it. That's it, that's the entire upgrade. It's one of the simplest, most straightforward upgrades in the game... and the description says nothing useful.
            [deleted]
                IMF loan is probably the worst income generation upgrade in the game and Monkeynomics is the best single money producer in the game.  


But keep in mind that IMF loan can be used to buy farms. Spending 8k to get a 12k loan is only a net 4k gain (which you have to pay back), but getting 12k worth of farms that faster is great.
                    Since you can deposit only with IMF Loans I believe they beat out banks now, as long as you're actively depositing.
                        The capacity of them made them slightly more cost effective before the deposit nerf, but since you need the upgrade to deposit, it beats banks by a lot more.
                            $8,000 is a lot for the privilege of depositing, how many rounds before you make that back?
                                Without deposits it's about 37 rounds with hard mode prices.
                                    How many with deposits? Since the upgrade does not increase income amount, that's the main question.
                    IMF loan is actually pretty good bc those are 0% interest loans. You're borrowing money from your future self at no loss, and you can invest the borrowed money to come out on top (especially if you take out a loan to cross a big income threshold early, such as x5x or 2x5 farm).
                Monkeynomics is good if you're planning to go long, but it takes a decent while to break even. It's 60 seconds between uses, and you can only use it twice per round, and it costs 108k on hard. If you're pushing to freeplay, it's worth it. If not... it kinda loses its shine.
                    One way you can make that ability better is to get a Energizer Sub for the reduced cooldown.

Assuming you have water on the map.
Or got a pool to throw down.
    We turn to him, when all hope is lost...
        uh that one makes sense, when bloons are gonna leak no matter what, therefore the when all hope is lost, lotk will disintegrate them with the portal
            Forgot about the passive ability.

That kinda thing is why [Advanced Popology](https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/atomg3/advanced_popology_vol_1_primary_towers/?st=juoy557m&sh=60369a6a) exists. And man am I glad u/Topper64 made it.
    That is actually amazing, thank you for linking that.
    Shame that we have to use an external database for knowing what everything does rather than just having it in-game
        This so much. I recently proposed some description-related change too. I just wish we had some stat page available during game for each monkey. Like an extra tab. I get newcomers might be overwhelmed but most players would be grateful for it. Just make it optional and problem fixed. I feel like BTD6 sometimes lacks transparency
            i dont know what you mean, "THIS IS A BIG PLANE" is perfectly descriptive
    Or wiki
    I was looking for something like this!
This. No explanation. No elaboration. Just raw power.

        That's why I love it. Absolutely shreds some of the toughest rounds and bloons...can still lose to mid game rounds.
    
When it works, it works.
then there is tier 5s that are completely useless in 95% of situations
    Absolute zero. 012 ice is already good for stalling ceramics. 032, 042, and 052 are all mostly range upgrades, the active isn’t exactly useless, but it’s not very good.


Unless you’re pairing absolute zero with icicle impale, which is the only case where the extra effect of speeding up ice towers matters. And even then, overclock is probably better.
        I've been trying out absolute zero, and it does do good work when you pair it with both other t5s of ice monkey. Ddt:s gt anti camoed instantly and stuff

Works well for primary only

                Yes but i need the insta monkey at 100
                    Just grind the collection event
                        How bout i do both
        I usually use Absolute Zero and Glaive Lord for temple sacrifices
            Just use bloom crush
                *should note that I use Absolute Zero for water placement but noted
        Arctic wind doesnt even increase range
        I mean considering how strong Arctic wind can be for supporting a strong defense, I wouldn’t call the tier 4 and 5 range increases useless, but yea the tier 5 is not really WORTH getting. I usually like getting at least a snowstorm when going for an ice monkey
I like when t5 upgrade descriptions do that
    I like the funny descriptions, but I wish there were seperate funny and technical ones. That way there could be something that gives all needed info *and* something that could have descriptions similar to BTD5's and BMC's, which even expanded a bit on the lore, such as with 04 super's description describing how it was completely a robot and shoots antimatter.
        I'm one of those people who want to know the ins and outs of every game I play. I can explain in great detail how *all* of XCOM's mechanics work, and similarly, I can tell you a great deal about how Titanfall 2's mechanics work. Tier 5 upgrades seem to exist *purely* to spite me. Sometimes, you get upgrades that're super informative, like how Energizer boosts hero XP gain within its range by 50% and globally reduces ability cooldowns by 20%, and reduces them by 50% if the tower is a water tower within range of the sub.

Sometimes, you get Apache Prime's description, which doesn't tell you *anything* about how missile DPS is boosted against MOAB-class bloons, or how the darts are replaced by laser projectiles that count as the Energy damage type, with the machine gun on its front becoming plasma projectiles. I had to search up *all* of that on the wiki, because the only descriptor you get is "the bloons will wish they'd never been inflated".

>of XCOM's mechanics work

Bold claim.I was going to challenge you to explain something obscure to test this, but I can't actually think of anything in vanilla or wotc that would be a challenge.Xcom2 is a fairly simple game when you get down to it.

&#x200B;

The only thing that comes to mind as a properly obscure mechanic is how Good Angle sometimes can make hit chances unpredictable.
                You want something obscure? Guns have different effective ranges. Sniper rifles in XCOM EU/EW, for instance, gain bonuses to accuracy the farther away a target is from the wielder, with the maximum bonus being obtained from being 10 tiles away from the target, and when a target is right next to the wielder, the wielder will experience massive aim reduction. They're the only gun in EU/EW to experience this accuracy range. In addition, this makes the perk that allows your sniper to move and then shoot the sniper rifle very hard to manage, since moving will not only cause the sniper to be closer to danger, it will also cause the sniper to lose aim for being close to the target on top of the perk's inherent aim penalty. This made squadsight the best choice most of the time, even with EW's nerf to its crit capabilities. As such, in XCOM 2, squadsight was nerfed further to place an aim penalty on the sniper based on distance to try and incentivize closer positioning of your sniper to the frontlines.

Also, disabling shot can be used on Sectoids and Sectoid Commanders in EU/EW, but doesn't do anything, since they use pistols, which don't need to reload to be able to fire. On another note, the second pistol upgrade in EU/EW is bugged, and it only confers the proper buff to Covert Operatives, since they're the only "class" whose primary weapon slot contains the pistol.
                    I mean, all of these things are fairly obvious, they're just range tables you can easily look up.  
Similarily, Vector rifles act more like shotguns in that they don't have range penalties for point blank firing.

As for EU/EW, never actually played the games so I couldn't say anything about them, but that seems like a fairly straightforward interaction to me. That's just how pistols work in the games.

A slightly more obscure iteraction I just thought of is how the Darklance interacts with most abilities, like how you cannot set up long watch if you've moved, despite the darklance only taking one action to fire, or how you lose access to squadsight if you move with it.
                        Alrighty then, something more obscure is that MEC Trooper Proximity Mines (a Tier 3 armour upgrade exclusive to that EW class) are triggered when units move through the area. Enemies spawning count as movement for the mine's purposes. When combined with the fact that the final boss in EU/EW only requires a maximum of 5 Proximity Mines to kill *and* that the range on the mine launcher is *slightly* longer than that required to trigger the boss spawning, you get the ability to skip the final fight in the last mission, which, incidentally, also skips the entire boss intro cutscene and starts the final cutscene, so long as you bring a minimum of two MEC Troopers with Proximity Mine Launchers.
                            That's completely hilarious, and I'm surprised that's how area trigger abilities work.  
Poor decision on their part to make the scene trigger that close :D
                                Yep. I found that out by doing a playthrough where I just tried to attach mines to the boss so when the boss moved, it would die. I then learned what the game considered "movement". It was an enjoyable experience.
        I think it would be cool if you got the full description after placing it the first time

my favourite is bloon exclusion zone: "[...] bloons are excluded from existence." ~~which is kind of ironic since it can't pop leads without alch buff or x3x village~~
This is a BIG plane!

Bloons a problem? Here's the solution
Tier 5 boom bilts be like one bloon got by every bloon die
Okay the xx5 dart monkeys are broken i don’t care what you say, all you need is a single alchemist with acid tipped darts
    Crossbow master can already pop leads, you don’t need alch. Also just a heads up, faster shooting is better than sharper darts because it gets more criticals and those are what deal the most damage.
        I use the alch for early lead popping
    They’re decent for stacking buffs, as they can get top path village buff and synergize well with perma brew
How about TIER 6 PARAGONS, jeez the Boomerang one is just "the bloons will look upon my glaives, and they will know fear"
This is a BIG plane
Many, many tacks.
A very, very large bomb.Someone put a stop to this craziness!

Tier 6 


*walks in*
I got it once put it in the middle of the whole map took almost all my monkeys and then I died the next round
Stop using my profile picture 🙈😂
Balloons a problem? Here’s the solution.
how does 5xx farm, x5x farm, xx5 farm, x5x village, xx5 village, x5x engineer, x5x ice, x5x glue, xx5 glue, xx5 boat, x5x ninja, or 5xx alch do anything anywhere near "annihilate bloons"

    it makes other farms better+ gives more money
        Only factories, not all farms.
    Banana Central produces tons of banana crates, and also boosts income of all Banana Research Facilities
        Does it boost income of villages too?

                Tbh the monkeyopolis kinda sucks... Why do I have to manually pick up the crates? Where my interest/healthy bananas?
                    Enter boss bloons
                Monkey City works on it though? I almost always use it with Monkeyopolis, on my 100+ runs, so it makes me more money.. You said about Monkey Town though so yeah, Monkey Town doesn't work, but Monkey City does.
                    can confirm

    The worst part is that the middle tier upgrades are actually simple. For simplicity, I'll explain without cross paths or monkey knowledge...

Banks (x3x) generate 230 per round plus 15% interest, and hold up to 7k. Nice and simple, just like BTD5.

The IMF Loan (x4x) buffs the capacity to 10k, and gives you a loan ability. The ability gives you an immediate 10k, but you have to gradually pay it off - and if you have an active loan, further activations only give you 5k. Loans are paid off by using 50% of all income to decrease your debt amount until it hits zero. The net amount of money from the ability is 0, but you get it now - which is great if you need that 10k for a big round.

Then, Monkeynomics just removes the debt part and reduces the ability cooldown. Now, you just get 10k whenever you activate it. That's it, that's the entire upgrade. It's one of the simplest, most straightforward upgrades in the game... and the description says nothing useful.
        [deleted]
            IMF loan is probably the worst income generation upgrade in the game and Monkeynomics is the best single money producer in the game.  


But keep in mind that IMF loan can be used to buy farms. Spending 8k to get a 12k loan is only a net 4k gain (which you have to pay back), but getting 12k worth of farms that faster is great.
                Since you can deposit only with IMF Loans I believe they beat out banks now, as long as you're actively depositing.
                    The capacity of them made them slightly more cost effective before the deposit nerf, but since you need the upgrade to deposit, it beats banks by a lot more.
                        $8,000 is a lot for the privilege of depositing, how many rounds before you make that back?
                            Without deposits it's about 37 rounds with hard mode prices.
                                How many with deposits? Since the upgrade does not increase income amount, that's the main question.
                IMF loan is actually pretty good bc those are 0% interest loans. You're borrowing money from your future self at no loss, and you can invest the borrowed money to come out on top (especially if you take out a loan to cross a big income threshold early, such as x5x or 2x5 farm).
            Monkeynomics is good if you're planning to go long, but it takes a decent while to break even. It's 60 seconds between uses, and you can only use it twice per round, and it costs 108k on hard. If you're pushing to freeplay, it's worth it. If not... it kinda loses its shine.
                One way you can make that ability better is to get a Energizer Sub for the reduced cooldown.

Assuming you have water on the map.

That is actually amazing, thank you for linking that.
Shame that we have to use an external database for knowing what everything does rather than just having it in-game
    This so much. I recently proposed some description-related change too. I just wish we had some stat page available during game for each monkey. Like an extra tab. I get newcomers might be overwhelmed but most players would be grateful for it. Just make it optional and problem fixed. I feel like BTD6 sometimes lacks transparency

    That's why I love it. Absolutely shreds some of the toughest rounds and bloons...can still lose to mid game rounds.
    
When it works, it works.
Absolute zero. 012 ice is already good for stalling ceramics. 032, 042, and 052 are all mostly range upgrades, the active isn’t exactly useless, but it’s not very good.


Unless you’re pairing absolute zero with icicle impale, which is the only case where the extra effect of speeding up ice towers matters. And even then, overclock is probably better.
    I've been trying out absolute zero, and it does do good work when you pair it with both other t5s of ice monkey. Ddt:s gt anti camoed instantly and stuff

Works well for primary only

        Just use bloom crush
            *should note that I use Absolute Zero for water placement but noted
    Arctic wind doesnt even increase range
    I mean considering how strong Arctic wind can be for supporting a strong defense, I wouldn’t call the tier 4 and 5 range increases useless, but yea the tier 5 is not really WORTH getting. I usually like getting at least a snowstorm when going for an ice monkey
I like the funny descriptions, but I wish there were seperate funny and technical ones. That way there could be something that gives all needed info *and* something that could have descriptions similar to BTD5's and BMC's, which even expanded a bit on the lore, such as with 04 super's description describing how it was completely a robot and shoots antimatter.
    I'm one of those people who want to know the ins and outs of every game I play. I can explain in great detail how *all* of XCOM's mechanics work, and similarly, I can tell you a great deal about how Titanfall 2's mechanics work. Tier 5 upgrades seem to exist *purely* to spite me. Sometimes, you get upgrades that're super informative, like how Energizer boosts hero XP gain within its range by 50% and globally reduces ability cooldowns by 20%, and reduces them by 50% if the tower is a water tower within range of the sub.

Sometimes, you get Apache Prime's description, which doesn't tell you *anything* about how missile DPS is boosted against MOAB-class bloons, or how the darts are replaced by laser projectiles that count as the Energy damage type, with the machine gun on its front becoming plasma projectiles. I had to search up *all* of that on the wiki, because the only descriptor you get is "the bloons will wish they'd never been inflated".
        >I can explain in great detail how

>of XCOM's mechanics work

Bold claim.I was going to challenge you to explain something obscure to test this, but I can't actually think of anything in vanilla or wotc that would be a challenge.Xcom2 is a fairly simple game when you get down to it.

&#x200B;

The only thing that comes to mind as a properly obscure mechanic is how Good Angle sometimes can make hit chances unpredictable.
            You want something obscure? Guns have different effective ranges. Sniper rifles in XCOM EU/EW, for instance, gain bonuses to accuracy the farther away a target is from the wielder, with the maximum bonus being obtained from being 10 tiles away from the target, and when a target is right next to the wielder, the wielder will experience massive aim reduction. They're the only gun in EU/EW to experience this accuracy range. In addition, this makes the perk that allows your sniper to move and then shoot the sniper rifle very hard to manage, since moving will not only cause the sniper to be closer to danger, it will also cause the sniper to lose aim for being close to the target on top of the perk's inherent aim penalty. This made squadsight the best choice most of the time, even with EW's nerf to its crit capabilities. As such, in XCOM 2, squadsight was nerfed further to place an aim penalty on the sniper based on distance to try and incentivize closer positioning of your sniper to the frontlines.

Also, disabling shot can be used on Sectoids and Sectoid Commanders in EU/EW, but doesn't do anything, since they use pistols, which don't need to reload to be able to fire. On another note, the second pistol upgrade in EU/EW is bugged, and it only confers the proper buff to Covert Operatives, since they're the only "class" whose primary weapon slot contains the pistol.
                I mean, all of these things are fairly obvious, they're just range tables you can easily look up.  
Similarily, Vector rifles act more like shotguns in that they don't have range penalties for point blank firing.

As for EU/EW, never actually played the games so I couldn't say anything about them, but that seems like a fairly straightforward interaction to me. That's just how pistols work in the games.

A slightly more obscure iteraction I just thought of is how the Darklance interacts with most abilities, like how you cannot set up long watch if you've moved, despite the darklance only taking one action to fire, or how you lose access to squadsight if you move with it.
                    Alrighty then, something more obscure is that MEC Trooper Proximity Mines (a Tier 3 armour upgrade exclusive to that EW class) are triggered when units move through the area. Enemies spawning count as movement for the mine's purposes. When combined with the fact that the final boss in EU/EW only requires a maximum of 5 Proximity Mines to kill *and* that the range on the mine launcher is *slightly* longer than that required to trigger the boss spawning, you get the ability to skip the final fight in the last mission, which, incidentally, also skips the entire boss intro cutscene and starts the final cutscene, so long as you bring a minimum of two MEC Troopers with Proximity Mine Launchers.
                        That's completely hilarious, and I'm surprised that's how area trigger abilities work.  
Poor decision on their part to make the scene trigger that close :D
                            Yep. I found that out by doing a playthrough where I just tried to attach mines to the boss so when the boss moved, it would die. I then learned what the game considered "movement". It was an enjoyable experience.
    I think it would be cool if you got the full description after placing it the first time
“The bloons will look upon my glaives, and they will know fear.”
and a beta male.
He's not sorry
Almost doesn’t include single DDTs
Crossbow master can already pop leads, you don’t need alch. Also just a heads up, faster shooting is better than sharper darts because it gets more criticals and those are what deal the most damage.
    I use the alch for early lead popping
They’re decent for stacking buffs, as they can get top path village buff and synergize well with perma brew

        Actually that's the worst one of then all, except for maybe "for when you're too big to fail"
            To be fair, the bloon solver does solve the problem of all non moab class, so that one is at least half decent of a description.
                It’s also a good pun as solution is both the answer to the bloom problem, and also referring to acidic chemical solutions
                who cares about anything but fortified ceramic magic resistant lead zebra B.A.D's in round 300?
            >For when you’re too big to fail…

This one actually pretty accurate, as it gives you loans you don’t have to pay back like what happened during 2007 (to my understanding, basically a bunch of companies were about to go out of business but the government had deemed them “too big to fail” and claimed them going out of business would be more trouble than it’s worth, so they gave them loans and bailed them out)

It’s just, you know, a reference to a time most of the target audience either wasn’t born yet or too young to remember.
                Was too young at the time to know what the hell was happening except that my parents were straight up, not having a good time and were working near 50ish, even up to 60 hours a week.
                Yep yep. Nowadays, the economy is mostly based on confidence. If people are confident things are going well, they invest money and everything keeps going well. If they aren’t confident, they pull their money out and you get a bank run. In the 2008 crash, a giant investment bank (Lehmen) was essentially bankrupt, and the govt. let it go down. Of course if Lehmen can fail, why not all the other giant investment banks? If people lost all confidence in the investment banks, the resulting crash could have been on the level of the Great Depression. So the government restored confidence by essentially saying they were gonna give the banks as much cash as they needed to stay solvent. The cash came with some tighter regulations that prevented the banks from making the kind of super risky bets that caused the crash in the first place, but not enough imo
                    It’s a post about tier 5 upgrades on btd 6 and there’s people talking about politics and economics. I love Reddit
                [https://imgur.com/a/N7jiUqz](https://imgur.com/a/N7jiUqz) the fuck happened
            I mean, if you’re too big to fail, you can’t suffer the effects of loans and bankruptcy, which is exactly what the Monkey-Nomics upgrade does.
Banana central increases production of 4xx farms by 25%

        Very good for Bloonarius runs.

    only 4xx? Ive been using it in combination with banks! Oh my god NO!
        Doesnt the buff not show if you get a bank?
            It does but the guy above said it doesn't work that way.
                if you look up on wiki, it does say that only 4xx farms get boosted.

            IMF loan is actually pretty good bc those are 0% interest loans. You're borrowing money from your future self at no loss, and you can invest the borrowed money to come out on top (especially if you take out a loan to cross a big income threshold early, such as x5x or 2x5 farm).
        Monkeynomics is good if you're planning to go long, but it takes a decent while to break even. It's 60 seconds between uses, and you can only use it twice per round, and it costs 108k on hard. If you're pushing to freeplay, it's worth it. If not... it kinda loses its shine.
            One way you can make that ability better is to get a Energizer Sub for the reduced cooldown.

        >For when you’re too big to fail…

This one actually pretty accurate, as it gives you loans you don’t have to pay back like what happened during 2007 (to my understanding, basically a bunch of companies were about to go out of business but the government had deemed them “too big to fail” and claimed them going out of business would be more trouble than it’s worth, so they gave them loans and bailed them out)

It’s just, you know, a reference to a time most of the target audience either wasn’t born yet or too young to remember.
            Was too young at the time to know what the hell was happening except that my parents were straight up, not having a good time and were working near 50ish, even up to 60 hours a week.
            Yep yep. Nowadays, the economy is mostly based on confidence. If people are confident things are going well, they invest money and everything keeps going well. If they aren’t confident, they pull their money out and you get a bank run. In the 2008 crash, a giant investment bank (Lehmen) was essentially bankrupt, and the govt. let it go down. Of course if Lehmen can fail, why not all the other giant investment banks? If people lost all confidence in the investment banks, the resulting crash could have been on the level of the Great Depression. So the government restored confidence by essentially saying they were gonna give the banks as much cash as they needed to stay solvent. The cash came with some tighter regulations that prevented the banks from making the kind of super risky bets that caused the crash in the first place, but not enough imo

*oh my god thats actually really good i should use that more*
    Very good for Bloonarius runs.
    It also makes the crates it gives out worth more too.
only 4xx? Ive been using it in combination with banks! Oh my god NO!
    Doesnt the buff not show if you get a bank?
        It does but the guy above said it doesn't work that way.
            if you look up on wiki, it does say that only 4xx farms get boosted.
Holy shit , they do have banana
Only factories, not all farms.
Does it boost income of villages too?

        Tbh the monkeyopolis kinda sucks... Why do I have to manually pick up the crates? Where my interest/healthy bananas?
            Enter boss bloons
        Monkey City works on it though? I almost always use it with Monkeyopolis, on my 100+ runs, so it makes me more money.. You said about Monkey Town though so yeah, Monkey Town doesn't work, but Monkey City does.

    IMF loan is probably the worst income generation upgrade in the game and Monkeynomics is the best single money producer in the game.  


But keep in mind that IMF loan can be used to buy farms. Spending 8k to get a 12k loan is only a net 4k gain (which you have to pay back), but getting 12k worth of farms that faster is great.
        Since you can deposit only with IMF Loans I believe they beat out banks now, as long as you're actively depositing.
            The capacity of them made them slightly more cost effective before the deposit nerf, but since you need the upgrade to deposit, it beats banks by a lot more.
                $8,000 is a lot for the privilege of depositing, how many rounds before you make that back?
                    Without deposits it's about 37 rounds with hard mode prices.
                        How many with deposits? Since the upgrade does not increase income amount, that's the main question.
        IMF loan is actually pretty good bc those are 0% interest loans. You're borrowing money from your future self at no loss, and you can invest the borrowed money to come out on top (especially if you take out a loan to cross a big income threshold early, such as x5x or 2x5 farm).
    Monkeynomics is good if you're planning to go long, but it takes a decent while to break even. It's 60 seconds between uses, and you can only use it twice per round, and it costs 108k on hard. If you're pushing to freeplay, it's worth it. If not... it kinda loses its shine.
        One way you can make that ability better is to get a Energizer Sub for the reduced cooldown.

Assuming you have water on the map.
Or got a pool to throw down.

Bold claim.I was going to challenge you to explain something obscure to test this, but I can't actually think of anything in vanilla or wotc that would be a challenge.Xcom2 is a fairly simple game when you get down to it.

&#x200B;

The only thing that comes to mind as a properly obscure mechanic is how Good Angle sometimes can make hit chances unpredictable.
    You want something obscure? Guns have different effective ranges. Sniper rifles in XCOM EU/EW, for instance, gain bonuses to accuracy the farther away a target is from the wielder, with the maximum bonus being obtained from being 10 tiles away from the target, and when a target is right next to the wielder, the wielder will experience massive aim reduction. They're the only gun in EU/EW to experience this accuracy range. In addition, this makes the perk that allows your sniper to move and then shoot the sniper rifle very hard to manage, since moving will not only cause the sniper to be closer to danger, it will also cause the sniper to lose aim for being close to the target on top of the perk's inherent aim penalty. This made squadsight the best choice most of the time, even with EW's nerf to its crit capabilities. As such, in XCOM 2, squadsight was nerfed further to place an aim penalty on the sniper based on distance to try and incentivize closer positioning of your sniper to the frontlines.

Also, disabling shot can be used on Sectoids and Sectoid Commanders in EU/EW, but doesn't do anything, since they use pistols, which don't need to reload to be able to fire. On another note, the second pistol upgrade in EU/EW is bugged, and it only confers the proper buff to Covert Operatives, since they're the only "class" whose primary weapon slot contains the pistol.
        I mean, all of these things are fairly obvious, they're just range tables you can easily look up.  
Similarily, Vector rifles act more like shotguns in that they don't have range penalties for point blank firing.

As for EU/EW, never actually played the games so I couldn't say anything about them, but that seems like a fairly straightforward interaction to me. That's just how pistols work in the games.

A slightly more obscure iteraction I just thought of is how the Darklance interacts with most abilities, like how you cannot set up long watch if you've moved, despite the darklance only taking one action to fire, or how you lose access to squadsight if you move with it.
            Alrighty then, something more obscure is that MEC Trooper Proximity Mines (a Tier 3 armour upgrade exclusive to that EW class) are triggered when units move through the area. Enemies spawning count as movement for the mine's purposes. When combined with the fact that the final boss in EU/EW only requires a maximum of 5 Proximity Mines to kill *and* that the range on the mine launcher is *slightly* longer than that required to trigger the boss spawning, you get the ability to skip the final fight in the last mission, which, incidentally, also skips the entire boss intro cutscene and starts the final cutscene, so long as you bring a minimum of two MEC Troopers with Proximity Mine Launchers.
                That's completely hilarious, and I'm surprised that's how area trigger abilities work.  
Poor decision on their part to make the scene trigger that close :D
                    Yep. I found that out by doing a playthrough where I just tried to attach mines to the boss so when the boss moved, it would die. I then learned what the game considered "movement". It was an enjoyable experience.
