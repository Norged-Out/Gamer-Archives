[[Everyone, I am proud to announce that the winner of the character elimination game is…. THE LOST!]]





I would never thought back in rebirth's day that The Lost would be chosen as the best character
    His victory only reflects our desire to have perfect hitless runs.
        I think he used a mantle between votes
            This was rigged, as a single character could be voted out per round, he possibly got hit once, but at the next round he regenerated his mantle.

Pretty sure T.Lost couldn't find another card lmao
        It was holding R until you get Holy Mantle in the first Treasure Room and 9 Lives in the Devil Deal.
    Probably wouldn’t have voted in his favor during AB+ either, but the Eternal D6 just seals the deal for me
        He was my fav in AB+ by far, but now I can't even remember how he is in repentance because of the absurd ammount of games I had to play to complete Tainted Lost.

I think getting one mantle per room would feel OP now.
        AB+ Lost was great. Sure you didn't have the ED6 but you just took entire devil deal rooms for free.
            Until you got an item you didn't liked, thought "hey, that's why he carries the d4 right?"... and deleted your mantle
                you guys actually used the d4?
                    Well, if you are about to restart because the first floor was shit, may as well try to reroll.

It did never work for me lmao
                    When it doesn't get rid of my only form health
                    I did it just once because I forgot it would get rid of holy mantle.
                    Only when there's lots of batteries to reroll multiple times.
        Perfection is amazing too. Getting a shit ton of consumables feels great, and getting any tear effects is crazy fun.
        I'm going to be honest.  The eternal d6 gets rid of my items like 50% of the time I use it, I swear to God, fuck this God forsaken character.
            80%
                It just runs on Pokemon luck. 30% of the time it works every time.
                    You know what they say
"If it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate"
    Well they made him like 100x more powerful from where he began now that he starts with spectral tears, Holy Mantle, and Eternal D6.  It's like 3 terrific starting items where he originally had none.  It's practically a different character at this point.
        For what it's worth, he did always effectively start with Transcendence, and flight is pretty terrific.

It's just that he lacked any innate tools to truly take advantage of it.
    He wasn't chosen as the best he was chosen as the least worst. This is because we were always voting for our least favorite
    He is fun with holy mantle, but otherwise really hard and frustrating. I really like both version of the Forgotten because of how unusual they are. Not sure when Azazel got voted out. I bet my left nut that that's probably the character that really unlocked the game for many people.
        Azazel is too easy. I'd guess that Azazel is one of the less played characters for more experienced players outside of very difficult unlocks just because after a while steamrolling everything with basically zero effort just gets boring. 

The lost starting with holy mantle and eternal d6 actually makes him extremely powerful to start, but still risky enough that you can't let your guard down, which adds a lot of tension even after you've mastered the game.
            I love Azazel. It's true, I don't play the character a lot anymore, but Isaac is an incredibly hard game and having an easy character was great, simply to see and unlock content in the first place. It's extremely frustrating not to have any success for a while and that's when the character shines. I also don't think I could ever have managed the thing with Mom's Shovel with a different character.
this describes the fandom perfectly, pain and suffering
    And somehow fun with gambling
    That would be t. Lost
        T. Cain, when played as intended
Imagine showing this to an Isaac fan in 2014
    *"why are there two of everyone"*
        "WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE"
            "THEY TOOK WHAT AWAY FROM THE LOST?!"
                “WHO THE FUCK IS BETHANY”
                    _markiplier voice_ IS THAT A _**DOUBLE CHARACTER?!**_
                        WHY IS THERE A FUCKING SKELETON?!
                            WE CAN PLAY AS A _**SHOPKEEPER!!?**_
        Except Esau
    i just joined and i only have afterbirth, so this is me😭 i am in 2014 and have no idea who tf these characters are

    You should post a pic of the planned art or final results!
    Do it or drop your mod spot >:(
        if there's no lost tattoo we riot
            No need to riot, I'll post it as proof when I get it, it just might take a bit as the artist I was looking at is pretty heavily booked from the sounds of it.
                Better to get it done right than too soon!

            You know the old bamboozle = banboozle

    Yo congrats on getting mod.
        I've been a mod for like a year and a half now but thanks lmao
            legit didnt notice lmao.
    WHERE IS
        Frankly no damn clue, I still haven't been contacted back and unfortunately everything's been crazy in my life the past few months.
    Tattoo update?
        Moving, transitioning and living has taken up most my funds and resources. Thinking of getting it shortly though as a friend of a friend is doing some on the cheaper end.
            Well?
            !remindme 6 months
            Talk to ya in 6 months :)
    Ayyy
    Based
    kinda mad you're not getting a tattoo of my face but guess lost is cool too
        Well I'd need a reference pic for that, now wouldn't I?
    Based and possibly even redpilled, could even be poggers. Perhaps a little KomodoHype.

Winner: [The Lost](https://imgur.com/a/HOHStbP)
    Find it interesting how before the one on one vote, the lost was actually loosing to the tainted keeper when the votes were split between more than two.
        I feel like if this was poll was made anywhere that isn't this sub, Lost would have been gone long time ago

People here really like him
            Clearly other subs have a skill issue
            Fr
        Duh, he still had the mantle.
    It's so weird how in round 22 somehow one comment caused a massive amount of votes against tainted isaac
        wait what happened?
            Before round 23, someone made a comment saying Broken Isaac should go out because he was too linear and had runs feel too similar.
                Which I still think is a dumb criticism of the character, before that I had never seen anyone saying that tainted isaac felt samey, and in my experience his runs were pretty varied in terms of item combos
                    Based off videos I've seen and general opinions in Issac circles, Broken Isaac is kind of an acquired taste.

Everyone will acknowledge he can be powerful, but a lot of ppl love just stacking a bunch of item effects big and small.

Personally, I don't care about stacking a lot of item effects, I like making small builds. T. Isaac lets you do that all the time while having the option to switch back if your nee build is worse.

I want to streak as him once I unlock all the major Mega Satan + Mother + Deli + Beast unlocks.
                Which is really weird considering how repetitive Lost is lol.
                Well hes not wrong lol
                    It's an acquired taste.

He's linear for a lot of ppl, but really interesting for me.
    By how many votes did The Lost win?
        Tainted keeper got 167 more votes, t. Keeper got 2762 votes and the lost got 2595
            By the skin of his chinny chin chin
            Now I need a ranking of each character by how many votes they got overall across all of the polls
    now do one with items
        Everyone, I am proud to announce that the winner of the item elimination game is…. ~~Death Certificate!~~ Lil Loki!
            Funny way of spelling brother bobby
                Funny way of spelling Breakfast
                    Funny way of spelling The Bean
                        Funny way of spelling „Insert bad item here“
                            How did you find this chain? it's 2 weeks old!
                            Funny way of spelling glitched crown
            I unironically believe Sissy Longlegs would (and should) win.
        there was a few posts like that a while ago when this meme was at it's peak. They removed like 16 items a round I think but it was still completely overwhelming and it died.

I think if we wanted to do that we could go item pool by item pool and then another one with the winners of each pool.
            yeah or like by quality 4, 3 etc.
        C-Section would win
            My choice would be Glitched Crown
            That or death certificate
                Just remove all items that let you get other items(glitched crown, death certificate, genesis, etc)
                    Just make it for tear modifiers, easy entertainment. Also, hemolacruia or ludo for me.
            Well...
    Interesting that tainted keeper had less votes than lost for every round in the top 10 except the last.
    total de votos kkkkj

Thank you for this series of posts, it was really fun ;D
        será q ele é br? kkkk.
    [mfw second worst character in my list is the winner](https://youtu.be/2j-RxfZ2Gco?t=49)
        Skill issue
        Here's my list, from the worst characters to the best 

T Lost, Lost, T Maggie, Laz, BB, Samson, Maggie, Beth, T Beth, Isaac, T Azazel, Eve, T apolly, Keeper, Lilith, Judas, T Forg (17'th split), T eve, Forg, Eden, T Isaac, T Judas, T Samson, T Keeper, Azazel, T Cain, J&E, T Laz, T Eden, T Lilith, T BB, Apollyon, T Jacob, Cain

Hey, at least worst character didn't get to top 10 and mah boi Cain did it, he's the best since 2011
            I don't even care about the list I'm just happy to see someone rightfully putting Cain on the top
                I'm just known Lost complainer in this poll so I put this list for those who wonder what characters I find enjoyable or annoying, maybe someone will have questions to me because the list looks pretty unconventional even beyond Reddit tboi community (excluding Losts being in the last row). I also have Dead God achievement, if that matters.
            Ah a fellow T. Jacob enjoyer.
                I felt emptiness inside myself when I tried to get marks on him before the patch. And then I dropped the game at some moment. 

After the patch, I checked if Lost Jacob gets holy mantle. I got dissapointed, but didn't gave up and still gave it a try. Didn't regret and he fastly became my favourite. I'd still give a neutral opinion on him if patch wouldn't happen, because I like the concept, but would say it's badly implemented in the game.
        put a headphone warning on that you dick.
    Thank you for doing these posts, reading the many discussions that resulted from them was really interesting!
    NNNNOOOOOO KEEPER
    I haven't played in a while so I gotta ask, why did Lazarus lost so early? In which way is he bad or uninteresting to play?
Lost almost died like 8 times
    That’s why holy mantle is op ;)
        I think it doesnt work like that but k
            it recharged between rounds
    He looted Dead Cat.
        From a first floor curse room ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4358)
Now let’s do the same thing but with every item ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
    Day 502 of voting host hat
        Host hat only with characters with no red heart containers.  Pyromaniac on those with.
    Bosses?
        That's a good idea, but champion bloat will be the first one out lmao
            Havent unlocked champion bosses but fuck the bloat
                Wait you have to unlock champion bosses?
                    Pretty sure, ive never seen any champions and i have over 150 hours
        I think we all know who would be voted out first.. Duke of flies. ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4357)
Rigged.

>!Jk, I love both of them.!<
    Literally my 2 favourite characters. I'd probably choose T Keeper as number one but I'm overall pretty happy about the result.
Honestly would’ve thought Isaac but the lost makes sense too.
rest in peace keeper my beloved
Wow, didn't expect that.

Like I said yesterday, even if I like T Keeper more, this is is a 1st and 2nd contest out of 34 characters. Im glad the top 2 looks like this. Im glad characters like T Cain and both Azazels didnt make it anywhere close to this.
    T Azazel post-patch is super fun. He's definitely in my top 5
    Azazels I can agree on, but I love playing T Cain so much

Even if it takes me an hour to get to the fifth floor...
        T Cain is fun for me once per month, just crafting 3 r keys and getting my favorite combo Brimstone + Polyphemus + Sacred Heart + Mom's Knife + Tech X
    tazazels not bad
    \>:( stop insulting my main like that
        That makes a lot of sense.
Finally  
  
Skill Issuen't
I will forever (prob not) have PTSD that forgor lost:(
Voted for  The Lost for 22 straight days... it's like I didn't even get to participate!
Rigged Jacob and Esau should’ve won
    Plot twist: Everyone misread it as 'vote for your favorite character'
        Would be great to do it in that reverse order.
            "Which one is your favorite character?:


The Lost, the Lost, the Lost, the Lost or the Lost?"
    Maybe after  Isaac 2 first big dlc.
\#TKeeper2026
the irony that the winner is named Lost XD
Lost aint bad by any metric but due to so many more interesting choices, i must express my disapproval. The Lost is too boring to be number one.
    Should've been Forgotten, but ah well
        Agreed. Hands down my favourite. Tainted Keeper is awesome too.
Isaac players all live in stockholm

Bony boi should have won.

You won't see the last of the forgor rebellion. We won't forget about this.
    If you pretend Lost is a wackier version of the Soul, Forgotten still won
    💀💀 gang rise up
    I think forgor💀 would have won easily in AB+ but with lost having eternal d6 and perfection he is more fun now.
        It's pretty impressive that he is the highest character that wasn't added or massively changed in repentance, the only buff was that he can now take deals with bone hearts
    he is too easy and becomes boring quick
        Get good
            I said he is too easy. I am too good
                False, you are bad. At the game, at life, at having fun.
The Won
T keeper def 
Should have won
I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed…
    cry about it
        Binding of Isaac moment
            Me when I throw teeth at my mom (I'm trying to go to womb I)
                Me when I get cancer (this is a great tears up)
                    Me peeing on nerve endings in my mom's womb (i need to clear this room)
        *TEARS UP* + Ratio + Bad trip + L + Feels like i'm walking on sunshine!
NOOOOOOOOO
Now this is tragic
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
    Indeed
    My satisfaction is incalculable and my day is intact
STOP THE COUNT!
"I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, i've elected to ignore it"
I am honestly shocked lmao
Wow, I really expected T. Keeper to win. I suppose this proves for Isaac players that risk = fun, which is true after a few hundred hours. I voted the Lost off solely because T. Keeper is excellent at using sac rooms, while generally when playing as the Lost you will go straight for devil deals since there’s no downside. Even in that case, if you play right with keeper even by basement II you should have enough to buy multiple devil deal (or angel deal) items
[the lost right now, probably](https://tenor.com/view/the-binding-of-isaac-specialist-gif-22741646)
I still don't get what attracts people to the lost
    For me it's the fact that he's extremely high risk high reward. Eternal D6 with free devil deals insanely overpowered. Sure, a lot of your runs with him ends with you dead but playing with him is so much fun I honestly don't even mind.
    honestly sometimes feels like a hiveming of people saying "duh **insert challenge charecter but not the lost** is worse than the lost"

*literally how tho*
        T. Lost existing
    Holy mantle, free Devil deals, Ghost tears, fly, eternal d6.. Hes high risk high reward, and hes still easier than other characters. I find him funny
And there we have it, by default, one half of the Forgotten wins, even if the poor skeleton portion was unjustly voted out.
I don’t get it, I understand he may be more fun but people arguing that he’s the best character in the game are weird.  Like, he has mantle but he dies in one hit.
NOOOO MY KEEPER BOY
    I know right, i never play as lost because he’s completely inferior
        sounds like skill issue to me
            Your moms a skill issue
                keep malding
On Jan 6 everyone storm OP house , HE STOLE THE VOTE  T keeper should of won . He cheated
    ![gif](giphy|TL2Yr3ioe78tO)
    Ja, agreed
    It's 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Y'all are lunatics.
One of the worst characters unironically.
Ugh, fine. Not impressed but I suppose a worse character could have won.
Meh I don't agree, but that's just my opinion
I wholeheartedly disagree with the outcome. T keeper is 1000x more fun than the lost. It’s the same stakes but you get way more items which means a bigger variety of successful runs
im just glad J&E were the first character removed, legitimately garbage, i didnt vote after that. also the lost is pretty cool
YEEEEESS!! GREATEST REDEMPTION ARC EVER

MISER KEEPER GOT SKILL ISSUE'D (he is, honestly, a lot easier to steamroll with...to a near boring degree)

And by proxy, Isaac and Forgotten are also redeemed because of the dead-child life cycle.
I expected this from the very beginning and I'm still dissapointed
Looking at all these poll results genuinely baffles me. They were rarely even close, and Forgotten lost by a much larger margin than I expected.
Bruh, T. Keeper will always be the winner in my heart
I DEMAND A RECOUNT
STOP THE COUNT
Ew wtf
Now this is a definitive Pog moment. The lost seems like the more of a main character than Isaac to me and I think he is a perfect embodiment of what makes Isaac great. Wasn't expecting Lost to be number 1 but would definitely be my first choice.
What the fuck is wrong with this fanbase
    [deleted]
        Your life is bad game design
    Different strokes for different folks.
I voted for this bastard to be gone every single round. :(
i know this is gonna sound like ranting

but

how can people straight up say that t.keeper is worse than the lost
    tkeeper is too easy, you can break the game in basement 1 if you start out next to a sacrifice room
Wha… but he sucks compared to tainted keeper 😔
NOOOOOOOOOO
He should have lost...
Wow I had no idea The Lost was the most popular. Throughout this whole thing there were a ton of comments about how fun T-Keeper is. Personally, I prefer T-Lost a lot.

Either way, the polling tournament was definitely an interesting experience. Thank you for hosting it!
My favorite is actually T. Lost I think. More challenging than the lost to play but you don't have to worry about getting a bunch of hp up items.
while i dissagree with the outcome (he's cool but nah) i liked the journey, and as we all know the real winner is the friends we make along the way
Really thought it was gonna be t keeper, but I like this. This whole character elimination thing was extremely fun to go through, really enjoyed it

R.I.P Keeper, gone too soon
and thus concludes that the binding of isaac subreddit are full of tryhards that dont want to have fun when playing isaac  


(jokes aside it was really fun to see what the community majority chose as the best character, even if i personally dont agree with it)
Wow!

This was a let down from start to finish ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4358)
I wanted Cain to win rip.
That's stupid

I like the lost's challenge n all, but he kinda felt boring, i mean, he has basic stats with flying and the hp feature, i felt like tainted keeper was just more fun for me to play as.
Should have been tainted keeper, but ok
    Agreed
Not unsurprising, lost is the definitive Isaac experience imo
NOOOOOOOOO MY BOY KEEPER
I want a refund
maybe someday I will unlock him
As an Afterbirth player I am so confused about this result
Oh god I'm seething so much right now that I'm going to cry on people and make them drop their money
The lost won, does that mean that the won lost?
The lost was my second to first pick to eliminate. You're all insane and love suffering.
Imagine showing this post to someone before The Lost could even unlock holy mantle.
I don't mind, however I did prefer tainted keeper winning, and I even prefer tainted lost over the normal variant, seeing stuff like hp ups is just annoying, even with Eternal D6.
Now vote bosses?
Holy damn. Talk about an upset I couldn't have seen coming in a million years--everyone was talking up Tainted Keeper the whole damn poll! Never underestimate being a historically intriguing character, I suppose.

This poll ruled, thank you so much OP!
I guess everyone else LOST
Let's eliminate the lost
that's a good character to end if off with
So who won?
Eww what? How? Who the fuck likes the lost???
Fuck you all
what…
YES! My favorite character in the entire game and the underdog throughout this whole thing.

Thank you for running this! It was awesome to follow this for the past month and I appreciate your contribution to the community.
Hail to the victim of datamining!
I'm mad
Rigged and wrong and original keeper was always the best character.
    This is true
Welp it's been a wild journey...

Also, skill issue, get good at the game.
    Mald harder, I wanna drink some of your salty tears.
I'm gonna make some digital art and pixel art of this
This brings me memories of when i used to play afterbirth and the lost was my fav character...
Wow I’m honestly surprised
😐
gross
Wtf … xD
“I don’t know how we got to this point but we made it to some place I like”
Finally, no more low effort posts on the sub
*what*
You are all liars and I will not hear any other truth.
Bruh sound #7
Lost won!   Wait what?
So basically everybody here likes pain more than happiness
![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
I am in disbelief

I'm surprised it wasn't tainted keeper :/
I thought he would've lost...
i no longer wish to associate with anyone in this subreddit-
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
no
YESSSSSSS
YOOO LOST WON ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)

In my opinion, he's just overrated. But yeah, just my opinion..
Same people who kept him in are the same people who made memes about how hard the character is. But got the check marks from RNG or "Lack of skill issue". And then changed their tone as a superiority thing. I think this came down to a dick measuring contest. "Its fun if you are skilled" but I didn't think people were this brainwashed by hubris and hindsight. Fuck off, ghost character sucks and raised your blood pressure at some point. I've completed him and T. Lost and will never willingly play them ever again. I can't wait to see the sweats reply to this. Actual Stockholm syndrome at its finest.
    1. skill issue is a joke phrase, everyone knows Lost to Delirium isn't fair
2. **This is for fun.** Lost is genuinely fun for a lot.
2. Personally voted out Miser Keeper because he snowballs too easily; by depths 1, I've already won from shops.
2. skill issue
        [removed]
            Why do you type like this
                Its a skill issue and my father was unkind
                    Is your mother an alcoholic who gambled your family's life savings away?
    The Lost Is the only completed character i still play. Hes way easier than a lot of other challenge characters, he has free Devil deals, eternal d6, starts with holy mantle, has ghost tears and fly. Hes not the strongest character but that doesnt make him unfunny to play. Maybe YOU completed them thanks to the RNG this just projection?
        [removed]
            >mansplaining

Lmao

Also, no need to be salty. Just because you completed them thanks to RNG doesnt mean everyone did. Maybe people just like some challenge?  This Is just skill issue ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
                Lol did I just get pwnd? XD
                    Nice reddit gold btw kind stranger
    I agree, very based, as they say
    you're actually incredibly based and I agree with the things you said
Interesting how T Keeper was consistently showing to be the winner until the very last poll. I’m glad though, I voted him off
HOLY FUCK LETS GOOOOO FUCK YOU KEEPER LOST WON AAHHHHHHHH
What makes lost more interesting then any other character? He has a worse D6, flight and spectral tears, and a downside that can be replicated by anyone else. Flight and spectral tears are not more interesting then the forgotten or T-keeper
I think The Lost won because he represents mastery of the game in all regards while still providing a fair experience.

His flight and spectral tears can be used tactically and use the room layout to your advantage.

His holy mantle gives you some leeway for imperfection, but more importantly can be used for a number of strategic (and sometimes risky) moves.

The addition of the Eternal D6 (and removal of the D4) allows you some degree of overcoming bad RNG without completely breaking the game.

Plus he's dang cute.
My favorite character yaaaa

WE HAVE AVENGED T LOST. LOST FUCKING WON. LEGIT i cant believe it im crying so much right now. Lost was cornered. His haters, fueled with the desire to serve envy, were bearing down on lost. "We will do as we are told, My envy. I love  You  above all else," His haters repeated to themselves. This was the end of the line for the lost. His haters were far too strong for him. But just as He accepted his mantle shatter. r/bindingofisaac intervened, Sending the lost gang down from above to stop his haters hand and, Just like that, Lost had won.
    oh cmon now it was clever :(
    Correction: both of them viciously murdered hundreds of cats to stay alive (1 vote = 1 skill issue for that character)
But what if it was Tainted
What? The sperm won?
dunno how the lost won over azazel but it's a welcome change
    azazel boring and pretty standard.
At least T.Lost didn't win

Eh, good enought for me
Yeah funny character... Ups, bad item R... Mmm... Not bad but... R...
Yeah its so fun
NOOOO MY GREED BOY IS GONE
Isaac players voting for the statistically worst character in the game as the best character because it’s more fun to die randomly to a BS room than fight delirium (skill issue btw)
    Far from the worse statistically
    “Statistically the worst” what “math” are you doing lol. I bet you graduated top of your class in the navy seals and have over 300 confirmed kills as well
        You literally die in 1 hit. The Lost at base is the literal most garbage character in the game.
            Hes tankier than all other characters in the game. With how many characters can you take a hit every single room without dying or losing deals?
                Damn people really don’t remember that the lost once unlocked does not start with holy mantle. Sure holy mantle eHP is deceiving but at base when unlocked without any upgrades the character is complete garbage lol
                    Because no one is considering characters without their unlocks acquired. Keeper is pain at his base, but very fun w/ the HP-Up and Wooden Nickel

Base Lost is worse than Baleful Lost. They should fo what someone else said and make Mantle apart of him normally,  but tie ed6 to the 879 Greed machine unlock
            My point was that there is no mathematical/scientific formula to determine how easy it is to win with a character, personally I find J+E harder than mantless lost
                How, you literally die in one hit
                At least you can take damage as J&E
            you die in 2 hits, that replenish every room. He's tankier than keeper imo.  he also has spectral and flight which is huge and one of the strongest starting items.
                The Lost at base does not have holy mantle. Out of all these characters at base the interesting and well designed ones would be stuff like Bethany, Lilith, Eden, Forgotten because they don’t die in 1 hit at all stages of the game, while also introducing interesting unique mechanics.
                    Its dumb to vote without considering the character with everything unlocked. Im pretty sure everyone voted considering The Lost with the mantle, Eve with the razor,  keeper with the wooden nickel, and Isaac with the D6.
                        To me it’s dumb to vote for a character considering everything unlocked so I guess we both have a skill issue
            Flight. Spectral. ED6. And Mantle are all amazing and can cause you to easily win any round.

I assume everyone voting thought of the perspective of a Dead God file. So everything unlocked.
    You're just mad that the character you can't play because you suck at the game won lol. keep malding
        lol I already knew Lost would win I’m not malding, I’m more so just a fan of characters who offer more unique play styles and shake up the formula (AKA stuff like Lilith/Eden/T-Mag/T-Samson, Forgotten) and I was thinking of them in base form w/o unlockable upgrades because you can just ret-con characters with those
    Unironic skill issue, the lost is a good character
    Tainted lost is the worst
    this is not about best character but most fun
It was meant to be.
YESSSSSSS
AHHHHH IN SO HAPPY HE TRULY IS THE BEST ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
FUCK YES
GHOST GANG!
The Lost......is not lost!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS
As a rebirth launch day player I am astonished that the worst character has become the favorite. And I agree with this decision, he’s become my favorite as well
For anyone's who's sad that their favourite character didn't win. It doesn't matter nothing can change your love and fun you have with them your own opinion matters most so don't get mad at anyone who's happy at the lost winning
    Yeah seriously there’s so many hateful comments from tainted keeper fans good lord
        average reddit user behaviour
FUCK YEAH
Both of this characters are very interesting, but i can understand why lost won, the guaranteed perfection and the chance to reroll with eternal d6
Hell yes! This was really fun guys
I'm so proud of this community 💜
literally tainted keeper had less votes on every single poll than the lost except the last ones. I know scrubs, n00bs, and trolls all united in a conspiracy to push the lost to the top at the end. yall suck. tainted keeper is the best
    Skill issue ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|8906)
this is COMPLETELY accurate. the lost represents the EPITOME of isaac. powerful, risky character that can reroll items with a rng risk… truly the perfect character.
Still personally think Isaac should've one but ggs lost
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined - a tainted eden fan
Yeeeeeees!!!! The lost didn't lost.
Humanity is Lost
People who voted, Tainted Keeper, L + Skill Issue +![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4357)
![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
Yay!
DEAD BABY WINS
i was thinking t keeper would win, but lost is so awesome, we won guys
Look how far my boy has come since the Rebirth days. You can't help but be proud.
MY BOI WON
YES !!!!!
GGS ALL ROUND!

Lost is honestly (imo obviously) the best character in the game.

I think people take flight for granted. Especially on the early floors. The only other characters to get default flight are Azazel and T.Lost, and at times. Flight can get you tons of resources and items.

Spectral is always nice to have

Mantle is a godsend

ED6 lets you reroll more items. Which without birthright theres so many bad items for Lost, that you can reroll them and remove them from the pool

And not needing to worry about taking useless deals that aren't worth the health

And don't even get me started on an EARLY DAMO! Thats just a GG right there
epic
Based
my faith in this community is gone
Binding of Isaac players confirmed for sweaty tryhards. *Posts screenshot of defeating ultra mega satan with the lost with no power ups*.

Why the lost over characters like t Cain or t Judas?
best boi confirmed <3
Well deserved, skill issue checker
LETS GOOOO
You have done a grand job with this vote! It's been a lot of fun!!! Keep it up!
This *isnt* a skill issue
LETTSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LETS GOOO MY DAY ONE CHOICE AND FAVORITE CHARACTER! GGs everyone
I never voted except for last round. Good job Lost
imo, a well a deserved win. I think the Lost is the quintessential BoI character, and although I enjoy T. Keeper, I just don't think it would sit right if he had won, considering how new he is, and how gimmicky he is
THE LOST REIGNS SUPREME 👑
epitome of "be careful who you call ugly in middle school"
Yaaaaaay!!!!
YES
To be fair, I think the time I maxed the lost was my favorite time playing, regarding the gameplay itself at least. I haven't played t.keeper but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be as good.
I'm happy with this. T.Isaac is still my favorite, but the lost is classic, iconic, and overall a great character
Remember when people hated the Lost when he came out? I remember. Can’t believe we made it this far.
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Epic
Who ever thought the die in one hit character would be the best in the game
I wanted Eden to win but both Lost and Tainted Keeper were in my Top 5 so I can't really be mad.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAH BABY THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT!!!

&#x200B;

I've been for him ever since day 1 (well ok maybe i was for T.Lost but that still counts)
Pog champion
tainted forgotten is the winner in my heart, but i give it to the lost
Lost won the game?

That means we all lost the game.
So when is season 2
Well, GGs, peeps. Was holding on for Tainted Keeper, but a LOT of people like The Lost more. I can see why tho
LETS FUCKING GOO!!!! ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO
gg
I knew it
The Lost has clearly come a long way since Rebirth! A true redemption arc if I've ever seen one
Well Fought Lost fans it was excellent fight
Love it!
This election is rigged
Hack fraud fucking poll.  
As always the majority spoils the game with their shit opinions.  
/sarcasm
YEAHHH ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357) KNEW HE WOULD WIN
All my op runs were with the lost, because I always got death's touch for some reason.
LETS GOOOO
Makes sense. Considering the immense pain and suffering T lost brought onto us, the Lost really isn't that bad, and is actually really nice in comparison.
YEAAH LETS GO THATS MY LITTLE GUY I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT
deserved tbh, lost is a great character
Personally would rank t. keeper over lost, but they're still my two favorite characters so I'm happy either way.
Who could've FUCKING GUESSED
I'm so proud ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
I still remember when I first learned of The Lost's existence back in rebirth I thought how could anyone even enjoy this character? Like one hit you re dead it's just impossible to do anything!

After several hours of dying and retrying I came to realize how fun he actually is ❤
I hated the lost in rebirth. I hated him in AB+. But in repentance he truly is the best character.
![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|2357)
Tainted loss is literally better, I have way more completed on him than the lost, how can the best character he a character that isnt affected by half the items in an average run
This was a blast! Should we do it again?
Tainted Keeper fans snorting copium. ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4358)
BEST BOI WOOOHOOOO
T. Keeper mains in SHAMBLES, truly a devastating loss
GG
LETS GOOOO, I wanted my man to win. Th lost is the most fun character and is a good challenge. Devil deals grant awesome fun runes
Of course this is the best character.
the lost more like the won hahaha right
My boy won :D
Tainted keeper fans sound like Trump supporters în the 2020 election rn
As it should be!
Finally this is over. Please don’t do it again
YES!!
I am so proud of this community.
That's unexpected, honestly even though I didn't find most of the top 5 or even top 10 that appealing, I feel as if The Lost does deserve to be number 1, in quite a lot of ways.
wooohooo Lost my boyyyyyyy always knew he'd win (honestly never believed a two-hit char could ever win this contest but whatever, Lost is still cool)
Fuck yeah!!!
ITS MY BOY, i love the Lost
I was rooting for him from the start, absolutely heartwarming to see how far he's come
BASED BASED BASED
Good
GG'S everybody, i also thought that lost would be the winner, T. keeper often loses that challenge aspect, since he gets stupidly powerful very quickly, with the only downside being dependent on your own greed, while has his upsides, his downsides, but is still a fair challenge

i still would like to point my disapointement for how fast T.cain got kicked out of the competition,many don't know that beyond the easy exploit machine and slower console, there's a very unique character, i will release a guide on him when the patch note for console is announced
LETS GOOO CATBOY POWER
🤓🖕
How
Hey, would you look at that! The sub will have content now!
At least the shitty character that deserved low 10 and not top 10 lost - skill issue + L to all the clowns voting him 😎✊🏿
Thank god it’s over and this BS will get out of my feed
Time for the items!
So all of the characters Lost
i just want to say i’ve been following through this since the very first poll and that i really appreciate all the effort put into this, i never commented but i always loved waking up to view these. thank you all for makin my days better
Rest in peace, everyone. You tried your best.

(You too, Lost.)
I honestly thought T.Keeper would've win since the beginning damn.
But I'm glad it made it to top 2
I just lost the game
I see the lost has won even tho his name says he lost
I purposely didn't unlock the lost when I was getting dookied on in repentance when I had the lost poster cuz I didn't want to rage. But now that I want the lost I can't find the lost poster anywhere ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4358)
How ironic.
the lost everywhere but in our hearts
I did not expect this
This is now the binding of the lost. Congrats
I think I will do some infographics with the data this weekend, just for fun.
ding dang darn
WOW! I heard t. keeper is fan favorite, im actually surprised, congratulations lost mains! i wish you find a dead cat every day....that sounded dark.....
    Tainted keeper being "the best character" is just herd psychology lol.
Congrats
Darn I thought t keeper would win but i definetly see why lost one
Malding rn
grimly predictable
you should've said "round whatever of character eliminations" and only give one choice, to eliminate the lost, so no characters would be left.
His victory only reflects our desire to have perfect hitless runs.
    I think he used a mantle between votes
        This was rigged, as a single character could be voted out per round, he possibly got hit once, but at the next round he regenerated his mantle.

Pretty sure T.Lost couldn't find another card lmao
    It was holding R until you get Holy Mantle in the first Treasure Room and 9 Lives in the Devil Deal.
Probably wouldn’t have voted in his favor during AB+ either, but the Eternal D6 just seals the deal for me
    He was my fav in AB+ by far, but now I can't even remember how he is in repentance because of the absurd ammount of games I had to play to complete Tainted Lost.

I think getting one mantle per room would feel OP now.
    AB+ Lost was great. Sure you didn't have the ED6 but you just took entire devil deal rooms for free.
        Until you got an item you didn't liked, thought "hey, that's why he carries the d4 right?"... and deleted your mantle
            you guys actually used the d4?
                Well, if you are about to restart because the first floor was shit, may as well try to reroll.

It did never work for me lmao
                When it doesn't get rid of my only form health
                I did it just once because I forgot it would get rid of holy mantle.
                Only when there's lots of batteries to reroll multiple times.
    Perfection is amazing too. Getting a shit ton of consumables feels great, and getting any tear effects is crazy fun.
    I'm going to be honest.  The eternal d6 gets rid of my items like 50% of the time I use it, I swear to God, fuck this God forsaken character.
        80%
            It just runs on Pokemon luck. 30% of the time it works every time.
                You know what they say
"If it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate"
Well they made him like 100x more powerful from where he began now that he starts with spectral tears, Holy Mantle, and Eternal D6.  It's like 3 terrific starting items where he originally had none.  It's practically a different character at this point.
    For what it's worth, he did always effectively start with Transcendence, and flight is pretty terrific.

It's just that he lacked any innate tools to truly take advantage of it.
He wasn't chosen as the best he was chosen as the least worst. This is because we were always voting for our least favorite
He is fun with holy mantle, but otherwise really hard and frustrating. I really like both version of the Forgotten because of how unusual they are. Not sure when Azazel got voted out. I bet my left nut that that's probably the character that really unlocked the game for many people.
    Azazel is too easy. I'd guess that Azazel is one of the less played characters for more experienced players outside of very difficult unlocks just because after a while steamrolling everything with basically zero effort just gets boring. 

The lost starting with holy mantle and eternal d6 actually makes him extremely powerful to start, but still risky enough that you can't let your guard down, which adds a lot of tension even after you've mastered the game.
        I love Azazel. It's true, I don't play the character a lot anymore, but Isaac is an incredibly hard game and having an easy character was great, simply to see and unlock content in the first place. It's extremely frustrating not to have any success for a while and that's when the character shines. I also don't think I could ever have managed the thing with Mom's Shovel with a different character.
And somehow fun with gambling
That would be t. Lost
    T. Cain, when played as intended
*"why are there two of everyone"*
    "WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE"
        "THEY TOOK WHAT AWAY FROM THE LOST?!"
            “WHO THE FUCK IS BETHANY”
                _markiplier voice_ IS THAT A _**DOUBLE CHARACTER?!**_
                    WHY IS THERE A FUCKING SKELETON?!
                        WE CAN PLAY AS A _**SHOPKEEPER!!?**_

You should post a pic of the planned art or final results!
Do it or drop your mod spot >:(
    if there's no lost tattoo we riot
        No need to riot, I'll post it as proof when I get it, it just might take a bit as the artist I was looking at is pretty heavily booked from the sounds of it.
            Better to get it done right than too soon!
            /subscribe
        You know the old bamboozle = banboozle
        It's time to riot
Yo congrats on getting mod.
    I've been a mod for like a year and a half now but thanks lmao
        legit didnt notice lmao.
WHERE IS
    Frankly no damn clue, I still haven't been contacted back and unfortunately everything's been crazy in my life the past few months.
Tattoo update?
    Moving, transitioning and living has taken up most my funds and resources. Thinking of getting it shortly though as a friend of a friend is doing some on the cheaper end.
        Well?
        !remindme 6 months
        Talk to ya in 6 months :)
Ayyy
Based
kinda mad you're not getting a tattoo of my face but guess lost is cool too
    Well I'd need a reference pic for that, now wouldn't I?
Based and possibly even redpilled, could even be poggers. Perhaps a little KomodoHype.
And the Keeper, the Loser
    Its tainted loser actually
        "It's  acTuAlLy GarBage"
            I dont have tainted keeper unlocked
    The weeper
        Tainted Seether
Even though I wanted forgor to win this is hilarious
Find it interesting how before the one on one vote, the lost was actually loosing to the tainted keeper when the votes were split between more than two.
    I feel like if this was poll was made anywhere that isn't this sub, Lost would have been gone long time ago

People here really like him
        Clearly other subs have a skill issue
        Fr
    Duh, he still had the mantle.
It's so weird how in round 22 somehow one comment caused a massive amount of votes against tainted isaac
    wait what happened?
        Before round 23, someone made a comment saying Broken Isaac should go out because he was too linear and had runs feel too similar.
            Which I still think is a dumb criticism of the character, before that I had never seen anyone saying that tainted isaac felt samey, and in my experience his runs were pretty varied in terms of item combos
                Based off videos I've seen and general opinions in Issac circles, Broken Isaac is kind of an acquired taste.

Everyone will acknowledge he can be powerful, but a lot of ppl love just stacking a bunch of item effects big and small.

Personally, I don't care about stacking a lot of item effects, I like making small builds. T. Isaac lets you do that all the time while having the option to switch back if your nee build is worse.

I want to streak as him once I unlock all the major Mega Satan + Mother + Deli + Beast unlocks.
            Which is really weird considering how repetitive Lost is lol.
            Well hes not wrong lol
                It's an acquired taste.

He's linear for a lot of ppl, but really interesting for me.
By how many votes did The Lost win?
    Tainted keeper got 167 more votes, t. Keeper got 2762 votes and the lost got 2595
        By the skin of his chinny chin chin
        Now I need a ranking of each character by how many votes they got overall across all of the polls
now do one with items
    Everyone, I am proud to announce that the winner of the item elimination game is…. ~~Death Certificate!~~ Lil Loki!
        Funny way of spelling brother bobby
            Funny way of spelling Breakfast

                        How did you find this chain? it's 2 weeks old!
                        Funny way of spelling glitched crown
        I unironically believe Sissy Longlegs would (and should) win.
    there was a few posts like that a while ago when this meme was at it's peak. They removed like 16 items a round I think but it was still completely overwhelming and it died.

I think if we wanted to do that we could go item pool by item pool and then another one with the winners of each pool.
        yeah or like by quality 4, 3 etc.
    C-Section would win
        My choice would be Glitched Crown
        That or death certificate
            Just remove all items that let you get other items(glitched crown, death certificate, genesis, etc)
                Just make it for tear modifiers, easy entertainment. Also, hemolacruia or ludo for me.
        Well...
Interesting that tainted keeper had less votes than lost for every round in the top 10 except the last.
total de votos kkkkj

Thank you for this series of posts, it was really fun ;D
    será q ele é br? kkkk.
[mfw second worst character in my list is the winner](https://youtu.be/2j-RxfZ2Gco?t=49)
    Skill issue
    Here's my list, from the worst characters to the best 

T Lost, Lost, T Maggie, Laz, BB, Samson, Maggie, Beth, T Beth, Isaac, T Azazel, Eve, T apolly, Keeper, Lilith, Judas, T Forg (17'th split), T eve, Forg, Eden, T Isaac, T Judas, T Samson, T Keeper, Azazel, T Cain, J&E, T Laz, T Eden, T Lilith, T BB, Apollyon, T Jacob, Cain

Hey, at least worst character didn't get to top 10 and mah boi Cain did it, he's the best since 2011
        I don't even care about the list I'm just happy to see someone rightfully putting Cain on the top
            I'm just known Lost complainer in this poll so I put this list for those who wonder what characters I find enjoyable or annoying, maybe someone will have questions to me because the list looks pretty unconventional even beyond Reddit tboi community (excluding Losts being in the last row). I also have Dead God achievement, if that matters.
        Ah a fellow T. Jacob enjoyer.
            I felt emptiness inside myself when I tried to get marks on him before the patch. And then I dropped the game at some moment. 

After the patch, I checked if Lost Jacob gets holy mantle. I got dissapointed, but didn't gave up and still gave it a try. Didn't regret and he fastly became my favourite. I'd still give a neutral opinion on him if patch wouldn't happen, because I like the concept, but would say it's badly implemented in the game.
    put a headphone warning on that you dick.
Thank you for doing these posts, reading the many discussions that resulted from them was really interesting!
NNNNOOOOOO KEEPER
I haven't played in a while so I gotta ask, why did Lazarus lost so early? In which way is he bad or uninteresting to play?
That’s why holy mantle is op ;)
    I think it doesnt work like that but k
        it recharged between rounds
He looted Dead Cat.
    From a first floor curse room ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4358)
Day 502 of voting host hat
    Host hat only with characters with no red heart containers.  Pyromaniac on those with.
Bosses?
    That's a good idea, but champion bloat will be the first one out lmao
        Havent unlocked champion bosses but fuck the bloat
            Wait you have to unlock champion bosses?
                Pretty sure, ive never seen any champions and i have over 150 hours
    I think we all know who would be voted out first.. Duke of flies. ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4357)
Literally my 2 favourite characters. I'd probably choose T Keeper as number one but I'm overall pretty happy about the result.
T Azazel post-patch is super fun. He's definitely in my top 5
Azazels I can agree on, but I love playing T Cain so much

Even if it takes me an hour to get to the fifth floor...
    T Cain is fun for me once per month, just crafting 3 r keys and getting my favorite combo Brimstone + Polyphemus + Sacred Heart + Mom's Knife + Tech X
tazazels not bad
\>:( stop insulting my main like that
    That makes a lot of sense.
Plot twist: Everyone misread it as 'vote for your favorite character'
    Would be great to do it in that reverse order.
        "Which one is your favorite character?:


The Lost, the Lost, the Lost, the Lost or the Lost?"
Maybe after  Isaac 2 first big dlc.
Should've been Forgotten, but ah well
    Agreed. Hands down my favourite. Tainted Keeper is awesome too.
If you pretend Lost is a wackier version of the Soul, Forgotten still won
💀💀 gang rise up
I think forgor💀 would have won easily in AB+ but with lost having eternal d6 and perfection he is more fun now.
    It's pretty impressive that he is the highest character that wasn't added or massively changed in repentance, the only buff was that he can now take deals with bone hearts
he is too easy and becomes boring quick
    Get good
        I said he is too easy. I am too good
            False, you are bad. At the game, at life, at having fun.
cry about it
    Binding of Isaac moment
        Me when I throw teeth at my mom (I'm trying to go to womb I)
            Me when I get cancer (this is a great tears up)
                Me peeing on nerve endings in my mom's womb (i need to clear this room)
    *TEARS UP* + Ratio + Bad trip + L + Feels like i'm walking on sunshine!
Indeed
My satisfaction is incalculable and my day is intact
For me it's the fact that he's extremely high risk high reward. Eternal D6 with free devil deals insanely overpowered. Sure, a lot of your runs with him ends with you dead but playing with him is so much fun I honestly don't even mind.
honestly sometimes feels like a hiveming of people saying "duh **insert challenge charecter but not the lost** is worse than the lost"

*literally how tho*
    T. Lost existing
Holy mantle, free Devil deals, Ghost tears, fly, eternal d6.. Hes high risk high reward, and hes still easier than other characters. I find him funny
I know right, i never play as lost because he’s completely inferior
    sounds like skill issue to me
        Your moms a skill issue
            keep malding
![gif](giphy|TL2Yr3ioe78tO)
Ja, agreed
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!

Imagine being this salty over a character competiton on reddit lol.  
Also, skill issue, get good at the game.
Mald harder, I wanna drink some of your salty tears.
1. skill issue is a joke phrase, everyone knows Lost to Delirium isn't fair
2. **This is for fun.** Lost is genuinely fun for a lot.
2. Personally voted out Miser Keeper because he snowballs too easily; by depths 1, I've already won from shops.
2. skill issue
    [removed]
        Why do you type like this
            Its a skill issue and my father was unkind
                Is your mother an alcoholic who gambled your family's life savings away?
The Lost Is the only completed character i still play. Hes way easier than a lot of other challenge characters, he has free Devil deals, eternal d6, starts with holy mantle, has ghost tears and fly. Hes not the strongest character but that doesnt make him unfunny to play. Maybe YOU completed them thanks to the RNG this just projection?
    [removed]
        >mansplaining

Lmao

Also, no need to be salty. Just because you completed them thanks to RNG doesnt mean everyone did. Maybe people just like some challenge?  This Is just skill issue ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
            Lol did I just get pwnd? XD
                Nice reddit gold btw kind stranger
I agree, very based, as they say
you're actually incredibly based and I agree with the things you said
oh cmon now it was clever :(
Correction: both of them viciously murdered hundreds of cats to stay alive (1 vote = 1 skill issue for that character)
azazel boring and pretty standard.
Far from the worse statistically
“Statistically the worst” what “math” are you doing lol. I bet you graduated top of your class in the navy seals and have over 300 confirmed kills as well
    You literally die in 1 hit. The Lost at base is the literal most garbage character in the game.
        Hes tankier than all other characters in the game. With how many characters can you take a hit every single room without dying or losing deals?
            Damn people really don’t remember that the lost once unlocked does not start with holy mantle. Sure holy mantle eHP is deceiving but at base when unlocked without any upgrades the character is complete garbage lol
                Because no one is considering characters without their unlocks acquired. Keeper is pain at his base, but very fun w/ the HP-Up and Wooden Nickel

Base Lost is worse than Baleful Lost. They should fo what someone else said and make Mantle apart of him normally,  but tie ed6 to the 879 Greed machine unlock
        My point was that there is no mathematical/scientific formula to determine how easy it is to win with a character, personally I find J+E harder than mantless lost
            How, you literally die in one hit
            At least you can take damage as J&E
        you die in 2 hits, that replenish every room. He's tankier than keeper imo.  he also has spectral and flight which is huge and one of the strongest starting items.
            The Lost at base does not have holy mantle. Out of all these characters at base the interesting and well designed ones would be stuff like Bethany, Lilith, Eden, Forgotten because they don’t die in 1 hit at all stages of the game, while also introducing interesting unique mechanics.
                Its dumb to vote without considering the character with everything unlocked. Im pretty sure everyone voted considering The Lost with the mantle, Eve with the razor,  keeper with the wooden nickel, and Isaac with the D6.
                    To me it’s dumb to vote for a character considering everything unlocked so I guess we both have a skill issue
        Flight. Spectral. ED6. And Mantle are all amazing and can cause you to easily win any round.

I assume everyone voting thought of the perspective of a Dead God file. So everything unlocked.
You're just mad that the character you can't play because you suck at the game won lol. keep malding
    lol I already knew Lost would win I’m not malding, I’m more so just a fan of characters who offer more unique play styles and shake up the formula (AKA stuff like Lilith/Eden/T-Mag/T-Samson, Forgotten) and I was thinking of them in base form w/o unlockable upgrades because you can just ret-con characters with those
Unironic skill issue, the lost is a good character
Tainted lost is the worst
this is not about best character but most fun
Yeah seriously there’s so many hateful comments from tainted keeper fans good lord
    average reddit user behaviour
Skill issue ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|8906)
Tainted keeper being "the best character" is just herd psychology lol.
I think he used a mantle between votes
    This was rigged, as a single character could be voted out per round, he possibly got hit once, but at the next round he regenerated his mantle.

Pretty sure T.Lost couldn't find another card lmao
It was holding R until you get Holy Mantle in the first Treasure Room and 9 Lives in the Devil Deal.
He was my fav in AB+ by far, but now I can't even remember how he is in repentance because of the absurd ammount of games I had to play to complete Tainted Lost.

I think getting one mantle per room would feel OP now.
AB+ Lost was great. Sure you didn't have the ED6 but you just took entire devil deal rooms for free.
    Until you got an item you didn't liked, thought "hey, that's why he carries the d4 right?"... and deleted your mantle
        you guys actually used the d4?
            Well, if you are about to restart because the first floor was shit, may as well try to reroll.

It did never work for me lmao
            When it doesn't get rid of my only form health
            I did it just once because I forgot it would get rid of holy mantle.
            Only when there's lots of batteries to reroll multiple times.
Perfection is amazing too. Getting a shit ton of consumables feels great, and getting any tear effects is crazy fun.
I'm going to be honest.  The eternal d6 gets rid of my items like 50% of the time I use it, I swear to God, fuck this God forsaken character.
    80%
        It just runs on Pokemon luck. 30% of the time it works every time.
            You know what they say
"If it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate"
For what it's worth, he did always effectively start with Transcendence, and flight is pretty terrific.

It's just that he lacked any innate tools to truly take advantage of it.
Azazel is too easy. I'd guess that Azazel is one of the less played characters for more experienced players outside of very difficult unlocks just because after a while steamrolling everything with basically zero effort just gets boring. 

The lost starting with holy mantle and eternal d6 actually makes him extremely powerful to start, but still risky enough that you can't let your guard down, which adds a lot of tension even after you've mastered the game.
    I love Azazel. It's true, I don't play the character a lot anymore, but Isaac is an incredibly hard game and having an easy character was great, simply to see and unlock content in the first place. It's extremely frustrating not to have any success for a while and that's when the character shines. I also don't think I could ever have managed the thing with Mom's Shovel with a different character.
T. Cain, when played as intended
"WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE"
    "THEY TOOK WHAT AWAY FROM THE LOST?!"
        “WHO THE FUCK IS BETHANY”

Host hat only with characters with no red heart containers.  Pyromaniac on those with.
That's a good idea, but champion bloat will be the first one out lmao
    Havent unlocked champion bosses but fuck the bloat
        Wait you have to unlock champion bosses?
            Pretty sure, ive never seen any champions and i have over 150 hours
I think we all know who would be voted out first.. Duke of flies. ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4357)
T Cain is fun for me once per month, just crafting 3 r keys and getting my favorite combo Brimstone + Polyphemus + Sacred Heart + Mom's Knife + Tech X
That makes a lot of sense.
Would be great to do it in that reverse order.
    "Which one is your favorite character?:


The Lost, the Lost, the Lost, the Lost or the Lost?"
Agreed. Hands down my favourite. Tainted Keeper is awesome too.
It's pretty impressive that he is the highest character that wasn't added or massively changed in repentance, the only buff was that he can now take deals with bone hearts
Get good
    I said he is too easy. I am too good
        False, you are bad. At the game, at life, at having fun.
Binding of Isaac moment
    Me when I throw teeth at my mom (I'm trying to go to womb I)
        Me when I get cancer (this is a great tears up)
            Me peeing on nerve endings in my mom's womb (i need to clear this room)
*TEARS UP* + Ratio + Bad trip + L + Feels like i'm walking on sunshine!
T. Lost existing
sounds like skill issue to me
    Your moms a skill issue
        keep malding
Your life is bad game design

        Lol did I just get pwnd? XD
            Nice reddit gold btw kind stranger
You literally die in 1 hit. The Lost at base is the literal most garbage character in the game.
    Hes tankier than all other characters in the game. With how many characters can you take a hit every single room without dying or losing deals?
        Damn people really don’t remember that the lost once unlocked does not start with holy mantle. Sure holy mantle eHP is deceiving but at base when unlocked without any upgrades the character is complete garbage lol
            Because no one is considering characters without their unlocks acquired. Keeper is pain at his base, but very fun w/ the HP-Up and Wooden Nickel

Base Lost is worse than Baleful Lost. They should fo what someone else said and make Mantle apart of him normally,  but tie ed6 to the 879 Greed machine unlock
    My point was that there is no mathematical/scientific formula to determine how easy it is to win with a character, personally I find J+E harder than mantless lost
        How, you literally die in one hit
        At least you can take damage as J&E
    you die in 2 hits, that replenish every room. He's tankier than keeper imo.  he also has spectral and flight which is huge and one of the strongest starting items.
        The Lost at base does not have holy mantle. Out of all these characters at base the interesting and well designed ones would be stuff like Bethany, Lilith, Eden, Forgotten because they don’t die in 1 hit at all stages of the game, while also introducing interesting unique mechanics.
            Its dumb to vote without considering the character with everything unlocked. Im pretty sure everyone voted considering The Lost with the mantle, Eve with the razor,  keeper with the wooden nickel, and Isaac with the D6.
                To me it’s dumb to vote for a character considering everything unlocked so I guess we both have a skill issue
    Flight. Spectral. ED6. And Mantle are all amazing and can cause you to easily win any round.

I assume everyone voting thought of the perspective of a Dead God file. So everything unlocked.
lol I already knew Lost would win I’m not malding, I’m more so just a fan of characters who offer more unique play styles and shake up the formula (AKA stuff like Lilith/Eden/T-Mag/T-Samson, Forgotten) and I was thinking of them in base form w/o unlockable upgrades because you can just ret-con characters with those
average reddit user behaviour
This was rigged, as a single character could be voted out per round, he possibly got hit once, but at the next round he regenerated his mantle.

Pretty sure T.Lost couldn't find another card lmao
Until you got an item you didn't liked, thought "hey, that's why he carries the d4 right?"... and deleted your mantle
    you guys actually used the d4?
        Well, if you are about to restart because the first floor was shit, may as well try to reroll.

It did never work for me lmao
        When it doesn't get rid of my only form health
        I did it just once because I forgot it would get rid of holy mantle.
        Only when there's lots of batteries to reroll multiple times.
80%
    It just runs on Pokemon luck. 30% of the time it works every time.
        You know what they say
"If it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate"
I love Azazel. It's true, I don't play the character a lot anymore, but Isaac is an incredibly hard game and having an easy character was great, simply to see and unlock content in the first place. It's extremely frustrating not to have any success for a while and that's when the character shines. I also don't think I could ever have managed the thing with Mom's Shovel with a different character.

No need to riot, I'll post it as proof when I get it, it just might take a bit as the artist I was looking at is pretty heavily booked from the sounds of it.

Before round 23, someone made a comment saying Broken Isaac should go out because he was too linear and had runs feel too similar.
    Which I still think is a dumb criticism of the character, before that I had never seen anyone saying that tainted isaac felt samey, and in my experience his runs were pretty varied in terms of item combos
        Based off videos I've seen and general opinions in Issac circles, Broken Isaac is kind of an acquired taste.

Everyone will acknowledge he can be powerful, but a lot of ppl love just stacking a bunch of item effects big and small.

Personally, I don't care about stacking a lot of item effects, I like making small builds. T. Isaac lets you do that all the time while having the option to switch back if your nee build is worse.

I want to streak as him once I unlock all the major Mega Satan + Mother + Deli + Beast unlocks.
    Which is really weird considering how repetitive Lost is lol.
    Well hes not wrong lol
        It's an acquired taste.

He's linear for a lot of ppl, but really interesting for me.
By the skin of his chinny chin chin
Now I need a ranking of each character by how many votes they got overall across all of the polls

                Funny way of spelling glitched crown
I unironically believe Sissy Longlegs would (and should) win.
yeah or like by quality 4, 3 etc.
My choice would be Glitched Crown
That or death certificate
    Just remove all items that let you get other items(glitched crown, death certificate, genesis, etc)
        Just make it for tear modifiers, easy entertainment. Also, hemolacruia or ludo for me.
Well...
I don't even care about the list I'm just happy to see someone rightfully putting Cain on the top
    I'm just known Lost complainer in this poll so I put this list for those who wonder what characters I find enjoyable or annoying, maybe someone will have questions to me because the list looks pretty unconventional even beyond Reddit tboi community (excluding Losts being in the last row). I also have Dead God achievement, if that matters.
Ah a fellow T. Jacob enjoyer.
    I felt emptiness inside myself when I tried to get marks on him before the patch. And then I dropped the game at some moment. 

After the patch, I checked if Lost Jacob gets holy mantle. I got dissapointed, but didn't gave up and still gave it a try. Didn't regret and he fastly became my favourite. I'd still give a neutral opinion on him if patch wouldn't happen, because I like the concept, but would say it's badly implemented in the game.
