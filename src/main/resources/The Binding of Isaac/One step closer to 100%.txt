no unlockables lost
    seriously the lost went from garbage tier to my favorite character as soon as I unlocked holy mantle
        The Lost was the second character I got all the completion marks for, right behind Isaac. Tainted Lost on the other hand…
            Not exatcly the second but same, I completed a few characters then was like "Fuck it, I want  P A I N"
And I don't regret it.
            At least Tainted Lost runs are fun until you die.
        I beat the lamb with base Lost and decided to try and push for all marks, but then I got addicted to greed mode and ruined it
            played through the dlcs in order, really gave me an appreciation for the players who couldnt buy ab even if they wanted to. 100%ed ab+ four days ago and lost is complete, now my favorite character (:
                I downloaded AB at platinum god, I will get real platinum god in AB, I can’t stand rebirth lost (btw tainted lost is just easier rebirth lost)
                    Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
                        Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
        Same.
        How do you feel about Baleful Lost?
            is that tainted lost? because i think he's really cool but im not talented enough to get anywhere with him
        I am on like 770 coins, almost unlocked
    the post said "the worst", not "the best"
        OG rebirth lost
        He meant Tainted Lost
            And?

Tainted Lost is even more fun.
                I’d rather play T lost than most other characters, best mixture of challenge and strong builds
                    T Isaac is God.
                        This was a Lilith thing
                            I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
                                I hate Lilith
                                    She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                                    please explain why
                Agree.  But after getting all his unlocks.
                    Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
                        I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
                            I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
                                Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                                    It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
                            tainted jacob is really fun
                No he isn't.
            That's the best tainted (alongside with TKeeper)
    Tainted lost like "No Mantle! Whoa! Can you guys imagine playing as lost without the mantle!?" and im out here as someone who doesn't play greed mode like "damn thats crazy imagine a lost with no mantle but better items."
        I think he is relatively well balanced with the higher chance for a holy card, I quite enjoy his tainted counterpart
            I just find it amusing that if you don't have a high greed mode donation count, T.Lost is just... a Straight Upgrade to regular lost.
                with the added addition of holy cards which makes it even better
                    he truly is
                He literally is, yes.
                I haven't bought repentance yet, so I haven't tried playing with tainted characters yet, but what changes if you have a high donation count?
                    Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
                        Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
                        Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
                            On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
        I did that for a bit because I didn’t know about holy mantle at first. Somehow I got lucky and beat Hush, Boss Rush, AND Delirium without holy mantle, but after that my luck ended and I couldn’t complete the rest without it. I racked up nearly 200 losses before someone told me about unlocking permanent holy mantle for the lost.
    I still give that to tainted jacob. Especially pre update
    Trying to unlock Godhead with Lost is driving me fucking insane.
Rebirth Lost  
Afterbirth Keeper  
Jacob & Esau  
Pre-Patch T. Laz. 

Yeah, there are a few good picks for this meme.
    Rebirth Lost was managable with a lucky Dead Cat. AB Keeper on the other hand was Edmund’s hatechild
        we shouldn't have unjammed that damned coin machine
        AB Keeper was manageable by Swallowed Penny on chapter 1 + Sacrifice Rooms
            I beat all marks with ab keeper and what I liked about him was as you completed marks you unlocked items to start with that made him a bit easier. I’m sad that T characters don’t have unlocks like that.
                YES! Finally someone who gets it!

The character unlocks make them all more unique and powerful but requires a bit more effort to get to. Tell me, would Isaac be anywhere near as interesting without the D6? Maggy without a Full Health pill? Cain without Paperclip? Keeper without Wooden Nickel and Shop Key? Lazarus without Anemic, Eve without Razor Blade, Lost without Holy Mantle, and... Samson without childs heart i guess...

The problem with the Tainted Characters, however, is that they aren't at all as simple as the normal ones. There's not much you can do to make the Tainted Characters get an extra starting bonus that adds onto what they already have and make them more interesting without making them overpowered. They're already really complex, so it's hard to balance them with just a little more.

Baleful Lost with Wooden Cross, T Isaac with D4, T Samson with Samson's Lock, T Keeper with Head of the Keeper, T ??? with Brown Cap, all of these are the most fitting things I could think of for each of them, but it would either be underwhelming or busted.
                    I like a lot of those ideas. I also don’t really like t lost’s birthright. It seems so boring. I wish they would somehow make it more interesting.
                        I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
        Pre-patch T. Laz is, I think, probably the most legitimately bad one that could go for 'worst playable character ever conceived'

Keeper could at least pop off with items normally and abuse Swallowed Penny first floor before it got hard.  Rebirth Lost could get 9 lives.

J&E can certainly feel bad, but people honestly overexaggerate their flaws without all their benefits too (have 2x dps, hold 2x actives, trinkets, and cards).

&#x200B;

But there was literally no way to play T. Laz before without feeling useless. Two characters, but half items.
        AB Keeper was like digging up a dirt field with a teaspoon. Sheer misery. I think I spent 150 hours of the 500 I put into Rebirth/AB+ just doing his post it note.
    I heard all the bad things about J&E but when I played him I thought it was fine, you get a lot more firepower and besides a select few rooms/bosses (mega satan p2), it was pretty easy to just treat them like 1 hitbox. I guess item balancing was a bit annoying? But I just threw all the dmg up on 1 guy then synergy items on the other.
        My problem is that there are certain room and bosses that were just not made for that character. You can lose so much health for no reason when that happens.
            As opposed to the bullshit instant hit rooms for T.Lost. Everyone here exaggerates J&E difficulty and T.Lost fun
                I like T. Lost because you get good base stats + flying + spectral tears at the start and you have a lot higher chance of getting good items/fun builds. Obviously the downside is death, but it's fun juggling around holy cards and there are a good amount of items like hourglass/blank card that can keep you pretty safe. I've found that most bs instant hit rooms for T.Lost are genuinely avoidable/dodgable (tho obv some still exist)
                    Idk even know if death is a bad side of t.lost for me personally. I do like shorter runs and a 20-30 minute run that gets you to womb or even further before you die is much better paced than 45m to an hour on a single run where you do win.

I always view playing t.lost as almost like playing a level on Super meat boy or the end is nigh, just go fast, go hard and dont expect to win, but eventually you will.
                        I don‘t know even know
                    there is no downside of death if you just dodge bozo ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
            idk I played him for unlocks and beat like at least isaac/satan/etc and throughout like 5+ runs i'd never run into some doomed room where it I lost more than like 2 hits
        I can see people not quite having the same problems in using them, but personally I don't find myself wanting to play as them over other characters, I feel a single stronger hit box is better than 2 weaker ones.
            I guess that's true, my favorite character to play it tainted lost and while I don't mind playing J&E, I don't really feel like playing him outside of like 2 player coop for the memes
        Yea i expected to hate them and even avoided playing for a bit. But I did a run with them and I died twice in the basement getting used to em, then on the third run I managed to kill mega satan w a great build and thought they were actually really strong. If u go the alt path u can grab both items at once so u have like double the treasure room items. And u can do the same thing w devil and angle rooms so I had a couple extra angle room items. U get extra items, double firepower 2 trinkets/actives/pills etc. and even more with items like school bag. They honestly just felt op. If u just get a tiny bit good at keeping them together u can just be super strong. I had no issue with them and really thought they were completely op. I don’t understand the dislike at all
            Some rooms and bosses feel pretty awful with them, that's pretty much it.

The Mother chase sequence for Knife Piece 2 is an obvious example
    Afterbirth Keeper is legitimately one of the worst playable characters I’ve ever used LMAO. love ed and love this game but *man* that character was some serious shit.
    [I use this mod for Jacob and Esau](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670308247&searchtext=) and it admittedly makes them a lot more fun, but borderline impossible
    Totally agree. I’m almost done with T lost and I only have a few for j and e. I hate Jacob Esau so damn much. I just don’t want to even play them.
    I daresay base Apollyon is the worst character.
        Wait, how? He's literally a base character but with the added benefit of turning shit items into stats. Like what's the downside at all?
        my only gripes with apollyon is that he's a bit boring and managing his item charge feels more annoying than other characters
        Damn a base stat character with 2HP and a tier 4 item. Worthless.
    Don’t even get me started on afterbirth keeper
??? moment
    He isn't even bad, just boring. Difficulty-wise he's like a low C-tier. I feel like all he needs is just one extra item to start with, even just a petrified poop
        i had the idea of giving him an item that lets him stomp red hearts like with apple of sodom, each half heart’s worth giving him tears/damage for the current floor. too bad he’s pretty much confirmed to be staying as he is
    I like my healthy dose of challenge without wanting to rip my hair out (unlike some other characters). 

And at least I don't have to hold onto a boring as hell active item because it's "objectively better than anything else" (looking at you Isaac), I want some variety in my runs and Poop alone has more possible uses than D6.
This is me after buying Repentance recently and unlocking Jacob & Esau the other day.
    I hate them so much.
    Install mods please, there is 2 mods that make him actually enjoyable and fair, later i send link
        Can't believe people are downvoting me because i use mods to enjoy a singleplayer game lmaooo
        I'm not on PC
            May god help you
Jacob and esau
    Original keeper
        I’d rather play original keeper than jacob esau
            These are some bold fucking words
            Actually I agree with this.
        I dont play anymore but got 1200 hours in this game. Is keeper kinda buffed or esau is way worse character?
            Keeper got buffed in Repentance to be able to hold 3 coin hearts w/ a hp-up or Hush unlock, he can no longer lose deal chances from getting hit, and devil deals also cost money instead of health.

I think he also got a minor tears up, but he's just...actually playable now. The buffs sound bigger than they are in a vacuum and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents
                > and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents

no the fuck you can't because keeper literally couldn't take 2-heart devil deals without an extra life or a Strength card, and even those left you 1 hit from death until you found an HP up
                    Also I’m not sure if this was changed but brim made him unplayable. First of all it was so rare to find brim but to actually take it and live , well you needed to be damn lucky, with extra lives or s card. But then the charge was so horrific that it wasn’t even worth it.
                        Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
                    That's what I meant by 'argue for,'

It's only a nerf if you had HP-ups showered about, which can sometimes be the case. Also wouldn't be as bad since you can spawn with 3 hearts now after Hush.

&#x200B;

Either way, this usually results in me skipping the first devil deal for a free angel deal later since I wouldn't have the money typically
        Hot take tainted keeper for low health
            tainted keeper is the definition of a glass cannon, but it doesn't mean he's bad
                He’s a stressful character, but also one of my favorites
                Tainted keeper greedier mode is the hardest thing I’ve done in Th is game other than mother route for tainted Jacob.
                    What? Just reset for a 7 cent item, then buy the shit out of it. He is honestly like the easiest Greedier character out there aside from Lilith.
                Eh I think he's pretty bad. He's like the lost minus the flight and spectral and less firepower (Lost has more firepower via devil deals, perfection and dice)

I also find myself dying trying to get back the health I lost. Idk. I think J&E and Lost are both way easier than t keeper for example.
                    You can get like 4 items a floor + angel and devil deals + you have pretty much infinite cash. He's easily the strongest offensive character in the game with his ability to quickly outpace even azazel, you're just wrong.
                        Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
                            Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
                            This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
                        Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
                            1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
                                Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
                                    Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
                            I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
                                Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
                                    Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
                        T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
                            He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
                    I think that T. Keeper is the strongest character in the game while being fairly challenging. The fact alone that you can get to normal tear cap while having quad shot makes him really strong.
Of course you need some luck with the shops but if you do he can get very strong very fast.
The big difference between him and Lost or Jacob & Esau is that you have to play very aggressive with t. Keeper while the Lost can be played extremely cautious as courtesy of his flight and spectral.
                        You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
                            If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
                                It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                                    Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                                    Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
                                Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                                    I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
                    No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
            It's just lost health but you can recharge the mantle with money
            Tainted Keeper has a lot of similar issues to AB+ Keeper, but one major bonus he gets in his favor is that enemies are very likely to drop money when killed.

I still kinda think he should have had 3HP max after a health upgrade, though. Right now, too much emphasis is put on finding stuff like Holy Mantle, Mother's Kiss or Greed's Gullet. Hell, maybe Tainted Keeper should have just started with Greed's Gullet. Make money an actual tradeoff.
                I don’t at all think finding any of those things are a big concern with T Keeper. Literally any of them are an instant win IMO, his offensive power is so great. if he started with greeds gullet I guarantee you could hit a 3 digit win streak easily lol, he’d be the most OP character in the game
                t. keeper should definitely start with deep pockets given how much money you waste after a while
            Not as bad as Jacob and esau (I also don't like appolyon)
                Jacop and Esau are far from bad characters. Double items makes them snowball so fast and they bring so many new strategies by having two active items, consumable and trinkets. The way they designed the controls is dumb though, but after you get used to them they can be such a fun challenge
                    You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
                        You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
                        It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
                Is the reason behind appolyon because his gimmick with the void and no real sustainence
                    I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
                    Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
            I think Tainted Keeper would be so must interesting if he had normal health

Right now the health management for T.Keeper feels so dumb
                thats cuz he is the strongest char with his only weak point being health if he had 3 health he would be just op
                    Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
                        Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
        Original lost (known now as tainted lost)
        The worst thing about the original keeper was bombing the pots in basement 1 and 2 for eons until you got swallowed penny

How are there nearly fifty comments without a single mention of Tainted Eden?
    Because while inherently bad, they aren't awful every time like some other characters
        Untrue, I have never had a good time playing T. Eden. It's gotten to the point where I've just given up on its completion marks because I can't stand playing as them.
            I found it to be slightly more bearable if you play as a soul-heart only character and load up on Devil Room items. It gives you some semi-reliable DPS through rerolls. The tweaks have made it slightly more bearable, but still pretty ass to work through on Switch. Sanity breaks to get marks as other characters is also a necessity.
                Really? I found the opposite to be true. At first I hated Tainted Eden because I would sometimes roll into Dead Cat which is pretty much an instant loss. But then I stopped taking any items from devil deals/curse rooms/red chests (any pool that could possibly reroll into Dead Cat) as them and sticking to the Angel path and I started enjoying them a lot more. I guess limiting yourself to only soul hearts somewhat gets around that as well, but one of my favorite runs as T. Eden was one where I managed to abuse a prayer card to the point that I had a ton of red hearts that couldn't be rerolled away, so I always had plenty of health.
                    By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
                        Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
            Try the d4 glitch
        I think post update they are actually pretty great.
Tainted Jacob, im masochist
    T Jacob is overrated in difficulty; fight me.
        now definitely, but pre-patch he was agonizing to play. just watching your run be destroyed on the dark room because esau decides to give the adversary a hug and gets a brimstone laser to the face in return
            Yeah, before you would eventually learn to play T. Lost because Esau had bad health scaling among other chase mechanics, but now all you have to do is stay out of Esau's charge range
In other games, you unlock new characters because they're fun. In Isaac, you unlock new characters to suffer.
I actually had a ton of fun with J&E once I consigned myself to the torment and got into the groove of how to play them.

Play one as DPS and make the other support, makes it a little more bearable!

Tainted laz is still more or less unplayable in my opinion
    Even after the rework?
        I think so. That said I will admit to some level of bias because normal laz was my least favorite character by far pre-repentence. I've just never found him enjoyable.
            I mean he always has been the most "meh" character, so it's understandable. But imo not only did the rework make Tainted Laz actually playable in the first place, but also made him actually fun. Actually.
                That's fair. Maybe I was a little hyperbolic, but I do hold that tainted laz is the character I'm least happy to play in a given run. I'd take tainted Jacob or tainted lost in a heartbeat over laz.
                    why?
                        I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
                            Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
                            yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
                                >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                                    what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
                                While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
        Maybe if his flip auto charged so I could get both items in any room where I need an item on both characters he would be playable but so often I get stuck unable to get an item from the ped for the character that needs it, or unable to get the other item that is better just becuase there isnt enough rooms to charge it again.
        I really like T. Laz after the Flip rework because it makes devil deals more fun and I've always liked devil rooms more than angel rooms.

Dead Laz has soul hearts, but higher damage (5.25 base)—glass cannon-y at the start. Alive Laz has normal red hearts and stats so what I usually do is just feed him most HP-ups and defensive items then buy at least two devil deals and then **flip** to Dead Laz for two free devil items.

&#x200B;

It helps that the ghost versions of devil items can be a different price, so I could use only 2-3 heart containers for effectively 4-6 hearts of deals ***for free***
    Wdym unplayable it's fun. I had a lot of fun playing with him. It's like j&e but less painful
        I'd much rather play j&e. They at least have a unique gimic as opposed to swapping between two underpowered characters. I just think he's extremely boring
            They're not underpowered if you get luck on first devil deal and boss items
                But surely you see that " it's fun if you get busted items early " is true for literally every character right? If you don't get that they are pretty underpowered and not even in a particularly fun way.
                    I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
                    That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
Tainted Cain IS pretty shitty
    I hate him. I completely hate and refuse using exploits, so playing him on a normal run is just painful. I just feel like no matter what input I do on the bag of crafting I always get shitty items. I wish they would make pickups more abundant and the crafting bag more generous, then the character might actually be fun.
        get the item descriptions mod
        [deleted]
            I know this was sarcasm but by the time I have enough of them I’m already at depths lmao
    I don’t agree
But J&E are technically TWO characters.
This is literally me trying to get Jacob and esau unlocks 😭
Me when beating Jacob and esau
There are a couple characters I haven't even given an honest attempt yet. I'm in no rush. The games given me over a thousand hours of fun so far. And I plan on a couple thousand more.

i never got too into the game, reddit just happened to recommend me this post so now im curious, how bad are the unlockable characters in binding of isaac? there can't be a more insane challenge than completing every zone in one run as coda in crypt of the necrodancer. double speed, you die if you miss a beat or get hit at all, and you can't pick up a better weapon so you're stuck with a 1 damage dagger.
    Never played much Necrodancer, but some of the unlock characters in Issac are just mean. Lost dies to any damage (you can unlock an item to give him a single hit per room.) Keeper uses coins as health and only has 2 coins, so can only get hit twice. You can refill coins by picking up money, but with only 2 total health slots you can't take some of the most powerful items that require trading health. Not even mentioning the Tainted variants of every character. Beating some of the bosses with some characters requires a mix of being incredibly skilled and also get crazy lucky with items.
    I don't think any Isaac character is harder than All Zones Aria or Bolt, although most of that comes down to the pace of the game and amount of focus you need constantly in Necrodancer.
    One-hit-death character in a bullet hell game and they have revive items blacklisted

Thank god they didn't blacklist all the invincibility items though

&#x200B;

Also, double character character in a bullet hell game. They have a lot of benefits, but the downsides also do suck.
Tainted Apollyon is just so boring and weak with his red flies
    Once you hit a critical mass of flies and damage he becomes a powertrain
        while he does become powerful, most of my runs end the same because most items dont have unique flies.
        Those libraries with 4 books hidden behind locked tiles think they're SO smart until I get my locusts to violently rip them apart molecule by molecule
    > Weak with his red flies 

I've killed end game bosses with him with one or two damage ups and the rest of my items as flies. They are far from weak. The stat boosts from Void are weaker than Abyss flies especially because Abyss flies are always a DPS upgrade.

If you said normal Apollyon was kinda weak and boring I'd maybe agree (void can sometimes give you useless stats a whole run) with that, but T. Apollyon runs are hard to lose because the red locusts are so good. Boring, maybe, but still very strong.
        Okay maybe I should’ve worded the comment different. I don’t think he’s very weak but he’s a below average character to me since whenever I play as him his flies end up doing not as much dps  or the same as other characters. The flies can actually dish out good damage against bosses especially stationary ones but against bosses that move a bunch like delirium they start to do less dps. This could just be because of me having bad luck with him or something idk
            Delirium is like the one case where the locusts kinda suck, and that's just because the arena is very big on top of Deli moving around a lot so the locusts will tend to travel a long distance hitting nothing before returning to you. Most other bosses they do just fine if you know how to aim them. On Mother, Hush. Beast, Dogma, and pretty much all other endgame bosses they do fine. One of the few other bosses I can think of where they kinda suck is against Scolex, but that's just Scolex being Scolex.

The one thing you do need to learn with T. Apollyon is min-maxing how many locusts you're getting. There are lots of ways to get extra items to turn into locusts and you want to be using as many as possible. This does mean taking HP ups early on as often as you can so you can play demon beggars and blood donation machines and sacrifice rooms (all sac rooms are +2 locusts minimum if you fully play them out). If you're high on money but don't want what's in the shop, buy it and hit abyss as you hold it above your head (if it's a passive) to turn it into a locust. You can do the same with Alt-path blind items and blind items in general. Look at it while you hold it, if you don't like it, abyss it.
    I beat ultra greed with about 8 flies, the stapler, and the trinket extension cord

Tainted Lost ain't that bad. his Item pool is better.
I don’t see enough T.Forgotten hate.
    Yeeting bones is fun, specially for static bosses like mega satan you can just spam attack button whiñe you focus on dodging
    I've unlocked him and cleared one floor and shelved him for now, not a fan of the mechanic but maybe I'll get used to it?
    T. Forgotten is sick what are you on about
        His play style is very boring and he’s a huge downgrade from the regular forgotten

i got repentance the other day and decided to try to get some unlocks before i went to bed so i played as bethany and went to corpse and finished the run then decided to use J&E just to get a feel got an okay run and kept damaging myself but still went through the other alt path and i’ve gotta say they aren’t a bad addition to the game and i’m somewhat confused why everyone shits on they so bad beside having to get used to how they work
I still don't understand why people willingly play t. Lost/ t. Jacob, losing up to an hour of progress each run in an instant with no second chances is horrible, especially with how much BS the game likes to throw at the player
    T. Lost is fun cause you get spectral and flight and better items and a decent reroll on bad items

T. Jacob is just for people who like playing with fire
    T lost is fun
    They're extremely difficult but genuinely rewarding. Memes aside, Tainted Lost does get better items on average, while Tainted Jacob has a high risk style with his brother doing a lot of damage if you position him right. Now, if they were Rebirth Lost or Pre-Patch T.Jacob...
    Nothing left to complete, and at that point the challenge is fun.
    so they won't have to play J&E
    I love Tainted Lost. Better items is a great trade off for one hit to die, plus flying and spectral tears and taking any devil deals. Every run is fun, and I have a blast. It took a few months but I got all Tainted Lost unlocks. It was just a matter of grinding until I hit the right combination of items, but every run was good and I had fun even though I died.

I have yet to get a single completion mark for Tainted Jacob. I don't care what anybody says, that character is broken as shit. A few times I've reached The Depths, always with base tears and damage. Fought Mom a couple of times and died, that's the closest I've got. Most runs I spend the entire time either one hit from dead with bad items, or continually trying to avoid Dark Esau. It just isn't fun. I can't clear rooms, I'm always in danger, I'm always stressed.

I almost feel like they programmed a secret feature where Tainted Jacon is the counter-part to Tainted Lost and instead of getting good items is only allowed bad items. I've sunk so many hours into it and every run has been terrible. I never get any damage up or tears up. There were characters I didn't like before and things I felt difficult before, but at this point I flat out refuse to play Tainted Jacob. The update made no difference to me. He is a terribly designed character, end of story.
        prepatch t jacob? because i got all completion marks with him now and he was pretty fun. difficult but fun regardless. you also can get free devil deal items if you let esau hit you
So you unlocked Tainted Blue Baby?
    That’s a pretty SHITTY one
    Literal shit, but actually a great character. I still don't get why some people hate him. Way better than base blue baby
        Idk man I just can't play with him. He's the only character I didn't manage to get a single achievement (other than T Eve, T Samson and T Jacob, who I haven't unlocked yet)
            The way I play him is I try to always have a 2-3x poop combo ready.

&#x200B;

Most obvious combo is **Streak + Holy**; streak buffs  damage and also inherits properties of poops. Holy Poop triples tears and damage or something ridiculous. This is a basic boss-killing trick.

**Double Corny** tossed into a corner allows a constant swarm of flies. You also get to walk out with six flies if you wait for them both to fill before leaving the room.

I use this for slow rooms w/ champions, annoyingly big rooms, and also for bosses if I can't get a holy poop because holy poops are definitely rarer than others.

**Fire + Poison** = mega explosion. Easy burst.

Same for **Bomb + Poison**, and the same interactions happens with **Farts** and **Diarrhea**

**Fire** *or* **Poison + Streak** makes the streak damage enemies and inherit Fire Mind/Poison tears.

**Stone Poops** can take more damage than the others and make for good cover. They also do more damage when tossed (15 normal, stones do 3x that).

When by a poop **streak**, they allow the streak to retain properties of other poops even if those poops are destroyed.

&#x200B;

The fact you can do all of this with zero items is insane and why I love T. Blue Baby; you can always have fun literally slinging shit at the enemy.
I wanted to 100% legit but I had to cheat for J&E or I would’ve lost interest in the game :/
    Oh boy, only if you would have tried to complete t laz pre patch. Like jacob and esau but worse imo. I'd rather have an extra hitbox than half my items.
Can I get that remix song? That thing go hard.
just accurate
Yeah I find playing the lost and tainted lost to be pretty miserable when compared to Jacob and Esau.  I actually somewhat enjoy them because I can get double treasure room and angel room items.

Why do people like lost as the best just because of holy mantle?
    Because it's such a huge difference. Without holy mantle, you literally can't make ANY mistake in a bullet hell game designed for chars w/ actual health.

Even Tainted Lost still gets holy cards because they know No-Mantle is awful.
        No, I get how it makes him better. I just don't see why he's people's favorite. He's still difficult with only 2 hits allowed.
            Oh, because free devil deals probably.

Also, if they played AB, Lost could get all devil deals for free there so some Old Character bias for some too
                Totally forgot about that.
Maggie? 😂😂😂
Who would be the worst Character? Blue Baby? I dont really think Lost, Tainted Lost, Tainted Jacob are bad. They are just so difficult that they seem bad. But they get so many benefits compared to other Characters. Like taking devil deals for free
Right now I'm hating a decent amount of the tainted characters. Eve, Maggie and Forgotten right now are just so meh for me

lillith. i will
not elaborate
Lilith?
I thought I was being clever by farming unlocks on shitty characters by loading up co-op slots, shit like T. Beth with T. Maggy in the co-op so I can just let Maggie die and use all the half heart drops on Lemegeton. So far the only downside is the camera gets a bit funky in larger rooms and you have to move the ghosts around, until I tried it on T. Jacob. Everything starts out fine, Dark Esau will even kill off Jacob for you and keep charging at his ghost for a little additional damage throughout the floor. The real problem begins after defeating the first boss, T. Jacob is resurrected with half a heart, immediately killed by Dark Esau. When you get to the next floor while Jacob is a ghost, when Dark Esau shows up he starts attacking player one now. The only way you can avoid being attacked by Dark Esau is to finish up in the boss room as soon as possible to get T. Jacob down to the next floor alive, then wait for Dark Esau to spawn and kill him. At which point I figure I should actually just try playing T. Jacob because then I'd have Anima Sola.
Everyone seems to think this is about Tainted Lost but I don't see anywhere in the video indicating that. And in the current state of Repentance, I'd say the worst character would probably be subjective, varying from person to person. I'd say that with glass cannon characters like Tainted Lost or Tainted Keeper, they can be fun to play, especially getting overpowered broken builds, but then dying to a bad room is really infuriating.  Greedier Mode is the only mark I have left on Tainted Lost, though.

Tainted Jacob, yeah, they improved him a great deal, but I'm still really bad at him, really bad at concentrating on enemies, dodging stuff, while then having to dodge Esau as well. I beat boss rush, Satan, Lamb, Isaac, and ??? with him, cheesed Greedier Mode pre-patch, and I don't know if I can do the other harder bosses with this character.

I'm done with all the other characters, so if I did hate them, I never have to touch them again.
    The meme is adaptable
tainted Jacob and Esau
Can someone genuinely explain how y’all manage to get godhead with the lost? I haven’t gotten him yet, but I unlocked him with a friend back in high school when you had to do all the insane shit to get him, and we were grossly disappointed
    He has Holy Mantle now
        Oh my god is it really just holy mantle? Guess I’m in the skill issue bus

    The Lost was the second character I got all the completion marks for, right behind Isaac. Tainted Lost on the other hand…
        Not exatcly the second but same, I completed a few characters then was like "Fuck it, I want  P A I N"
And I don't regret it.
        At least Tainted Lost runs are fun until you die.
    I beat the lamb with base Lost and decided to try and push for all marks, but then I got addicted to greed mode and ruined it
        played through the dlcs in order, really gave me an appreciation for the players who couldnt buy ab even if they wanted to. 100%ed ab+ four days ago and lost is complete, now my favorite character (:
            I downloaded AB at platinum god, I will get real platinum god in AB, I can’t stand rebirth lost (btw tainted lost is just easier rebirth lost)
                Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
                    Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
    Same.
    How do you feel about Baleful Lost?
        is that tainted lost? because i think he's really cool but im not talented enough to get anywhere with him
    I am on like 770 coins, almost unlocked
the post said "the worst", not "the best"
    OG rebirth lost
    He meant Tainted Lost
        And?

Tainted Lost is even more fun.
            I’d rather play T lost than most other characters, best mixture of challenge and strong builds
                T Isaac is God.
                    This was a Lilith thing
                        I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
                            I hate Lilith
                                She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                                please explain why
            Agree.  But after getting all his unlocks.
                Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
                    I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
                        I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
                            Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                                It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
                        tainted jacob is really fun
            No he isn't.
        That's the best tainted (alongside with TKeeper)
Tainted lost like "No Mantle! Whoa! Can you guys imagine playing as lost without the mantle!?" and im out here as someone who doesn't play greed mode like "damn thats crazy imagine a lost with no mantle but better items."
    I think he is relatively well balanced with the higher chance for a holy card, I quite enjoy his tainted counterpart
        I just find it amusing that if you don't have a high greed mode donation count, T.Lost is just... a Straight Upgrade to regular lost.
            with the added addition of holy cards which makes it even better
                he truly is
            He literally is, yes.
            I haven't bought repentance yet, so I haven't tried playing with tainted characters yet, but what changes if you have a high donation count?
                Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
                    Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
                    Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
                        On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
    I did that for a bit because I didn’t know about holy mantle at first. Somehow I got lucky and beat Hush, Boss Rush, AND Delirium without holy mantle, but after that my luck ended and I couldn’t complete the rest without it. I racked up nearly 200 losses before someone told me about unlocking permanent holy mantle for the lost.
I still give that to tainted jacob. Especially pre update
Trying to unlock Godhead with Lost is driving me fucking insane.
Rebirth Lost was managable with a lucky Dead Cat. AB Keeper on the other hand was Edmund’s hatechild
    we shouldn't have unjammed that damned coin machine
    AB Keeper was manageable by Swallowed Penny on chapter 1 + Sacrifice Rooms
        I beat all marks with ab keeper and what I liked about him was as you completed marks you unlocked items to start with that made him a bit easier. I’m sad that T characters don’t have unlocks like that.
            YES! Finally someone who gets it!

The character unlocks make them all more unique and powerful but requires a bit more effort to get to. Tell me, would Isaac be anywhere near as interesting without the D6? Maggy without a Full Health pill? Cain without Paperclip? Keeper without Wooden Nickel and Shop Key? Lazarus without Anemic, Eve without Razor Blade, Lost without Holy Mantle, and... Samson without childs heart i guess...

The problem with the Tainted Characters, however, is that they aren't at all as simple as the normal ones. There's not much you can do to make the Tainted Characters get an extra starting bonus that adds onto what they already have and make them more interesting without making them overpowered. They're already really complex, so it's hard to balance them with just a little more.

Baleful Lost with Wooden Cross, T Isaac with D4, T Samson with Samson's Lock, T Keeper with Head of the Keeper, T ??? with Brown Cap, all of these are the most fitting things I could think of for each of them, but it would either be underwhelming or busted.
                I like a lot of those ideas. I also don’t really like t lost’s birthright. It seems so boring. I wish they would somehow make it more interesting.
                    I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
    Pre-patch T. Laz is, I think, probably the most legitimately bad one that could go for 'worst playable character ever conceived'

Keeper could at least pop off with items normally and abuse Swallowed Penny first floor before it got hard.  Rebirth Lost could get 9 lives.

J&E can certainly feel bad, but people honestly overexaggerate their flaws without all their benefits too (have 2x dps, hold 2x actives, trinkets, and cards).

&#x200B;

But there was literally no way to play T. Laz before without feeling useless. Two characters, but half items.
    AB Keeper was like digging up a dirt field with a teaspoon. Sheer misery. I think I spent 150 hours of the 500 I put into Rebirth/AB+ just doing his post it note.
I heard all the bad things about J&E but when I played him I thought it was fine, you get a lot more firepower and besides a select few rooms/bosses (mega satan p2), it was pretty easy to just treat them like 1 hitbox. I guess item balancing was a bit annoying? But I just threw all the dmg up on 1 guy then synergy items on the other.
    My problem is that there are certain room and bosses that were just not made for that character. You can lose so much health for no reason when that happens.
        As opposed to the bullshit instant hit rooms for T.Lost. Everyone here exaggerates J&E difficulty and T.Lost fun
            I like T. Lost because you get good base stats + flying + spectral tears at the start and you have a lot higher chance of getting good items/fun builds. Obviously the downside is death, but it's fun juggling around holy cards and there are a good amount of items like hourglass/blank card that can keep you pretty safe. I've found that most bs instant hit rooms for T.Lost are genuinely avoidable/dodgable (tho obv some still exist)
                Idk even know if death is a bad side of t.lost for me personally. I do like shorter runs and a 20-30 minute run that gets you to womb or even further before you die is much better paced than 45m to an hour on a single run where you do win.

I always view playing t.lost as almost like playing a level on Super meat boy or the end is nigh, just go fast, go hard and dont expect to win, but eventually you will.
                    I don‘t know even know
                there is no downside of death if you just dodge bozo ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
        idk I played him for unlocks and beat like at least isaac/satan/etc and throughout like 5+ runs i'd never run into some doomed room where it I lost more than like 2 hits
    I can see people not quite having the same problems in using them, but personally I don't find myself wanting to play as them over other characters, I feel a single stronger hit box is better than 2 weaker ones.
        I guess that's true, my favorite character to play it tainted lost and while I don't mind playing J&E, I don't really feel like playing him outside of like 2 player coop for the memes
    Yea i expected to hate them and even avoided playing for a bit. But I did a run with them and I died twice in the basement getting used to em, then on the third run I managed to kill mega satan w a great build and thought they were actually really strong. If u go the alt path u can grab both items at once so u have like double the treasure room items. And u can do the same thing w devil and angle rooms so I had a couple extra angle room items. U get extra items, double firepower 2 trinkets/actives/pills etc. and even more with items like school bag. They honestly just felt op. If u just get a tiny bit good at keeping them together u can just be super strong. I had no issue with them and really thought they were completely op. I don’t understand the dislike at all
        Some rooms and bosses feel pretty awful with them, that's pretty much it.

The Mother chase sequence for Knife Piece 2 is an obvious example
Afterbirth Keeper is legitimately one of the worst playable characters I’ve ever used LMAO. love ed and love this game but *man* that character was some serious shit.
[I use this mod for Jacob and Esau](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670308247&searchtext=) and it admittedly makes them a lot more fun, but borderline impossible
Totally agree. I’m almost done with T lost and I only have a few for j and e. I hate Jacob Esau so damn much. I just don’t want to even play them.
I daresay base Apollyon is the worst character.
    Wait, how? He's literally a base character but with the added benefit of turning shit items into stats. Like what's the downside at all?
    my only gripes with apollyon is that he's a bit boring and managing his item charge feels more annoying than other characters
    Damn a base stat character with 2HP and a tier 4 item. Worthless.
Don’t even get me started on afterbirth keeper
He isn't even bad, just boring. Difficulty-wise he's like a low C-tier. I feel like all he needs is just one extra item to start with, even just a petrified poop
    i had the idea of giving him an item that lets him stomp red hearts like with apple of sodom, each half heart’s worth giving him tears/damage for the current floor. too bad he’s pretty much confirmed to be staying as he is
I like my healthy dose of challenge without wanting to rip my hair out (unlike some other characters). 

And at least I don't have to hold onto a boring as hell active item because it's "objectively better than anything else" (looking at you Isaac), I want some variety in my runs and Poop alone has more possible uses than D6.
I hate them so much.
Install mods please, there is 2 mods that make him actually enjoyable and fair, later i send link
    Can't believe people are downvoting me because i use mods to enjoy a singleplayer game lmaooo
    I'm not on PC
        May god help you
Original keeper
    I’d rather play original keeper than jacob esau
        These are some bold fucking words
        Actually I agree with this.
    I dont play anymore but got 1200 hours in this game. Is keeper kinda buffed or esau is way worse character?
        Keeper got buffed in Repentance to be able to hold 3 coin hearts w/ a hp-up or Hush unlock, he can no longer lose deal chances from getting hit, and devil deals also cost money instead of health.

I think he also got a minor tears up, but he's just...actually playable now. The buffs sound bigger than they are in a vacuum and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents
            > and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents

no the fuck you can't because keeper literally couldn't take 2-heart devil deals without an extra life or a Strength card, and even those left you 1 hit from death until you found an HP up
                Also I’m not sure if this was changed but brim made him unplayable. First of all it was so rare to find brim but to actually take it and live , well you needed to be damn lucky, with extra lives or s card. But then the charge was so horrific that it wasn’t even worth it.
                    Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
                That's what I meant by 'argue for,'

It's only a nerf if you had HP-ups showered about, which can sometimes be the case. Also wouldn't be as bad since you can spawn with 3 hearts now after Hush.

&#x200B;

Either way, this usually results in me skipping the first devil deal for a free angel deal later since I wouldn't have the money typically
    Hot take tainted keeper for low health
        tainted keeper is the definition of a glass cannon, but it doesn't mean he's bad
            He’s a stressful character, but also one of my favorites
            Tainted keeper greedier mode is the hardest thing I’ve done in Th is game other than mother route for tainted Jacob.
                What? Just reset for a 7 cent item, then buy the shit out of it. He is honestly like the easiest Greedier character out there aside from Lilith.
            Eh I think he's pretty bad. He's like the lost minus the flight and spectral and less firepower (Lost has more firepower via devil deals, perfection and dice)

I also find myself dying trying to get back the health I lost. Idk. I think J&E and Lost are both way easier than t keeper for example.
                You can get like 4 items a floor + angel and devil deals + you have pretty much infinite cash. He's easily the strongest offensive character in the game with his ability to quickly outpace even azazel, you're just wrong.
                    Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
                        Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
                        This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
                    Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
                        1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
                            Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
                                Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
                        I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
                            Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
                                Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
                    T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
                        He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
                I think that T. Keeper is the strongest character in the game while being fairly challenging. The fact alone that you can get to normal tear cap while having quad shot makes him really strong.
Of course you need some luck with the shops but if you do he can get very strong very fast.
The big difference between him and Lost or Jacob & Esau is that you have to play very aggressive with t. Keeper while the Lost can be played extremely cautious as courtesy of his flight and spectral.
                    You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
                        If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
                            It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                                Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                                Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
                            Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                                I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
                No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
        It's just lost health but you can recharge the mantle with money
        Tainted Keeper has a lot of similar issues to AB+ Keeper, but one major bonus he gets in his favor is that enemies are very likely to drop money when killed.

I still kinda think he should have had 3HP max after a health upgrade, though. Right now, too much emphasis is put on finding stuff like Holy Mantle, Mother's Kiss or Greed's Gullet. Hell, maybe Tainted Keeper should have just started with Greed's Gullet. Make money an actual tradeoff.
            I don’t at all think finding any of those things are a big concern with T Keeper. Literally any of them are an instant win IMO, his offensive power is so great. if he started with greeds gullet I guarantee you could hit a 3 digit win streak easily lol, he’d be the most OP character in the game
            t. keeper should definitely start with deep pockets given how much money you waste after a while
        Not as bad as Jacob and esau (I also don't like appolyon)
            Jacop and Esau are far from bad characters. Double items makes them snowball so fast and they bring so many new strategies by having two active items, consumable and trinkets. The way they designed the controls is dumb though, but after you get used to them they can be such a fun challenge
                You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
                    You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
                    It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
            Is the reason behind appolyon because his gimmick with the void and no real sustainence
                I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
                Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
        I think Tainted Keeper would be so must interesting if he had normal health

Right now the health management for T.Keeper feels so dumb
            thats cuz he is the strongest char with his only weak point being health if he had 3 health he would be just op
                Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
                    Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
    Original lost (known now as tainted lost)
    The worst thing about the original keeper was bombing the pots in basement 1 and 2 for eons until you got swallowed penny 
￼
Isn’t original lost the worst? Like it didn’t even have spectral tears with its flying
    the birth of reset spamming
Because while inherently bad, they aren't awful every time like some other characters
    Untrue, I have never had a good time playing T. Eden. It's gotten to the point where I've just given up on its completion marks because I can't stand playing as them.
        I found it to be slightly more bearable if you play as a soul-heart only character and load up on Devil Room items. It gives you some semi-reliable DPS through rerolls. The tweaks have made it slightly more bearable, but still pretty ass to work through on Switch. Sanity breaks to get marks as other characters is also a necessity.
            Really? I found the opposite to be true. At first I hated Tainted Eden because I would sometimes roll into Dead Cat which is pretty much an instant loss. But then I stopped taking any items from devil deals/curse rooms/red chests (any pool that could possibly reroll into Dead Cat) as them and sticking to the Angel path and I started enjoying them a lot more. I guess limiting yourself to only soul hearts somewhat gets around that as well, but one of my favorite runs as T. Eden was one where I managed to abuse a prayer card to the point that I had a ton of red hearts that couldn't be rerolled away, so I always had plenty of health.
                By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
                    Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
        Try the d4 glitch
    I think post update they are actually pretty great.
T Jacob is overrated in difficulty; fight me.
    now definitely, but pre-patch he was agonizing to play. just watching your run be destroyed on the dark room because esau decides to give the adversary a hug and gets a brimstone laser to the face in return
        Yeah, before you would eventually learn to play T. Lost because Esau had bad health scaling among other chase mechanics, but now all you have to do is stay out of Esau's charge range
Even after the rework?
    I think so. That said I will admit to some level of bias because normal laz was my least favorite character by far pre-repentence. I've just never found him enjoyable.
        I mean he always has been the most "meh" character, so it's understandable. But imo not only did the rework make Tainted Laz actually playable in the first place, but also made him actually fun. Actually.
            That's fair. Maybe I was a little hyperbolic, but I do hold that tainted laz is the character I'm least happy to play in a given run. I'd take tainted Jacob or tainted lost in a heartbeat over laz.
                why?
                    I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
                        Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
                        yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
                            >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                                what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
                            While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
    Maybe if his flip auto charged so I could get both items in any room where I need an item on both characters he would be playable but so often I get stuck unable to get an item from the ped for the character that needs it, or unable to get the other item that is better just becuase there isnt enough rooms to charge it again.
    I really like T. Laz after the Flip rework because it makes devil deals more fun and I've always liked devil rooms more than angel rooms.

Dead Laz has soul hearts, but higher damage (5.25 base)—glass cannon-y at the start. Alive Laz has normal red hearts and stats so what I usually do is just feed him most HP-ups and defensive items then buy at least two devil deals and then **flip** to Dead Laz for two free devil items.

&#x200B;

It helps that the ghost versions of devil items can be a different price, so I could use only 2-3 heart containers for effectively 4-6 hearts of deals ***for free***
Wdym unplayable it's fun. I had a lot of fun playing with him. It's like j&e but less painful
    I'd much rather play j&e. They at least have a unique gimic as opposed to swapping between two underpowered characters. I just think he's extremely boring
        They're not underpowered if you get luck on first devil deal and boss items
            But surely you see that " it's fun if you get busted items early " is true for literally every character right? If you don't get that they are pretty underpowered and not even in a particularly fun way.
                I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
                That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
I hate him. I completely hate and refuse using exploits, so playing him on a normal run is just painful. I just feel like no matter what input I do on the bag of crafting I always get shitty items. I wish they would make pickups more abundant and the crafting bag more generous, then the character might actually be fun.
    get the item descriptions mod

        I know this was sarcasm but by the time I have enough of them I’m already at depths lmao
I don’t agree

Never played much Necrodancer, but some of the unlock characters in Issac are just mean. Lost dies to any damage (you can unlock an item to give him a single hit per room.) Keeper uses coins as health and only has 2 coins, so can only get hit twice. You can refill coins by picking up money, but with only 2 total health slots you can't take some of the most powerful items that require trading health. Not even mentioning the Tainted variants of every character. Beating some of the bosses with some characters requires a mix of being incredibly skilled and also get crazy lucky with items.
I don't think any Isaac character is harder than All Zones Aria or Bolt, although most of that comes down to the pace of the game and amount of focus you need constantly in Necrodancer.
One-hit-death character in a bullet hell game and they have revive items blacklisted

Thank god they didn't blacklist all the invincibility items though

&#x200B;

Also, double character character in a bullet hell game. They have a lot of benefits, but the downsides also do suck.
Once you hit a critical mass of flies and damage he becomes a powertrain
    while he does become powerful, most of my runs end the same because most items dont have unique flies.
    Those libraries with 4 books hidden behind locked tiles think they're SO smart until I get my locusts to violently rip them apart molecule by molecule
> Weak with his red flies 

I've killed end game bosses with him with one or two damage ups and the rest of my items as flies. They are far from weak. The stat boosts from Void are weaker than Abyss flies especially because Abyss flies are always a DPS upgrade.

If you said normal Apollyon was kinda weak and boring I'd maybe agree (void can sometimes give you useless stats a whole run) with that, but T. Apollyon runs are hard to lose because the red locusts are so good. Boring, maybe, but still very strong.
    Okay maybe I should’ve worded the comment different. I don’t think he’s very weak but he’s a below average character to me since whenever I play as him his flies end up doing not as much dps  or the same as other characters. The flies can actually dish out good damage against bosses especially stationary ones but against bosses that move a bunch like delirium they start to do less dps. This could just be because of me having bad luck with him or something idk
        Delirium is like the one case where the locusts kinda suck, and that's just because the arena is very big on top of Deli moving around a lot so the locusts will tend to travel a long distance hitting nothing before returning to you. Most other bosses they do just fine if you know how to aim them. On Mother, Hush. Beast, Dogma, and pretty much all other endgame bosses they do fine. One of the few other bosses I can think of where they kinda suck is against Scolex, but that's just Scolex being Scolex.

The one thing you do need to learn with T. Apollyon is min-maxing how many locusts you're getting. There are lots of ways to get extra items to turn into locusts and you want to be using as many as possible. This does mean taking HP ups early on as often as you can so you can play demon beggars and blood donation machines and sacrifice rooms (all sac rooms are +2 locusts minimum if you fully play them out). If you're high on money but don't want what's in the shop, buy it and hit abyss as you hold it above your head (if it's a passive) to turn it into a locust. You can do the same with Alt-path blind items and blind items in general. Look at it while you hold it, if you don't like it, abyss it.
I beat ultra greed with about 8 flies, the stapler, and the trinket extension cord
Yeeting bones is fun, specially for static bosses like mega satan you can just spam attack button whiñe you focus on dodging
I've unlocked him and cleared one floor and shelved him for now, not a fan of the mechanic but maybe I'll get used to it?
T. Forgotten is sick what are you on about
    His play style is very boring and he’s a huge downgrade from the regular forgotten
T. Lost is fun cause you get spectral and flight and better items and a decent reroll on bad items

T. Jacob is just for people who like playing with fire
T lost is fun
They're extremely difficult but genuinely rewarding. Memes aside, Tainted Lost does get better items on average, while Tainted Jacob has a high risk style with his brother doing a lot of damage if you position him right. Now, if they were Rebirth Lost or Pre-Patch T.Jacob...
Nothing left to complete, and at that point the challenge is fun.
so they won't have to play J&E
I love Tainted Lost. Better items is a great trade off for one hit to die, plus flying and spectral tears and taking any devil deals. Every run is fun, and I have a blast. It took a few months but I got all Tainted Lost unlocks. It was just a matter of grinding until I hit the right combination of items, but every run was good and I had fun even though I died.

I have yet to get a single completion mark for Tainted Jacob. I don't care what anybody says, that character is broken as shit. A few times I've reached The Depths, always with base tears and damage. Fought Mom a couple of times and died, that's the closest I've got. Most runs I spend the entire time either one hit from dead with bad items, or continually trying to avoid Dark Esau. It just isn't fun. I can't clear rooms, I'm always in danger, I'm always stressed.

I almost feel like they programmed a secret feature where Tainted Jacon is the counter-part to Tainted Lost and instead of getting good items is only allowed bad items. I've sunk so many hours into it and every run has been terrible. I never get any damage up or tears up. There were characters I didn't like before and things I felt difficult before, but at this point I flat out refuse to play Tainted Jacob. The update made no difference to me. He is a terribly designed character, end of story.
    prepatch t jacob? because i got all completion marks with him now and he was pretty fun. difficult but fun regardless. you also can get free devil deal items if you let esau hit you
That’s a pretty SHITTY one
Literal shit, but actually a great character. I still don't get why some people hate him. Way better than base blue baby
    Idk man I just can't play with him. He's the only character I didn't manage to get a single achievement (other than T Eve, T Samson and T Jacob, who I haven't unlocked yet)
        The way I play him is I try to always have a 2-3x poop combo ready.

&#x200B;

Most obvious combo is **Streak + Holy**; streak buffs  damage and also inherits properties of poops. Holy Poop triples tears and damage or something ridiculous. This is a basic boss-killing trick.

**Double Corny** tossed into a corner allows a constant swarm of flies. You also get to walk out with six flies if you wait for them both to fill before leaving the room.

I use this for slow rooms w/ champions, annoyingly big rooms, and also for bosses if I can't get a holy poop because holy poops are definitely rarer than others.

**Fire + Poison** = mega explosion. Easy burst.

Same for **Bomb + Poison**, and the same interactions happens with **Farts** and **Diarrhea**

**Fire** *or* **Poison + Streak** makes the streak damage enemies and inherit Fire Mind/Poison tears.

**Stone Poops** can take more damage than the others and make for good cover. They also do more damage when tossed (15 normal, stones do 3x that).

When by a poop **streak**, they allow the streak to retain properties of other poops even if those poops are destroyed.

&#x200B;

The fact you can do all of this with zero items is insane and why I love T. Blue Baby; you can always have fun literally slinging shit at the enemy.
Oh boy, only if you would have tried to complete t laz pre patch. Like jacob and esau but worse imo. I'd rather have an extra hitbox than half my items.
Because it's such a huge difference. Without holy mantle, you literally can't make ANY mistake in a bullet hell game designed for chars w/ actual health.

Even Tainted Lost still gets holy cards because they know No-Mantle is awful.
    No, I get how it makes him better. I just don't see why he's people's favorite. He's still difficult with only 2 hits allowed.
        Oh, because free devil deals probably.

Also, if they played AB, Lost could get all devil deals for free there so some Old Character bias for some too
            Totally forgot about that.

The Lost was the second character I got all the completion marks for, right behind Isaac. Tainted Lost on the other hand…
    Not exatcly the second but same, I completed a few characters then was like "Fuck it, I want  P A I N"
And I don't regret it.
    At least Tainted Lost runs are fun until you die.
I beat the lamb with base Lost and decided to try and push for all marks, but then I got addicted to greed mode and ruined it
    played through the dlcs in order, really gave me an appreciation for the players who couldnt buy ab even if they wanted to. 100%ed ab+ four days ago and lost is complete, now my favorite character (:
        I downloaded AB at platinum god, I will get real platinum god in AB, I can’t stand rebirth lost (btw tainted lost is just easier rebirth lost)
            Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
                Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
Same.
How do you feel about Baleful Lost?
    is that tainted lost? because i think he's really cool but im not talented enough to get anywhere with him
I am on like 770 coins, almost unlocked
OG rebirth lost
He meant Tainted Lost
    And?

Tainted Lost is even more fun.
        I’d rather play T lost than most other characters, best mixture of challenge and strong builds
            T Isaac is God.
                This was a Lilith thing
                    I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
                        I hate Lilith
                            She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                            please explain why
        Agree.  But after getting all his unlocks.
            Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
                I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
                    I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
                        Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                            It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
                    tainted jacob is really fun
        No he isn't.
    That's the best tainted (alongside with TKeeper)
I think he is relatively well balanced with the higher chance for a holy card, I quite enjoy his tainted counterpart
    I just find it amusing that if you don't have a high greed mode donation count, T.Lost is just... a Straight Upgrade to regular lost.
        with the added addition of holy cards which makes it even better
            he truly is
        He literally is, yes.
        I haven't bought repentance yet, so I haven't tried playing with tainted characters yet, but what changes if you have a high donation count?
            Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
                Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
                Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
                    On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
I did that for a bit because I didn’t know about holy mantle at first. Somehow I got lucky and beat Hush, Boss Rush, AND Delirium without holy mantle, but after that my luck ended and I couldn’t complete the rest without it. I racked up nearly 200 losses before someone told me about unlocking permanent holy mantle for the lost.
we shouldn't have unjammed that damned coin machine
AB Keeper was manageable by Swallowed Penny on chapter 1 + Sacrifice Rooms
    I beat all marks with ab keeper and what I liked about him was as you completed marks you unlocked items to start with that made him a bit easier. I’m sad that T characters don’t have unlocks like that.
        YES! Finally someone who gets it!

The character unlocks make them all more unique and powerful but requires a bit more effort to get to. Tell me, would Isaac be anywhere near as interesting without the D6? Maggy without a Full Health pill? Cain without Paperclip? Keeper without Wooden Nickel and Shop Key? Lazarus without Anemic, Eve without Razor Blade, Lost without Holy Mantle, and... Samson without childs heart i guess...

The problem with the Tainted Characters, however, is that they aren't at all as simple as the normal ones. There's not much you can do to make the Tainted Characters get an extra starting bonus that adds onto what they already have and make them more interesting without making them overpowered. They're already really complex, so it's hard to balance them with just a little more.

Baleful Lost with Wooden Cross, T Isaac with D4, T Samson with Samson's Lock, T Keeper with Head of the Keeper, T ??? with Brown Cap, all of these are the most fitting things I could think of for each of them, but it would either be underwhelming or busted.
            I like a lot of those ideas. I also don’t really like t lost’s birthright. It seems so boring. I wish they would somehow make it more interesting.
                I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
Pre-patch T. Laz is, I think, probably the most legitimately bad one that could go for 'worst playable character ever conceived'

Keeper could at least pop off with items normally and abuse Swallowed Penny first floor before it got hard.  Rebirth Lost could get 9 lives.

J&E can certainly feel bad, but people honestly overexaggerate their flaws without all their benefits too (have 2x dps, hold 2x actives, trinkets, and cards).

&#x200B;

But there was literally no way to play T. Laz before without feeling useless. Two characters, but half items.
AB Keeper was like digging up a dirt field with a teaspoon. Sheer misery. I think I spent 150 hours of the 500 I put into Rebirth/AB+ just doing his post it note.
My problem is that there are certain room and bosses that were just not made for that character. You can lose so much health for no reason when that happens.
    As opposed to the bullshit instant hit rooms for T.Lost. Everyone here exaggerates J&E difficulty and T.Lost fun
        I like T. Lost because you get good base stats + flying + spectral tears at the start and you have a lot higher chance of getting good items/fun builds. Obviously the downside is death, but it's fun juggling around holy cards and there are a good amount of items like hourglass/blank card that can keep you pretty safe. I've found that most bs instant hit rooms for T.Lost are genuinely avoidable/dodgable (tho obv some still exist)
            Idk even know if death is a bad side of t.lost for me personally. I do like shorter runs and a 20-30 minute run that gets you to womb or even further before you die is much better paced than 45m to an hour on a single run where you do win.

I always view playing t.lost as almost like playing a level on Super meat boy or the end is nigh, just go fast, go hard and dont expect to win, but eventually you will.
                I don‘t know even know
            there is no downside of death if you just dodge bozo ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
    idk I played him for unlocks and beat like at least isaac/satan/etc and throughout like 5+ runs i'd never run into some doomed room where it I lost more than like 2 hits
I can see people not quite having the same problems in using them, but personally I don't find myself wanting to play as them over other characters, I feel a single stronger hit box is better than 2 weaker ones.
    I guess that's true, my favorite character to play it tainted lost and while I don't mind playing J&E, I don't really feel like playing him outside of like 2 player coop for the memes
Yea i expected to hate them and even avoided playing for a bit. But I did a run with them and I died twice in the basement getting used to em, then on the third run I managed to kill mega satan w a great build and thought they were actually really strong. If u go the alt path u can grab both items at once so u have like double the treasure room items. And u can do the same thing w devil and angle rooms so I had a couple extra angle room items. U get extra items, double firepower 2 trinkets/actives/pills etc. and even more with items like school bag. They honestly just felt op. If u just get a tiny bit good at keeping them together u can just be super strong. I had no issue with them and really thought they were completely op. I don’t understand the dislike at all
    Some rooms and bosses feel pretty awful with them, that's pretty much it.

The Mother chase sequence for Knife Piece 2 is an obvious example
Wait, how? He's literally a base character but with the added benefit of turning shit items into stats. Like what's the downside at all?
my only gripes with apollyon is that he's a bit boring and managing his item charge feels more annoying than other characters
Damn a base stat character with 2HP and a tier 4 item. Worthless.
i had the idea of giving him an item that lets him stomp red hearts like with apple of sodom, each half heart’s worth giving him tears/damage for the current floor. too bad he’s pretty much confirmed to be staying as he is
Can't believe people are downvoting me because i use mods to enjoy a singleplayer game lmaooo
I'm not on PC
    May god help you
I’d rather play original keeper than jacob esau
    These are some bold fucking words
    Actually I agree with this.
I dont play anymore but got 1200 hours in this game. Is keeper kinda buffed or esau is way worse character?
    Keeper got buffed in Repentance to be able to hold 3 coin hearts w/ a hp-up or Hush unlock, he can no longer lose deal chances from getting hit, and devil deals also cost money instead of health.

I think he also got a minor tears up, but he's just...actually playable now. The buffs sound bigger than they are in a vacuum and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents
        > and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents

no the fuck you can't because keeper literally couldn't take 2-heart devil deals without an extra life or a Strength card, and even those left you 1 hit from death until you found an HP up
            Also I’m not sure if this was changed but brim made him unplayable. First of all it was so rare to find brim but to actually take it and live , well you needed to be damn lucky, with extra lives or s card. But then the charge was so horrific that it wasn’t even worth it.
                Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
            That's what I meant by 'argue for,'

It's only a nerf if you had HP-ups showered about, which can sometimes be the case. Also wouldn't be as bad since you can spawn with 3 hearts now after Hush.

&#x200B;

Either way, this usually results in me skipping the first devil deal for a free angel deal later since I wouldn't have the money typically
Hot take tainted keeper for low health
    tainted keeper is the definition of a glass cannon, but it doesn't mean he's bad
        He’s a stressful character, but also one of my favorites
        Tainted keeper greedier mode is the hardest thing I’ve done in Th is game other than mother route for tainted Jacob.
            What? Just reset for a 7 cent item, then buy the shit out of it. He is honestly like the easiest Greedier character out there aside from Lilith.
        Eh I think he's pretty bad. He's like the lost minus the flight and spectral and less firepower (Lost has more firepower via devil deals, perfection and dice)

I also find myself dying trying to get back the health I lost. Idk. I think J&E and Lost are both way easier than t keeper for example.
            You can get like 4 items a floor + angel and devil deals + you have pretty much infinite cash. He's easily the strongest offensive character in the game with his ability to quickly outpace even azazel, you're just wrong.
                Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
                    Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
                    This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
                Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
                    1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
                        Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
                            Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
                    I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
                        Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
                            Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
                T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
                    He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
            I think that T. Keeper is the strongest character in the game while being fairly challenging. The fact alone that you can get to normal tear cap while having quad shot makes him really strong.
Of course you need some luck with the shops but if you do he can get very strong very fast.
The big difference between him and Lost or Jacob & Esau is that you have to play very aggressive with t. Keeper while the Lost can be played extremely cautious as courtesy of his flight and spectral.
                You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
                    If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
                        It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                            Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                            Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
                        Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                            I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
            No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
    It's just lost health but you can recharge the mantle with money
    Tainted Keeper has a lot of similar issues to AB+ Keeper, but one major bonus he gets in his favor is that enemies are very likely to drop money when killed.

I still kinda think he should have had 3HP max after a health upgrade, though. Right now, too much emphasis is put on finding stuff like Holy Mantle, Mother's Kiss or Greed's Gullet. Hell, maybe Tainted Keeper should have just started with Greed's Gullet. Make money an actual tradeoff.
        I don’t at all think finding any of those things are a big concern with T Keeper. Literally any of them are an instant win IMO, his offensive power is so great. if he started with greeds gullet I guarantee you could hit a 3 digit win streak easily lol, he’d be the most OP character in the game
        t. keeper should definitely start with deep pockets given how much money you waste after a while
    Not as bad as Jacob and esau (I also don't like appolyon)
        Jacop and Esau are far from bad characters. Double items makes them snowball so fast and they bring so many new strategies by having two active items, consumable and trinkets. The way they designed the controls is dumb though, but after you get used to them they can be such a fun challenge
            You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
                You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
                It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
        Is the reason behind appolyon because his gimmick with the void and no real sustainence
            I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
            Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
    I think Tainted Keeper would be so must interesting if he had normal health

Right now the health management for T.Keeper feels so dumb
        thats cuz he is the strongest char with his only weak point being health if he had 3 health he would be just op
            Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
                Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
Original lost (known now as tainted lost)
The worst thing about the original keeper was bombing the pots in basement 1 and 2 for eons until you got swallowed penny

the birth of reset spamming
Untrue, I have never had a good time playing T. Eden. It's gotten to the point where I've just given up on its completion marks because I can't stand playing as them.
    I found it to be slightly more bearable if you play as a soul-heart only character and load up on Devil Room items. It gives you some semi-reliable DPS through rerolls. The tweaks have made it slightly more bearable, but still pretty ass to work through on Switch. Sanity breaks to get marks as other characters is also a necessity.
        Really? I found the opposite to be true. At first I hated Tainted Eden because I would sometimes roll into Dead Cat which is pretty much an instant loss. But then I stopped taking any items from devil deals/curse rooms/red chests (any pool that could possibly reroll into Dead Cat) as them and sticking to the Angel path and I started enjoying them a lot more. I guess limiting yourself to only soul hearts somewhat gets around that as well, but one of my favorite runs as T. Eden was one where I managed to abuse a prayer card to the point that I had a ton of red hearts that couldn't be rerolled away, so I always had plenty of health.
            By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
                Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
    Try the d4 glitch
I think post update they are actually pretty great.
now definitely, but pre-patch he was agonizing to play. just watching your run be destroyed on the dark room because esau decides to give the adversary a hug and gets a brimstone laser to the face in return
    Yeah, before you would eventually learn to play T. Lost because Esau had bad health scaling among other chase mechanics, but now all you have to do is stay out of Esau's charge range
I think so. That said I will admit to some level of bias because normal laz was my least favorite character by far pre-repentence. I've just never found him enjoyable.
    I mean he always has been the most "meh" character, so it's understandable. But imo not only did the rework make Tainted Laz actually playable in the first place, but also made him actually fun. Actually.
        That's fair. Maybe I was a little hyperbolic, but I do hold that tainted laz is the character I'm least happy to play in a given run. I'd take tainted Jacob or tainted lost in a heartbeat over laz.
            why?
                I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
                    Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
                    yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
                        >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                            what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
                        While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
Maybe if his flip auto charged so I could get both items in any room where I need an item on both characters he would be playable but so often I get stuck unable to get an item from the ped for the character that needs it, or unable to get the other item that is better just becuase there isnt enough rooms to charge it again.
I really like T. Laz after the Flip rework because it makes devil deals more fun and I've always liked devil rooms more than angel rooms.

Dead Laz has soul hearts, but higher damage (5.25 base)—glass cannon-y at the start. Alive Laz has normal red hearts and stats so what I usually do is just feed him most HP-ups and defensive items then buy at least two devil deals and then **flip** to Dead Laz for two free devil items.

&#x200B;

It helps that the ghost versions of devil items can be a different price, so I could use only 2-3 heart containers for effectively 4-6 hearts of deals ***for free***
I'd much rather play j&e. They at least have a unique gimic as opposed to swapping between two underpowered characters. I just think he's extremely boring
    They're not underpowered if you get luck on first devil deal and boss items
        But surely you see that " it's fun if you get busted items early " is true for literally every character right? If you don't get that they are pretty underpowered and not even in a particularly fun way.
            I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
            That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
get the item descriptions mod
[deleted]
    I know this was sarcasm but by the time I have enough of them I’m already at depths lmao
while he does become powerful, most of my runs end the same because most items dont have unique flies.
Those libraries with 4 books hidden behind locked tiles think they're SO smart until I get my locusts to violently rip them apart molecule by molecule
Okay maybe I should’ve worded the comment different. I don’t think he’s very weak but he’s a below average character to me since whenever I play as him his flies end up doing not as much dps  or the same as other characters. The flies can actually dish out good damage against bosses especially stationary ones but against bosses that move a bunch like delirium they start to do less dps. This could just be because of me having bad luck with him or something idk
    Delirium is like the one case where the locusts kinda suck, and that's just because the arena is very big on top of Deli moving around a lot so the locusts will tend to travel a long distance hitting nothing before returning to you. Most other bosses they do just fine if you know how to aim them. On Mother, Hush. Beast, Dogma, and pretty much all other endgame bosses they do fine. One of the few other bosses I can think of where they kinda suck is against Scolex, but that's just Scolex being Scolex.

The one thing you do need to learn with T. Apollyon is min-maxing how many locusts you're getting. There are lots of ways to get extra items to turn into locusts and you want to be using as many as possible. This does mean taking HP ups early on as often as you can so you can play demon beggars and blood donation machines and sacrifice rooms (all sac rooms are +2 locusts minimum if you fully play them out). If you're high on money but don't want what's in the shop, buy it and hit abyss as you hold it above your head (if it's a passive) to turn it into a locust. You can do the same with Alt-path blind items and blind items in general. Look at it while you hold it, if you don't like it, abyss it.
His play style is very boring and he’s a huge downgrade from the regular forgotten
prepatch t jacob? because i got all completion marks with him now and he was pretty fun. difficult but fun regardless. you also can get free devil deal items if you let esau hit you
Idk man I just can't play with him. He's the only character I didn't manage to get a single achievement (other than T Eve, T Samson and T Jacob, who I haven't unlocked yet)
    The way I play him is I try to always have a 2-3x poop combo ready.

&#x200B;

Most obvious combo is **Streak + Holy**; streak buffs  damage and also inherits properties of poops. Holy Poop triples tears and damage or something ridiculous. This is a basic boss-killing trick.

**Double Corny** tossed into a corner allows a constant swarm of flies. You also get to walk out with six flies if you wait for them both to fill before leaving the room.

I use this for slow rooms w/ champions, annoyingly big rooms, and also for bosses if I can't get a holy poop because holy poops are definitely rarer than others.

**Fire + Poison** = mega explosion. Easy burst.

Same for **Bomb + Poison**, and the same interactions happens with **Farts** and **Diarrhea**

**Fire** *or* **Poison + Streak** makes the streak damage enemies and inherit Fire Mind/Poison tears.

**Stone Poops** can take more damage than the others and make for good cover. They also do more damage when tossed (15 normal, stones do 3x that).

When by a poop **streak**, they allow the streak to retain properties of other poops even if those poops are destroyed.

&#x200B;

The fact you can do all of this with zero items is insane and why I love T. Blue Baby; you can always have fun literally slinging shit at the enemy.
No, I get how it makes him better. I just don't see why he's people's favorite. He's still difficult with only 2 hits allowed.
    Oh, because free devil deals probably.

Also, if they played AB, Lost could get all devil deals for free there so some Old Character bias for some too
        Totally forgot about that.
Oh my god is it really just holy mantle? Guess I’m in the skill issue bus
Not exatcly the second but same, I completed a few characters then was like "Fuck it, I want  P A I N"
And I don't regret it.
At least Tainted Lost runs are fun until you die.
played through the dlcs in order, really gave me an appreciation for the players who couldnt buy ab even if they wanted to. 100%ed ab+ four days ago and lost is complete, now my favorite character (:
    I downloaded AB at platinum god, I will get real platinum god in AB, I can’t stand rebirth lost (btw tainted lost is just easier rebirth lost)
        Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
            Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
is that tainted lost? because i think he's really cool but im not talented enough to get anywhere with him
And?

Tainted Lost is even more fun.
    I’d rather play T lost than most other characters, best mixture of challenge and strong builds
        T Isaac is God.
            This was a Lilith thing
                I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
                    I hate Lilith
                        She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                        please explain why
    Agree.  But after getting all his unlocks.
        Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
            I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
                I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
                    Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                        It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
                tainted jacob is really fun
    No he isn't.
That's the best tainted (alongside with TKeeper)
I just find it amusing that if you don't have a high greed mode donation count, T.Lost is just... a Straight Upgrade to regular lost.
    with the added addition of holy cards which makes it even better
        he truly is
    He literally is, yes.
    I haven't bought repentance yet, so I haven't tried playing with tainted characters yet, but what changes if you have a high donation count?
        Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
            Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
            Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
                On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
I beat all marks with ab keeper and what I liked about him was as you completed marks you unlocked items to start with that made him a bit easier. I’m sad that T characters don’t have unlocks like that.
    YES! Finally someone who gets it!

The character unlocks make them all more unique and powerful but requires a bit more effort to get to. Tell me, would Isaac be anywhere near as interesting without the D6? Maggy without a Full Health pill? Cain without Paperclip? Keeper without Wooden Nickel and Shop Key? Lazarus without Anemic, Eve without Razor Blade, Lost without Holy Mantle, and... Samson without childs heart i guess...

The problem with the Tainted Characters, however, is that they aren't at all as simple as the normal ones. There's not much you can do to make the Tainted Characters get an extra starting bonus that adds onto what they already have and make them more interesting without making them overpowered. They're already really complex, so it's hard to balance them with just a little more.

Baleful Lost with Wooden Cross, T Isaac with D4, T Samson with Samson's Lock, T Keeper with Head of the Keeper, T ??? with Brown Cap, all of these are the most fitting things I could think of for each of them, but it would either be underwhelming or busted.
        I like a lot of those ideas. I also don’t really like t lost’s birthright. It seems so boring. I wish they would somehow make it more interesting.
            I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
As opposed to the bullshit instant hit rooms for T.Lost. Everyone here exaggerates J&E difficulty and T.Lost fun
    I like T. Lost because you get good base stats + flying + spectral tears at the start and you have a lot higher chance of getting good items/fun builds. Obviously the downside is death, but it's fun juggling around holy cards and there are a good amount of items like hourglass/blank card that can keep you pretty safe. I've found that most bs instant hit rooms for T.Lost are genuinely avoidable/dodgable (tho obv some still exist)
        Idk even know if death is a bad side of t.lost for me personally. I do like shorter runs and a 20-30 minute run that gets you to womb or even further before you die is much better paced than 45m to an hour on a single run where you do win.

I always view playing t.lost as almost like playing a level on Super meat boy or the end is nigh, just go fast, go hard and dont expect to win, but eventually you will.
            I don‘t know even know
        there is no downside of death if you just dodge bozo ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
idk I played him for unlocks and beat like at least isaac/satan/etc and throughout like 5+ runs i'd never run into some doomed room where it I lost more than like 2 hits
I guess that's true, my favorite character to play it tainted lost and while I don't mind playing J&E, I don't really feel like playing him outside of like 2 player coop for the memes
Some rooms and bosses feel pretty awful with them, that's pretty much it.

The Mother chase sequence for Knife Piece 2 is an obvious example
May god help you
These are some bold fucking words
Actually I agree with this.
Keeper got buffed in Repentance to be able to hold 3 coin hearts w/ a hp-up or Hush unlock, he can no longer lose deal chances from getting hit, and devil deals also cost money instead of health.

I think he also got a minor tears up, but he's just...actually playable now. The buffs sound bigger than they are in a vacuum and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents
    > and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents

no the fuck you can't because keeper literally couldn't take 2-heart devil deals without an extra life or a Strength card, and even those left you 1 hit from death until you found an HP up
        Also I’m not sure if this was changed but brim made him unplayable. First of all it was so rare to find brim but to actually take it and live , well you needed to be damn lucky, with extra lives or s card. But then the charge was so horrific that it wasn’t even worth it.
            Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
        That's what I meant by 'argue for,'

It's only a nerf if you had HP-ups showered about, which can sometimes be the case. Also wouldn't be as bad since you can spawn with 3 hearts now after Hush.

&#x200B;

Either way, this usually results in me skipping the first devil deal for a free angel deal later since I wouldn't have the money typically
tainted keeper is the definition of a glass cannon, but it doesn't mean he's bad
    He’s a stressful character, but also one of my favorites
    Tainted keeper greedier mode is the hardest thing I’ve done in Th is game other than mother route for tainted Jacob.
        What? Just reset for a 7 cent item, then buy the shit out of it. He is honestly like the easiest Greedier character out there aside from Lilith.
    Eh I think he's pretty bad. He's like the lost minus the flight and spectral and less firepower (Lost has more firepower via devil deals, perfection and dice)

I also find myself dying trying to get back the health I lost. Idk. I think J&E and Lost are both way easier than t keeper for example.
        You can get like 4 items a floor + angel and devil deals + you have pretty much infinite cash. He's easily the strongest offensive character in the game with his ability to quickly outpace even azazel, you're just wrong.
            Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
                Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
                This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
            Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
                1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
                    Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
                        Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
                I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
                    Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
                        Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
            T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
                He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
        I think that T. Keeper is the strongest character in the game while being fairly challenging. The fact alone that you can get to normal tear cap while having quad shot makes him really strong.
Of course you need some luck with the shops but if you do he can get very strong very fast.
The big difference between him and Lost or Jacob & Esau is that you have to play very aggressive with t. Keeper while the Lost can be played extremely cautious as courtesy of his flight and spectral.
            You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
                If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
                    It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                        Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                        Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
                    Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                        I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
        No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
It's just lost health but you can recharge the mantle with money
Tainted Keeper has a lot of similar issues to AB+ Keeper, but one major bonus he gets in his favor is that enemies are very likely to drop money when killed.

I still kinda think he should have had 3HP max after a health upgrade, though. Right now, too much emphasis is put on finding stuff like Holy Mantle, Mother's Kiss or Greed's Gullet. Hell, maybe Tainted Keeper should have just started with Greed's Gullet. Make money an actual tradeoff.
    I don’t at all think finding any of those things are a big concern with T Keeper. Literally any of them are an instant win IMO, his offensive power is so great. if he started with greeds gullet I guarantee you could hit a 3 digit win streak easily lol, he’d be the most OP character in the game
    t. keeper should definitely start with deep pockets given how much money you waste after a while
Not as bad as Jacob and esau (I also don't like appolyon)
    Jacop and Esau are far from bad characters. Double items makes them snowball so fast and they bring so many new strategies by having two active items, consumable and trinkets. The way they designed the controls is dumb though, but after you get used to them they can be such a fun challenge
        You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
            You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
            It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
    Is the reason behind appolyon because his gimmick with the void and no real sustainence
        I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
        Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
I think Tainted Keeper would be so must interesting if he had normal health

Right now the health management for T.Keeper feels so dumb
    thats cuz he is the strongest char with his only weak point being health if he had 3 health he would be just op
        Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
            Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
I found it to be slightly more bearable if you play as a soul-heart only character and load up on Devil Room items. It gives you some semi-reliable DPS through rerolls. The tweaks have made it slightly more bearable, but still pretty ass to work through on Switch. Sanity breaks to get marks as other characters is also a necessity.
    Really? I found the opposite to be true. At first I hated Tainted Eden because I would sometimes roll into Dead Cat which is pretty much an instant loss. But then I stopped taking any items from devil deals/curse rooms/red chests (any pool that could possibly reroll into Dead Cat) as them and sticking to the Angel path and I started enjoying them a lot more. I guess limiting yourself to only soul hearts somewhat gets around that as well, but one of my favorite runs as T. Eden was one where I managed to abuse a prayer card to the point that I had a ton of red hearts that couldn't be rerolled away, so I always had plenty of health.
        By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
            Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
Try the d4 glitch
Yeah, before you would eventually learn to play T. Lost because Esau had bad health scaling among other chase mechanics, but now all you have to do is stay out of Esau's charge range
I mean he always has been the most "meh" character, so it's understandable. But imo not only did the rework make Tainted Laz actually playable in the first place, but also made him actually fun. Actually.
    That's fair. Maybe I was a little hyperbolic, but I do hold that tainted laz is the character I'm least happy to play in a given run. I'd take tainted Jacob or tainted lost in a heartbeat over laz.
        why?
            I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
                Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
                yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
                    >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                        what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
                    While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
They're not underpowered if you get luck on first devil deal and boss items
    But surely you see that " it's fun if you get busted items early " is true for literally every character right? If you don't get that they are pretty underpowered and not even in a particularly fun way.
        I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
        That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
I know this was sarcasm but by the time I have enough of them I’m already at depths lmao
Delirium is like the one case where the locusts kinda suck, and that's just because the arena is very big on top of Deli moving around a lot so the locusts will tend to travel a long distance hitting nothing before returning to you. Most other bosses they do just fine if you know how to aim them. On Mother, Hush. Beast, Dogma, and pretty much all other endgame bosses they do fine. One of the few other bosses I can think of where they kinda suck is against Scolex, but that's just Scolex being Scolex.

The one thing you do need to learn with T. Apollyon is min-maxing how many locusts you're getting. There are lots of ways to get extra items to turn into locusts and you want to be using as many as possible. This does mean taking HP ups early on as often as you can so you can play demon beggars and blood donation machines and sacrifice rooms (all sac rooms are +2 locusts minimum if you fully play them out). If you're high on money but don't want what's in the shop, buy it and hit abyss as you hold it above your head (if it's a passive) to turn it into a locust. You can do the same with Alt-path blind items and blind items in general. Look at it while you hold it, if you don't like it, abyss it.
The way I play him is I try to always have a 2-3x poop combo ready.

&#x200B;

Most obvious combo is **Streak + Holy**; streak buffs  damage and also inherits properties of poops. Holy Poop triples tears and damage or something ridiculous. This is a basic boss-killing trick.

**Double Corny** tossed into a corner allows a constant swarm of flies. You also get to walk out with six flies if you wait for them both to fill before leaving the room.

I use this for slow rooms w/ champions, annoyingly big rooms, and also for bosses if I can't get a holy poop because holy poops are definitely rarer than others.

**Fire + Poison** = mega explosion. Easy burst.

Same for **Bomb + Poison**, and the same interactions happens with **Farts** and **Diarrhea**

**Fire** *or* **Poison + Streak** makes the streak damage enemies and inherit Fire Mind/Poison tears.

**Stone Poops** can take more damage than the others and make for good cover. They also do more damage when tossed (15 normal, stones do 3x that).

When by a poop **streak**, they allow the streak to retain properties of other poops even if those poops are destroyed.

&#x200B;

The fact you can do all of this with zero items is insane and why I love T. Blue Baby; you can always have fun literally slinging shit at the enemy.
Oh, because free devil deals probably.

Also, if they played AB, Lost could get all devil deals for free there so some Old Character bias for some too
    Totally forgot about that.
I downloaded AB at platinum god, I will get real platinum god in AB, I can’t stand rebirth lost (btw tainted lost is just easier rebirth lost)
    Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
        Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
I’d rather play T lost than most other characters, best mixture of challenge and strong builds
    T Isaac is God.
        This was a Lilith thing
            I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
                I hate Lilith
                    She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                    please explain why
Agree.  But after getting all his unlocks.
    Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
        I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
            I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
                Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                    It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
            tainted jacob is really fun
No he isn't.
with the added addition of holy cards which makes it even better
    he truly is
He literally is, yes.
I haven't bought repentance yet, so I haven't tried playing with tainted characters yet, but what changes if you have a high donation count?
    Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
        Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
        Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
            On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
YES! Finally someone who gets it!

The character unlocks make them all more unique and powerful but requires a bit more effort to get to. Tell me, would Isaac be anywhere near as interesting without the D6? Maggy without a Full Health pill? Cain without Paperclip? Keeper without Wooden Nickel and Shop Key? Lazarus without Anemic, Eve without Razor Blade, Lost without Holy Mantle, and... Samson without childs heart i guess...

The problem with the Tainted Characters, however, is that they aren't at all as simple as the normal ones. There's not much you can do to make the Tainted Characters get an extra starting bonus that adds onto what they already have and make them more interesting without making them overpowered. They're already really complex, so it's hard to balance them with just a little more.

Baleful Lost with Wooden Cross, T Isaac with D4, T Samson with Samson's Lock, T Keeper with Head of the Keeper, T ??? with Brown Cap, all of these are the most fitting things I could think of for each of them, but it would either be underwhelming or busted.
    I like a lot of those ideas. I also don’t really like t lost’s birthright. It seems so boring. I wish they would somehow make it more interesting.
        I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
I like T. Lost because you get good base stats + flying + spectral tears at the start and you have a lot higher chance of getting good items/fun builds. Obviously the downside is death, but it's fun juggling around holy cards and there are a good amount of items like hourglass/blank card that can keep you pretty safe. I've found that most bs instant hit rooms for T.Lost are genuinely avoidable/dodgable (tho obv some still exist)
    Idk even know if death is a bad side of t.lost for me personally. I do like shorter runs and a 20-30 minute run that gets you to womb or even further before you die is much better paced than 45m to an hour on a single run where you do win.

I always view playing t.lost as almost like playing a level on Super meat boy or the end is nigh, just go fast, go hard and dont expect to win, but eventually you will.
        I don‘t know even know
    there is no downside of death if you just dodge bozo ![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|4359)
> and you can argue money for devil deals is a nerf since HP-ups are more common than an extra +15 cents

no the fuck you can't because keeper literally couldn't take 2-heart devil deals without an extra life or a Strength card, and even those left you 1 hit from death until you found an HP up
    Also I’m not sure if this was changed but brim made him unplayable. First of all it was so rare to find brim but to actually take it and live , well you needed to be damn lucky, with extra lives or s card. But then the charge was so horrific that it wasn’t even worth it.
        Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
    That's what I meant by 'argue for,'

It's only a nerf if you had HP-ups showered about, which can sometimes be the case. Also wouldn't be as bad since you can spawn with 3 hearts now after Hush.

&#x200B;

Either way, this usually results in me skipping the first devil deal for a free angel deal later since I wouldn't have the money typically
He’s a stressful character, but also one of my favorites
Tainted keeper greedier mode is the hardest thing I’ve done in Th is game other than mother route for tainted Jacob.
    What? Just reset for a 7 cent item, then buy the shit out of it. He is honestly like the easiest Greedier character out there aside from Lilith.
Eh I think he's pretty bad. He's like the lost minus the flight and spectral and less firepower (Lost has more firepower via devil deals, perfection and dice)

I also find myself dying trying to get back the health I lost. Idk. I think J&E and Lost are both way easier than t keeper for example.
    You can get like 4 items a floor + angel and devil deals + you have pretty much infinite cash. He's easily the strongest offensive character in the game with his ability to quickly outpace even azazel, you're just wrong.
        Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
            Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
            This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
        Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
            1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
                Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
                    Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
            I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
                Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
                    Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
        T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
            He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
    I think that T. Keeper is the strongest character in the game while being fairly challenging. The fact alone that you can get to normal tear cap while having quad shot makes him really strong.
Of course you need some luck with the shops but if you do he can get very strong very fast.
The big difference between him and Lost or Jacob & Esau is that you have to play very aggressive with t. Keeper while the Lost can be played extremely cautious as courtesy of his flight and spectral.
        You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
            If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
                It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                    Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                    Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
                Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                    I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
    No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
I don’t at all think finding any of those things are a big concern with T Keeper. Literally any of them are an instant win IMO, his offensive power is so great. if he started with greeds gullet I guarantee you could hit a 3 digit win streak easily lol, he’d be the most OP character in the game
t. keeper should definitely start with deep pockets given how much money you waste after a while
Jacop and Esau are far from bad characters. Double items makes them snowball so fast and they bring so many new strategies by having two active items, consumable and trinkets. The way they designed the controls is dumb though, but after you get used to them they can be such a fun challenge
    You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
        You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
        It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
Is the reason behind appolyon because his gimmick with the void and no real sustainence
    I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
    Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
thats cuz he is the strongest char with his only weak point being health if he had 3 health he would be just op
    Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
        Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
Really? I found the opposite to be true. At first I hated Tainted Eden because I would sometimes roll into Dead Cat which is pretty much an instant loss. But then I stopped taking any items from devil deals/curse rooms/red chests (any pool that could possibly reroll into Dead Cat) as them and sticking to the Angel path and I started enjoying them a lot more. I guess limiting yourself to only soul hearts somewhat gets around that as well, but one of my favorite runs as T. Eden was one where I managed to abuse a prayer card to the point that I had a ton of red hearts that couldn't be rerolled away, so I always had plenty of health.
    By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
        Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
That's fair. Maybe I was a little hyperbolic, but I do hold that tainted laz is the character I'm least happy to play in a given run. I'd take tainted Jacob or tainted lost in a heartbeat over laz.
    why?
        I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
            Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
            yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
                >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                    what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
                While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
But surely you see that " it's fun if you get busted items early " is true for literally every character right? If you don't get that they are pretty underpowered and not even in a particularly fun way.
    I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
    That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
Totally forgot about that.
Thank you! Idk why everyone bitches about tainted Lost when he is literally easier than the first incarnation of regular Lost.
    Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
T Isaac is God.
    This was a Lilith thing
        I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
            I hate Lilith
                She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
                please explain why
Just do the other files. I have done that just to avoid T.Lazarus (Playing in PS4 pre-patch)
    I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
        I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
            Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
                It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
        tainted jacob is really fun
he truly is
Donating enough cash to the greed mode donation machine unlocks the Holy Mantle as a starting item for The Lost. 

The drawback of Tainted Lost is that you don’t start with Holy Mantle.
    Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
    Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.

I feel like a broken record when saying this because I say it everytime J&E are brought up

Double treasure rooms, double starting dps, double actives, consumeables, hp, bombs. Some asterisks here and there of course but in general. They're not as fragile as T. Keeper is.
        If you dont like t keeper because you have ro play aggresively then i cant argue with that because its your personal preference.
Your standpoint to J&E is kinda weird though.
While you do get double treasure room items you dont get double boss room items, which are often the ones you get for basic stat ups. You also only get double bombs but no other consumables really.
And if they get seperated through any bs you will most likely get hit.
            It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
                Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
                Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
            Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
                I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
No way. T. Keeper is easily one of the strongest characters in the game.
You cannot snowball if you have to split the items all the time. I always ended with two underpowered characters and of course dying due to bs damage. This game is not designed for two characters. Period.
    You don't split them all the time. Go to alt-path and you basically get double item room items all the time. Now get a lucky angel room with at least two items and you are all set. You end up with way more items than other characters quickly which is why they snowball the game.
    It not being designed for two characters swings both ways. The 'splitting' doesn't really hurt much because you'll have the items being used all the time.

You also get to hold 2x actives, trinkets ,and cards—actives might be hard to find on some runs, but you can definitely take advantage of double trinkets and cards.

You can also buy two store items with just 15 cents if you walk in right. Two angel deals, and both items in alt-path as well, though those are more famous.
I just have a particular hard time with him not really that he is bad I just have a harder time using the void in comparison to the other starter actives although he can become very overpowered with a good library
Isaac that eats items as opposed to rerolling them.
Maybe a different system where the only way to get health would be to buy it ?

Imagine if he has normal red health, but the only way to get hearts would be to buy them (in shops and boss rooms)

The only problem it that red health wouldn't be much thematic for him
    Then he becomes boring, t keeper is one of the best chars cuz he is high risk high reward, a balanced one at that. Red hearts would make him boring and easy sure he might not get deals, but fuck it the sheer amount of power you can amass with just shops is still ridiculous , if he had more health, steam sale, restock and member card would be just a win run 100%.
By the way, the last big patch fixed the 9 lives thing, if you roll into it you don't instantly lose anymore. I actually won a run yesterday cause I rolled into 9 lives (one of many other times during the run) on my last heart during beast, and that made me ress (without rerolling) and kill the boss.
    Oh cool, I didn't realize they changed that interaction. What does rolling into 9 lives do now? Does it just give you the extra lives without reducing you to one red heart?
why?
    I think they are both much more interesting to actually play. I just think tainted laz was unplayable before the rework and a little boring after the rework imo.
        Eh, fair, he's not bad but it's not the most interesting mechanic
        yeah, tainted laz got pretty boring after the rework. He was my favourite character by far before the rework but after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to have to do, which is my favourite part about the game. Now he is just like most other characters where you can not rly give a shit and still win with a mild amount of luck.
            >after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
                what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
            While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
I'm not talking about overpowered item. You just need some good stats up.
That's not much different from playing a normal character now that you can get 2x treasure items for both Laz's.

But devil deals can be extra good on them  because you can give one version of Laz the items for free. My go-to strat is to fatten Alive Laz with HP-ups bc they spawn with red hearts normally.

Then buy a bunch of deals and switch to Dead Laz for free ***devil*** items.
Repentance is honestly a lot harder than rebirth
This was a Lilith thing
    I'm just making a random comment. Not relevant to the post. T Isaac is God.
        I hate Lilith
            She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
            please explain why
I have finished every character except T Jacob and T Lost. There is nothing left and I really want to finish the game but these two characters are just awful and I am not enjoying at all getting their unlocks. T Lost is kinda funny because you can get really strong but dying all the time due to stupid BS hits you cannot avoid is very annoying.

By the way, I feel you. Pre-patch T Lazarus is even worse. After the patch he is actually funny to play and if you get Birthright it is free win.
    I think the tainted characters you can get their unlocks on normal which is handy, then you can grind hard with some of the fancier items. 

You can get gnawed leaf with t lost doing some funky shit with items, so there's always that...
        Im pretty sure gnawed leaf is banned on tlost tho
            It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
    tainted jacob is really fun
Oh okay. Thanks for explaining
Another "drawback" is that most defensive items and health ups, even those that are good for the lost like holy mantle, as well as all but 1 respawn item (his birthright) are also taken out of the pool. You're guaranteed good damage, but *that's all you're getting*.
    On the other half, any run that gets past Depths 2 FUCKS.
I like BD1P's idea of letting him walk through walls, but letting him find defensive Items would work too (9 Lives, Gnawed Leaf, maybe even Holy Mantle!)
I don‘t know even know
Correct. I remember Strength-carding for a Brim once on an XL first floor and then dying next floor because it took so goddamn long to charge blasts.

&#x200B;

And you couldn't abuse 3x Brimstone either without dying
Tainted keeper was the easiest of my unlocks like... he gets so powerful so quickly it's insane
    Definitely one of the characters where every single unlock run was broken. I basically one shot Delirium on my first Tkeeper run. 

Only other character close in reliable bustedness for me is Tmaggy, but it might have just been my luck giving me 5 2-Item-Breaks in back to back on her...
    This. Oh look at all these coins. Oh look at all these incredible deals in the shop. Oh look, I can use the sacrifice room in every run. Tainted Keeper is amazing.
Besides T. Lost he's the most fragile character in the game and 4 items a floor is reaching. Maybe towards later floors but early floors you won't get more than 2. 

Perfection on lost makes lost a powerhouse. Any luck-based item is instantly A if not S-tier and you need just one to shred basically any boss. No money needed, no need to get close to your enemies when you're always two-hit. Nothing. Free cursed rooms. Dice.

Lost easily outpaces Azazel as well only difference being is Lost is not a low-firerate sitting duck early game. Maybe in super lategame Keeper deals more damage than Lost but at that point we're talking such high numbers on both that it doesn't matter.
    1. Its easily 4
2. You don't need luck if you get 4 items a floor + inherent quad shot
3. Early game does not matter at all, you shouldn't be getting hit on basement and by the end of basement you have the means to succeed later in the run, lost is a strong character offensively for sure, but t.keeper is literally just better.
        Late game (Not super late game because if you get to super late game i.e. Mega Satan, Corpse or Void your run is good enough to where random bullshit can't even stop you) T Keeper still runs the risk of getting two-hit and dying, even on strong runs. You'll be chasing a coin which despawns quickly and sometimes entering rooms as one-hit. Lost is two-hit as well, but it's defensive playstyle makes it easier to avoid getting hit while still putting out damage. 

Quad shot is nice, but with base fire rate in the beginning it's not super good which makes early game keeper annoying.

T-Keeper can't compete with Lost, Perfection is wayy too strong of a trinket for that.
            Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
    I think the shop difference giving T-Keeper a definite Item benefit is true, but it's at least debatable against the losts ability to abuse luck and stuff like damocles. 

What T-Keeper definitely has over T-Lost though, and what keeps me from putting the two even close to the same category of fragility, is that keeper can easily recover lost healt. Got hit because of a dumb bullet you didn't see? Just pick up a coin, they're literally the most common pick up, and you are actively generating them yourself. Get hit as T-Lost? Good luck digging for another holy card. Many conventional T-Lost strategies are built around generating more of them, and even then it's far from guaranteed. 

I got all my T-Keeper unlicks within 10 games because I kept snowballing and insulating my runs through abusing the shop, and I still like to pick him up for fun. On the other hand, I went on -50 loss streaks and more for almost every T-lost unlock, because even the most OP can get knocked out by some finnicky mausoleum whipper or an unfortunate champion enemy.
        Lol, I'm not arguing about T-Lost. I'm arguing about THE Lost. As in regular lost. T-Lost sucks compared to T-Keeper, or, really, in general.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
            Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
T. Judas is arguably stronger imo, especially against bullet hell bosses.
    He was nerfed pretty heavily, and the consistency of his damage boost is pretty low compared to getting 4 items a floor
You said it yourself why I have a problem with T. Keeper. You have to play aggressively. The Lost can die from random bullshit, sure, but as long as you keep your distance and are careful you can bring the times it happens down to next to never. Enter T. Keeper who has to always be close quarters ESPECIALLY when one-hit to be able to grab that coin he needs. You're opening yourself up for way more bullshit deaths than what Lost has ever to offer.

I got my THE lost unlocks within like 5 games barring Greedier (took a few resets to get that). I've died on a ton of T-Keeper runs from random bullshit. Did just get a lucky one though where I managed to land Dark room, Mega Satan and Deli in one run. A whole handful of close calls though.
    Aight, my bad, I get you. T-Keeper vs. regular Lost is definitely a more level playing field, and I'd agree that Keeper is probably more fragile in a couple of ways, although in my opinion more prone to popping off, even with cursed D6/devil deal potential.
It’s literally a skill issue. Because T Keeper is more aggressive, it takes a lot more actual ability than the Lost who innately has great defensive ability.
    Nah I think it has more to do with playstyle tbh. I'm also way better at fighting bosses than clearing rooms and Lost is great at room clearing but kinda shit against bosses while Keeper is the exact opposite.
    Lost is a hard character too imo
Especially if you dont get any luck based items
Treasure rooms are generally better than Boss items. Sure, boss items are more consistent, but if every item was a boss room item, I'd suspect Isaac would be kind of hard. It's the treasure room items (and angel/devil items) that help you scale and dominate runs.

Also your double bombs argument is kinda weird. Saying that not getting double keys or coins makes J&E bad is like saying your life sucks because you have a big ass house but no brand new sports car.

And getting seperated sucks I guess, but if you master controlling Jacob seperately it's not too bad.
    I brought up the double bomb argument because you said that you get double consumables which I didnt really understand
But i can agree on item or deal items are possibly the ones that will win the run but most of the time thyre kind of a let down
And im probably just ass with j&e so thats why theyre the worst character imo
>after the rework u dont really need to do as much micromanagement and small plays as you used to

I don't really get what you mean there. All the same micro management options are still available to you that there were pre-rework, except now in rooms where items naturally spawn, there are more items available. But if you want a particular item on a specific Lazarus, you still need to do the same flip shenanigans as before. In fact, I'd argue there's even more micro management since the additional items mean more options to manage. Say for instance you want both the regular and the ghostly item from a room on the same Laz? That means you need your flip charged and to be the correct laz so you can take the item on the Laz you want it on, then flip to make the ghostly item obtainable, then go clear a room and come back. And if that's in a room like the shop where there are multiple items that you may want to split differently, that means you need even more flip shenanigans to get them all.

If you still prefer his original form, to each their own, but I don't think it's fair to say that the patch in any way reduced the micro management required to play him optimally- it just gave him more items to work with.
    what i meant was that since hes a better character you dont really need to do any of the micro management to win with him, and because of that it feels like a waste of time to do any micro management which takes time to do. I was exaggurating shen i said he was meh, i still rly enjoy playing him but not as much as pre rework
While I didn't care for him pre-rework, I agree that he almost barely feels like a tainted character post rework.
She CAN be good. Like if you have a pretty high damage and get the 9 volt and just keep spamming followers. It just requires some work.
please explain why
It's possible to get banned items using spindown dice I think.
Necropolis: You'll have the coins needed to buy out the shop. You can get more coins pretty easily as the rooms are usually low enemy. 

Womb: You don't need many coins, 30 at the most. 

Cathedral/Sheol: You don't need coins.

Chest: You don't need coins.

Dark Room: You'll have enough coins from the no coin floors earlier + coins that are easy to get from boss kills.

The chasing coins argument is meaningless. You can play defensive when it matters because you don't need coins when playing defensive matters. I think you heavily over-value perfection and luck based items in general, because the best chance items in the game don't even scale with luck. You can hate playing the character, but you being bad at it doesn't make the character any less good.
