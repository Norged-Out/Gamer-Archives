[[It only removes red hearts, right]]





Everyone learn the effect in the hard way.
    This whole game is about learning things the hard way tho hahah
        I learned the passive effect of cursed eye the hard way
            Ugh, I hate that item with Azazel. The joys of not looking up how items work haha. I may have fallen for it on at least 3 occasions.
                Cursed eye has no effect on Azazel and will never teleport. Edit: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                    I mean, that's just wrong. At least on Switch it is.
                        I don't know if the Switch version is different, but I doubt it. I recorded a clip showing it doesn't teleport on PC: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                            Actually is not guaranteed; it's a chance.
                                You can test it yourself; it's not a chance. If you are charging, you will teleport on damage. If not or at full charge, you will not.
                                    It is a chance; it's not gonna happen every time.
                    I'm pretty sure cursed eye causes Azazel to teleport- it has no positive effect on his attack though.


Lilith doesn't teleport, but still gets a positive effect on incubus.

Also, Black Candle completely removed the teleport part.
                        It must have changed.

I was trying to unlock the forgotten with azazel and was having a really good run and then picked up the item  by mistake.

I thought maybe because I had azazel it wouldn’t do nothing and it didn’t. I finished the challenge  with it.
                            Cursed eye doesn't automatically teleport you each time you get hit , its a 50% chance i think
                                It is (or *was*, who knows with repentance) based on the charge meter, if you get hit while charging you teleport, but if you're holding at 100 or not charging at all you don't
                                    Actually, that is how it _now_ works with Repentance. It _used_ to be just a chance, I think a 25% chance, but I’m not sure about that.
                            Maybe you only got hit when you already had a full charge
                        Just confirming it indeed does not teleport you, I've posted a clip throughout this thread but I'll drop it here as well: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                            I have had experience with cursed eye and it does unless you have black candle
                                You can test it yourself with a seed or the debug console if you'd like.
                                    I've gotten cursed eye before with many characters including azazel also cant do debug console
                    Really??
                        No
                        Yes.
                            It most definitely does teleport you lol
                                I posted a clip in a few threads, you can also test for yourself that it actually doesn't teleport you with Azazel.
                                    Didnt you pick up the black candle?
                            That's incorrect.
                                https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                                    Well damn, I would have bet real money that I had been teleported from it on him within the last couple of weeks. That's what I get for not verifying before trying to correct someone like some kinda dickhead I guess.

My bad. Have a good day.
                                It is not incorrect, black candle removes all curses, cursed eye included
                                    You're not wrong, but they're talking about azazel, not black candle, so idk why you bring it up
                    r/confidentlyincorrect
                        https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                    This is an injustice
            In case you didn't know, if you have black candle, cursed eye does not teleport anymore.
                Yes, i know, but I've had black candle and cursed eye in the same run once
                It's done that since original afterbirth
            I learned not to take curse room items with curse of the blind because of cursed eye
                I haven't learned that one yet gimmie them items
            It's not that bad, he says
                Cursed eye would be ok if it synergised with holy mantle
                    I think it does now, but don't quote me
                        It does
            Of course, Learning is fun, _And learning demands suffering_

            I took it ~5 times and always wondering why tf i was teleporting all the time until a friend told me its the cursed eye ╥﹏╥
        [deleted]
            Which is why I am super exciting for mods coming back, so I no longer have to tab out to look it up.

Only improvement now would be if someone could make an addon for PlatinumGod that makes it link to the wiki in addition to those semi-useless descriptions (half of the time I use wiki, it's to look up weird interactions or synergies, which PG doesn't cover).

I tried to do it myself with javascript, managed to get the elements containing the item names, and make links based on them, but I'm too dumb to figure out how to convert the <p> tags to <a> tags.
        Only run I ever lost with Sacred Heart was the run I took ludovico on.
            Ludo is the worst item istg.
        I’ll never forget one run from my earliest days. I was finally getting good at the game, and was ready to beat Mom’s Heart for the very first time...

And then I got Curse of the Tower

Yeah... didn’t beat her that time
        Hahaha definitely true, happened many times years ago when I first played it
Although when I picked it back up after the expansions I just look new stuff up on the wiki haha, fuck it
        Used the Bible on Satan today. It was cool:)
    Would be the best item ever if it just respawned you in the room, but then it would probably be too op
        It's op for the beast fight for exactly that reason
            Thank god it is. Nobody wants to respawn after their "prime" life runs out (most likely due to low dmg output), just to have to probably fight the horsemen again and again and again with one heart until dying for real.

The Beast being more of a last hurrah feels exactly right, especially after Dogma's 9000mph feather zoomies and other assorted annoying bullshit he throws at you in the second phase.
                I honestly hate the feeling of losing a boss fight with 6 full hears, and then having to try to no-hit it 9 times. It’s so incredibly demoralizing and for most characters I kinda hate this item because of it
                    Dead cat was super op when you could bomb yourself to death in the boss room and it would spawn a new boss. I've never found a good use for the extra lives outside of devil deals. Once you die the first time just R baby.
                        Reroll with d4 after picking it up and keep the lives was another use, but was fixed.

Also, Suicide King item farming. Blank Card it 9 times, then pick up the items on your last life and probably get a lot of max hearts back.

Or on The Lost.
                        You can use it to farm Sacrifice room until the big payout. Also reducing you to 1 red heart was arguably an upside in AB/AB+.
                        Every run is winnable
                            Not wrong, but I'm neither good enough to win every run or willing to spend time playing a game in a way I don't enjoy. I'm just happy that I can crush things as judas every once in a while lol.
                            Yeah, if you're good enough. But I don't know any people good enough to win a Eden run that starts with 1 red heart, lower than normal damage and tears, razor blade and brother bobby with a ghost baby in a treasure room :D
                                Lol i wasn't saying you have to. But it's fun to try sometimes! Never know what's waiting for you on that 2nd floor item room !
                                    I try to do that sometimes, I only give up after getting -5 streak in 20 minutes. Example: I played yesterday a run where my only damage ups were curved horn on caves 2 and then negative after mom's fight. I died in dark room because it was just too much.
                                At least you are 1 step from conjoined
                    Well, today i beat Isaac on my 9th life with half a heart (i got the waffer on the first floor, and I'm omw to unlock the polaroid)
                        Good job!
                            Thanks!
Technically it's my first ever save file from scratch, but i know all there's to know because of watching youtube, and when AB+ came out I played a lot with a pirate copy and a downloaded save file.

I'm still gittin gud
                                Well I’m glad you’re well on your way to the true experience. And by the way, thank you for switching from your pirated copy. Games like these definitely deserve to be supported directly.
                                    Yeah, well... I don't see myself unlocking godhead in my entire life, but we'll see.

I always try to buy the games i like, or the ones i can afford (specially being from Argentina, where a dollar is as expensive as a kidney).

Supporting small companies that make good games is the best we can do as consumers.
                    It’s good on either Lost, and sometimes it comes in clutch. Plus, even if you do waste all your lives it’s a valuable learning experience. That was how I learned Hush’s patterns, by throwing myself at him about 9 times
                        Is there some way to get it on alt Lost? I haven't found one, but I haven't really been searching either.
                            Unless you have Spindown Dice, unfortunately no. But it’s still excellent for regular lost
                        Ah, the Edge of Tomorrow strategy.
                        Before the patch when the Dead Cat would give infinite lifes if you happen to pick it as Esau, I did the same with Mother.  
Pros: I'm a god at that fight now.  
Cons: Dying 30 times in a row made me a bit insane.
                    You are using it the wrong way or with the wrong characters. In short, dead cat is for when you have no red hearts on a red heart character (you have a bunch of soul hearts), have taken several devil deals and are operating on low hearts, are trying to complete a guppy set, you are The Lost, you have something that triggers on death/revival such as Suicide King, trying to make a good one heart build (you are eve or have Whore of Babylon), you have a reliable way or getting health ups or soul hearts, so on. Do NOT just blindly take it... you have to have an entire build around it.
                        Big brain strat: With Potatoe pealer, you can have 2 level 4 meatboys in exchange for the lifes.
                        Well yes, but some final bosses are really hard to beat without a hit. I’m mostly talking about after you already have your build and say you have a lot of soul hearts. If you manage to lose all those hearts, no matter how good your build is, you’re usually screwed cause you’ll only have a red heart when you respawn, and even if you’re able to scour soul hearts from the floor, you almost always end up with less than your first life. If you can beat the boss your first try you’re fine, but if you manage to die you’re basically screwed.
                            Yea, no one outside of The Lost can actually use the other lives like that. You are missing the point of the item / using it incorrectly. Unless you are super OP, or a great player, beating bosses with only 1 hp ain't feasible. You are supposed to use dead cat to do any of the things I listed above, NOT as 8 hopeless chances to get the boss kill. After the first death, after losing all your built up hearts, the run is effectively OVER. Ignore the other lives, you lost. You can either 1) practice 2) scour the floor for SOMETHING that might help... 3) try those 8 attempts and maybe get lucky. Option 3 is NOT what you should be looking for with this item.
                                That’s fair
                    I got guppy's collar and had it activate about 12 times fighting that one  3 stage Corpse boss.

I got so close so many times but God that was frustrating.
                        You lucky sonbitch

I get guppys collar and it usually activates 0 times lmao
                            Yeah same usually. I opened it free and was like "yeah ok"

Even being that lucky I didn't do anything with it lol
                        I got Dead Cat and Guppy's Collar (no 3rd item though) on a recent Lost run and after Dead Cat ran out I must have gotten at least a dozen Collar respawns, I kept expecting it to happen but my luck only ran out againstb one of  Mega Satan's spawn bosses
                    Or being cursed and getting hit and having to restart two of three times. Yuck
                    i mean, sure, but normally you would just be straight up dead. Whereas the cat gives you chances to possibly still win even after you have failed.
            Idk if it qas a bug with lazarus or what but the 2nd time i died with 9 lives i thikk i stayed in the rpoom but then the 3rd time i think i restarted from before dogma
                I think lazarus revive has a higher priority than dead cat, so you triggered his built in revive before dead cat. Lazarus revive is a same room revive.
                    I’m pretty sure you’re right, I think Laz rags have higher priority than everything except the 1up mushroom
                        You're correct. 1up > Laz Rags (or Laz's natural revive) > Dead Cat > Guppy's collar, followed by all the other revive items.
        I wonder if there's enough similar revival effects that it would be worth making a trinket that stops you from getting teleported outside the room. Maybe it could stop the Cursed Eye teleport and neutralize Curse of the Maze too.

edit: and if you wanted to be mean it could also stop getting teleported to the devil or angel room from chests and sacrifice rooms
        At least you feel a little of adrenaline.

    The creation of this meme was absolutely not fueled in any way by me learning about this effect the hard way in a tainted blue baby run I had just prior to making it.
    I learned it from this meme 😎
    I just learned the hard way that you need to the polaroid or negative to open the >!strange door!< I was the lost and I had a super op run too :(
        Pro tip : the >!faded polaroid!< works, too !
            This is not true. Do you mean the Faded Polaroid?
                Omg you're right sorry I always confuse these two !


(Comment corrected)
            NO THAT DROPPED ON THAT FLOOR TOO :((( well at least I know now :p

Edit: just checked the wiki and it says it can't be used so nvm
    Sometime more than ~~once~~ ~~twice~~ every other run
    If you didn’t learn about the Bible on Satan the hard way, did you really play Isaac?
    Apparently not me, i just started the game today. So apparently nine lives removes all your current hearts to 1?
    Using the Bible fighting Satan losing my first good blue baby run
This was me on my first run of blue baby and oh god i did not learn my lesson the first time, i got very confused and did it again in another run like a dumbass
    northernlion moment
        Pot play moment
        when he spends more brain cells on banter than the very thing he’s streaming😂
            it's more fun than watching safe plays at least
                THE ZANE
                    worth it every time man
            And yet he's somehow still way better than I ever will be giving the game my full attention.
                yea lol i was doing a tainted run earlier and got poly+brimstone and died bcz of youtube🙄
    Brother?
        BROTHER!
[I got bored.](https://i.imgur.com/1ZfGELy.png)
    Beautiful, why didn't I think to do that
        [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/7jXWqyo.png)
    that's amazing and i love you for it
Nine Lives is also pretty rough with lategame Tainted Eden. Pretty much every hit from Womb onwards is rolling the dice on whether all your health just straight-up disappears. ofc it’s incredibly powerful for Lost and other aggressive Devil Deal builds.
    Seriously, I don’t understand why the extra lives were removed on reroll (dead cat used to persist rerolls) but the HP penalty still applies. Not to mention the fact every other form of HP gain is reverted on reroll now.
        if edmund wants to make tainted eden fair then he has to either remove dead cat from items that it can reroll into or keep the lives, it's literally the only reason you shouldn't ever take deals while having any amount of red hearts because this shit will just steal your hearts and will never revive you even once, it's just so stupid
    Yeah, I think the existence of 9 lives pretty much means devil and curse pool items are off limits for t. Eden... I've been screwed over too many times  rolling into it, which is a shame
Wow holy shit I lucked out. Literally just had a run with this exact set up. Tons of health and an offered dead cat. 
I almost took it when "but what if" entered my head it caused me to leave. I lost anyways but at least I got boss rush and hush done.

Edit-Spelling and stuff
    Yup... One mildly negative thing about Repentance is that often things just work only in the worst way imagineable.


Stuff like Forgotten and ??? being set to 1 HP with Dead Cat, as their hearts are basically just treated like red hearts for items is relatively minor. But on the other hand, a lot of items get hard nerfed while penalties still apply. Example being Keeper and extra shots.


Keeper gets the full penalty from 20/20 and The Inner Eye while only gaining one extra tear from each. So combined that's just really throwing his dps down. 

Assuming Inner Eye Delay works the same Keeper starts with a Tear Delay of 28. Inner Eye is a Penalty of (Tears = Tears·2.1+3) = 61.8. For the new tps counter that's (30/(1+61.8)) = 30/63 = 0.48 (Which I'm pretty sure is correct since I was stupid enough to take that combo once) 

Now damage is 4.2 (base) · 0.75 = 3.15 


So, Keeper with Inner Eye and 20/20 vs normal Keeper:

 * Normal Keeper: 3 tears at 1.06 shots per second at 4.2 damage per tear:
  * 3 · 1.06 · 4.2 = 13.356 dps if he hits all 3 tears

 * BothShots Keeper: 5 tears at 0.48 shots per second  at 3.15 damage per shot:
  * 5 · 0.48 · 3.15 = 7.56 if he hits all 5 tears

So put in more work to get half the damage... and this seems like a specific example, but you can really just substitute so many things. Brimstone does similar things to your tears.. (Although with arguably the damage to back it up... until you collect another tears down...)
    That's pretty mush.
        What does that mean?
            you know, it's just kinda wured  
a bit jinky  
somewhat breek
Honestly I just grab this item for devil deals lol
Dead cat + potato peeler = 2 full grown meat boys. Just had a run where they carried me all the way.
I'll still forget again at some point
me every goddamn time, never again
Dead cat bad item
    Idk man it carries hard when fighting beast, especially as the lost
    When you have only two red hearts it’s pretty good. It’s only an upgrade, plus a guppy item.
        I got like four health upgrades over the course of a floor before remembering I specifically skipped a Nine Lives at the beginning of the floor because I was only on two hearts.

*sigh*
    It’s good as Judas
        Or lost.
            Or anytime you have items that give you hearts.
        [deleted]
            Really? That makes it even better, instead of having to retry a boss with 1 hp
    It’s good if you have low red hearts, hell it’s free if you have only one. It also lets you get tons of Devil deals you otherwise wouldn’t.
    I almost always take it for that guppy transformation. But it’s a pretty bad item on it’s own, especially if you had alot of red hearts before picking it up.
    Dead cat item
This happened to me with tainted Judas, in necropolis 2 with full black hearts :/
Just hope you were 1 item away to bring guppy
On the plus side, this actually functions as a health up if you have 0 red hearts

If you can have red hearts, at least
I dont know that
This used to be legit back when soul hearts were plentiful.

Now not only does this suck, I just can't play blue baby at all anymore.
Blueless
Same with Glass Cannon.

Regret.
I wish I saw this an hour ago
Worth it if you become guppy!
I did this in the chest with Tainted Judas and died on the inside. (But I had glyph of balance too which literally saved my life)
Actually did this today to haha definitely learnt my lesson on that one!
Did it in a Greed run few days ago (at Sheol/The Chest w/ a weak build but blue hearts at max), i was like "Wtf is that shit ?", so i went on the Isaac wiki to see what kind of black magic it was.

R key was my best friend here 😭
Why do people even play as Blue Baby?
    Completion marks
    Their Machocists
I had this same situation pop up but I had the foresight to google it.


Unfortunately the result I found was a steam community question where the first two responses, the only ones I read, were two chucklefucks who said “yeah it only removes red hearts it’ll just give you a free spirit heart”.


Why even fucking comment if you don’t know the answer to the question
what a noob haha... \*uses bible on satan fight
    Noob: FFFUUUCCCKKK!!!
fun thing to learn on a tainted bethany run :))))
Am I the only one who didn't assume this their first time? I mean, if Blue Baby has no red hearts, it makes sense that it would just reduce his only source of health instead. Not trying to be arrongant or anything, I'm just curious.
    For me it made sense that 9 lives would not remove soul hearts on blue baby because the character is dogshit as you can't get red hearts so  "some items must be better on him". Then I picked it up, lost 8 soul hearts, and remembered I'm playing the binding of isaac so of course you lose all soul hearts.
        Understandable
Please tell me this is not true?
    It very much is
        [deleted]
            true
        Oof
Imma interested in mods thatll give serpents kiss and maw their black heart drop rates again TwT
you newsaacs know you run guppy’s paw with dead cat for three soul heart restart, right?
    Not while playing as blue baby.
        yes, but everyone’s deciding dead cat is generally bad. 


it’s pseudo 9 hearts with an add tether to save your run. you can easily do a full sacrifice room, opportunity for two angel room items or keys, and gain another +7 soul hearts on the second to last sacrifice proc. 


y’all are simple
    Sure, if you have it.
Happened to me once, lesson learned.
That's because Soul Hearts on blue baby are counted as red hearts. HP up pills and items will give you soul hearts, same thing for HP downs.
My first time making it to delirium with blue baby, I'll never forget it.
It's so tempting when you could always get a Guppy run... TO TEMPTING TO RESIST.... but 99% of the time ends in failure
That literally just happened to me
"Welly at least now I know!"


Curse of the blind.

Unknown item in the Curse Room. 

"Here we go again."
Today i went for delirium and almost take it.
 I'm glad that my danger sense was active
In every version of the game, I ruined a good run, because I keep forgeting its effects.
That happened to me once and I died in side
*laughs in I manage to find genesis every run somehow*
I mean... *technically* you only lost 3 hearts. The rest got converted into extra lives.
    Technically they lost 11 hearts and gained 9 more lives.
        Technically it's an overall loss anyways :)
I picked it up yesterday during the BRAINS! challenge because I forgot about this, did beat it though.
is this new in repentance? i speedran blue baby unlocks so i cant even remember how he worked
Recently played Keeper and saw Abaddon for 30 cents. Only after I bought did I realize my mistake.
Yes, the best item for characters that don't have red hearts or Bethany
Does it do that to "Bethany" aswell?
Just happened to me yesterday and I was like "wait.. what did a do??"

Yea, I'm a noob
Only works into all hearts, f blue baby
or you pick it up from a red chest with curse of blind
I took it as Tainted Keeper, so I know the pain, ended up winning and killing delirium, but it was painful
weren't that obvious? other characters have red hearts as base and only red hearts are taken, Blue Baby have Soul/Black Hearts as base so Dead cat takes them
He must feel so blue
I always keep the guide for items pulled up when i play
Just lost like 9 hearts in greed mode to this, good times
Literally what happened today and then i died to satan
and from that day forward, dumb guy never played blue baby again
This literally happened to me an hour ago wtf
This is EXACTLY what happened to me
What does it do?

Funny thing is, Flash Isaac had a bug where you could get red health with Dead Cat and Blue Baby. Just lose a life, and you get red health.
Damn it used to do that??
That item is trash
This whole game is about learning things the hard way tho hahah
    I learned the passive effect of cursed eye the hard way
        Ugh, I hate that item with Azazel. The joys of not looking up how items work haha. I may have fallen for it on at least 3 occasions.
            Cursed eye has no effect on Azazel and will never teleport. Edit: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                I mean, that's just wrong. At least on Switch it is.
                    I don't know if the Switch version is different, but I doubt it. I recorded a clip showing it doesn't teleport on PC: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                        Actually is not guaranteed; it's a chance.
                            You can test it yourself; it's not a chance. If you are charging, you will teleport on damage. If not or at full charge, you will not.
                                It is a chance; it's not gonna happen every time.
                I'm pretty sure cursed eye causes Azazel to teleport- it has no positive effect on his attack though.


Lilith doesn't teleport, but still gets a positive effect on incubus.

Also, Black Candle completely removed the teleport part.
                    It must have changed.

I was trying to unlock the forgotten with azazel and was having a really good run and then picked up the item  by mistake.

I thought maybe because I had azazel it wouldn’t do nothing and it didn’t. I finished the challenge  with it.
                        Cursed eye doesn't automatically teleport you each time you get hit , its a 50% chance i think
                            It is (or *was*, who knows with repentance) based on the charge meter, if you get hit while charging you teleport, but if you're holding at 100 or not charging at all you don't
                                Actually, that is how it _now_ works with Repentance. It _used_ to be just a chance, I think a 25% chance, but I’m not sure about that.
                        Maybe you only got hit when you already had a full charge
                    Just confirming it indeed does not teleport you, I've posted a clip throughout this thread but I'll drop it here as well: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                        I have had experience with cursed eye and it does unless you have black candle
                            You can test it yourself with a seed or the debug console if you'd like.
                                I've gotten cursed eye before with many characters including azazel also cant do debug console
                Really??
                    No
                    Yes.
                        It most definitely does teleport you lol
                            I posted a clip in a few threads, you can also test for yourself that it actually doesn't teleport you with Azazel.
                                Didnt you pick up the black candle?
                        That's incorrect.
                            https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                                Well damn, I would have bet real money that I had been teleported from it on him within the last couple of weeks. That's what I get for not verifying before trying to correct someone like some kinda dickhead I guess.

My bad. Have a good day.
                            It is not incorrect, black candle removes all curses, cursed eye included
                                You're not wrong, but they're talking about azazel, not black candle, so idk why you bring it up
                r/confidentlyincorrect
                    https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                This is an injustice
        In case you didn't know, if you have black candle, cursed eye does not teleport anymore.
            Yes, i know, but I've had black candle and cursed eye in the same run once
            It's done that since original afterbirth
        I learned not to take curse room items with curse of the blind because of cursed eye
            I haven't learned that one yet gimmie them items
        It's not that bad, he says
            Cursed eye would be ok if it synergised with holy mantle
                I think it does now, but don't quote me
                    It does
        Of course, Learning is fun, _And learning demands suffering_

        I took it ~5 times and always wondering why tf i was teleporting all the time until a friend told me its the cursed eye ╥﹏╥
    [deleted]
        Which is why I am super exciting for mods coming back, so I no longer have to tab out to look it up.

Only improvement now would be if someone could make an addon for PlatinumGod that makes it link to the wiki in addition to those semi-useless descriptions (half of the time I use wiki, it's to look up weird interactions or synergies, which PG doesn't cover).

I tried to do it myself with javascript, managed to get the elements containing the item names, and make links based on them, but I'm too dumb to figure out how to convert the <p> tags to <a> tags.
    Only run I ever lost with Sacred Heart was the run I took ludovico on.
        Ludo is the worst item istg.
    I’ll never forget one run from my earliest days. I was finally getting good at the game, and was ready to beat Mom’s Heart for the very first time...

And then I got Curse of the Tower

Yeah... didn’t beat her that time
    Hahaha definitely true, happened many times years ago when I first played it
Although when I picked it back up after the expansions I just look new stuff up on the wiki haha, fuck it
    Used the Bible on Satan today. It was cool:)
Would be the best item ever if it just respawned you in the room, but then it would probably be too op
    It's op for the beast fight for exactly that reason
        Thank god it is. Nobody wants to respawn after their "prime" life runs out (most likely due to low dmg output), just to have to probably fight the horsemen again and again and again with one heart until dying for real.

The Beast being more of a last hurrah feels exactly right, especially after Dogma's 9000mph feather zoomies and other assorted annoying bullshit he throws at you in the second phase.
            I honestly hate the feeling of losing a boss fight with 6 full hears, and then having to try to no-hit it 9 times. It’s so incredibly demoralizing and for most characters I kinda hate this item because of it
                Dead cat was super op when you could bomb yourself to death in the boss room and it would spawn a new boss. I've never found a good use for the extra lives outside of devil deals. Once you die the first time just R baby.
                    Reroll with d4 after picking it up and keep the lives was another use, but was fixed.

Also, Suicide King item farming. Blank Card it 9 times, then pick up the items on your last life and probably get a lot of max hearts back.

Or on The Lost.
                    You can use it to farm Sacrifice room until the big payout. Also reducing you to 1 red heart was arguably an upside in AB/AB+.
                    Every run is winnable
                        Not wrong, but I'm neither good enough to win every run or willing to spend time playing a game in a way I don't enjoy. I'm just happy that I can crush things as judas every once in a while lol.
                        Yeah, if you're good enough. But I don't know any people good enough to win a Eden run that starts with 1 red heart, lower than normal damage and tears, razor blade and brother bobby with a ghost baby in a treasure room :D
                            Lol i wasn't saying you have to. But it's fun to try sometimes! Never know what's waiting for you on that 2nd floor item room !
                                I try to do that sometimes, I only give up after getting -5 streak in 20 minutes. Example: I played yesterday a run where my only damage ups were curved horn on caves 2 and then negative after mom's fight. I died in dark room because it was just too much.
                            At least you are 1 step from conjoined
                Well, today i beat Isaac on my 9th life with half a heart (i got the waffer on the first floor, and I'm omw to unlock the polaroid)
                    Good job!
                        Thanks!
Technically it's my first ever save file from scratch, but i know all there's to know because of watching youtube, and when AB+ came out I played a lot with a pirate copy and a downloaded save file.

I'm still gittin gud
                            Well I’m glad you’re well on your way to the true experience. And by the way, thank you for switching from your pirated copy. Games like these definitely deserve to be supported directly.
                                Yeah, well... I don't see myself unlocking godhead in my entire life, but we'll see.

I always try to buy the games i like, or the ones i can afford (specially being from Argentina, where a dollar is as expensive as a kidney).

Supporting small companies that make good games is the best we can do as consumers.
                It’s good on either Lost, and sometimes it comes in clutch. Plus, even if you do waste all your lives it’s a valuable learning experience. That was how I learned Hush’s patterns, by throwing myself at him about 9 times
                    Is there some way to get it on alt Lost? I haven't found one, but I haven't really been searching either.
                        Unless you have Spindown Dice, unfortunately no. But it’s still excellent for regular lost
                    Ah, the Edge of Tomorrow strategy.
                    Before the patch when the Dead Cat would give infinite lifes if you happen to pick it as Esau, I did the same with Mother.  
Pros: I'm a god at that fight now.  
Cons: Dying 30 times in a row made me a bit insane.
                You are using it the wrong way or with the wrong characters. In short, dead cat is for when you have no red hearts on a red heart character (you have a bunch of soul hearts), have taken several devil deals and are operating on low hearts, are trying to complete a guppy set, you are The Lost, you have something that triggers on death/revival such as Suicide King, trying to make a good one heart build (you are eve or have Whore of Babylon), you have a reliable way or getting health ups or soul hearts, so on. Do NOT just blindly take it... you have to have an entire build around it.
                    Big brain strat: With Potatoe pealer, you can have 2 level 4 meatboys in exchange for the lifes.
                    Well yes, but some final bosses are really hard to beat without a hit. I’m mostly talking about after you already have your build and say you have a lot of soul hearts. If you manage to lose all those hearts, no matter how good your build is, you’re usually screwed cause you’ll only have a red heart when you respawn, and even if you’re able to scour soul hearts from the floor, you almost always end up with less than your first life. If you can beat the boss your first try you’re fine, but if you manage to die you’re basically screwed.
                        Yea, no one outside of The Lost can actually use the other lives like that. You are missing the point of the item / using it incorrectly. Unless you are super OP, or a great player, beating bosses with only 1 hp ain't feasible. You are supposed to use dead cat to do any of the things I listed above, NOT as 8 hopeless chances to get the boss kill. After the first death, after losing all your built up hearts, the run is effectively OVER. Ignore the other lives, you lost. You can either 1) practice 2) scour the floor for SOMETHING that might help... 3) try those 8 attempts and maybe get lucky. Option 3 is NOT what you should be looking for with this item.
                            That’s fair
                I got guppy's collar and had it activate about 12 times fighting that one  3 stage Corpse boss.

I got so close so many times but God that was frustrating.
                    You lucky sonbitch

I get guppys collar and it usually activates 0 times lmao
                        Yeah same usually. I opened it free and was like "yeah ok"

Even being that lucky I didn't do anything with it lol
                    I got Dead Cat and Guppy's Collar (no 3rd item though) on a recent Lost run and after Dead Cat ran out I must have gotten at least a dozen Collar respawns, I kept expecting it to happen but my luck only ran out againstb one of  Mega Satan's spawn bosses
                Or being cursed and getting hit and having to restart two of three times. Yuck
                i mean, sure, but normally you would just be straight up dead. Whereas the cat gives you chances to possibly still win even after you have failed.
        Idk if it qas a bug with lazarus or what but the 2nd time i died with 9 lives i thikk i stayed in the rpoom but then the 3rd time i think i restarted from before dogma
            I think lazarus revive has a higher priority than dead cat, so you triggered his built in revive before dead cat. Lazarus revive is a same room revive.
                I’m pretty sure you’re right, I think Laz rags have higher priority than everything except the 1up mushroom
                    You're correct. 1up > Laz Rags (or Laz's natural revive) > Dead Cat > Guppy's collar, followed by all the other revive items.
    I wonder if there's enough similar revival effects that it would be worth making a trinket that stops you from getting teleported outside the room. Maybe it could stop the Cursed Eye teleport and neutralize Curse of the Maze too.

edit: and if you wanted to be mean it could also stop getting teleported to the devil or angel room from chests and sacrifice rooms
    At least you feel a little of adrenaline.

The creation of this meme was absolutely not fueled in any way by me learning about this effect the hard way in a tainted blue baby run I had just prior to making it.
I learned it from this meme 😎
I just learned the hard way that you need to the polaroid or negative to open the >!strange door!< I was the lost and I had a super op run too :(
    Pro tip : the >!faded polaroid!< works, too !
        This is not true. Do you mean the Faded Polaroid?
            Omg you're right sorry I always confuse these two !


(Comment corrected)
        NO THAT DROPPED ON THAT FLOOR TOO :((( well at least I know now :p

Edit: just checked the wiki and it says it can't be used so nvm
Sometime more than ~~once~~ ~~twice~~ every other run
If you didn’t learn about the Bible on Satan the hard way, did you really play Isaac?
Apparently not me, i just started the game today. So apparently nine lives removes all your current hearts to 1?
Using the Bible fighting Satan losing my first good blue baby run
northernlion moment
    Pot play moment
    when he spends more brain cells on banter than the very thing he’s streaming😂
        it's more fun than watching safe plays at least
            THE ZANE
                worth it every time man
        And yet he's somehow still way better than I ever will be giving the game my full attention.
            yea lol i was doing a tainted run earlier and got poly+brimstone and died bcz of youtube🙄
Brother?
    BROTHER!
Beautiful, why didn't I think to do that
    [Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/7jXWqyo.png)
that's amazing and i love you for it
Seriously, I don’t understand why the extra lives were removed on reroll (dead cat used to persist rerolls) but the HP penalty still applies. Not to mention the fact every other form of HP gain is reverted on reroll now.
    if edmund wants to make tainted eden fair then he has to either remove dead cat from items that it can reroll into or keep the lives, it's literally the only reason you shouldn't ever take deals while having any amount of red hearts because this shit will just steal your hearts and will never revive you even once, it's just so stupid
Yeah, I think the existence of 9 lives pretty much means devil and curse pool items are off limits for t. Eden... I've been screwed over too many times  rolling into it, which is a shame
Yup... One mildly negative thing about Repentance is that often things just work only in the worst way imagineable.


Stuff like Forgotten and ??? being set to 1 HP with Dead Cat, as their hearts are basically just treated like red hearts for items is relatively minor. But on the other hand, a lot of items get hard nerfed while penalties still apply. Example being Keeper and extra shots.


Keeper gets the full penalty from 20/20 and The Inner Eye while only gaining one extra tear from each. So combined that's just really throwing his dps down. 

Assuming Inner Eye Delay works the same Keeper starts with a Tear Delay of 28. Inner Eye is a Penalty of (Tears = Tears·2.1+3) = 61.8. For the new tps counter that's (30/(1+61.8)) = 30/63 = 0.48 (Which I'm pretty sure is correct since I was stupid enough to take that combo once) 

Now damage is 4.2 (base) · 0.75 = 3.15 


So, Keeper with Inner Eye and 20/20 vs normal Keeper:

 * Normal Keeper: 3 tears at 1.06 shots per second at 4.2 damage per tear:
  * 3 · 1.06 · 4.2 = 13.356 dps if he hits all 3 tears

 * BothShots Keeper: 5 tears at 0.48 shots per second  at 3.15 damage per shot:
  * 5 · 0.48 · 3.15 = 7.56 if he hits all 5 tears

So put in more work to get half the damage... and this seems like a specific example, but you can really just substitute so many things. Brimstone does similar things to your tears.. (Although with arguably the damage to back it up... until you collect another tears down...)
That's pretty mush.
    What does that mean?
        you know, it's just kinda wured  
a bit jinky  
somewhat breek
Idk man it carries hard when fighting beast, especially as the lost
When you have only two red hearts it’s pretty good. It’s only an upgrade, plus a guppy item.
    I got like four health upgrades over the course of a floor before remembering I specifically skipped a Nine Lives at the beginning of the floor because I was only on two hearts.

*sigh*
It’s good as Judas
    Or lost.
        Or anytime you have items that give you hearts.
    [deleted]
        Really? That makes it even better, instead of having to retry a boss with 1 hp
It’s good if you have low red hearts, hell it’s free if you have only one. It also lets you get tons of Devil deals you otherwise wouldn’t.
I almost always take it for that guppy transformation. But it’s a pretty bad item on it’s own, especially if you had alot of red hearts before picking it up.
Dead cat item
Completion marks
Their Machocists
Noob: FFFUUUCCCKKK!!!
For me it made sense that 9 lives would not remove soul hearts on blue baby because the character is dogshit as you can't get red hearts so  "some items must be better on him". Then I picked it up, lost 8 soul hearts, and remembered I'm playing the binding of isaac so of course you lose all soul hearts.
    Understandable
It very much is
    [deleted]
        true
    Oof
Not while playing as blue baby.
    yes, but everyone’s deciding dead cat is generally bad. 


it’s pseudo 9 hearts with an add tether to save your run. you can easily do a full sacrifice room, opportunity for two angel room items or keys, and gain another +7 soul hearts on the second to last sacrifice proc. 


y’all are simple
Sure, if you have it.
Technically they lost 11 hearts and gained 9 more lives.
    Technically it's an overall loss anyways :)
I learned the passive effect of cursed eye the hard way
    Ugh, I hate that item with Azazel. The joys of not looking up how items work haha. I may have fallen for it on at least 3 occasions.

My bad. Have a good day.
                        It is not incorrect, black candle removes all curses, cursed eye included
                            You're not wrong, but they're talking about azazel, not black candle, so idk why you bring it up
            r/confidentlyincorrect
                https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
            This is an injustice
    In case you didn't know, if you have black candle, cursed eye does not teleport anymore.
        Yes, i know, but I've had black candle and cursed eye in the same run once
        It's done that since original afterbirth
    I learned not to take curse room items with curse of the blind because of cursed eye
        I haven't learned that one yet gimmie them items
    It's not that bad, he says
        Cursed eye would be ok if it synergised with holy mantle
            I think it does now, but don't quote me
                It does
    Of course, Learning is fun, _And learning demands suffering_

    I took it ~5 times and always wondering why tf i was teleporting all the time until a friend told me its the cursed eye ╥﹏╥

    Which is why I am super exciting for mods coming back, so I no longer have to tab out to look it up.

Only improvement now would be if someone could make an addon for PlatinumGod that makes it link to the wiki in addition to those semi-useless descriptions (half of the time I use wiki, it's to look up weird interactions or synergies, which PG doesn't cover).

I tried to do it myself with javascript, managed to get the elements containing the item names, and make links based on them, but I'm too dumb to figure out how to convert the <p> tags to <a> tags.
Only run I ever lost with Sacred Heart was the run I took ludovico on.
    Ludo is the worst item istg.
I’ll never forget one run from my earliest days. I was finally getting good at the game, and was ready to beat Mom’s Heart for the very first time...

And then I got Curse of the Tower

Yeah... didn’t beat her that time
Hahaha definitely true, happened many times years ago when I first played it
Although when I picked it back up after the expansions I just look new stuff up on the wiki haha, fuck it
Used the Bible on Satan today. It was cool:)
It's op for the beast fight for exactly that reason
    Thank god it is. Nobody wants to respawn after their "prime" life runs out (most likely due to low dmg output), just to have to probably fight the horsemen again and again and again with one heart until dying for real.

The Beast being more of a last hurrah feels exactly right, especially after Dogma's 9000mph feather zoomies and other assorted annoying bullshit he throws at you in the second phase.
        I honestly hate the feeling of losing a boss fight with 6 full hears, and then having to try to no-hit it 9 times. It’s so incredibly demoralizing and for most characters I kinda hate this item because of it
            Dead cat was super op when you could bomb yourself to death in the boss room and it would spawn a new boss. I've never found a good use for the extra lives outside of devil deals. Once you die the first time just R baby.
                Reroll with d4 after picking it up and keep the lives was another use, but was fixed.

Also, Suicide King item farming. Blank Card it 9 times, then pick up the items on your last life and probably get a lot of max hearts back.

Or on The Lost.
                You can use it to farm Sacrifice room until the big payout. Also reducing you to 1 red heart was arguably an upside in AB/AB+.
                Every run is winnable
                    Not wrong, but I'm neither good enough to win every run or willing to spend time playing a game in a way I don't enjoy. I'm just happy that I can crush things as judas every once in a while lol.
                    Yeah, if you're good enough. But I don't know any people good enough to win a Eden run that starts with 1 red heart, lower than normal damage and tears, razor blade and brother bobby with a ghost baby in a treasure room :D
                        Lol i wasn't saying you have to. But it's fun to try sometimes! Never know what's waiting for you on that 2nd floor item room !
                            I try to do that sometimes, I only give up after getting -5 streak in 20 minutes. Example: I played yesterday a run where my only damage ups were curved horn on caves 2 and then negative after mom's fight. I died in dark room because it was just too much.
                        At least you are 1 step from conjoined
            Well, today i beat Isaac on my 9th life with half a heart (i got the waffer on the first floor, and I'm omw to unlock the polaroid)
                Good job!
                    Thanks!
Technically it's my first ever save file from scratch, but i know all there's to know because of watching youtube, and when AB+ came out I played a lot with a pirate copy and a downloaded save file.

I'm still gittin gud
                        Well I’m glad you’re well on your way to the true experience. And by the way, thank you for switching from your pirated copy. Games like these definitely deserve to be supported directly.
                            Yeah, well... I don't see myself unlocking godhead in my entire life, but we'll see.

I always try to buy the games i like, or the ones i can afford (specially being from Argentina, where a dollar is as expensive as a kidney).

Supporting small companies that make good games is the best we can do as consumers.
            It’s good on either Lost, and sometimes it comes in clutch. Plus, even if you do waste all your lives it’s a valuable learning experience. That was how I learned Hush’s patterns, by throwing myself at him about 9 times
                Is there some way to get it on alt Lost? I haven't found one, but I haven't really been searching either.
                    Unless you have Spindown Dice, unfortunately no. But it’s still excellent for regular lost
                Ah, the Edge of Tomorrow strategy.
                Before the patch when the Dead Cat would give infinite lifes if you happen to pick it as Esau, I did the same with Mother.  
Pros: I'm a god at that fight now.  
Cons: Dying 30 times in a row made me a bit insane.
            You are using it the wrong way or with the wrong characters. In short, dead cat is for when you have no red hearts on a red heart character (you have a bunch of soul hearts), have taken several devil deals and are operating on low hearts, are trying to complete a guppy set, you are The Lost, you have something that triggers on death/revival such as Suicide King, trying to make a good one heart build (you are eve or have Whore of Babylon), you have a reliable way or getting health ups or soul hearts, so on. Do NOT just blindly take it... you have to have an entire build around it.
                Big brain strat: With Potatoe pealer, you can have 2 level 4 meatboys in exchange for the lifes.
                Well yes, but some final bosses are really hard to beat without a hit. I’m mostly talking about after you already have your build and say you have a lot of soul hearts. If you manage to lose all those hearts, no matter how good your build is, you’re usually screwed cause you’ll only have a red heart when you respawn, and even if you’re able to scour soul hearts from the floor, you almost always end up with less than your first life. If you can beat the boss your first try you’re fine, but if you manage to die you’re basically screwed.
                    Yea, no one outside of The Lost can actually use the other lives like that. You are missing the point of the item / using it incorrectly. Unless you are super OP, or a great player, beating bosses with only 1 hp ain't feasible. You are supposed to use dead cat to do any of the things I listed above, NOT as 8 hopeless chances to get the boss kill. After the first death, after losing all your built up hearts, the run is effectively OVER. Ignore the other lives, you lost. You can either 1) practice 2) scour the floor for SOMETHING that might help... 3) try those 8 attempts and maybe get lucky. Option 3 is NOT what you should be looking for with this item.
                        That’s fair
            I got guppy's collar and had it activate about 12 times fighting that one  3 stage Corpse boss.

I got so close so many times but God that was frustrating.
                You lucky sonbitch

I get guppys collar and it usually activates 0 times lmao
                    Yeah same usually. I opened it free and was like "yeah ok"

Even being that lucky I didn't do anything with it lol
                I got Dead Cat and Guppy's Collar (no 3rd item though) on a recent Lost run and after Dead Cat ran out I must have gotten at least a dozen Collar respawns, I kept expecting it to happen but my luck only ran out againstb one of  Mega Satan's spawn bosses
            Or being cursed and getting hit and having to restart two of three times. Yuck
            i mean, sure, but normally you would just be straight up dead. Whereas the cat gives you chances to possibly still win even after you have failed.
    Idk if it qas a bug with lazarus or what but the 2nd time i died with 9 lives i thikk i stayed in the rpoom but then the 3rd time i think i restarted from before dogma
        I think lazarus revive has a higher priority than dead cat, so you triggered his built in revive before dead cat. Lazarus revive is a same room revive.
            I’m pretty sure you’re right, I think Laz rags have higher priority than everything except the 1up mushroom
                You're correct. 1up > Laz Rags (or Laz's natural revive) > Dead Cat > Guppy's collar, followed by all the other revive items.
I wonder if there's enough similar revival effects that it would be worth making a trinket that stops you from getting teleported outside the room. Maybe it could stop the Cursed Eye teleport and neutralize Curse of the Maze too.

edit: and if you wanted to be mean it could also stop getting teleported to the devil or angel room from chests and sacrifice rooms
At least you feel a little of adrenaline.

Pro tip : the >!faded polaroid!< works, too !
    This is not true. Do you mean the Faded Polaroid?
        Omg you're right sorry I always confuse these two !


(Comment corrected)
    NO THAT DROPPED ON THAT FLOOR TOO :((( well at least I know now :p

Edit: just checked the wiki and it says it can't be used so nvm
Pot play moment
when he spends more brain cells on banter than the very thing he’s streaming😂
    it's more fun than watching safe plays at least
        THE ZANE
            worth it every time man
    And yet he's somehow still way better than I ever will be giving the game my full attention.
        yea lol i was doing a tainted run earlier and got poly+brimstone and died bcz of youtube🙄
BROTHER!
[Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/7jXWqyo.png)
if edmund wants to make tainted eden fair then he has to either remove dead cat from items that it can reroll into or keep the lives, it's literally the only reason you shouldn't ever take deals while having any amount of red hearts because this shit will just steal your hearts and will never revive you even once, it's just so stupid
What does that mean?
    you know, it's just kinda wured  
a bit jinky  
somewhat breek
I got like four health upgrades over the course of a floor before remembering I specifically skipped a Nine Lives at the beginning of the floor because I was only on two hearts.

*sigh*
Or lost.
    Or anytime you have items that give you hearts.
[deleted]
    Really? That makes it even better, instead of having to retry a boss with 1 hp
Understandable
[deleted]
    true
Oof
yes, but everyone’s deciding dead cat is generally bad. 


it’s pseudo 9 hearts with an add tether to save your run. you can easily do a full sacrifice room, opportunity for two angel room items or keys, and gain another +7 soul hearts on the second to last sacrifice proc. 


y’all are simple
Technically it's an overall loss anyways :)
Ugh, I hate that item with Azazel. The joys of not looking up how items work haha. I may have fallen for it on at least 3 occasions.
    Cursed eye has no effect on Azazel and will never teleport. Edit: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
        I mean, that's just wrong. At least on Switch it is.
            I don't know if the Switch version is different, but I doubt it. I recorded a clip showing it doesn't teleport on PC: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                Actually is not guaranteed; it's a chance.
                    You can test it yourself; it's not a chance. If you are charging, you will teleport on damage. If not or at full charge, you will not.
                        It is a chance; it's not gonna happen every time.
        I'm pretty sure cursed eye causes Azazel to teleport- it has no positive effect on his attack though.


Lilith doesn't teleport, but still gets a positive effect on incubus.

Also, Black Candle completely removed the teleport part.
            It must have changed.

I was trying to unlock the forgotten with azazel and was having a really good run and then picked up the item  by mistake.

I thought maybe because I had azazel it wouldn’t do nothing and it didn’t. I finished the challenge  with it.
                Cursed eye doesn't automatically teleport you each time you get hit , its a 50% chance i think
                    It is (or *was*, who knows with repentance) based on the charge meter, if you get hit while charging you teleport, but if you're holding at 100 or not charging at all you don't
                        Actually, that is how it _now_ works with Repentance. It _used_ to be just a chance, I think a 25% chance, but I’m not sure about that.
                Maybe you only got hit when you already had a full charge
            Just confirming it indeed does not teleport you, I've posted a clip throughout this thread but I'll drop it here as well: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                I have had experience with cursed eye and it does unless you have black candle
                    You can test it yourself with a seed or the debug console if you'd like.
                        I've gotten cursed eye before with many characters including azazel also cant do debug console
        Really??
            No
            Yes.
                It most definitely does teleport you lol
                    I posted a clip in a few threads, you can also test for yourself that it actually doesn't teleport you with Azazel.
                        Didnt you pick up the black candle?
                That's incorrect.
                    https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                        Well damn, I would have bet real money that I had been teleported from it on him within the last couple of weeks. That's what I get for not verifying before trying to correct someone like some kinda dickhead I guess.

                    It is a chance; it's not gonna happen every time.
    I'm pretty sure cursed eye causes Azazel to teleport- it has no positive effect on his attack though.


Lilith doesn't teleport, but still gets a positive effect on incubus.

Also, Black Candle completely removed the teleport part.
        It must have changed.

I was trying to unlock the forgotten with azazel and was having a really good run and then picked up the item  by mistake.

I thought maybe because I had azazel it wouldn’t do nothing and it didn’t. I finished the challenge  with it.
            Cursed eye doesn't automatically teleport you each time you get hit , its a 50% chance i think
                It is (or *was*, who knows with repentance) based on the charge meter, if you get hit while charging you teleport, but if you're holding at 100 or not charging at all you don't
                    Actually, that is how it _now_ works with Repentance. It _used_ to be just a chance, I think a 25% chance, but I’m not sure about that.
            Maybe you only got hit when you already had a full charge
        Just confirming it indeed does not teleport you, I've posted a clip throughout this thread but I'll drop it here as well: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
            I have had experience with cursed eye and it does unless you have black candle
                You can test it yourself with a seed or the debug console if you'd like.
                    I've gotten cursed eye before with many characters including azazel also cant do debug console
    Really??
        No
        Yes.
            It most definitely does teleport you lol
                I posted a clip in a few threads, you can also test for yourself that it actually doesn't teleport you with Azazel.
                    Didnt you pick up the black candle?
            That's incorrect.
                https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr
                    Well damn, I would have bet real money that I had been teleported from it on him within the last couple of weeks. That's what I get for not verifying before trying to correct someone like some kinda dickhead I guess.

My bad. Have a good day.
                It is not incorrect, black candle removes all curses, cursed eye included
                    You're not wrong, but they're talking about azazel, not black candle, so idk why you bring it up

    This is an injustice
Yes, i know, but I've had black candle and cursed eye in the same run once
It's done that since original afterbirth
I haven't learned that one yet gimmie them items
Cursed eye would be ok if it synergised with holy mantle
    I think it does now, but don't quote me
        It does
I honestly hate the feeling of losing a boss fight with 6 full hears, and then having to try to no-hit it 9 times. It’s so incredibly demoralizing and for most characters I kinda hate this item because of it
    Dead cat was super op when you could bomb yourself to death in the boss room and it would spawn a new boss. I've never found a good use for the extra lives outside of devil deals. Once you die the first time just R baby.
        Reroll with d4 after picking it up and keep the lives was another use, but was fixed.

Also, Suicide King item farming. Blank Card it 9 times, then pick up the items on your last life and probably get a lot of max hearts back.

Or on The Lost.
        You can use it to farm Sacrifice room until the big payout. Also reducing you to 1 red heart was arguably an upside in AB/AB+.
        Every run is winnable
            Not wrong, but I'm neither good enough to win every run or willing to spend time playing a game in a way I don't enjoy. I'm just happy that I can crush things as judas every once in a while lol.
            Yeah, if you're good enough. But I don't know any people good enough to win a Eden run that starts with 1 red heart, lower than normal damage and tears, razor blade and brother bobby with a ghost baby in a treasure room :D
                Lol i wasn't saying you have to. But it's fun to try sometimes! Never know what's waiting for you on that 2nd floor item room !
                    I try to do that sometimes, I only give up after getting -5 streak in 20 minutes. Example: I played yesterday a run where my only damage ups were curved horn on caves 2 and then negative after mom's fight. I died in dark room because it was just too much.
                At least you are 1 step from conjoined
    Well, today i beat Isaac on my 9th life with half a heart (i got the waffer on the first floor, and I'm omw to unlock the polaroid)
        Good job!
            Thanks!
Technically it's my first ever save file from scratch, but i know all there's to know because of watching youtube, and when AB+ came out I played a lot with a pirate copy and a downloaded save file.

I'm still gittin gud
                Well I’m glad you’re well on your way to the true experience. And by the way, thank you for switching from your pirated copy. Games like these definitely deserve to be supported directly.
                    Yeah, well... I don't see myself unlocking godhead in my entire life, but we'll see.

I always try to buy the games i like, or the ones i can afford (specially being from Argentina, where a dollar is as expensive as a kidney).

Supporting small companies that make good games is the best we can do as consumers.
    It’s good on either Lost, and sometimes it comes in clutch. Plus, even if you do waste all your lives it’s a valuable learning experience. That was how I learned Hush’s patterns, by throwing myself at him about 9 times
        Is there some way to get it on alt Lost? I haven't found one, but I haven't really been searching either.
            Unless you have Spindown Dice, unfortunately no. But it’s still excellent for regular lost
        Ah, the Edge of Tomorrow strategy.
        Before the patch when the Dead Cat would give infinite lifes if you happen to pick it as Esau, I did the same with Mother.  
Pros: I'm a god at that fight now.  
Cons: Dying 30 times in a row made me a bit insane.
    You are using it the wrong way or with the wrong characters. In short, dead cat is for when you have no red hearts on a red heart character (you have a bunch of soul hearts), have taken several devil deals and are operating on low hearts, are trying to complete a guppy set, you are The Lost, you have something that triggers on death/revival such as Suicide King, trying to make a good one heart build (you are eve or have Whore of Babylon), you have a reliable way or getting health ups or soul hearts, so on. Do NOT just blindly take it... you have to have an entire build around it.
        Big brain strat: With Potatoe pealer, you can have 2 level 4 meatboys in exchange for the lifes.
        Well yes, but some final bosses are really hard to beat without a hit. I’m mostly talking about after you already have your build and say you have a lot of soul hearts. If you manage to lose all those hearts, no matter how good your build is, you’re usually screwed cause you’ll only have a red heart when you respawn, and even if you’re able to scour soul hearts from the floor, you almost always end up with less than your first life. If you can beat the boss your first try you’re fine, but if you manage to die you’re basically screwed.
            Yea, no one outside of The Lost can actually use the other lives like that. You are missing the point of the item / using it incorrectly. Unless you are super OP, or a great player, beating bosses with only 1 hp ain't feasible. You are supposed to use dead cat to do any of the things I listed above, NOT as 8 hopeless chances to get the boss kill. After the first death, after losing all your built up hearts, the run is effectively OVER. Ignore the other lives, you lost. You can either 1) practice 2) scour the floor for SOMETHING that might help... 3) try those 8 attempts and maybe get lucky. Option 3 is NOT what you should be looking for with this item.
                That’s fair
    I got guppy's collar and had it activate about 12 times fighting that one  3 stage Corpse boss.

I got so close so many times but God that was frustrating.
        You lucky sonbitch

I get guppys collar and it usually activates 0 times lmao
            Yeah same usually. I opened it free and was like "yeah ok"

Even being that lucky I didn't do anything with it lol
        I got Dead Cat and Guppy's Collar (no 3rd item though) on a recent Lost run and after Dead Cat ran out I must have gotten at least a dozen Collar respawns, I kept expecting it to happen but my luck only ran out againstb one of  Mega Satan's spawn bosses
    Or being cursed and getting hit and having to restart two of three times. Yuck
    i mean, sure, but normally you would just be straight up dead. Whereas the cat gives you chances to possibly still win even after you have failed.
I think lazarus revive has a higher priority than dead cat, so you triggered his built in revive before dead cat. Lazarus revive is a same room revive.
    I’m pretty sure you’re right, I think Laz rags have higher priority than everything except the 1up mushroom
        You're correct. 1up > Laz Rags (or Laz's natural revive) > Dead Cat > Guppy's collar, followed by all the other revive items.
Omg you're right sorry I always confuse these two !


(Comment corrected)
THE ZANE
    worth it every time man
yea lol i was doing a tainted run earlier and got poly+brimstone and died bcz of youtube🙄
I mean, that's just wrong. At least on Switch it is.
    I don't know if the Switch version is different, but I doubt it. I recorded a clip showing it doesn't teleport on PC: https://imgur.com/a/NDVJGHr

    It is not incorrect, black candle removes all curses, cursed eye included
        You're not wrong, but they're talking about azazel, not black candle, so idk why you bring it up
Not wrong, but I'm neither good enough to win every run or willing to spend time playing a game in a way I don't enjoy. I'm just happy that I can crush things as judas every once in a while lol.
Yeah, if you're good enough. But I don't know any people good enough to win a Eden run that starts with 1 red heart, lower than normal damage and tears, razor blade and brother bobby with a ghost baby in a treasure room :D
    Lol i wasn't saying you have to. But it's fun to try sometimes! Never know what's waiting for you on that 2nd floor item room !
        I try to do that sometimes, I only give up after getting -5 streak in 20 minutes. Example: I played yesterday a run where my only damage ups were curved horn on caves 2 and then negative after mom's fight. I died in dark room because it was just too much.
    At least you are 1 step from conjoined
Thanks!
Technically it's my first ever save file from scratch, but i know all there's to know because of watching youtube, and when AB+ came out I played a lot with a pirate copy and a downloaded save file.

I'm still gittin gud
    Well I’m glad you’re well on your way to the true experience. And by the way, thank you for switching from your pirated copy. Games like these definitely deserve to be supported directly.
        Yeah, well... I don't see myself unlocking godhead in my entire life, but we'll see.

I always try to buy the games i like, or the ones i can afford (specially being from Argentina, where a dollar is as expensive as a kidney).

Supporting small companies that make good games is the best we can do as consumers.
Unless you have Spindown Dice, unfortunately no. But it’s still excellent for regular lost
Yea, no one outside of The Lost can actually use the other lives like that. You are missing the point of the item / using it incorrectly. Unless you are super OP, or a great player, beating bosses with only 1 hp ain't feasible. You are supposed to use dead cat to do any of the things I listed above, NOT as 8 hopeless chances to get the boss kill. After the first death, after losing all your built up hearts, the run is effectively OVER. Ignore the other lives, you lost. You can either 1) practice 2) scour the floor for SOMETHING that might help... 3) try those 8 attempts and maybe get lucky. Option 3 is NOT what you should be looking for with this item.
    That’s fair
Yeah same usually. I opened it free and was like "yeah ok"

Even being that lucky I didn't do anything with it lol
You can test it yourself; it's not a chance. If you are charging, you will teleport on damage. If not or at full charge, you will not.
    It is a chance; it's not gonna happen every time.
It is (or *was*, who knows with repentance) based on the charge meter, if you get hit while charging you teleport, but if you're holding at 100 or not charging at all you don't
    Actually, that is how it _now_ works with Repentance. It _used_ to be just a chance, I think a 25% chance, but I’m not sure about that.
You can test it yourself with a seed or the debug console if you'd like.
    I've gotten cursed eye before with many characters including azazel also cant do debug console
I posted a clip in a few threads, you can also test for yourself that it actually doesn't teleport you with Azazel.
    Didnt you pick up the black candle?
