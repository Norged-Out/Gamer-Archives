Apolion mains: 𝙎𝙐𝘾𝙆
    "Apolion"

*sucks in rawrxD*
        Apolion Bonaparte
    How dare you, I think’s he’s actually a very well rounded and effective chara-

Oh. Oh I see. Clever girl.
Are there actual maggie mains
    I've genuinely been having more fun with her than I expected now that she gets a guaranteed full health pill. self sacrifice rooms are pretty cracked
        Yeah, I literally got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room
            And that kids, is how I got Maggie's The Beast kill.
            How do you get an item from the sacrifice room?
                on the 6th or 7th try i think you're guaranteed an item

I dont know for sure though
                    Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
                        I believe the item is always an angel room item
            > got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room

:O
        Never would have thought that giving her a Full Health pill would change the start of her playstyle so drastically.

Honestly Maggy and Bethany are some of my favourites now since I love all Angel Room items
            I also feel like angel rooms are way stronger. I got sacred heart once in 500 runs, but since repentance i got it 4 times
                True, Special items don't exist anymore, so you'll probably be seeing Sacred Heart/Godhead/Brimstone etc more often now
                    I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
                        I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
                            Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
                                Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                                    Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
                                You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                                    Welp, not looking forward to that lol
                    Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
                        Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
                    What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
                        No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
                        Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
                            Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
                                ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
                            Huh, never knew that
                    ... What
                        They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
                            Oh my god that's incredible.
                    That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
                Devils rooms also feel weaker post repentance which indirectly makes angel rooms even more appealing
                I'm pretty sure it's because Repentance changed how the dpecial items work, thus they are more likely to appear. But I might be wrong.
        Repentance maggy is prob. My second favouritw character
        getting wafer + scrificial floor on floor one is pretty POG
    I used to be one when I was newer at the game, she’s really good for surviving the first few floors if you’re a noob
        Maggy flippin sucks in the long run
            Now that she can start with full health pill she’s actually amazing you basically always have a 50/50 chance at an angel item on floor one
                How do you get an angel room on floor one?
                    Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
                        It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
                    Sacrifice rooms
                        Ah
            Until you buy the holy Potato Peeler.
                That's other history
            Nice profile pic. r/enterthegungeon
    I used to be one, but am enjoying Bethany a lot right now.  I quite liked her ability to use health a resource more often, more sacrifice rooms and more blood donation money.  And didn’t mind the speed loss.  But most other characters do feel like they have more going for them.
    Maggie is way more fun in repentance
    I'm a Maggie main.

The extra heart container + Yum Heart has lots of uses besides being able to tank more hits. You can much more reliably play Sacrifice rooms for angle items, coins, soul hearts, or key pieces. More easily play blood donation machines. Have more HP to trade for devil deals. Plus, you know you have a Full Health pill in the pill rotation.
    Not a main, but back in afterbirth i played her frequently and i got crown of light AND sacred heart on the first floor with maggy in one run (one in the teleport to the angel room, one in the angel item spawn), now that she has a full health pill she's even better
    Tbh i hate playing as maggie shes just boring
    There was when she had a speed up pill
    Not me, but extra hp for devil deals plus a full health pill for sacrifice rooms is pretty dang good.
    I don't think so
    I mean once you unlock the speed pill to start off with (since it’s a fairly easy unlock) I’d say she’s not assss bad??? But still too slow and nothing special apart from being a low-key tank
    She's fun to minmax with
    Play Maggie when drunk and with others joining in as babies
    I have been playing Isaac since launch 10 years ago at this point and Maggie has always been my favorite character to play as, during the olden Isaac days 4health containers meant a lot more devil deals, and now? With Yum Heart and a Full Health pill you can pretty consistently leave the first floor with 1-2 Angel items thanks to sacrifice rooms. Tainted Maggie is even better to some extend.
        Idk how to get tainted stuff
            Not sure if it’s considered a spoiler or not, but it’s tied to one of the two new bosses they added on Repetence. Not sure how much I can reveal in this post since it’s not flaired for repetence content.
    Regular Maggie? No.

Tainted Maggie? Yes.
        How do you get tainted characters
            When you get to home, use the Red Key or the Cracked Key in the corridor to the left of Mom's TV room. This can only be done BEFORE you sleep in Mom's bed.
Which Tainted character you get depends on what character your playing as when you unlock them.
While getting Red Key is just RNG, you can get a Cracked Key by leaving a trinket on the ground, then coming back later during the ascension scene to pick it up.
                Ok so: never gotten to home, never seen the red key, and don’t know what the ascension scene is
                    Um, how far into the game are you?
                        I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance
    Me because I am very bad playing Isaac so using the Yum Heart it really helps me.
        That’s awesome
    i got a mod that replaces her with Neco arc and now I'm a Maggie main
    she’s the only character that I can consistently win runs on, free angel items, near infinite heals, good starting health
“Lost mains” couldn’t be any more accurate
    "Lost mains explaining how starting with Holy Mantle actually makes them harder than most characters to kill."
        Honestly it does, 1 free hit every room is quite op if you think about it. I'm no lost main, but in alt floors I sometimes transform into the lost to avoid red heart damage. Unless it is dross, cause Colostomia and Turdlet are the freaking worst.
            Fuck Dross. All my homies hate Dross.

            I like to do the boss rooms twice in Downpour/Dross 2 for the extra item, I've lost a few runs there but it's only the 2nd/3rd floor of the game
            Turdlet is easy wdym
                Dude how tf am I supposed to avoid that mach 5 spin attack when it takes up the entire screen?
                I don’t fight it enough, cause it’s not a common encounter. Where does it actually aim towards anyway
        I actually believe that Lost was one of the most permissive character to main. Guaranteed deals in floor 2 is huge
    You can tell who lost mains are because they talk about how lost used to be hard but balanced and now they overbuffed it to make it the best character. 

Source: I am lost main. I trained with weighted clothing for years, suiciding into curse rooms on the chance there would be a dead cat or guppy’s collar in there. Your new game is made for babies.
        Well good thing that (SPOILERS): >!Tainted Lost exists now for all of your masochistic needs!<
            >!I have do to it AGAIN?!<
                >!Yep, have fun!!<
                yes, and not only that, >!but the blost cannot find any items that would give him a second chance. holy cards spawn more often for him, and he starts with one, but he cannot find the mantle, dead cat, etc. The only extra lives he can find are Birthright which is +1 life for him with a huge damage effect on respawn, and Missing Poster, oddly.!<

>!his UPSIDE is that he cannot find any items that he cannot use. items that are primarily health/healing, flight, spectral, self-damaging, on hit effects, or anything that might be a net downgrade like Stompy, will not actually appear as him. Additionally, any item with a quality of 2 or lower, like Brother Bobby for example, has a 20% chance to be automatically rerolled by Blost. (platgod has quality listed for each item)!<
                    So a true glass cannon character?
                        yeah.
            I've had tons of fun on Tainted Lost to be honest. >!The base damage and upgraded item pools make it so hardly any run is a bad run, so I don't have to hold R until a good item pops up. It's the real die-and-retry mode in Isaac. Almost feels like I'm playing Cuphead, seeing how fast I can get back into the game after a loss (I'm at like 200 tries, probably three quarters are deaths before Necropolis, the others are godlike and of course I die in Gehenna going back up after Mom's fight -\_- )!<
                I was not looking forward to playing him, but this makes me slightly less anxious about having to do so, haha.
                Gehenna can eat my dick honestly
                    I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
            >!I love it, his pools are better and the extra damage at the start is nice!<
        as someone who is playing on console before repentance.. is there any other difference to the lost other than the D4 and the eternal D6? I don’t have the lost unlocked yet but eventually i’ll get there.
            holy mantle can't be rerolled with for example d4 and dice rooms with d4
                epic i mean it makes sense bc you go thru the trouble of making sure the lost starts with it... I understand both sides of the coin
                    also 9 lives can be rerolled now
                        I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
            Starting with eternal D6 is a huge buff to go with already having automatic flight and spectral tears.
                He didn't always have spectral tears
            The Lost's Holy Mantle is no longer an item he starts with, but a direct upgrade to the character himself once unlocked. It is completely baked in.

This means if you were to turn into the lost, for reasons like dying while holding Missing Poster, using the Clicker, or potential other ways that Repentance may add, you will have the Holy Mantle so long as you keep being the Lost. This also makes Missing Poster an actually valid respawn item now.

Additionally, the Lost cannot lose the Holy Mantle due to a full run reroll, the Clicker's item removal, a victory lap's item confiscation, etc.

As another change, Repentance has nerfed the Lost so that he can only buy 1 item from each individual deal, as the rest will disappear if he purchases one.

However, Lost also recieved an indirect buff in the form of the Perfection trinket. If you no hit 3 bosses in a row, Perfection will spawn, which will give you +10 luck until you get hit. The Holy Mantle does not count as getting hit. So the lost will always get this and keep it, unless you get an extra life and promptly lose it. And I think (but im not sure) that the Eternal D6 is less likely to delete items based on your luck stat, too.
                Eternal D6 has a 50% chance to poof the item at 0 Luck, and scales all the way down to a 5% chance at 10 Luck.
                    damb

-heavy
        Precisely why I made sure to get all his marks before afterbirth + (or whichever dlc came after his release)
            he were avalible in base game, but with afterbirth he is much easier to unlock
                Easier yes... but it's based soley on RNG since afterbirth. Which I argue makes unlocking lost much more infuriating.

Example: On my xbone I unlocked Lost relatively quickly once Missing Poster was unlocked. However when I bought my PC 2 years ago, I put MAJOR hours into BOI and unlocked The Lost LITERALLY LAST MONTH! I tried everything to up my chances of getting the missing poster (mom's trinket box etc.). 

I did all because The Lost is my favorite character by far, also im a masochist.
                    Why not just shop break?
                        Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
        Honestly, I love The Lost now. I played him a fair bit even before getting Holy Mantle, and now I think he's great. He was my first >!Beast!< kill. >!Tainted Lost!< is even more rewarding, but I'm not quite good enough with him to actually accomplish anything good
        I got downvoted so hard recently for saying that my preferred rebalance was to replace Holy Mantle with Breath of Life.
            How the fuck does breath of life even work? Ive been playing since flash and I still gave up on trying to use that item ever.
                The charge bar on Breath of Life ticks down. Release and it recharges. Right when it hits zero charge, you get I-frames. Hold it any longer and it hurts you. Not much use for combat, but great for getting through curse doors and playing blood machines. Just takes skill to use.
                    That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
                    Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
        Oh thank god, I thought I was the only one who thought the same

Lost was high risk high reward, and it was great. Afterbirth buffed lost a lot with holy mantle, but it was kinda fair. But repentance just made it more balanced. A lot less risk and a lot less reward, it sucks.
    I played the lost without holy mantle, I mained him beates delirium and all the other marks, I didn’t want to do 20 runs just to put the money in the machine, I got all marks and did it afterwards, no one is more patient then a lost main
    So you're saying Lost mains are malformed mimicries of human beings?
Keeper Mains: [Footage unavailable]
    Keeper is my favourite character, he is pretty easy too :)
        He has always been Elder God-tier with a first floor Swallowed Penny. Now he's unstoppable.
            The only thing that bothered me with keeper was his low speed, now he's faster and harder to kill, so that's nice
                Yeah, now everybody loves keeper, when I tried defending him in AB+ I had like -200 karma, bah I even explained how OP would Keeper be with 3 Coin slots, no one belived, who laughs now?
                    I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.
    Keeper mains when there is no sacrifice room on floor one:
I believe you mean Cain mains 😎
    If I had to choose a main I’d probably go Cain. Idk why but I’ve almost always had the most fun with him
        I mean he has a lot of desirable qualities. High starting damage and speed, free gold chests, and the eyepatch which makes his tears more consistent, all at the cost of 1 red heart.
            And on top of that you can't get negative pills
                But that's a rep buff
                    Did they give him PhD back in repentance?
                        Yes. Flash Lucky Foot is back
                            Great news, love playing as Cain!
                            Wait, how do I get the PHD for Cain?
                                The item Cain starts with, Lucky Foot, was buffed and now turns all stats down pills into stats up
                        he doesn't know what the pills do, but can only get good ones.
            Wait can u explain why the eye patch makes tears more consistent
                When you fire tears, they alternate between the eyes. Since cain only has 1 eye, there's no alternating, which makes the shots more consistant. This also has an effect on some items which I cant remember off the top of my head.
                    Blood clot
        Cain for me always seems to have a broken run. I don’t know what it is but I don’t think it is the luck element playing into it
            I had +10 Luck and Birds Eye which resulted in crazy constant damage. All my tears were high damage fire.
    Cain mains when they get 38 coins on womb 2
    All aboard the Cain Train! 🚂
do people actually "main" characters in isaac? i always saw the game as being an obstacle with each character being a different way to deal with the obstacle. sure, there's some characters i use more than others, but it's not like in a fighting game where i pick characters based on what i have the best chance of winning with.
    I think a main in this game is which character you play the most when playing a run for fun
        Whoever I don’t have stamps for because I was indoctrinated to thinking like that by my friend
            Assume you have all the completion marks and that you had to do a run. Which character would you pick? 

Inb4 “I wouldn’t be playing if I had all the marks”
                ...azazel...
I suck at the game and he has flight and small brimstone with the highest starting damage so I hav the most fun with him if I were to casually play
                Isaac. Classic and well rounded, the D6 is good shit too.

Bethany if I want an insta-win though, holy shit is she good.
                    Could you give me some Bethany tips? I just lose her wisps nearly instantly and other than that she doesn't do much for me.
                        Well the key to never losing with Beth is to take it slow, spend time dodging to minimise wisp loss. Then get lucky with a great active item haha. I'm not very good at the game I can't give many tips haha.
                        the reason the basic  wisps are so hard to keep is because they’re in the second ring, so they’re somewhat far away from you. Getting an active item that spawns the wisps in the first ring closest to her will make it much easier to keep them alive. Check the wiki book of virtues tab for which items are first ring. Also active items with only one room cooldowns, like guppies head and wooden nickel will allow you to build up a great amount of wisps, even if they are being destroyed.
                That would be the random button. How does that work with tainted chars? I haven't had a chance to unlock any yet
                    Tainted chars are a separate page, which means you have to swap to the Tainted page to choose a random Tainted character, no normal characters

Clicker works the same as far as I know, if you play a normal character you can't swap to tainteds because it's a different page and vice versa
                Whatever character I feel I could get the remaining achievements with.
                I mena even after you do the marks, you can do all the challenges and get all items
                    Idk how else to phrase it, but I didn’t mean this question as a “hehe be as semantic as possible”. I thought it was pretty clear I just meant “who is your favorite character to play as independent of any achievements”
                In Antibirth, pretty much always The Lost.
                Random
        My main is Challenge 45.
    Random Button is a very valid main. I should know, I'm one of those.
        Mine is eden. Which basically is random random lmao.
            You should take it a step further with the tainted one for even more random.
                Haha yea but it’s a little too random for me
        Me too dude lmao I always played on xbox now I need to unlock everything again on pc bc of repentance, so I just random everytime bc they all need unlocks, plus that's how I did it on console anyway 😂
        Good luck getting it every run now :V
    when I have most of the shit unlocked and I just want a fun run I tend to go Judas.
        Judas is my go-to as well, having really solid damage right off the bat is just so valuable.
    I kinda “mained” Azazel to farm out Eden tokens when I was filling out the completion marks for every character, and I got really used to starting out with flight and no red hearts, really suited how I wanted to play the game and reduced the feelsbad moments when early pickups are locked behind rocks. Az’s Brimstone is also very fun with a few stat upgrades.
        All I need is the hard mode Mega Satan mark for The Lost. It’s been so painful
        honestly Azazel is probably the most fun character in general, at least for me. Apollyon gets an honorable mention
            I kind of took a sabbatical from TBoI after Afterbirth came around and I finished all hard mode check marks, never learned Apollyon (Or the Forgotten) so I’m only now getting up to speed with them.

Can’t seem to figure out when to use Void. It implies that you want to use it on active items, but since so many of them do different things, and you have to use an active charge to absorb the item that typically drops after the big battle where you would like to use Void offensively, it seems like the payoff never has an opportunity to, well, pay off.
                Use it to absorb shitty or inaccessible passives for stat upgrades.
            I had a surprisingly large amount of fun with Apollyon on a run recently and I may try to fill out his note (I'm sort of bad and the only character that i have more than 2 hard marks on is Azazel)
            Really? I find both of them to be sorta boring. For me Apollyon just feels way to weak at the start and ramps way to slow. And Azazel just feels too strong
    im more branched in terms of mains,mostly play Isaac,Lazarus is my 2nd most played,only played azazel for greed but heard he’s good,playing Lilith is fucking torment for me,I don’t delve into maggy a lot,play eve a decent amount,mostly don’t play Lilith because heart container variety= shit devil deals and aiming using incubus is torture
        Lilith is my favorite because I hate myself.  I'm so incredibly used to Incubus that I actually struggle playing any other character for the first few runs until I adapt back to it.  Derp.
            Have you unlocked Tainted Lilith yet? She's absurdly fun.
                My computer is broke and I can't afford to repair it so I don't have Repentance yet. 😩

The agony is unbearable.
    While I don't main any one character in this game, I definitely play Judas more than any other character
        He will be the first char i have everything completed. Just missing greedier and unlocking his tainted
    Eden streaks.

        What's fun about blue baby?
            Angel deal's baby
                Just for the appeal of angel rooms isn't Isaac better since you can reroll the key for an extra item?
                    Adding to what the other person said, rerolling the key piece means you're giving up an item that gives you a better chance to find angel rooms in the future.
                    But blue baby have guaranteed chance because he doesn't have red hearts
        I also used to main Blue Baby. Never having to worry about losing devil deals/angel deals and always having polaroid, empty vessel, whore of babylon and crown of light active is fun. His slightly higher damage and speed are neat too
    idk if I main but I pick Lost > Keeper > Judas > Isaac as a general rule rarely going into any other characters once I've got their marks.
        Keeper? What the fuck? You on crack?
            With the new dlc he's actually really good now.
                Oh yeah for sure, he's dope now, but it seems like it's been longer than repentance that they've mained him
                    Reset until you get swallowed penny from pots

You're now almost immortal and can get plenty of rewards from the sacrifice room for basically free

That's how i played keeper in ab+, and it was great.

Killed lamb before the 6 minute mark with him
                        Yeah but do you really have fun resetting until you're invincible?
                            I'll reset untill I get a decent item room, but man resetting till you get a specific trinket sounds awful.
                                It dropped very frequently from pots, so i'd just wal around in cellar and try to get it
            Yeah I really liked old keeper certinaly wasn't getting big win streaks on him but I felt like he struck a nice balance in rewarding good play and punishing bad play.
                I always thought Keeper with the Swallowed Penny was always a really fun character since you still got a chance to heal time but had to run for it so it presented a fair challenge
    kinda? of course ill do my unlocks with everyone, but ill start out any new dlc with samson, and once im done unlocking things, hes definitely my go-to aside from the random button. i just find minmaxing really calming, and bloody lust goes hand in hand with blood banks/self sacrifice rooms.
    Pretty sure at some Point you'll play all characters but there is always the one character that I enjoy overall more than another.


Big Apollyon fan here. Bad item? SPEED. Trash Golden Chest Item DAMAGE UPGRADE. Bible and Book of Rev.? SLURP!
        Does using book of rev when it's voided cause your bosses to become horsemen like it does it you use it normally? I usually don't take it, because a soulheart every ~6 rooms just isn't worth sacrificing half of your items for orbitals imo.
            Not 100% sure but I Voided it recently and never got a Horsemen. So I'd say it doesnt trigger them.
    No but I'm guessing it fits the meme format better like this
        agreed, good meme. i've just seen other people use this term before and i thought it was strange.
    I actually main Isaac, I don’t see why anyone would main any other character aside from any of the new tainted ones
        All the characters are fun in different ways

Maggie when you want to do a very casual run with low risk

Cain when you wanna take pills and have better speed

Judas for the high damage

Eve for when you want to take every devil deal

Samson for casual high damage run (low stress Judas basically)

Blue baby/Lost/Keeper for challenge runs

Eden for almost limitless variety

Azazel for super casual runs

Forgotten for melee fun and neat synergies

Apollyon for probably the same reasons you would main Isaac.

Bethany for book of virtues synergy fun

Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist or you want a reason to go to the alt floors and a challenge.

Lazarus for casual run where you can die if you want and probably still win.

Lilith for either easy greed mode or familiar based runs.
            > Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist

I like micromanaging resources in runs, and a character who can have two cards, two trinkets and two active items by default (+more with Schoolbag, Mom's Purse, etc.) is right up my alley. The larger hitbox is a pain, and I think a valid buff would be them having the One Makes You Small pill effect by default, but I'm actually having quite a lot of fun even now. Definitely more than, e.g., Apollyon, whom I honestly still not quite able to wrap my head around.
                I'm starting to get better with him as well. I personally think that the buff should be a passive Options (2 boss items) on Isaac kill. Would help them get a bit stronger earlier and allow you to really play to their stat differences.

Apollyon isn't too hard imo, void low quality items like range ups, shot speed ups, etc and only void actives you think you'll actually want to use in the future. I do like his tainted version a lot more since it's a much harder decision to Abyss half decent items for more/better flies than to Void half decent items (ie you don't/shouldnt) with regular Apollyon. 

Also a trick with regular Apollyon is to go angel rooms so that if you get garbage you can potentially void up to 4 items at once and if not then you get something super strong anyway typically.
                Yo ya gonna love tainted lazarus
                    I haven't unlocked him, but I think I know what he does, and it's pretty cool as well, but imo will be harder to manage (because of the flips).
            Forgotten is a bliss, it's  so fun to play with it and smash stuff
        Cain, damage multiplier, never have key issues, all pills are positive
    I've mained Judas, Eve, and Samson, I really love damage-based characters

Lilith is also fun to play, especially when you can find some battery-related items.

            How'd they nerf it? I haven't dived into her in repentance yet.
                [deleted]
                    Well now I know that's not true because the one thing I've done with her since the dlc is a greed run, and I had like a dozen little assholes shooting around the room.
                    This isn't true, not sure where you got your info from
                        Strange, it looked like it in Hutts' runs
    If I get tilted off of a bad run and just wanna have fun win or lose, I'll usually go for either eve, apolly, lost, or forgotten.
    Before repentance after I got my save files completed I only played the lost
    If I’m not trying to get completion marks, I’m playing as the Forgotten.  Maybe Apollyon if I’m feeling spicy.
    Yeah I played the lost most pre repentance, might mix it up once I've finished all post its these days, but definitely was a lost main before this point.

I mean, fighting game main doesn't mean you can't use others any more than the isaac mains, it's not like you know what hurdles a run will have before you pick your character of choice, anyways, so how they handle things differently is just preferential really.
        yeah i think it's just a different usage of the word really. in competitive games, your main is the character (weapon, etc) you use the most *for the purpose* of a competitive advantage over your opponent/the game, usually because you're the most experienced with their moveset. this concept doesn't really transfer over to isaac since all the characters play the same way.

in other games, characters play fundamentally differently from each other, with different controls and moves. even in games like smash with a relatively shared set of inputs across the whole roster you can't just use a ton of characters if you feel like it- you have to put at least a little bit of time into each one you intend to use. if i get done playing with mario and try doing the exact same set of inputs using luigi, i'll be playing an entirely different game. since all isaac characters fundamentally play the exact same way, with only variations in optimal strategy, you can't really "main" a character in isaac. a blue baby "main" plays the exact same game, the exact same way as a lost "main", who plays the exact same game as etc. it feels like a definitionally slippery application of an existing term when people could just say "favorite character" to better mean what they're trying to say.

ultimately this is, however, just semantics, and people can use whatever word they want. i just thought it was kinda funny.
            Yeah I suppose so, but personally I see main in a non fighting game context more than in fighting game contexts, largely due to to being more involved in non fighting games admittedly, but still very broadly in any game with a character choice.

And most non fighting game contexts are more comparable to the isaac meaning than the fighting game meaning. You're right that they're relatively different but IMO even then the sentiment is similar, even if the reason is different. 

I dunno that I'd say a blue baby plays the same as the lost, I mean same control scheme yes but some different strategies for sure. 

But yeah like I said, main exists in a non fighting game constant very well defined, this isn't just an isaac phenomenon, so if you want other games not using the term you kinda missed your window.

I suppose there is some merit in the idea that there's less point in games where you don't need to memorize movesets, but eh, people will gravitate to a specific character any time there's a choice, and favorite character isn't necessarily the same as what you play most even in a game like isaac (eg some people who like azazel best but feel guilt at the ease an thus don't, or just a favorite aesthetically who's not favorite in playstyle), plus just more of a hassle to say. Main on the other hand definitely means what you play the most.

Side note, in a non fighting game context, there's also things like mobas which kinda bridge the gap in 'mains', there's lots of proficiency to be gained in a given character, the competitive aspect you mentioned as well, but relatively more homogenized and simple control schemes. Honestly though, some characters in a given moba may be about as similar as the differences between isaac and forgotten.
                i get that it's commonly used to refer to one's most used character, i just think that it kinda loses some meaning when your most used character isn't any different than your least used character. i'm not really familiar with MOBAs, i played competitive smash for a bit so i know a little bit about fighting games which is why that's what i defaulted to haha. i think "main" can even work for something like monster hunter or shooting games where you choose a specific weapon to use. as long as those weapons play sizeably differently such that you can get a comparative advantage from putting time into one that you don't get from the other, it makes sense to call it a "main". i've spent 500 hours playing only piranha plant in smash and i'm a pretty good piranha plant player, but if i choose almost any other character i probably couldn't beat a CPU. those skill sets are only slightly transferable. if i spend 500 hours playing only as isaac, i can still pick up blue baby, eve, lilith, etc. having never used them before and still do just as well as long as i understand how their strategy works. because the characters in isaac (the forgotten and azazel excepted) are all just isaac with different stats and items, since you get those items and stats as you play, you have experience using those stats and items strategically even if the run didn't start with them. the fundamentals stay exactly the same, just the way you approach the game changes a bit.

for me, saying you "main" a character in isaac is like saying you "main" a G2 pen. sure, you might use a G2 more than any other pen, you might prefer it, and you might even only use that pen, but i can put any other pen, a pencil, or a marker in your hand and you'll be able to use it just as well. it's impossible to develop any meaningful comparative advantage in a game when the characters are all just variations of the same base model.

also, in other games, you get an advantage from devoting a lot of time to one weapon, character, etc. you develop skills with that weapon and become proficient with it. by contrast, in isaac, the game effectively requires that you use all the characters, not just for completion marks but for unlocking items that can then benefit other characters. it feels like all the characters are just different challenges and ways to play the game that should all be utilized for optimal enjoyment.
                    > the forgotten and azazel excepted

>!and 7 other characters now!<

But yeah, relatively true, I get where you're coming from but personally I think they're different enough to be valid, isaac's on one end of a spectrum and fighting game characters are the other end, and there's a gradient in between really. 

I feel like it's worth noting there are plenty of fighting game players who practice a lot of different characters in their own right, and they may not reach your mastery with any, but once you've picked up five some things certainly do help with the 6th and so on, you still have to learn new movesets but it's not like nothing transfers there either. 

You could definitely easily beat me with your worst character and my best, lol. 

But yeah, all in all I certainly wouldn't argue isaac characters are as diverse as fighting game characters, but I don't think they're SO samey as to be an entirely invalid title. 

One thing I'll definitely give to you is you can't really have a main in isaac til after you've finished off your post its or decided you don't care, but hey, I played tons after finishing the post it note in the past, and will eventually get there again.

My optimal enjoyment is mostly just avoiding jacob & esau like the plague once I finish the last few things on the post it note :-) That said, personally I really like >!alt forgotten!< so far from this dlc and they're extremely different from other characters for example.
                        oh yeah, the new tainted characters are so fucking cool. i really can't wait to try tainted cain. i'm also excited to try buffed out regular keeper. i enjoy the way keeper plays and the unique health management system, but it's so frustrating feeling doomed if you can't get swallowed penny or good stat buffs in the first level. the ability to accept more health and not lose devil deal % on hit anymore is huge.
    I'm playing the characters I have still to unlock stuff with
    In the strictest sense of the term, I go with Forgotten when I have the chance cause being able to deliver smacks is the best part of the game.
    Eden streaks are life
    I definitely have a favorite character, being the Forgotten. Once I have all the completion marks, I imagine I’ll be playing him a lot, alongside Isaac if I’m going for synergies, and the Lost if I just want a bunch of Devil deals. But if I were to pick a “main,” it’s definitely the bone man.
    I like Lilith and Tainted Keeper, they are really fun
    I main Cain
    Nah, it's just that maybe you have much fun playing with a character, that  you want to keep playing with it for a while. To me Forgotten is my fav right now, but maybe tomorrow i'd try some lilith or Eden, i almost never played with them
This is just reminding me of how much of a bop the PPG theme song was.
Forgotten mains: gigachad

        random mains are the peak of humanity
            I am above Boss Armour. I am above Damage
        Only true legends let **Fate** have even more control over the game’s outcome than normal. >!If only there was way to roll Tainted and normal characters from random outside of Co-op partners!<
    dude Forgotten is the most creative character I love forgotten so much
        100%. So versatile and so many cool strategies that are unique to him. Easily my favorite character in this game.
    Honestly I resent Forgotten a bit, have cleared all red marks on him, and after playing forgotten it’s impossible to go from that high speed, high risk gameplay of getting in close with enemies, and going back to tiny damage kiting tears
bethany mains holding R for 3 hours trying to find shoop da whoop
    You can also find a library and snag book of shadows, it's almost an automatic win.
    This has been my life as her so far. Held R for maybe ten minutes last night before getting Guppy's Head and beating >!The Beast!<, now I just have the rest of her fucking note to do.
    For me it's glass cannon
    I like pretty much any 2 room recharge active. Some of my favourite are Telekinesis for Dummys and Bob's Rotten Head
    I still can't believe they added worst antibirth character tbh
I love how Cain isnt even on here.
    tbh I couldn't think of one for Cain lmao
        Cain players when they found out Lucky Foot doesn't give them OP pills anymore:
            I did consider that, but seeing as Repentance re-added that feature to the item I decided against it
                Cain players explaining how they're original even though they play the most boring and generic character in the game:
                    Or maybe "cain mains when they don't get a golden chest on a floor."
                    I disagree, Lucky foot leads to interesting plays and his eyepatch does have some interesting effects on his tears.

Definitely one of the most consistent characters though.
                    this hurt my heart because i know it is true
        Cain mains resetting greedier mode for ten hours until they get a good item in the treasure room
Lost is just spicy Judas change my mind.
    counterpoint: judas has a fez, the lost doesnt even have a cool hat of any kind
        Ok yeah I'm convinced now thanks.
good meme but I can’t help but feel that the actually blue child shoulda been used for the blue baby part
Lilith mains when she can't hit the spider in the corner and take damage
    Every character
I hate spiders
    I feel personally attacked.
    How dare you make me remember that moment
I main Bethany because she's fun
    I used to main her in antibirth
Love this meme format
Bethany mains after they google Bethany without safesearch
    Just checked, nothing weird popped up. 

Yall just need to chill
    Wait what do you get when you google that?
Where forgotten

Edit: HOLY SHIT HE’S BEEN FORGOTTEN
Power Puff theme is what sells it
Eden enjoyers rise up
lost mains when they get hit once 😱
My favs are probably isaac, the lost, and Apollyon with honorable mentions going to Judas and ???
For some reason I play The Lost much more better than any other character with 1 hp.
Apolion main when getting any stat up that isn't tears or DMG

What about us keeper mains? My boy is robust.
    Wish I was able to fit more in the edit but powerpuff girl theme is short
Walter White's breakdown set to the Powerpuff Girls theme is something I never thought I would want but turns out I really do.
Dear Cain mains: I did not forget you, I just couldn't come up with something for Cain lul
I mained the lost pretty heavily because I love devil deals a lot and am fairly good at the game. I know that I'll have a lot more fun with him after I re-unlock him since I deleted all my saves so I can re-unlock everything again.
Listen, taking damage and gaining damage plus speed is worth it, despite dying many times ofc
    I mean i start evey eve run by almost killing myself. Tha dmg is just soo good.
        Yeah same, I try to get a devil deal to just get rid of that extra heart because its so easy to pick up red hearts and heal, undoing everything
            Yeah having her start with the razor is so much better. As when i play on a newer file without that unlocked. I always ruin it by picking up red health out of habit.
now do it for the >!tainted characters!<
[Keeper mains when they are one hit away, no coins for the entire floor, and their active item hasn't given a coin for the 5th time...](https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-hot-nervous-l4FATJpd4LWgeruTK)
cain mains are so based and goated that we're unroastable. there are no flaws to poke fun at.
What about modded characters?
that was very accurate
oh right, forgotten is an afterbirth character
    +
Keeper mains after dying 20 times to a red fly: third template
As a lost main getting tons of health up items feels terrible. Also the reason it felt so good to play lost pre repentance was because the free devil deals, now you can only take one, and getting revelation or god head is so good that i usually pass the devil deal ans wait until the next floor, if i dont get angel room in caves i just press R or ragequit. I think tainted lost is gonna take away years of my life.
I feel like tinted rocka have been eradicated in repentance.. I mean i was leays unlucky but now it's just sad. And also i fully agree with the lost one
Lilith mains when they see BFF in the first shop but don't have enough money to afford it
Do AB, AB+ and Repentance characters pls
I always hit random...
Lilith mains taking 2 minutes to clear a room with a single stonie
huge respect for lost mains
Lillith mains:

^(There are no Lillith mains.)
maggie mains when they get a soul heart and a chest out of a sacrifice room
Lilith mains when they get demon baby after loosing 8 black hearts
Judas mains taking a bad trip pill be like
    Bad trip actually can't kill Isaac. It turns into a full health pill as soon as you get down to one heart or less. Can definitely put you down to a half heart though.
Jacob and Esau mains: *face melt from Raiders of the Lost Ark*
Lilith mains after accidentally hitting the active item
Download, comrade?
As blue baby just restart for libraries with either unholy Bible or book of revelations.
I swear the libraries are op in repentance, love them.
I judas main because I love casually running into huge damage games that make my run the most fun all night
Being a Lost main was not so absurd, but with Repentance (and its nerfs to Holy Mantle and Devil Rooms) it really has become a pain. Judas is the way
Cain mains: forgotten :(

Not to be confused with the forgotten
Funny how Cain isn’t here because there’s little downside to him.
Forgotten mains explaining how Hotline Miami is the greatest series in existence (Forgotten always felt like playing melee Jacket to me)
As a Lost main, I totally agree with OP.
jokes on you guys i am a Forgotten main
Who Mains Blue baby?

Aren't most Eden "mains" streakers? Don't think holding R is a thing, unless your streak just got reset lol
I had no idea people mained characters in this game.

Repentance tainted characters be like:
Judas=with soul converter i broke the game :)
I just play Samson cus I get hit a lot so I said why not add a bonus for it now I hav the most stuff done on Samson
Where are the keeper mains?? They’re the true chads.
If I had to pick one I'd probably say The Lost for me but I generally just go with random runs
You guys have mains?
Average Isaac fan vs Average Keeper connoisseur
The Eve one would apply to me if I don’t pick up every single HP up item I can find with her.
Is there a name for this meme template yet? I have seen several of those over the past couple of days
BRUHHHH THIS IS FACTSSS
Where the frick is cain
Why yes, i do main lost. How could you tell
You got the last one wrong: Lost mains dodging every tear and beam on the game just get hit twice by a fly
Blue baby main here

This pains me
Apollyon mains voiding mom's heels for a worse range up.
i was waititng for someone to do this

Jacob and esau mains playing fireboy and watergirl by themself
Bro.....Cain mains.....
Where my Lilith mains at?
I had honestly no idea you had to die with Lazarus for extra dmg?  
Most runs I did with normal lazarus and they went pretty well
This is the kind of quality shitposting I come here for. Well done sir.
As we can see, thanks to this video, Cain is one unstoppable being.
Cain Mains: are we a joke to you?
What's the name of the meme that was the "eden main"
This is gold
How would I go about making one of these?
As an Azazel main, I fucking hate when that happens
cain mains
Cain mains: "I have a gambling problem"
>!Tainted Cain!< mains be like "Imma spend an hour and never leave the basement
As an Azazel main, this is exactly how I react 😂 he’s the best for getting Eden tokens, his start items and stats are just beautiful

I actually like the lost and feel as if he's balanced.
make one with ab, ab+and rep characters
Lost mains getting a devil deal of brimstone and 9 lives
Lost mains when the devil room only has black hearts and red chests
I'm usually able to get enough speed ups to at least be as fast as Isaac by the first floor.
OP just admitted that Cain is the best character in Repentance.
Cain mains when they can't find golden chests to lockpick
Jacob and esau mains hit by a stray shot
lost is actually an extremely fun character

but only if you're willing to donate 800+ coins to the greed machine
Apollyon mains after sucking up blood donation machine because of cotb
What about Cain???
I main tainted Judas. I don’t have such weaknesses

Forgotten mains: *horny BONK*
wher eyepatch boi
the lost and forgotten are the best characters in the game imo
Where  the forgotten at? oh...
Whats's the name of this Song?
When you just started so isaac dosent have the d6 yet: 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵🧐😎
Basicly Shisheyu, a french streamer who had the WR on the lost streak with an "unfinished" streak of 100-0 with the lost in AB+. He "intentionnaly" lost the streak because of changes in repentance
"Rebirth characters" meanwhile hush and azazel taking a range down pill is mentioned
the forgotten has been forgotten
Forgotten mains: 💀
Bethany mains Explaining to noobs why they can’t use soul hearts as health for the 69420th time
Oh my god I finally found it. What is the video for the Lazarus one. I’ve been looking for that video for months.
Shisheyu is a omega chad then (101-0 lost streak in ab+ and in repantance 36-0 all chapters)
I play Cain and restart till I get a good start and then immediately lose because I have no health
Lost mains getting haunt on the first floor
No Cain mention
Lost mains getting hit in a cursed room
Cain?
If you get range down for azalel its over
im a lost main until i get god-head
Clear rooms fast, die fast. I am speed
    Live fast die faster
        This is my motto from now on
        Judas run fast and died a virgin
            r/UnexpectedTF2
It hurts more for me. Trust![img](emote|t5_2sxpk|17741)
"Apolion"

*sucks in rawrxD*
    Apolion Bonaparte
How dare you, I think’s he’s actually a very well rounded and effective chara-

Oh. Oh I see. Clever girl.
I've genuinely been having more fun with her than I expected now that she gets a guaranteed full health pill. self sacrifice rooms are pretty cracked
    Yeah, I literally got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room
        And that kids, is how I got Maggie's The Beast kill.
        How do you get an item from the sacrifice room?
            on the 6th or 7th try i think you're guaranteed an item

I dont know for sure though
                Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
                    I believe the item is always an angel room item
        > got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room

:O
    Never would have thought that giving her a Full Health pill would change the start of her playstyle so drastically.

Honestly Maggy and Bethany are some of my favourites now since I love all Angel Room items
        I also feel like angel rooms are way stronger. I got sacred heart once in 500 runs, but since repentance i got it 4 times
            True, Special items don't exist anymore, so you'll probably be seeing Sacred Heart/Godhead/Brimstone etc more often now
                I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
                    I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
                        Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
                            Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                                Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
                            You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                                Welp, not looking forward to that lol
                Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
                    Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
                What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
                    No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
                    Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
                        Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
                            ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
                        Huh, never knew that
                ... What
                    They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
                        Oh my god that's incredible.
                That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
            Devils rooms also feel weaker post repentance which indirectly makes angel rooms even more appealing
            I'm pretty sure it's because Repentance changed how the dpecial items work, thus they are more likely to appear. But I might be wrong.
    Repentance maggy is prob. My second favouritw character
    getting wafer + scrificial floor on floor one is pretty POG
I used to be one when I was newer at the game, she’s really good for surviving the first few floors if you’re a noob
    Maggy flippin sucks in the long run
        Now that she can start with full health pill she’s actually amazing you basically always have a 50/50 chance at an angel item on floor one
            How do you get an angel room on floor one?
                Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
                    It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
                Sacrifice rooms
                    Ah
        Until you buy the holy Potato Peeler.
            That's other history
        Nice profile pic. r/enterthegungeon
I used to be one, but am enjoying Bethany a lot right now.  I quite liked her ability to use health a resource more often, more sacrifice rooms and more blood donation money.  And didn’t mind the speed loss.  But most other characters do feel like they have more going for them.
Maggie is way more fun in repentance
I'm a Maggie main.

The extra heart container + Yum Heart has lots of uses besides being able to tank more hits. You can much more reliably play Sacrifice rooms for angle items, coins, soul hearts, or key pieces. More easily play blood donation machines. Have more HP to trade for devil deals. Plus, you know you have a Full Health pill in the pill rotation.
Not a main, but back in afterbirth i played her frequently and i got crown of light AND sacred heart on the first floor with maggy in one run (one in the teleport to the angel room, one in the angel item spawn), now that she has a full health pill she's even better
Tbh i hate playing as maggie shes just boring
There was when she had a speed up pill
Not me, but extra hp for devil deals plus a full health pill for sacrifice rooms is pretty dang good.
I don't think so
I mean once you unlock the speed pill to start off with (since it’s a fairly easy unlock) I’d say she’s not assss bad??? But still too slow and nothing special apart from being a low-key tank
She's fun to minmax with
Play Maggie when drunk and with others joining in as babies
I have been playing Isaac since launch 10 years ago at this point and Maggie has always been my favorite character to play as, during the olden Isaac days 4health containers meant a lot more devil deals, and now? With Yum Heart and a Full Health pill you can pretty consistently leave the first floor with 1-2 Angel items thanks to sacrifice rooms. Tainted Maggie is even better to some extend.
    Idk how to get tainted stuff
        Not sure if it’s considered a spoiler or not, but it’s tied to one of the two new bosses they added on Repetence. Not sure how much I can reveal in this post since it’s not flaired for repetence content.
Regular Maggie? No.

Tainted Maggie? Yes.
    How do you get tainted characters
        When you get to home, use the Red Key or the Cracked Key in the corridor to the left of Mom's TV room. This can only be done BEFORE you sleep in Mom's bed.
Which Tainted character you get depends on what character your playing as when you unlock them.
While getting Red Key is just RNG, you can get a Cracked Key by leaving a trinket on the ground, then coming back later during the ascension scene to pick it up.
            Ok so: never gotten to home, never seen the red key, and don’t know what the ascension scene is
                Um, how far into the game are you?
                    I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance
Me because I am very bad playing Isaac so using the Yum Heart it really helps me.
    That’s awesome
i got a mod that replaces her with Neco arc and now I'm a Maggie main
she’s the only character that I can consistently win runs on, free angel items, near infinite heals, good starting health
"Lost mains explaining how starting with Holy Mantle actually makes them harder than most characters to kill."
    Honestly it does, 1 free hit every room is quite op if you think about it. I'm no lost main, but in alt floors I sometimes transform into the lost to avoid red heart damage. Unless it is dross, cause Colostomia and Turdlet are the freaking worst.
        Fuck Dross. All my homies hate Dross.

                        Good bot
        I like to do the boss rooms twice in Downpour/Dross 2 for the extra item, I've lost a few runs there but it's only the 2nd/3rd floor of the game
        Turdlet is easy wdym
            Dude how tf am I supposed to avoid that mach 5 spin attack when it takes up the entire screen?
            I don’t fight it enough, cause it’s not a common encounter. Where does it actually aim towards anyway
    I actually believe that Lost was one of the most permissive character to main. Guaranteed deals in floor 2 is huge
You can tell who lost mains are because they talk about how lost used to be hard but balanced and now they overbuffed it to make it the best character. 

Source: I am lost main. I trained with weighted clothing for years, suiciding into curse rooms on the chance there would be a dead cat or guppy’s collar in there. Your new game is made for babies.
    Well good thing that (SPOILERS): >!Tainted Lost exists now for all of your masochistic needs!<
        >!I have do to it AGAIN?!<
            >!Yep, have fun!!<
            yes, and not only that, >!but the blost cannot find any items that would give him a second chance. holy cards spawn more often for him, and he starts with one, but he cannot find the mantle, dead cat, etc. The only extra lives he can find are Birthright which is +1 life for him with a huge damage effect on respawn, and Missing Poster, oddly.!<

>!his UPSIDE is that he cannot find any items that he cannot use. items that are primarily health/healing, flight, spectral, self-damaging, on hit effects, or anything that might be a net downgrade like Stompy, will not actually appear as him. Additionally, any item with a quality of 2 or lower, like Brother Bobby for example, has a 20% chance to be automatically rerolled by Blost. (platgod has quality listed for each item)!<
                So a true glass cannon character?
                    yeah.
        I've had tons of fun on Tainted Lost to be honest. >!The base damage and upgraded item pools make it so hardly any run is a bad run, so I don't have to hold R until a good item pops up. It's the real die-and-retry mode in Isaac. Almost feels like I'm playing Cuphead, seeing how fast I can get back into the game after a loss (I'm at like 200 tries, probably three quarters are deaths before Necropolis, the others are godlike and of course I die in Gehenna going back up after Mom's fight -\_- )!<
            I was not looking forward to playing him, but this makes me slightly less anxious about having to do so, haha.
            Gehenna can eat my dick honestly
                I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
        >!I love it, his pools are better and the extra damage at the start is nice!<
    as someone who is playing on console before repentance.. is there any other difference to the lost other than the D4 and the eternal D6? I don’t have the lost unlocked yet but eventually i’ll get there.
        holy mantle can't be rerolled with for example d4 and dice rooms with d4
            epic i mean it makes sense bc you go thru the trouble of making sure the lost starts with it... I understand both sides of the coin
                also 9 lives can be rerolled now
                    I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
        Starting with eternal D6 is a huge buff to go with already having automatic flight and spectral tears.
            He didn't always have spectral tears
        The Lost's Holy Mantle is no longer an item he starts with, but a direct upgrade to the character himself once unlocked. It is completely baked in.

This means if you were to turn into the lost, for reasons like dying while holding Missing Poster, using the Clicker, or potential other ways that Repentance may add, you will have the Holy Mantle so long as you keep being the Lost. This also makes Missing Poster an actually valid respawn item now.

Additionally, the Lost cannot lose the Holy Mantle due to a full run reroll, the Clicker's item removal, a victory lap's item confiscation, etc.

As another change, Repentance has nerfed the Lost so that he can only buy 1 item from each individual deal, as the rest will disappear if he purchases one.

However, Lost also recieved an indirect buff in the form of the Perfection trinket. If you no hit 3 bosses in a row, Perfection will spawn, which will give you +10 luck until you get hit. The Holy Mantle does not count as getting hit. So the lost will always get this and keep it, unless you get an extra life and promptly lose it. And I think (but im not sure) that the Eternal D6 is less likely to delete items based on your luck stat, too.
            Eternal D6 has a 50% chance to poof the item at 0 Luck, and scales all the way down to a 5% chance at 10 Luck.

    Precisely why I made sure to get all his marks before afterbirth + (or whichever dlc came after his release)
        he were avalible in base game, but with afterbirth he is much easier to unlock
            Easier yes... but it's based soley on RNG since afterbirth. Which I argue makes unlocking lost much more infuriating.

Example: On my xbone I unlocked Lost relatively quickly once Missing Poster was unlocked. However when I bought my PC 2 years ago, I put MAJOR hours into BOI and unlocked The Lost LITERALLY LAST MONTH! I tried everything to up my chances of getting the missing poster (mom's trinket box etc.). 

I did all because The Lost is my favorite character by far, also im a masochist.
                Why not just shop break?
                    Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
    Honestly, I love The Lost now. I played him a fair bit even before getting Holy Mantle, and now I think he's great. He was my first >!Beast!< kill. >!Tainted Lost!< is even more rewarding, but I'm not quite good enough with him to actually accomplish anything good
    I got downvoted so hard recently for saying that my preferred rebalance was to replace Holy Mantle with Breath of Life.
        How the fuck does breath of life even work? Ive been playing since flash and I still gave up on trying to use that item ever.
            The charge bar on Breath of Life ticks down. Release and it recharges. Right when it hits zero charge, you get I-frames. Hold it any longer and it hurts you. Not much use for combat, but great for getting through curse doors and playing blood machines. Just takes skill to use.
                That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
                Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
    Oh thank god, I thought I was the only one who thought the same

Lost was high risk high reward, and it was great. Afterbirth buffed lost a lot with holy mantle, but it was kinda fair. But repentance just made it more balanced. A lot less risk and a lot less reward, it sucks.
I played the lost without holy mantle, I mained him beates delirium and all the other marks, I didn’t want to do 20 runs just to put the money in the machine, I got all marks and did it afterwards, no one is more patient then a lost main
So you're saying Lost mains are malformed mimicries of human beings?
Keeper is my favourite character, he is pretty easy too :)
    He has always been Elder God-tier with a first floor Swallowed Penny. Now he's unstoppable.
        The only thing that bothered me with keeper was his low speed, now he's faster and harder to kill, so that's nice
            Yeah, now everybody loves keeper, when I tried defending him in AB+ I had like -200 karma, bah I even explained how OP would Keeper be with 3 Coin slots, no one belived, who laughs now?
                I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.
Keeper mains when there is no sacrifice room on floor one:
If I had to choose a main I’d probably go Cain. Idk why but I’ve almost always had the most fun with him
    I mean he has a lot of desirable qualities. High starting damage and speed, free gold chests, and the eyepatch which makes his tears more consistent, all at the cost of 1 red heart.
        And on top of that you can't get negative pills
            But that's a rep buff
                Did they give him PhD back in repentance?
                    Yes. Flash Lucky Foot is back
                        Great news, love playing as Cain!
                        Wait, how do I get the PHD for Cain?
                            The item Cain starts with, Lucky Foot, was buffed and now turns all stats down pills into stats up
                    he doesn't know what the pills do, but can only get good ones.
        Wait can u explain why the eye patch makes tears more consistent
            When you fire tears, they alternate between the eyes. Since cain only has 1 eye, there's no alternating, which makes the shots more consistant. This also has an effect on some items which I cant remember off the top of my head.
                Blood clot
    Cain for me always seems to have a broken run. I don’t know what it is but I don’t think it is the luck element playing into it
        I had +10 Luck and Birds Eye which resulted in crazy constant damage. All my tears were high damage fire.
Cain mains when they get 38 coins on womb 2
All aboard the Cain Train! 🚂
I think a main in this game is which character you play the most when playing a run for fun
    Whoever I don’t have stamps for because I was indoctrinated to thinking like that by my friend
        Assume you have all the completion marks and that you had to do a run. Which character would you pick? 

Inb4 “I wouldn’t be playing if I had all the marks”
            ...azazel...
I suck at the game and he has flight and small brimstone with the highest starting damage so I hav the most fun with him if I were to casually play
            Isaac. Classic and well rounded, the D6 is good shit too.

Bethany if I want an insta-win though, holy shit is she good.
                Could you give me some Bethany tips? I just lose her wisps nearly instantly and other than that she doesn't do much for me.
                    Well the key to never losing with Beth is to take it slow, spend time dodging to minimise wisp loss. Then get lucky with a great active item haha. I'm not very good at the game I can't give many tips haha.
                    the reason the basic  wisps are so hard to keep is because they’re in the second ring, so they’re somewhat far away from you. Getting an active item that spawns the wisps in the first ring closest to her will make it much easier to keep them alive. Check the wiki book of virtues tab for which items are first ring. Also active items with only one room cooldowns, like guppies head and wooden nickel will allow you to build up a great amount of wisps, even if they are being destroyed.
            That would be the random button. How does that work with tainted chars? I haven't had a chance to unlock any yet
                Tainted chars are a separate page, which means you have to swap to the Tainted page to choose a random Tainted character, no normal characters

Clicker works the same as far as I know, if you play a normal character you can't swap to tainteds because it's a different page and vice versa
            Whatever character I feel I could get the remaining achievements with.
            I mena even after you do the marks, you can do all the challenges and get all items
                Idk how else to phrase it, but I didn’t mean this question as a “hehe be as semantic as possible”. I thought it was pretty clear I just meant “who is your favorite character to play as independent of any achievements”
            In Antibirth, pretty much always The Lost.
            Random
    My main is Challenge 45.
Random Button is a very valid main. I should know, I'm one of those.
    Mine is eden. Which basically is random random lmao.
        You should take it a step further with the tainted one for even more random.
            Haha yea but it’s a little too random for me
    Me too dude lmao I always played on xbox now I need to unlock everything again on pc bc of repentance, so I just random everytime bc they all need unlocks, plus that's how I did it on console anyway 😂
    Good luck getting it every run now :V
when I have most of the shit unlocked and I just want a fun run I tend to go Judas.
    Judas is my go-to as well, having really solid damage right off the bat is just so valuable.
I kinda “mained” Azazel to farm out Eden tokens when I was filling out the completion marks for every character, and I got really used to starting out with flight and no red hearts, really suited how I wanted to play the game and reduced the feelsbad moments when early pickups are locked behind rocks. Az’s Brimstone is also very fun with a few stat upgrades.
    All I need is the hard mode Mega Satan mark for The Lost. It’s been so painful
    honestly Azazel is probably the most fun character in general, at least for me. Apollyon gets an honorable mention
        I kind of took a sabbatical from TBoI after Afterbirth came around and I finished all hard mode check marks, never learned Apollyon (Or the Forgotten) so I’m only now getting up to speed with them.

Can’t seem to figure out when to use Void. It implies that you want to use it on active items, but since so many of them do different things, and you have to use an active charge to absorb the item that typically drops after the big battle where you would like to use Void offensively, it seems like the payoff never has an opportunity to, well, pay off.
            Use it to absorb shitty or inaccessible passives for stat upgrades.
        I had a surprisingly large amount of fun with Apollyon on a run recently and I may try to fill out his note (I'm sort of bad and the only character that i have more than 2 hard marks on is Azazel)
        Really? I find both of them to be sorta boring. For me Apollyon just feels way to weak at the start and ramps way to slow. And Azazel just feels too strong
im more branched in terms of mains,mostly play Isaac,Lazarus is my 2nd most played,only played azazel for greed but heard he’s good,playing Lilith is fucking torment for me,I don’t delve into maggy a lot,play eve a decent amount,mostly don’t play Lilith because heart container variety= shit devil deals and aiming using incubus is torture
    Lilith is my favorite because I hate myself.  I'm so incredibly used to Incubus that I actually struggle playing any other character for the first few runs until I adapt back to it.  Derp.
        Have you unlocked Tainted Lilith yet? She's absurdly fun.
            My computer is broke and I can't afford to repair it so I don't have Repentance yet. 😩

The agony is unbearable.
While I don't main any one character in this game, I definitely play Judas more than any other character
    He will be the first char i have everything completed. Just missing greedier and unlocking his tainted
Eden streaks.

    What's fun about blue baby?
        Angel deal's baby
            Just for the appeal of angel rooms isn't Isaac better since you can reroll the key for an extra item?
                Adding to what the other person said, rerolling the key piece means you're giving up an item that gives you a better chance to find angel rooms in the future.
                But blue baby have guaranteed chance because he doesn't have red hearts
    I also used to main Blue Baby. Never having to worry about losing devil deals/angel deals and always having polaroid, empty vessel, whore of babylon and crown of light active is fun. His slightly higher damage and speed are neat too
idk if I main but I pick Lost > Keeper > Judas > Isaac as a general rule rarely going into any other characters once I've got their marks.
    Keeper? What the fuck? You on crack?
        With the new dlc he's actually really good now.
            Oh yeah for sure, he's dope now, but it seems like it's been longer than repentance that they've mained him
                Reset until you get swallowed penny from pots

You're now almost immortal and can get plenty of rewards from the sacrifice room for basically free

That's how i played keeper in ab+, and it was great.

Killed lamb before the 6 minute mark with him
                    Yeah but do you really have fun resetting until you're invincible?
                        I'll reset untill I get a decent item room, but man resetting till you get a specific trinket sounds awful.
                            It dropped very frequently from pots, so i'd just wal around in cellar and try to get it
        Yeah I really liked old keeper certinaly wasn't getting big win streaks on him but I felt like he struck a nice balance in rewarding good play and punishing bad play.
            I always thought Keeper with the Swallowed Penny was always a really fun character since you still got a chance to heal time but had to run for it so it presented a fair challenge
kinda? of course ill do my unlocks with everyone, but ill start out any new dlc with samson, and once im done unlocking things, hes definitely my go-to aside from the random button. i just find minmaxing really calming, and bloody lust goes hand in hand with blood banks/self sacrifice rooms.
Pretty sure at some Point you'll play all characters but there is always the one character that I enjoy overall more than another.


Big Apollyon fan here. Bad item? SPEED. Trash Golden Chest Item DAMAGE UPGRADE. Bible and Book of Rev.? SLURP!
    Does using book of rev when it's voided cause your bosses to become horsemen like it does it you use it normally? I usually don't take it, because a soulheart every ~6 rooms just isn't worth sacrificing half of your items for orbitals imo.
        Not 100% sure but I Voided it recently and never got a Horsemen. So I'd say it doesnt trigger them.
No but I'm guessing it fits the meme format better like this
    agreed, good meme. i've just seen other people use this term before and i thought it was strange.
I actually main Isaac, I don’t see why anyone would main any other character aside from any of the new tainted ones
    All the characters are fun in different ways

Maggie when you want to do a very casual run with low risk

Cain when you wanna take pills and have better speed

Judas for the high damage

Eve for when you want to take every devil deal

Samson for casual high damage run (low stress Judas basically)

Blue baby/Lost/Keeper for challenge runs

Eden for almost limitless variety

Azazel for super casual runs

Forgotten for melee fun and neat synergies

Apollyon for probably the same reasons you would main Isaac.

Bethany for book of virtues synergy fun

Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist or you want a reason to go to the alt floors and a challenge.

Lazarus for casual run where you can die if you want and probably still win.

Lilith for either easy greed mode or familiar based runs.
        > Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist

I like micromanaging resources in runs, and a character who can have two cards, two trinkets and two active items by default (+more with Schoolbag, Mom's Purse, etc.) is right up my alley. The larger hitbox is a pain, and I think a valid buff would be them having the One Makes You Small pill effect by default, but I'm actually having quite a lot of fun even now. Definitely more than, e.g., Apollyon, whom I honestly still not quite able to wrap my head around.
            I'm starting to get better with him as well. I personally think that the buff should be a passive Options (2 boss items) on Isaac kill. Would help them get a bit stronger earlier and allow you to really play to their stat differences.

Apollyon isn't too hard imo, void low quality items like range ups, shot speed ups, etc and only void actives you think you'll actually want to use in the future. I do like his tainted version a lot more since it's a much harder decision to Abyss half decent items for more/better flies than to Void half decent items (ie you don't/shouldnt) with regular Apollyon. 

Also a trick with regular Apollyon is to go angel rooms so that if you get garbage you can potentially void up to 4 items at once and if not then you get something super strong anyway typically.
            Yo ya gonna love tainted lazarus
                I haven't unlocked him, but I think I know what he does, and it's pretty cool as well, but imo will be harder to manage (because of the flips).
        Forgotten is a bliss, it's  so fun to play with it and smash stuff
    Cain, damage multiplier, never have key issues, all pills are positive
I've mained Judas, Eve, and Samson, I really love damage-based characters

Lilith is also fun to play, especially when you can find some battery-related items.
    [deleted]
        How'd they nerf it? I haven't dived into her in repentance yet.
            [deleted]
                Well now I know that's not true because the one thing I've done with her since the dlc is a greed run, and I had like a dozen little assholes shooting around the room.
                This isn't true, not sure where you got your info from
                    Strange, it looked like it in Hutts' runs
If I get tilted off of a bad run and just wanna have fun win or lose, I'll usually go for either eve, apolly, lost, or forgotten.
Before repentance after I got my save files completed I only played the lost
If I’m not trying to get completion marks, I’m playing as the Forgotten.  Maybe Apollyon if I’m feeling spicy.
Yeah I played the lost most pre repentance, might mix it up once I've finished all post its these days, but definitely was a lost main before this point.

I mean, fighting game main doesn't mean you can't use others any more than the isaac mains, it's not like you know what hurdles a run will have before you pick your character of choice, anyways, so how they handle things differently is just preferential really.
    yeah i think it's just a different usage of the word really. in competitive games, your main is the character (weapon, etc) you use the most *for the purpose* of a competitive advantage over your opponent/the game, usually because you're the most experienced with their moveset. this concept doesn't really transfer over to isaac since all the characters play the same way.

in other games, characters play fundamentally differently from each other, with different controls and moves. even in games like smash with a relatively shared set of inputs across the whole roster you can't just use a ton of characters if you feel like it- you have to put at least a little bit of time into each one you intend to use. if i get done playing with mario and try doing the exact same set of inputs using luigi, i'll be playing an entirely different game. since all isaac characters fundamentally play the exact same way, with only variations in optimal strategy, you can't really "main" a character in isaac. a blue baby "main" plays the exact same game, the exact same way as a lost "main", who plays the exact same game as etc. it feels like a definitionally slippery application of an existing term when people could just say "favorite character" to better mean what they're trying to say.

ultimately this is, however, just semantics, and people can use whatever word they want. i just thought it was kinda funny.
        Yeah I suppose so, but personally I see main in a non fighting game context more than in fighting game contexts, largely due to to being more involved in non fighting games admittedly, but still very broadly in any game with a character choice.

And most non fighting game contexts are more comparable to the isaac meaning than the fighting game meaning. You're right that they're relatively different but IMO even then the sentiment is similar, even if the reason is different. 

I dunno that I'd say a blue baby plays the same as the lost, I mean same control scheme yes but some different strategies for sure. 

But yeah like I said, main exists in a non fighting game constant very well defined, this isn't just an isaac phenomenon, so if you want other games not using the term you kinda missed your window.

I suppose there is some merit in the idea that there's less point in games where you don't need to memorize movesets, but eh, people will gravitate to a specific character any time there's a choice, and favorite character isn't necessarily the same as what you play most even in a game like isaac (eg some people who like azazel best but feel guilt at the ease an thus don't, or just a favorite aesthetically who's not favorite in playstyle), plus just more of a hassle to say. Main on the other hand definitely means what you play the most.

Side note, in a non fighting game context, there's also things like mobas which kinda bridge the gap in 'mains', there's lots of proficiency to be gained in a given character, the competitive aspect you mentioned as well, but relatively more homogenized and simple control schemes. Honestly though, some characters in a given moba may be about as similar as the differences between isaac and forgotten.
            i get that it's commonly used to refer to one's most used character, i just think that it kinda loses some meaning when your most used character isn't any different than your least used character. i'm not really familiar with MOBAs, i played competitive smash for a bit so i know a little bit about fighting games which is why that's what i defaulted to haha. i think "main" can even work for something like monster hunter or shooting games where you choose a specific weapon to use. as long as those weapons play sizeably differently such that you can get a comparative advantage from putting time into one that you don't get from the other, it makes sense to call it a "main". i've spent 500 hours playing only piranha plant in smash and i'm a pretty good piranha plant player, but if i choose almost any other character i probably couldn't beat a CPU. those skill sets are only slightly transferable. if i spend 500 hours playing only as isaac, i can still pick up blue baby, eve, lilith, etc. having never used them before and still do just as well as long as i understand how their strategy works. because the characters in isaac (the forgotten and azazel excepted) are all just isaac with different stats and items, since you get those items and stats as you play, you have experience using those stats and items strategically even if the run didn't start with them. the fundamentals stay exactly the same, just the way you approach the game changes a bit.

for me, saying you "main" a character in isaac is like saying you "main" a G2 pen. sure, you might use a G2 more than any other pen, you might prefer it, and you might even only use that pen, but i can put any other pen, a pencil, or a marker in your hand and you'll be able to use it just as well. it's impossible to develop any meaningful comparative advantage in a game when the characters are all just variations of the same base model.

also, in other games, you get an advantage from devoting a lot of time to one weapon, character, etc. you develop skills with that weapon and become proficient with it. by contrast, in isaac, the game effectively requires that you use all the characters, not just for completion marks but for unlocking items that can then benefit other characters. it feels like all the characters are just different challenges and ways to play the game that should all be utilized for optimal enjoyment.
                > the forgotten and azazel excepted

>!and 7 other characters now!<

But yeah, relatively true, I get where you're coming from but personally I think they're different enough to be valid, isaac's on one end of a spectrum and fighting game characters are the other end, and there's a gradient in between really. 

I feel like it's worth noting there are plenty of fighting game players who practice a lot of different characters in their own right, and they may not reach your mastery with any, but once you've picked up five some things certainly do help with the 6th and so on, you still have to learn new movesets but it's not like nothing transfers there either. 

You could definitely easily beat me with your worst character and my best, lol. 

But yeah, all in all I certainly wouldn't argue isaac characters are as diverse as fighting game characters, but I don't think they're SO samey as to be an entirely invalid title. 

One thing I'll definitely give to you is you can't really have a main in isaac til after you've finished off your post its or decided you don't care, but hey, I played tons after finishing the post it note in the past, and will eventually get there again.

My optimal enjoyment is mostly just avoiding jacob & esau like the plague once I finish the last few things on the post it note :-) That said, personally I really like >!alt forgotten!< so far from this dlc and they're extremely different from other characters for example.
                    oh yeah, the new tainted characters are so fucking cool. i really can't wait to try tainted cain. i'm also excited to try buffed out regular keeper. i enjoy the way keeper plays and the unique health management system, but it's so frustrating feeling doomed if you can't get swallowed penny or good stat buffs in the first level. the ability to accept more health and not lose devil deal % on hit anymore is huge.
I'm playing the characters I have still to unlock stuff with
In the strictest sense of the term, I go with Forgotten when I have the chance cause being able to deliver smacks is the best part of the game.
Eden streaks are life
I definitely have a favorite character, being the Forgotten. Once I have all the completion marks, I imagine I’ll be playing him a lot, alongside Isaac if I’m going for synergies, and the Lost if I just want a bunch of Devil deals. But if I were to pick a “main,” it’s definitely the bone man.
I like Lilith and Tainted Keeper, they are really fun
I main Cain
Nah, it's just that maybe you have much fun playing with a character, that  you want to keep playing with it for a while. To me Forgotten is my fav right now, but maybe tomorrow i'd try some lilith or Eden, i almost never played with them
[deleted]
    random mains are the peak of humanity
        I am above Boss Armour. I am above Damage
    Only true legends let **Fate** have even more control over the game’s outcome than normal. >!If only there was way to roll Tainted and normal characters from random outside of Co-op partners!<
dude Forgotten is the most creative character I love forgotten so much
    100%. So versatile and so many cool strategies that are unique to him. Easily my favorite character in this game.
Honestly I resent Forgotten a bit, have cleared all red marks on him, and after playing forgotten it’s impossible to go from that high speed, high risk gameplay of getting in close with enemies, and going back to tiny damage kiting tears
You can also find a library and snag book of shadows, it's almost an automatic win.
This has been my life as her so far. Held R for maybe ten minutes last night before getting Guppy's Head and beating >!The Beast!<, now I just have the rest of her fucking note to do.
For me it's glass cannon
I like pretty much any 2 room recharge active. Some of my favourite are Telekinesis for Dummys and Bob's Rotten Head
I still can't believe they added worst antibirth character tbh
tbh I couldn't think of one for Cain lmao
    Cain players when they found out Lucky Foot doesn't give them OP pills anymore:
        I did consider that, but seeing as Repentance re-added that feature to the item I decided against it
            Cain players explaining how they're original even though they play the most boring and generic character in the game:
                Or maybe "cain mains when they don't get a golden chest on a floor."
                I disagree, Lucky foot leads to interesting plays and his eyepatch does have some interesting effects on his tears.

Definitely one of the most consistent characters though.
                this hurt my heart because i know it is true
    Cain mains resetting greedier mode for ten hours until they get a good item in the treasure room
counterpoint: judas has a fez, the lost doesnt even have a cool hat of any kind
    Ok yeah I'm convinced now thanks.
Every character
I hate spiders
I feel personally attacked.

Wish I was able to fit more in the edit but powerpuff girl theme is short
I mean i start evey eve run by almost killing myself. Tha dmg is just soo good.
    Yeah same, I try to get a devil deal to just get rid of that extra heart because its so easy to pick up red hearts and heal, undoing everything
        Yeah having her start with the razor is so much better. As when i play on a newer file without that unlocked. I always ruin it by picking up red health out of habit.
+
Bad trip actually can't kill Isaac. It turns into a full health pill as soon as you get down to one heart or less. Can definitely put you down to a half heart though.

Live fast die faster
    This is my motto from now on
    Judas run fast and died a virgin
        r/UnexpectedTF2
Apolion Bonaparte
Yeah, I literally got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room
    And that kids, is how I got Maggie's The Beast kill.
    How do you get an item from the sacrifice room?
        on the 6th or 7th try i think you're guaranteed an item

I dont know for sure though
            Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
                I believe the item is always an angel room item
    > got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room

:O
Never would have thought that giving her a Full Health pill would change the start of her playstyle so drastically.

Honestly Maggy and Bethany are some of my favourites now since I love all Angel Room items
    I also feel like angel rooms are way stronger. I got sacred heart once in 500 runs, but since repentance i got it 4 times
        True, Special items don't exist anymore, so you'll probably be seeing Sacred Heart/Godhead/Brimstone etc more often now
            I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
                I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
                    Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
                        Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                            Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
                        You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                            Welp, not looking forward to that lol
            Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
                Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
            What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
                No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
                Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
                    Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
                        ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
                    Huh, never knew that
            ... What
                They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
                    Oh my god that's incredible.
            That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
        Devils rooms also feel weaker post repentance which indirectly makes angel rooms even more appealing
        I'm pretty sure it's because Repentance changed how the dpecial items work, thus they are more likely to appear. But I might be wrong.
Repentance maggy is prob. My second favouritw character
getting wafer + scrificial floor on floor one is pretty POG
Maggy flippin sucks in the long run
    Now that she can start with full health pill she’s actually amazing you basically always have a 50/50 chance at an angel item on floor one
        How do you get an angel room on floor one?
            Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
                It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
            Sacrifice rooms
                Ah
    Until you buy the holy Potato Peeler.
        That's other history
    Nice profile pic. r/enterthegungeon
Idk how to get tainted stuff
    Not sure if it’s considered a spoiler or not, but it’s tied to one of the two new bosses they added on Repetence. Not sure how much I can reveal in this post since it’s not flaired for repetence content.
How do you get tainted characters
    When you get to home, use the Red Key or the Cracked Key in the corridor to the left of Mom's TV room. This can only be done BEFORE you sleep in Mom's bed.
Which Tainted character you get depends on what character your playing as when you unlock them.
While getting Red Key is just RNG, you can get a Cracked Key by leaving a trinket on the ground, then coming back later during the ascension scene to pick it up.
        Ok so: never gotten to home, never seen the red key, and don’t know what the ascension scene is
            Um, how far into the game are you?
                I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance
That’s awesome
Honestly it does, 1 free hit every room is quite op if you think about it. I'm no lost main, but in alt floors I sometimes transform into the lost to avoid red heart damage. Unless it is dross, cause Colostomia and Turdlet are the freaking worst.
    Fuck Dross. All my homies hate Dross.

                    Good bot
    I like to do the boss rooms twice in Downpour/Dross 2 for the extra item, I've lost a few runs there but it's only the 2nd/3rd floor of the game
    Turdlet is easy wdym
        Dude how tf am I supposed to avoid that mach 5 spin attack when it takes up the entire screen?
        I don’t fight it enough, cause it’s not a common encounter. Where does it actually aim towards anyway
I actually believe that Lost was one of the most permissive character to main. Guaranteed deals in floor 2 is huge
Well good thing that (SPOILERS): >!Tainted Lost exists now for all of your masochistic needs!<
    >!I have do to it AGAIN?!<
        >!Yep, have fun!!<
        yes, and not only that, >!but the blost cannot find any items that would give him a second chance. holy cards spawn more often for him, and he starts with one, but he cannot find the mantle, dead cat, etc. The only extra lives he can find are Birthright which is +1 life for him with a huge damage effect on respawn, and Missing Poster, oddly.!<

>!his UPSIDE is that he cannot find any items that he cannot use. items that are primarily health/healing, flight, spectral, self-damaging, on hit effects, or anything that might be a net downgrade like Stompy, will not actually appear as him. Additionally, any item with a quality of 2 or lower, like Brother Bobby for example, has a 20% chance to be automatically rerolled by Blost. (platgod has quality listed for each item)!<
            So a true glass cannon character?
                yeah.
    I've had tons of fun on Tainted Lost to be honest. >!The base damage and upgraded item pools make it so hardly any run is a bad run, so I don't have to hold R until a good item pops up. It's the real die-and-retry mode in Isaac. Almost feels like I'm playing Cuphead, seeing how fast I can get back into the game after a loss (I'm at like 200 tries, probably three quarters are deaths before Necropolis, the others are godlike and of course I die in Gehenna going back up after Mom's fight -\_- )!<
        I was not looking forward to playing him, but this makes me slightly less anxious about having to do so, haha.
        Gehenna can eat my dick honestly
            I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
    >!I love it, his pools are better and the extra damage at the start is nice!<
as someone who is playing on console before repentance.. is there any other difference to the lost other than the D4 and the eternal D6? I don’t have the lost unlocked yet but eventually i’ll get there.
    holy mantle can't be rerolled with for example d4 and dice rooms with d4
        epic i mean it makes sense bc you go thru the trouble of making sure the lost starts with it... I understand both sides of the coin
            also 9 lives can be rerolled now
                I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
    Starting with eternal D6 is a huge buff to go with already having automatic flight and spectral tears.
        He didn't always have spectral tears
    The Lost's Holy Mantle is no longer an item he starts with, but a direct upgrade to the character himself once unlocked. It is completely baked in.

This means if you were to turn into the lost, for reasons like dying while holding Missing Poster, using the Clicker, or potential other ways that Repentance may add, you will have the Holy Mantle so long as you keep being the Lost. This also makes Missing Poster an actually valid respawn item now.

Additionally, the Lost cannot lose the Holy Mantle due to a full run reroll, the Clicker's item removal, a victory lap's item confiscation, etc.

As another change, Repentance has nerfed the Lost so that he can only buy 1 item from each individual deal, as the rest will disappear if he purchases one.

However, Lost also recieved an indirect buff in the form of the Perfection trinket. If you no hit 3 bosses in a row, Perfection will spawn, which will give you +10 luck until you get hit. The Holy Mantle does not count as getting hit. So the lost will always get this and keep it, unless you get an extra life and promptly lose it. And I think (but im not sure) that the Eternal D6 is less likely to delete items based on your luck stat, too.
        Eternal D6 has a 50% chance to poof the item at 0 Luck, and scales all the way down to a 5% chance at 10 Luck.

        THANK YOU!!!
YOU ALL ARE BABIES!

-heavy
Precisely why I made sure to get all his marks before afterbirth + (or whichever dlc came after his release)
    he were avalible in base game, but with afterbirth he is much easier to unlock
        Easier yes... but it's based soley on RNG since afterbirth. Which I argue makes unlocking lost much more infuriating.

Example: On my xbone I unlocked Lost relatively quickly once Missing Poster was unlocked. However when I bought my PC 2 years ago, I put MAJOR hours into BOI and unlocked The Lost LITERALLY LAST MONTH! I tried everything to up my chances of getting the missing poster (mom's trinket box etc.). 

I did all because The Lost is my favorite character by far, also im a masochist.
            Why not just shop break?
                Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
Honestly, I love The Lost now. I played him a fair bit even before getting Holy Mantle, and now I think he's great. He was my first >!Beast!< kill. >!Tainted Lost!< is even more rewarding, but I'm not quite good enough with him to actually accomplish anything good
I got downvoted so hard recently for saying that my preferred rebalance was to replace Holy Mantle with Breath of Life.
    How the fuck does breath of life even work? Ive been playing since flash and I still gave up on trying to use that item ever.
        The charge bar on Breath of Life ticks down. Release and it recharges. Right when it hits zero charge, you get I-frames. Hold it any longer and it hurts you. Not much use for combat, but great for getting through curse doors and playing blood machines. Just takes skill to use.
            That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
            Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
Oh thank god, I thought I was the only one who thought the same

Lost was high risk high reward, and it was great. Afterbirth buffed lost a lot with holy mantle, but it was kinda fair. But repentance just made it more balanced. A lot less risk and a lot less reward, it sucks.
He has always been Elder God-tier with a first floor Swallowed Penny. Now he's unstoppable.
    The only thing that bothered me with keeper was his low speed, now he's faster and harder to kill, so that's nice
        Yeah, now everybody loves keeper, when I tried defending him in AB+ I had like -200 karma, bah I even explained how OP would Keeper be with 3 Coin slots, no one belived, who laughs now?
            I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.
I mean he has a lot of desirable qualities. High starting damage and speed, free gold chests, and the eyepatch which makes his tears more consistent, all at the cost of 1 red heart.
    And on top of that you can't get negative pills
        But that's a rep buff
            Did they give him PhD back in repentance?
                Yes. Flash Lucky Foot is back
                    Great news, love playing as Cain!
                    Wait, how do I get the PHD for Cain?
                        The item Cain starts with, Lucky Foot, was buffed and now turns all stats down pills into stats up
                he doesn't know what the pills do, but can only get good ones.
    Wait can u explain why the eye patch makes tears more consistent
        When you fire tears, they alternate between the eyes. Since cain only has 1 eye, there's no alternating, which makes the shots more consistant. This also has an effect on some items which I cant remember off the top of my head.
            Blood clot
Cain for me always seems to have a broken run. I don’t know what it is but I don’t think it is the luck element playing into it
    I had +10 Luck and Birds Eye which resulted in crazy constant damage. All my tears were high damage fire.
Whoever I don’t have stamps for because I was indoctrinated to thinking like that by my friend
    Assume you have all the completion marks and that you had to do a run. Which character would you pick? 

Inb4 “I wouldn’t be playing if I had all the marks”
        ...azazel...
I suck at the game and he has flight and small brimstone with the highest starting damage so I hav the most fun with him if I were to casually play
        Isaac. Classic and well rounded, the D6 is good shit too.

Bethany if I want an insta-win though, holy shit is she good.
            Could you give me some Bethany tips? I just lose her wisps nearly instantly and other than that she doesn't do much for me.
                Well the key to never losing with Beth is to take it slow, spend time dodging to minimise wisp loss. Then get lucky with a great active item haha. I'm not very good at the game I can't give many tips haha.
                the reason the basic  wisps are so hard to keep is because they’re in the second ring, so they’re somewhat far away from you. Getting an active item that spawns the wisps in the first ring closest to her will make it much easier to keep them alive. Check the wiki book of virtues tab for which items are first ring. Also active items with only one room cooldowns, like guppies head and wooden nickel will allow you to build up a great amount of wisps, even if they are being destroyed.
        That would be the random button. How does that work with tainted chars? I haven't had a chance to unlock any yet
            Tainted chars are a separate page, which means you have to swap to the Tainted page to choose a random Tainted character, no normal characters

Clicker works the same as far as I know, if you play a normal character you can't swap to tainteds because it's a different page and vice versa
        Whatever character I feel I could get the remaining achievements with.
        I mena even after you do the marks, you can do all the challenges and get all items
            Idk how else to phrase it, but I didn’t mean this question as a “hehe be as semantic as possible”. I thought it was pretty clear I just meant “who is your favorite character to play as independent of any achievements”
        In Antibirth, pretty much always The Lost.
        Random
My main is Challenge 45.
Mine is eden. Which basically is random random lmao.
    You should take it a step further with the tainted one for even more random.
        Haha yea but it’s a little too random for me
Me too dude lmao I always played on xbox now I need to unlock everything again on pc bc of repentance, so I just random everytime bc they all need unlocks, plus that's how I did it on console anyway 😂
Good luck getting it every run now :V
Judas is my go-to as well, having really solid damage right off the bat is just so valuable.
All I need is the hard mode Mega Satan mark for The Lost. It’s been so painful
honestly Azazel is probably the most fun character in general, at least for me. Apollyon gets an honorable mention
    I kind of took a sabbatical from TBoI after Afterbirth came around and I finished all hard mode check marks, never learned Apollyon (Or the Forgotten) so I’m only now getting up to speed with them.

Can’t seem to figure out when to use Void. It implies that you want to use it on active items, but since so many of them do different things, and you have to use an active charge to absorb the item that typically drops after the big battle where you would like to use Void offensively, it seems like the payoff never has an opportunity to, well, pay off.
        Use it to absorb shitty or inaccessible passives for stat upgrades.
    I had a surprisingly large amount of fun with Apollyon on a run recently and I may try to fill out his note (I'm sort of bad and the only character that i have more than 2 hard marks on is Azazel)
    Really? I find both of them to be sorta boring. For me Apollyon just feels way to weak at the start and ramps way to slow. And Azazel just feels too strong
Lilith is my favorite because I hate myself.  I'm so incredibly used to Incubus that I actually struggle playing any other character for the first few runs until I adapt back to it.  Derp.
    Have you unlocked Tainted Lilith yet? She's absurdly fun.
        My computer is broke and I can't afford to repair it so I don't have Repentance yet. 😩

The agony is unbearable.
He will be the first char i have everything completed. Just missing greedier and unlocking his tainted
What's fun about blue baby?
    Angel deal's baby
        Just for the appeal of angel rooms isn't Isaac better since you can reroll the key for an extra item?
            Adding to what the other person said, rerolling the key piece means you're giving up an item that gives you a better chance to find angel rooms in the future.
            But blue baby have guaranteed chance because he doesn't have red hearts
I also used to main Blue Baby. Never having to worry about losing devil deals/angel deals and always having polaroid, empty vessel, whore of babylon and crown of light active is fun. His slightly higher damage and speed are neat too
Keeper? What the fuck? You on crack?
    With the new dlc he's actually really good now.
        Oh yeah for sure, he's dope now, but it seems like it's been longer than repentance that they've mained him
            Reset until you get swallowed penny from pots

You're now almost immortal and can get plenty of rewards from the sacrifice room for basically free

That's how i played keeper in ab+, and it was great.

Killed lamb before the 6 minute mark with him
                Yeah but do you really have fun resetting until you're invincible?
                    I'll reset untill I get a decent item room, but man resetting till you get a specific trinket sounds awful.
                        It dropped very frequently from pots, so i'd just wal around in cellar and try to get it
    Yeah I really liked old keeper certinaly wasn't getting big win streaks on him but I felt like he struck a nice balance in rewarding good play and punishing bad play.
        I always thought Keeper with the Swallowed Penny was always a really fun character since you still got a chance to heal time but had to run for it so it presented a fair challenge
Does using book of rev when it's voided cause your bosses to become horsemen like it does it you use it normally? I usually don't take it, because a soulheart every ~6 rooms just isn't worth sacrificing half of your items for orbitals imo.
    Not 100% sure but I Voided it recently and never got a Horsemen. So I'd say it doesnt trigger them.
agreed, good meme. i've just seen other people use this term before and i thought it was strange.
All the characters are fun in different ways

Maggie when you want to do a very casual run with low risk

Cain when you wanna take pills and have better speed

Judas for the high damage

Eve for when you want to take every devil deal

Samson for casual high damage run (low stress Judas basically)

Blue baby/Lost/Keeper for challenge runs

Eden for almost limitless variety

Azazel for super casual runs

Forgotten for melee fun and neat synergies

Apollyon for probably the same reasons you would main Isaac.

Bethany for book of virtues synergy fun

Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist or you want a reason to go to the alt floors and a challenge.

Lazarus for casual run where you can die if you want and probably still win.

Lilith for either easy greed mode or familiar based runs.
    > Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist

I like micromanaging resources in runs, and a character who can have two cards, two trinkets and two active items by default (+more with Schoolbag, Mom's Purse, etc.) is right up my alley. The larger hitbox is a pain, and I think a valid buff would be them having the One Makes You Small pill effect by default, but I'm actually having quite a lot of fun even now. Definitely more than, e.g., Apollyon, whom I honestly still not quite able to wrap my head around.
        I'm starting to get better with him as well. I personally think that the buff should be a passive Options (2 boss items) on Isaac kill. Would help them get a bit stronger earlier and allow you to really play to their stat differences.

Apollyon isn't too hard imo, void low quality items like range ups, shot speed ups, etc and only void actives you think you'll actually want to use in the future. I do like his tainted version a lot more since it's a much harder decision to Abyss half decent items for more/better flies than to Void half decent items (ie you don't/shouldnt) with regular Apollyon. 

Also a trick with regular Apollyon is to go angel rooms so that if you get garbage you can potentially void up to 4 items at once and if not then you get something super strong anyway typically.
        Yo ya gonna love tainted lazarus
            I haven't unlocked him, but I think I know what he does, and it's pretty cool as well, but imo will be harder to manage (because of the flips).
    Forgotten is a bliss, it's  so fun to play with it and smash stuff
Cain, damage multiplier, never have key issues, all pills are positive
[deleted]
    How'd they nerf it? I haven't dived into her in repentance yet.
        [deleted]
            Well now I know that's not true because the one thing I've done with her since the dlc is a greed run, and I had like a dozen little assholes shooting around the room.
            This isn't true, not sure where you got your info from
                Strange, it looked like it in Hutts' runs
yeah i think it's just a different usage of the word really. in competitive games, your main is the character (weapon, etc) you use the most *for the purpose* of a competitive advantage over your opponent/the game, usually because you're the most experienced with their moveset. this concept doesn't really transfer over to isaac since all the characters play the same way.

in other games, characters play fundamentally differently from each other, with different controls and moves. even in games like smash with a relatively shared set of inputs across the whole roster you can't just use a ton of characters if you feel like it- you have to put at least a little bit of time into each one you intend to use. if i get done playing with mario and try doing the exact same set of inputs using luigi, i'll be playing an entirely different game. since all isaac characters fundamentally play the exact same way, with only variations in optimal strategy, you can't really "main" a character in isaac. a blue baby "main" plays the exact same game, the exact same way as a lost "main", who plays the exact same game as etc. it feels like a definitionally slippery application of an existing term when people could just say "favorite character" to better mean what they're trying to say.

ultimately this is, however, just semantics, and people can use whatever word they want. i just thought it was kinda funny.
    Yeah I suppose so, but personally I see main in a non fighting game context more than in fighting game contexts, largely due to to being more involved in non fighting games admittedly, but still very broadly in any game with a character choice.

And most non fighting game contexts are more comparable to the isaac meaning than the fighting game meaning. You're right that they're relatively different but IMO even then the sentiment is similar, even if the reason is different. 

I dunno that I'd say a blue baby plays the same as the lost, I mean same control scheme yes but some different strategies for sure. 

But yeah like I said, main exists in a non fighting game constant very well defined, this isn't just an isaac phenomenon, so if you want other games not using the term you kinda missed your window.

I suppose there is some merit in the idea that there's less point in games where you don't need to memorize movesets, but eh, people will gravitate to a specific character any time there's a choice, and favorite character isn't necessarily the same as what you play most even in a game like isaac (eg some people who like azazel best but feel guilt at the ease an thus don't, or just a favorite aesthetically who's not favorite in playstyle), plus just more of a hassle to say. Main on the other hand definitely means what you play the most.

Side note, in a non fighting game context, there's also things like mobas which kinda bridge the gap in 'mains', there's lots of proficiency to be gained in a given character, the competitive aspect you mentioned as well, but relatively more homogenized and simple control schemes. Honestly though, some characters in a given moba may be about as similar as the differences between isaac and forgotten.
        i get that it's commonly used to refer to one's most used character, i just think that it kinda loses some meaning when your most used character isn't any different than your least used character. i'm not really familiar with MOBAs, i played competitive smash for a bit so i know a little bit about fighting games which is why that's what i defaulted to haha. i think "main" can even work for something like monster hunter or shooting games where you choose a specific weapon to use. as long as those weapons play sizeably differently such that you can get a comparative advantage from putting time into one that you don't get from the other, it makes sense to call it a "main". i've spent 500 hours playing only piranha plant in smash and i'm a pretty good piranha plant player, but if i choose almost any other character i probably couldn't beat a CPU. those skill sets are only slightly transferable. if i spend 500 hours playing only as isaac, i can still pick up blue baby, eve, lilith, etc. having never used them before and still do just as well as long as i understand how their strategy works. because the characters in isaac (the forgotten and azazel excepted) are all just isaac with different stats and items, since you get those items and stats as you play, you have experience using those stats and items strategically even if the run didn't start with them. the fundamentals stay exactly the same, just the way you approach the game changes a bit.

for me, saying you "main" a character in isaac is like saying you "main" a G2 pen. sure, you might use a G2 more than any other pen, you might prefer it, and you might even only use that pen, but i can put any other pen, a pencil, or a marker in your hand and you'll be able to use it just as well. it's impossible to develop any meaningful comparative advantage in a game when the characters are all just variations of the same base model.

also, in other games, you get an advantage from devoting a lot of time to one weapon, character, etc. you develop skills with that weapon and become proficient with it. by contrast, in isaac, the game effectively requires that you use all the characters, not just for completion marks but for unlocking items that can then benefit other characters. it feels like all the characters are just different challenges and ways to play the game that should all be utilized for optimal enjoyment.
            > the forgotten and azazel excepted

>!and 7 other characters now!<

But yeah, relatively true, I get where you're coming from but personally I think they're different enough to be valid, isaac's on one end of a spectrum and fighting game characters are the other end, and there's a gradient in between really. 

I feel like it's worth noting there are plenty of fighting game players who practice a lot of different characters in their own right, and they may not reach your mastery with any, but once you've picked up five some things certainly do help with the 6th and so on, you still have to learn new movesets but it's not like nothing transfers there either. 

You could definitely easily beat me with your worst character and my best, lol. 

But yeah, all in all I certainly wouldn't argue isaac characters are as diverse as fighting game characters, but I don't think they're SO samey as to be an entirely invalid title. 

One thing I'll definitely give to you is you can't really have a main in isaac til after you've finished off your post its or decided you don't care, but hey, I played tons after finishing the post it note in the past, and will eventually get there again.

My optimal enjoyment is mostly just avoiding jacob & esau like the plague once I finish the last few things on the post it note :-) That said, personally I really like >!alt forgotten!< so far from this dlc and they're extremely different from other characters for example.
                oh yeah, the new tainted characters are so fucking cool. i really can't wait to try tainted cain. i'm also excited to try buffed out regular keeper. i enjoy the way keeper plays and the unique health management system, but it's so frustrating feeling doomed if you can't get swallowed penny or good stat buffs in the first level. the ability to accept more health and not lose devil deal % on hit anymore is huge.
random mains are the peak of humanity
    I am above Boss Armour. I am above Damage
Only true legends let **Fate** have even more control over the game’s outcome than normal. >!If only there was way to roll Tainted and normal characters from random outside of Co-op partners!<
100%. So versatile and so many cool strategies that are unique to him. Easily my favorite character in this game.
Cain players when they found out Lucky Foot doesn't give them OP pills anymore:
    I did consider that, but seeing as Repentance re-added that feature to the item I decided against it
        Cain players explaining how they're original even though they play the most boring and generic character in the game:
            Or maybe "cain mains when they don't get a golden chest on a floor."
            I disagree, Lucky foot leads to interesting plays and his eyepatch does have some interesting effects on his tears.

Definitely one of the most consistent characters though.
            this hurt my heart because i know it is true
Cain mains resetting greedier mode for ten hours until they get a good item in the treasure room
Ok yeah I'm convinced now thanks.
Yeah same, I try to get a devil deal to just get rid of that extra heart because its so easy to pick up red hearts and heal, undoing everything
    Yeah having her start with the razor is so much better. As when i play on a newer file without that unlocked. I always ruin it by picking up red health out of habit.
Ok, sure
This is my motto from now on
Judas run fast and died a virgin
    r/UnexpectedTF2
And that kids, is how I got Maggie's The Beast kill.
How do you get an item from the sacrifice room?
    on the 6th or 7th try i think you're guaranteed an item

I dont know for sure though
        Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
            I believe the item is always an angel room item
> got sacred heart with her on first floor via sacrifice room

:O
I also feel like angel rooms are way stronger. I got sacred heart once in 500 runs, but since repentance i got it 4 times
    True, Special items don't exist anymore, so you'll probably be seeing Sacred Heart/Godhead/Brimstone etc more often now
        I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
            I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
                Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
                    Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                        Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
                    You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                        Welp, not looking forward to that lol
        Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
            Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
        What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
            No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
            Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
                Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
                    ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
                Huh, never knew that
        ... What
            They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
                Oh my god that's incredible.
        That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
    Devils rooms also feel weaker post repentance which indirectly makes angel rooms even more appealing
    I'm pretty sure it's because Repentance changed how the dpecial items work, thus they are more likely to appear. But I might be wrong.
Now that she can start with full health pill she’s actually amazing you basically always have a 50/50 chance at an angel item on floor one
    How do you get an angel room on floor one?
        Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
            It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
        Sacrifice rooms
            Ah
Until you buy the holy Potato Peeler.
    That's other history
Nice profile pic. r/enterthegungeon
Not sure if it’s considered a spoiler or not, but it’s tied to one of the two new bosses they added on Repetence. Not sure how much I can reveal in this post since it’s not flaired for repetence content.
When you get to home, use the Red Key or the Cracked Key in the corridor to the left of Mom's TV room. This can only be done BEFORE you sleep in Mom's bed.
Which Tainted character you get depends on what character your playing as when you unlock them.
While getting Red Key is just RNG, you can get a Cracked Key by leaving a trinket on the ground, then coming back later during the ascension scene to pick it up.
    Ok so: never gotten to home, never seen the red key, and don’t know what the ascension scene is
        Um, how far into the game are you?
            I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance

I like to do the boss rooms twice in Downpour/Dross 2 for the extra item, I've lost a few runs there but it's only the 2nd/3rd floor of the game
Turdlet is easy wdym
    Dude how tf am I supposed to avoid that mach 5 spin attack when it takes up the entire screen?
    I don’t fight it enough, cause it’s not a common encounter. Where does it actually aim towards anyway
>!I have do to it AGAIN?!<
    >!Yep, have fun!!<
    yes, and not only that, >!but the blost cannot find any items that would give him a second chance. holy cards spawn more often for him, and he starts with one, but he cannot find the mantle, dead cat, etc. The only extra lives he can find are Birthright which is +1 life for him with a huge damage effect on respawn, and Missing Poster, oddly.!<

>!his UPSIDE is that he cannot find any items that he cannot use. items that are primarily health/healing, flight, spectral, self-damaging, on hit effects, or anything that might be a net downgrade like Stompy, will not actually appear as him. Additionally, any item with a quality of 2 or lower, like Brother Bobby for example, has a 20% chance to be automatically rerolled by Blost. (platgod has quality listed for each item)!<
        So a true glass cannon character?
            yeah.
I've had tons of fun on Tainted Lost to be honest. >!The base damage and upgraded item pools make it so hardly any run is a bad run, so I don't have to hold R until a good item pops up. It's the real die-and-retry mode in Isaac. Almost feels like I'm playing Cuphead, seeing how fast I can get back into the game after a loss (I'm at like 200 tries, probably three quarters are deaths before Necropolis, the others are godlike and of course I die in Gehenna going back up after Mom's fight -\_- )!<
    I was not looking forward to playing him, but this makes me slightly less anxious about having to do so, haha.
    Gehenna can eat my dick honestly
        I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
>!I love it, his pools are better and the extra damage at the start is nice!<
holy mantle can't be rerolled with for example d4 and dice rooms with d4
    epic i mean it makes sense bc you go thru the trouble of making sure the lost starts with it... I understand both sides of the coin
        also 9 lives can be rerolled now
            I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
Starting with eternal D6 is a huge buff to go with already having automatic flight and spectral tears.
    He didn't always have spectral tears
The Lost's Holy Mantle is no longer an item he starts with, but a direct upgrade to the character himself once unlocked. It is completely baked in.

This means if you were to turn into the lost, for reasons like dying while holding Missing Poster, using the Clicker, or potential other ways that Repentance may add, you will have the Holy Mantle so long as you keep being the Lost. This also makes Missing Poster an actually valid respawn item now.

Additionally, the Lost cannot lose the Holy Mantle due to a full run reroll, the Clicker's item removal, a victory lap's item confiscation, etc.

As another change, Repentance has nerfed the Lost so that he can only buy 1 item from each individual deal, as the rest will disappear if he purchases one.

However, Lost also recieved an indirect buff in the form of the Perfection trinket. If you no hit 3 bosses in a row, Perfection will spawn, which will give you +10 luck until you get hit. The Holy Mantle does not count as getting hit. So the lost will always get this and keep it, unless you get an extra life and promptly lose it. And I think (but im not sure) that the Eternal D6 is less likely to delete items based on your luck stat, too.
    Eternal D6 has a 50% chance to poof the item at 0 Luck, and scales all the way down to a 5% chance at 10 Luck.
        damb
    THANK YOU!!!
he were avalible in base game, but with afterbirth he is much easier to unlock
    Easier yes... but it's based soley on RNG since afterbirth. Which I argue makes unlocking lost much more infuriating.

Example: On my xbone I unlocked Lost relatively quickly once Missing Poster was unlocked. However when I bought my PC 2 years ago, I put MAJOR hours into BOI and unlocked The Lost LITERALLY LAST MONTH! I tried everything to up my chances of getting the missing poster (mom's trinket box etc.). 

I did all because The Lost is my favorite character by far, also im a masochist.
        Why not just shop break?
            Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
How the fuck does breath of life even work? Ive been playing since flash and I still gave up on trying to use that item ever.
    The charge bar on Breath of Life ticks down. Release and it recharges. Right when it hits zero charge, you get I-frames. Hold it any longer and it hurts you. Not much use for combat, but great for getting through curse doors and playing blood machines. Just takes skill to use.
        That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
        Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
The only thing that bothered me with keeper was his low speed, now he's faster and harder to kill, so that's nice
    Yeah, now everybody loves keeper, when I tried defending him in AB+ I had like -200 karma, bah I even explained how OP would Keeper be with 3 Coin slots, no one belived, who laughs now?
        I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.
And on top of that you can't get negative pills
    But that's a rep buff
        Did they give him PhD back in repentance?
            Yes. Flash Lucky Foot is back
                Great news, love playing as Cain!
                Wait, how do I get the PHD for Cain?
                    The item Cain starts with, Lucky Foot, was buffed and now turns all stats down pills into stats up
            he doesn't know what the pills do, but can only get good ones.
Wait can u explain why the eye patch makes tears more consistent
    When you fire tears, they alternate between the eyes. Since cain only has 1 eye, there's no alternating, which makes the shots more consistant. This also has an effect on some items which I cant remember off the top of my head.
        Blood clot
I had +10 Luck and Birds Eye which resulted in crazy constant damage. All my tears were high damage fire.
Assume you have all the completion marks and that you had to do a run. Which character would you pick? 

Inb4 “I wouldn’t be playing if I had all the marks”
    ...azazel...
I suck at the game and he has flight and small brimstone with the highest starting damage so I hav the most fun with him if I were to casually play
    Isaac. Classic and well rounded, the D6 is good shit too.

Bethany if I want an insta-win though, holy shit is she good.
        Could you give me some Bethany tips? I just lose her wisps nearly instantly and other than that she doesn't do much for me.
            Well the key to never losing with Beth is to take it slow, spend time dodging to minimise wisp loss. Then get lucky with a great active item haha. I'm not very good at the game I can't give many tips haha.
            the reason the basic  wisps are so hard to keep is because they’re in the second ring, so they’re somewhat far away from you. Getting an active item that spawns the wisps in the first ring closest to her will make it much easier to keep them alive. Check the wiki book of virtues tab for which items are first ring. Also active items with only one room cooldowns, like guppies head and wooden nickel will allow you to build up a great amount of wisps, even if they are being destroyed.
    That would be the random button. How does that work with tainted chars? I haven't had a chance to unlock any yet
        Tainted chars are a separate page, which means you have to swap to the Tainted page to choose a random Tainted character, no normal characters

Clicker works the same as far as I know, if you play a normal character you can't swap to tainteds because it's a different page and vice versa
    Whatever character I feel I could get the remaining achievements with.
    I mena even after you do the marks, you can do all the challenges and get all items
        Idk how else to phrase it, but I didn’t mean this question as a “hehe be as semantic as possible”. I thought it was pretty clear I just meant “who is your favorite character to play as independent of any achievements”
    In Antibirth, pretty much always The Lost.
    Random
You should take it a step further with the tainted one for even more random.
    Haha yea but it’s a little too random for me
I kind of took a sabbatical from TBoI after Afterbirth came around and I finished all hard mode check marks, never learned Apollyon (Or the Forgotten) so I’m only now getting up to speed with them.

Can’t seem to figure out when to use Void. It implies that you want to use it on active items, but since so many of them do different things, and you have to use an active charge to absorb the item that typically drops after the big battle where you would like to use Void offensively, it seems like the payoff never has an opportunity to, well, pay off.
    Use it to absorb shitty or inaccessible passives for stat upgrades.
I had a surprisingly large amount of fun with Apollyon on a run recently and I may try to fill out his note (I'm sort of bad and the only character that i have more than 2 hard marks on is Azazel)
Really? I find both of them to be sorta boring. For me Apollyon just feels way to weak at the start and ramps way to slow. And Azazel just feels too strong
Have you unlocked Tainted Lilith yet? She's absurdly fun.
    My computer is broke and I can't afford to repair it so I don't have Repentance yet. 😩

The agony is unbearable.
Angel deal's baby
    Just for the appeal of angel rooms isn't Isaac better since you can reroll the key for an extra item?
        Adding to what the other person said, rerolling the key piece means you're giving up an item that gives you a better chance to find angel rooms in the future.
        But blue baby have guaranteed chance because he doesn't have red hearts
With the new dlc he's actually really good now.
    Oh yeah for sure, he's dope now, but it seems like it's been longer than repentance that they've mained him
        Reset until you get swallowed penny from pots

You're now almost immortal and can get plenty of rewards from the sacrifice room for basically free

That's how i played keeper in ab+, and it was great.

Killed lamb before the 6 minute mark with him
            Yeah but do you really have fun resetting until you're invincible?
                I'll reset untill I get a decent item room, but man resetting till you get a specific trinket sounds awful.
                    It dropped very frequently from pots, so i'd just wal around in cellar and try to get it
Yeah I really liked old keeper certinaly wasn't getting big win streaks on him but I felt like he struck a nice balance in rewarding good play and punishing bad play.
    I always thought Keeper with the Swallowed Penny was always a really fun character since you still got a chance to heal time but had to run for it so it presented a fair challenge
Not 100% sure but I Voided it recently and never got a Horsemen. So I'd say it doesnt trigger them.
> Jacob and Esau if you are a masochist

I like micromanaging resources in runs, and a character who can have two cards, two trinkets and two active items by default (+more with Schoolbag, Mom's Purse, etc.) is right up my alley. The larger hitbox is a pain, and I think a valid buff would be them having the One Makes You Small pill effect by default, but I'm actually having quite a lot of fun even now. Definitely more than, e.g., Apollyon, whom I honestly still not quite able to wrap my head around.
    I'm starting to get better with him as well. I personally think that the buff should be a passive Options (2 boss items) on Isaac kill. Would help them get a bit stronger earlier and allow you to really play to their stat differences.

Apollyon isn't too hard imo, void low quality items like range ups, shot speed ups, etc and only void actives you think you'll actually want to use in the future. I do like his tainted version a lot more since it's a much harder decision to Abyss half decent items for more/better flies than to Void half decent items (ie you don't/shouldnt) with regular Apollyon. 

Also a trick with regular Apollyon is to go angel rooms so that if you get garbage you can potentially void up to 4 items at once and if not then you get something super strong anyway typically.
    Yo ya gonna love tainted lazarus
        I haven't unlocked him, but I think I know what he does, and it's pretty cool as well, but imo will be harder to manage (because of the flips).
Forgotten is a bliss, it's  so fun to play with it and smash stuff
How'd they nerf it? I haven't dived into her in repentance yet.
    [deleted]
        Well now I know that's not true because the one thing I've done with her since the dlc is a greed run, and I had like a dozen little assholes shooting around the room.
        This isn't true, not sure where you got your info from
            Strange, it looked like it in Hutts' runs
Yeah I suppose so, but personally I see main in a non fighting game context more than in fighting game contexts, largely due to to being more involved in non fighting games admittedly, but still very broadly in any game with a character choice.

And most non fighting game contexts are more comparable to the isaac meaning than the fighting game meaning. You're right that they're relatively different but IMO even then the sentiment is similar, even if the reason is different. 

I dunno that I'd say a blue baby plays the same as the lost, I mean same control scheme yes but some different strategies for sure. 

But yeah like I said, main exists in a non fighting game constant very well defined, this isn't just an isaac phenomenon, so if you want other games not using the term you kinda missed your window.

I suppose there is some merit in the idea that there's less point in games where you don't need to memorize movesets, but eh, people will gravitate to a specific character any time there's a choice, and favorite character isn't necessarily the same as what you play most even in a game like isaac (eg some people who like azazel best but feel guilt at the ease an thus don't, or just a favorite aesthetically who's not favorite in playstyle), plus just more of a hassle to say. Main on the other hand definitely means what you play the most.

Side note, in a non fighting game context, there's also things like mobas which kinda bridge the gap in 'mains', there's lots of proficiency to be gained in a given character, the competitive aspect you mentioned as well, but relatively more homogenized and simple control schemes. Honestly though, some characters in a given moba may be about as similar as the differences between isaac and forgotten.
    i get that it's commonly used to refer to one's most used character, i just think that it kinda loses some meaning when your most used character isn't any different than your least used character. i'm not really familiar with MOBAs, i played competitive smash for a bit so i know a little bit about fighting games which is why that's what i defaulted to haha. i think "main" can even work for something like monster hunter or shooting games where you choose a specific weapon to use. as long as those weapons play sizeably differently such that you can get a comparative advantage from putting time into one that you don't get from the other, it makes sense to call it a "main". i've spent 500 hours playing only piranha plant in smash and i'm a pretty good piranha plant player, but if i choose almost any other character i probably couldn't beat a CPU. those skill sets are only slightly transferable. if i spend 500 hours playing only as isaac, i can still pick up blue baby, eve, lilith, etc. having never used them before and still do just as well as long as i understand how their strategy works. because the characters in isaac (the forgotten and azazel excepted) are all just isaac with different stats and items, since you get those items and stats as you play, you have experience using those stats and items strategically even if the run didn't start with them. the fundamentals stay exactly the same, just the way you approach the game changes a bit.

for me, saying you "main" a character in isaac is like saying you "main" a G2 pen. sure, you might use a G2 more than any other pen, you might prefer it, and you might even only use that pen, but i can put any other pen, a pencil, or a marker in your hand and you'll be able to use it just as well. it's impossible to develop any meaningful comparative advantage in a game when the characters are all just variations of the same base model.

also, in other games, you get an advantage from devoting a lot of time to one weapon, character, etc. you develop skills with that weapon and become proficient with it. by contrast, in isaac, the game effectively requires that you use all the characters, not just for completion marks but for unlocking items that can then benefit other characters. it feels like all the characters are just different challenges and ways to play the game that should all be utilized for optimal enjoyment.
        > the forgotten and azazel excepted

>!and 7 other characters now!<

But yeah, relatively true, I get where you're coming from but personally I think they're different enough to be valid, isaac's on one end of a spectrum and fighting game characters are the other end, and there's a gradient in between really. 

I feel like it's worth noting there are plenty of fighting game players who practice a lot of different characters in their own right, and they may not reach your mastery with any, but once you've picked up five some things certainly do help with the 6th and so on, you still have to learn new movesets but it's not like nothing transfers there either. 

You could definitely easily beat me with your worst character and my best, lol. 

But yeah, all in all I certainly wouldn't argue isaac characters are as diverse as fighting game characters, but I don't think they're SO samey as to be an entirely invalid title. 

One thing I'll definitely give to you is you can't really have a main in isaac til after you've finished off your post its or decided you don't care, but hey, I played tons after finishing the post it note in the past, and will eventually get there again.

My optimal enjoyment is mostly just avoiding jacob & esau like the plague once I finish the last few things on the post it note :-) That said, personally I really like >!alt forgotten!< so far from this dlc and they're extremely different from other characters for example.
            oh yeah, the new tainted characters are so fucking cool. i really can't wait to try tainted cain. i'm also excited to try buffed out regular keeper. i enjoy the way keeper plays and the unique health management system, but it's so frustrating feeling doomed if you can't get swallowed penny or good stat buffs in the first level. the ability to accept more health and not lose devil deal % on hit anymore is huge.
I am above Boss Armour. I am above Damage
I did consider that, but seeing as Repentance re-added that feature to the item I decided against it
    Cain players explaining how they're original even though they play the most boring and generic character in the game:
        Or maybe "cain mains when they don't get a golden chest on a floor."
        I disagree, Lucky foot leads to interesting plays and his eyepatch does have some interesting effects on his tears.

Definitely one of the most consistent characters though.
        this hurt my heart because i know it is true
Yeah having her start with the razor is so much better. As when i play on a newer file without that unlocked. I always ruin it by picking up red health out of habit.
r/UnexpectedTF2
on the 6th or 7th try i think you're guaranteed an item

I dont know for sure though
    Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
        I believe the item is always an angel room item
True, Special items don't exist anymore, so you'll probably be seeing Sacred Heart/Godhead/Brimstone etc more often now
    I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
        I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
            Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
                Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                    Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
                You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                    Welp, not looking forward to that lol
    Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
        Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
    What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
        No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
        Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
            Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
                ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
            Huh, never knew that
    ... What
        They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
            Oh my god that's incredible.
    That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
Devils rooms also feel weaker post repentance which indirectly makes angel rooms even more appealing
I'm pretty sure it's because Repentance changed how the dpecial items work, thus they are more likely to appear. But I might be wrong.
How do you get an angel room on floor one?
    Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
        It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
    Sacrifice rooms
        Ah
That's other history
Ok so: never gotten to home, never seen the red key, and don’t know what the ascension scene is
    Um, how far into the game are you?
        I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance

Dude how tf am I supposed to avoid that mach 5 spin attack when it takes up the entire screen?
I don’t fight it enough, cause it’s not a common encounter. Where does it actually aim towards anyway
>!Yep, have fun!!<
yes, and not only that, >!but the blost cannot find any items that would give him a second chance. holy cards spawn more often for him, and he starts with one, but he cannot find the mantle, dead cat, etc. The only extra lives he can find are Birthright which is +1 life for him with a huge damage effect on respawn, and Missing Poster, oddly.!<

>!his UPSIDE is that he cannot find any items that he cannot use. items that are primarily health/healing, flight, spectral, self-damaging, on hit effects, or anything that might be a net downgrade like Stompy, will not actually appear as him. Additionally, any item with a quality of 2 or lower, like Brother Bobby for example, has a 20% chance to be automatically rerolled by Blost. (platgod has quality listed for each item)!<
    So a true glass cannon character?
        yeah.
I was not looking forward to playing him, but this makes me slightly less anxious about having to do so, haha.
Gehenna can eat my dick honestly
    I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
epic i mean it makes sense bc you go thru the trouble of making sure the lost starts with it... I understand both sides of the coin
    also 9 lives can be rerolled now
        I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
He didn't always have spectral tears
Eternal D6 has a 50% chance to poof the item at 0 Luck, and scales all the way down to a 5% chance at 10 Luck.
    damb
THANK YOU!!!
Easier yes... but it's based soley on RNG since afterbirth. Which I argue makes unlocking lost much more infuriating.

Example: On my xbone I unlocked Lost relatively quickly once Missing Poster was unlocked. However when I bought my PC 2 years ago, I put MAJOR hours into BOI and unlocked The Lost LITERALLY LAST MONTH! I tried everything to up my chances of getting the missing poster (mom's trinket box etc.). 

I did all because The Lost is my favorite character by far, also im a masochist.
    Why not just shop break?
        Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
The charge bar on Breath of Life ticks down. Release and it recharges. Right when it hits zero charge, you get I-frames. Hold it any longer and it hurts you. Not much use for combat, but great for getting through curse doors and playing blood machines. Just takes skill to use.
    That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
    Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
Yeah, now everybody loves keeper, when I tried defending him in AB+ I had like -200 karma, bah I even explained how OP would Keeper be with 3 Coin slots, no one belived, who laughs now?
    I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.

i get that it's commonly used to refer to one's most used character, i just think that it kinda loses some meaning when your most used character isn't any different than your least used character. i'm not really familiar with MOBAs, i played competitive smash for a bit so i know a little bit about fighting games which is why that's what i defaulted to haha. i think "main" can even work for something like monster hunter or shooting games where you choose a specific weapon to use. as long as those weapons play sizeably differently such that you can get a comparative advantage from putting time into one that you don't get from the other, it makes sense to call it a "main". i've spent 500 hours playing only piranha plant in smash and i'm a pretty good piranha plant player, but if i choose almost any other character i probably couldn't beat a CPU. those skill sets are only slightly transferable. if i spend 500 hours playing only as isaac, i can still pick up blue baby, eve, lilith, etc. having never used them before and still do just as well as long as i understand how their strategy works. because the characters in isaac (the forgotten and azazel excepted) are all just isaac with different stats and items, since you get those items and stats as you play, you have experience using those stats and items strategically even if the run didn't start with them. the fundamentals stay exactly the same, just the way you approach the game changes a bit.

for me, saying you "main" a character in isaac is like saying you "main" a G2 pen. sure, you might use a G2 more than any other pen, you might prefer it, and you might even only use that pen, but i can put any other pen, a pencil, or a marker in your hand and you'll be able to use it just as well. it's impossible to develop any meaningful comparative advantage in a game when the characters are all just variations of the same base model.

also, in other games, you get an advantage from devoting a lot of time to one weapon, character, etc. you develop skills with that weapon and become proficient with it. by contrast, in isaac, the game effectively requires that you use all the characters, not just for completion marks but for unlocking items that can then benefit other characters. it feels like all the characters are just different challenges and ways to play the game that should all be utilized for optimal enjoyment.
    > the forgotten and azazel excepted

>!and 7 other characters now!<

But yeah, relatively true, I get where you're coming from but personally I think they're different enough to be valid, isaac's on one end of a spectrum and fighting game characters are the other end, and there's a gradient in between really. 

I feel like it's worth noting there are plenty of fighting game players who practice a lot of different characters in their own right, and they may not reach your mastery with any, but once you've picked up five some things certainly do help with the 6th and so on, you still have to learn new movesets but it's not like nothing transfers there either. 

You could definitely easily beat me with your worst character and my best, lol. 

But yeah, all in all I certainly wouldn't argue isaac characters are as diverse as fighting game characters, but I don't think they're SO samey as to be an entirely invalid title. 

One thing I'll definitely give to you is you can't really have a main in isaac til after you've finished off your post its or decided you don't care, but hey, I played tons after finishing the post it note in the past, and will eventually get there again.

My optimal enjoyment is mostly just avoiding jacob & esau like the plague once I finish the last few things on the post it note :-) That said, personally I really like >!alt forgotten!< so far from this dlc and they're extremely different from other characters for example.
        oh yeah, the new tainted characters are so fucking cool. i really can't wait to try tainted cain. i'm also excited to try buffed out regular keeper. i enjoy the way keeper plays and the unique health management system, but it's so frustrating feeling doomed if you can't get swallowed penny or good stat buffs in the first level. the ability to accept more health and not lose devil deal % on hit anymore is huge.
Cain players explaining how they're original even though they play the most boring and generic character in the game:
    Or maybe "cain mains when they don't get a golden chest on a floor."
    I disagree, Lucky foot leads to interesting plays and his eyepatch does have some interesting effects on his tears.

Definitely one of the most consistent characters though.
    this hurt my heart because i know it is true
Yeah I tried yesterday and got a habit, but sacred heart is a damn good find
    I believe the item is always an angel room item
I started my file all over again for repentance. I think I won't be seeing Godhead for a while
    I hadn't unlocked it on my main file before repentance, so it's gonna be a while for me too lol
        Do you need to do all the post it note bits as The Lost or just the ones that were around for Rebirth?
            Great question, I have no idea. I do know that when Delirium was added to the game he became a requirement. If you had unlocked Godhead beforehand, then you still had it of course, but if you hadn't done it yet then Delirium was now mandatory instead of just Mega Satan and the rest. It may be the same case with Repentance where you now have to beat >!Mother!< and >!The Beast!< as well, but I don't know for sure.
                Yeah I got Godhead in Rebirth and haven't touched the Lost since, so all the stuff added after I'm more than a little worried about lol
            You need every single one now. Had to do it on a new savefile and it was painful as heck lol
                Welp, not looking forward to that lol
Oh wow, that explains how I got 20/20, inner eye, quad shot, polyphemus all at once I guess
    Yeh, Polyphemus and Mutant Spider were both special items so the chances of getting them together was lower than normal.
What does that mean? "special items don't exist anymore" are they not locked to Angel rooms now?
    No, the thing is before, you would get one special item and you had a veeeeery small chance of seeing another, but now that doesn't exist anymore do you can have a bunch of really good items.
    Basically some items were marked as special and if you have seen one in a run the chances of another appearing on the same run were incredibly small. Now that system is removed so there's nothing stopping multiple special items from appearing on the same run.

Mutant spider for example was a special item. Pretty sure the D6 was too.
        Correct, I think the special item list was something like: 

Brimstone, D100, D6, Dr. Fetus, Epic Fetus, Godhead, Lil Brimstone, Ludovico Technique, Mom's Knife, Mutant Spider, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac, and Sacred Heart. 

And for pre DLCs I think The Stopwatch and Soy Milk were also considered special items.

Basically they were all items the devs considered unique/stronger than normal.
            ... I can't believe soy milk was on there at any point lmao

Glad that change was quick
        Huh, never knew that
... What
    They removed the 'special item' tag on all special items like Brimstone/Godhead/Sacred Heart so you're more likely to see multiple special items in a run since special item classification isn't a thing. 

Now items are weighted, with most items having a weight of 1. This means almost every item has an equal opportunity to show up. There are only a small amount of items that don't have a weight of 1. For example Mega Blast has a 0.2 weight which basically just means it has an 80% less chance to show up in a given run.
        Oh my god that's incredible.
That reminds me, on my second rep run on a new save file I got quad shot brimstone, and got brimstone first floor thanks to the joker card on my next run

Fun times
Sacrifice room has a chance to, among other things, take you there or spawn a pedestal from that item pool after like 6 or so sacrifices. Which is doable literally every game with Maggy if she has the full health pill
    It’s nice, but not having to start at .85 speed was also pretty nice.
Sacrifice rooms
    Ah
Um, how far into the game are you?
    I just haven’t killed corpse mom, done everything else


Edit: everything else pre repentance

So a true glass cannon character?
    yeah.
I'd rather not but

&#x200B;

yes 🐇
also 9 lives can be rerolled now
    I’m pretty sure I knew this, along with rolling into transformations doesn’t actually keep them
damb
Why not just shop break?
    Tried it all. I did blank card jera, d20, d4 battery farm. I never got lucky enough to get a trinket item in shop with any of my breaks. Trust me when I say, I tried everything.
That was my impression but I still was never able to use it to any meaningful extent. Its just a waste of a pedestal to me at this point.
Ah, that's my issue with it then. I have no skill.
I think AB+ Keeper was fine minus his horrible speed. That was really the only buff he needed, instead he got a huge buff.
Did they give him PhD back in repentance?
    Yes. Flash Lucky Foot is back
        Great news, love playing as Cain!
        Wait, how do I get the PHD for Cain?
            The item Cain starts with, Lucky Foot, was buffed and now turns all stats down pills into stats up
    he doesn't know what the pills do, but can only get good ones.
Blood clot
Could you give me some Bethany tips? I just lose her wisps nearly instantly and other than that she doesn't do much for me.
    Well the key to never losing with Beth is to take it slow, spend time dodging to minimise wisp loss. Then get lucky with a great active item haha. I'm not very good at the game I can't give many tips haha.
    the reason the basic  wisps are so hard to keep is because they’re in the second ring, so they’re somewhat far away from you. Getting an active item that spawns the wisps in the first ring closest to her will make it much easier to keep them alive. Check the wiki book of virtues tab for which items are first ring. Also active items with only one room cooldowns, like guppies head and wooden nickel will allow you to build up a great amount of wisps, even if they are being destroyed.
Tainted chars are a separate page, which means you have to swap to the Tainted page to choose a random Tainted character, no normal characters

Clicker works the same as far as I know, if you play a normal character you can't swap to tainteds because it's a different page and vice versa
Idk how else to phrase it, but I didn’t mean this question as a “hehe be as semantic as possible”. I thought it was pretty clear I just meant “who is your favorite character to play as independent of any achievements”
Adding to what the other person said, rerolling the key piece means you're giving up an item that gives you a better chance to find angel rooms in the future.
But blue baby have guaranteed chance because he doesn't have red hearts
Reset until you get swallowed penny from pots

You're now almost immortal and can get plenty of rewards from the sacrifice room for basically free

That's how i played keeper in ab+, and it was great.

Killed lamb before the 6 minute mark with him
    Yeah but do you really have fun resetting until you're invincible?
        I'll reset untill I get a decent item room, but man resetting till you get a specific trinket sounds awful.
            It dropped very frequently from pots, so i'd just wal around in cellar and try to get it
I haven't unlocked him, but I think I know what he does, and it's pretty cool as well, but imo will be harder to manage (because of the flips).
Well now I know that's not true because the one thing I've done with her since the dlc is a greed run, and I had like a dozen little assholes shooting around the room.
This isn't true, not sure where you got your info from
    Strange, it looked like it in Hutts' runs
