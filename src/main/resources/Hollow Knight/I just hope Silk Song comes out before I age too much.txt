[[I just hope Silk Song comes out before I age too much]]


I am 30 years old and my gaming skills aren't what they used to be.I stopped playing FPS because I couldn't keep up my reflexes with the young ones.

Even with the Hollow Knight, I was only able to do 111% and that took a looooong time.

112%? Pantheon with bindings? Those are now impossible for me.

&#x200B;

If Silksong comes out too late, I feel like I won't be able to play due to my aging curve ... hope they release a difficulty changer with it.


Dude I‚Äôm 42 and I‚Äôm currently 111% going for 112% today, age is just a number you got this!
    Late fourties‚Ä¶ 107% iirc? Need to practice more on the pantheons and trial of the fool, but they‚Äôre not out of reach.
    Keep at it! I‚Äôll be 43 soon, and I just got the Platinum trophy not to long ago on ps5
    >age is just a number

don't say this in the court btw
        Jail is just a room¬†
    39. I stopped at 111% üò≠
Dude what? I'm 30 too and we are way too young to be having this conversation
    Seriously, I'm 27 so a few years off of 30, but I'm playing harder games and I'm generally better than anything I played than when I was a teenager. I think OP will be fine with some practice
    Fr, I swear people hit their physical peak at around 30 lmao
        Rethink what that means! You're on the decline after. 

I'm kidding but I kind of agree with OP. 

I got hollow knight for ps4 on release, 5 years ago. 

I played for hours and got to 106% in a few sittings. 

I replayed it from the start and I'm aiming for 112%, I'm currently at 107%. 

It's taken me like 3 weeks with work and life, one night I played for 40 minutes and it made me so sad. I fucked up the coliseum a few times and just had to go to bed feeling like a loser because I had work in the morning. 

Nightmare grimm seems impossible, the pantheons seem impossible. I'll do them, but I remember when I was just good at all games all the time.
            That feeling has everything to do with how we're treated at a "workplace" and nothing related to who we are. It's dehumanizing.
OMG, you‚Äôre 30. üò≠

I‚Äôm 42, and while my reflexes and hands aren‚Äôt as fast as they used to be, I still play almost entirely Metroidvanias. Eventually I learned to recognized that no, maybe I didn‚Äôt need to complete every boss rush, and my life became a lot less frustration filled.
    Do you really feel a decay in your capabilities or is it more of a time/commitment type of problem? Having families and responsibilities doesn‚Äôt give you as much time than if you were 14 and gaming 27 hours a day.
        I'm 31 and I was never really good at videogames, achieving 109% on HK is probably my biggest achievement (along with beating Farewell in Celeste I guess). While I don't really feel any decay in my abilities, I do feel like modern games can be visually overwhelming, like I'm a bit sensitive to crazy particles effects, I believe more so than  20-something people that were exposed to screens earlier than me. 

Maybe it's just my brain though, 30 is definitely not super old when it comes to playing games!
            Farewell is harder than Path of Pain, and for me, P5, too (I've done both to testify). I've only gotten through the first half of farewell so far.
                Farewell was absolutely horrible, aha, I hated the game by the time I got to the finish line and only beat it like 4 years after buying the game. I'm still glad I went for it but damn, some bits were NOT FUN at all. 

Congrats on beating P5, this looks insurmountable for me!
                    Well, you are clearly a skilled gamer to beat Farewell. You will definitely be able to get your 112% and more soon, bro.
                        Thanks for the kind words! üôåüèª
                            I beat p5 using mark of pride, long nail, quick focus and I think grub song. The plan was to just stay far away from anything that could hurt me. It did take 2 weeks of practicing PV and Markoth and Abs Rad until I could beat them 8/10 times in a row then I went for it. Took only 2 tries when I got consistent on those bosses.
        I'm 42, and I'd say it's a little bit of both for me. I just spent a lot of time trying to complete the Trial of the Fool. I did it, but there was a moment in the middle where I wondered if maybe it was beyond me due to my old man reflexes.

After I put my kids to bed I have a couple hours to play games before I get tired. So I was getting frustrated that i was spending all my me-time banging my head against the wall with that damn trial. I finally settled on giving it 3 attempts every night, and then stopping. And I got it within 4 days of doing that. 

It just takes a little more time and patience. I'm at 110% right now. We'll see if I feel the same way when I start Path of Pain, and Pantheon of Hallownest.
        I‚Äôm 39. Gaming is a skill, and with the passage of time, comes less time you have to either maintain or improve the skill. I play a variety of games, but my favorite are Metroidvania‚Äôs, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any decline in skill. I‚Äôm not trying to brag or anything, but I don‚Äôt feel any sort of advanced cognitive decline where i cant make my character jump in time to dodge a projectile. I have less time for gaming, but Im not like grandpa trying to play a video game for the first time. In some ways I‚Äôm better than I was when I was younger, because of the accumulated experience of playing other similar games
        Both
        Definitely a bit of both, having at most 6-8 hours a week to game makes it a lot difficult to build up reflexes for a game‚Äôs timings.

But also it gets harder and harder to play as I get older, although things like rear paddles have made a huge difference in ergonomics and probably took 10 years off of relative age.
            What do you use the rear paddles for? I haven't found a use for them yet.
                I usually bind the right one to dash and the left one to parry. Really makes a big difference when you need to quickly go from jump to dash.
                    Uhhh am I an idiot? What is parry in this game?

Like I know there's some parry mechanic when you cancel out someones attack by hitting it but I am unaware of a specific parry button.
                        There‚Äôs no parry in Hollow Knight, but that‚Äôs what I use in games like Blasphemous. I think in Hollow Knight I had it paired to Vengeful Spirit.
                            Fair, ty.
        I‚Äôm 31 and I‚Äôll answer it‚Äôs time commitment. Even if I have a day off and my wife tells me I‚Äôm free to do anything I want there is always so much to do that even if I take a day to game I can‚Äôt get past the guilt of losing a day.
        Time and commitment for me. My friends and I still play competitive shooters and I do just as good as I did a decade ago. Maybe I‚Äôm keeping up or I‚Äôm the same level trash I‚Äôve always been but either way I haven‚Äôt noticed a decline. I was able to beat NKG in 4 hours and I‚Äôve seen people take almost double that. So that‚Äôs an accomplishment in and of itself in my mind. Especially because my skill level is somewhere between trash and mid on any given day, with wild random and rare fluctuations into godly. But only brief moments of unlocking ultra instinct. 

But as difficult as NKG was I saw myself getting better every hour until finally I did it. It‚Äôs just time. Practice. Commitment. Maybe some people are declining and i certainly could be, and my buddy who is 30 claims he‚Äôs declining, but i feel I perform the same as I always have.
    I think it‚Äôs all the more reason to play difficult games as you age. It keeps you sharp. You can still accomplish anything in any game; the variable is really just how many times it takes you. Comparing yourself to a version of your younger self that is probably not even accurate is also a recipe for unhappiness. Try to improve what skills you have and don‚Äôt judge yourself for failure- that‚Äôs advice for gaming and life
    Respect for the username
        Hah yup, that‚Äôs what the morph ball was called in the  original NES manual for Metroid. The only time it was called by its Japanese name.

Not many people recognize it these days!
This dude said 30
    fellow 30 year old here, lol it isnt that old but if you spend enough time on the internet all the kids born in like 2010 and up calling you "grandpa" will condition you to think it is lol.
I was hoping Silksong would come out before my child was born, and I wasn't even planning on having children when it was announced... My child will come out next month and I won't even be able to play Silksong to pass time once labor starts.

(Before you think I shouldn't play while my wife suffers: it's me who'll be suffering. I'm the wife).

Now I'm wondering whether my child will be old enough to play Silksong with me when it releases... I feel like I'm on a whole new level of resignation.
    lol you being the wife was such a twist. you have a talent, I'm sure :D
If my friend‚Äôs 70 year old dad can beat elden ring you can beat silk song.
    Bold to assume silk song will be out in the next 40 years.
Wtf! Dude 30 is hella young to be talking about losing skills

Maybe busier and has less time for gaming but that's it, you are good.
For 112% you dont need bindings. Bindings are optional.
    I think the comma he used implies he knows that, and was just making a point he can't do either (Could be wrong)
        Haha well I mean, I'm 27 now and I can't do that either. I mean maybe I could if I invested 50 hours for that, but I think he could di it with 50-100 hours too. You just need dedication and good set-up.
            I'm 28 also at 111% and not grinding P5 lmfao. Like I know I could do it if I really tried but 50 hours of repetition is a lot (those 50 hours could be spent practicing clarinet üòÇ)

Edit: I forgot I'm at 112% üíÄ still not grinding P5 was my point my fault
                Does clarinet give you amazing cutscene? I don't think so!
                You don't need P5 for 112%. Only the first 4 count.
                P5 isnt a %, I was told.
                You're probably missing something so minor, I got up to 106 without realising I was missing a charm notch
                    Wait I meant 112%**** my fault.

I forgot P5 isn't a %. Idgaf 112% without p5 is good enough
lmao you‚Äôre only bad at these things because you‚Äôre being dramatic about your age and telling yourself you can‚Äôt do them.

30 ain‚Äôt old, especially not old enough that you‚Äôre losing your ‚Äúgaming skills‚Äù
I completed P5 when I was 34. So don‚Äôt worry too much, it‚Äôs all about practice.

edit: if you can‚Äôt beat it at 30 you couldn‚Äôt at 20. HK bosses are much more about memorizing attack patterns than reflexes.
    *Radiant Obblobles enter the chat*
        *much more*, I didn‚Äôt say there aren‚Äôt any. But yes, I got most of the bosses in Radiant, but Obblobles were none of them. Also Markoth. ü•≤
            the multi hit nail art with knockback charm is pretty good against them.
You guys are so dramatic lmao
I feel like everyone goes through this phase when they turn 30 lol
    I went through it this year at 36.
So I've actually developed horribly debilitating and rapidly worsening arthritis in my hands over the last few years.

I can't begin to tell you how much I feel this post. People are joking about how you aren't old. I'm not much older than you, but my hands are going fast. It makes me super sad that some day, maybe soon, I will be permanently disabled. 

I, too, hope Silksong comes out before I'm unable to play it. 

If anyone sees this comment, please think positive thoughts for my health. I'm currently in the process of lots of testing and hoping for a diagnosis. It could be lupus. It could be something else. I don't know yet. My hands hurt all the time. I can't make it more than a couple hours without compression gloves and even with them on, it still hurts.
    Yo I'm on team arthritis at 30. Took nearly 5 years but I just had my very first blood test with normal inflammation levels. You will beat this, and silksong!
        Okay this is so strange but you and I have so much in common. 

1. Cow in the user name
2. Created account in 2013
3. Similar subreddit activity
4. Similar karma count
5. Arthritis in our 30s.

What the heck! Lol. This was just what I immediately noticed. So weird!!!
            So all I need is a suspicious mustache to be your evil clone, excellent. :)
                ü§£ üòÆ

üë®!
Lmfao this guy
55 here and Hornet drove me crazy, it took a long time for the reflexes to build up, but now I am pretty much on top of the game though I leave some bosses until I have more masks.
Sorry my friend‚Ä¶Silksong is coming out in 2093 so you‚Äôll be too old :(
I used to think the same, then got back at it a couple years later and I‚Äôm better than I used to be.
>112%? Pantheon with bindings? Those are now impossible for me.

Eh, I don't think many people are able to do that, young or old. I'm talking about the pantheons with bindings btw, 112% is really not that hard, no matter your age, it is more time consuming than difficult.

I feel that you are exaggerating, or more likely you are overestimating how good you were at games when you were younger. There are many 30+ years old who are absolute beasts at fps and at games like HK. But ok, in fps reaction time is definitely more important, however, in games like HK reaction time is far less relevant because every boss (well designed ones at last) have clear tells that give you ample time to react, it's not a split second chocie that you have to make, bosses are not random.

30 years old is not an age were you stop being able to do well at games. If you can't "compete" anymore it is far more likely that you are slacking off on your practice, which could be a consequence of being older and having less time though.
30? Are you kidding? I'm also 30 this year and I feel like I'm the best I ever was when it comes to competitive gaming. And pretty much anything I do on regular basis. Come on, you should be in your prime around now.
30 years old you old fart. I didn't start playing this till I was 34
I tried to play Hollow Knight for the first time around 3-5 years ago. I fumbled a bit and forgot about it, since even the city of tears Soul Master boss was almost impossibly hard for me. Now? I'm 27 and it's peanuts, I think Soul Master took at most two tries. If you're playing casually you can extend your prime for as long as you want if you care for your health and mind at least a bit.
I feel like aging is getting in your head.  30 is way too young to just quit a genre of games because of reflexes.  And dude I get 30 feels old but you are a young one still.  Post this when you are 50.
I'm 32 with a muscular degenerative illness. It's less than ideal. I just want to finish my favourite books and play the games that are in development and Early Access!
The biggest thing in aging and gaming is that in my 20s up till mid 30s I could drink and game. I still can at 40 but not Hollow Knight anymore and expect to beat the boss in a reasonable amount of tries. Also competitive 3D shooters. I can play and drink like my early 20s (aka not die in real life) except keeping a positive k/d ratio. That went out of the window.
I'm 13 and like 106 to 110 I can't remember
Nah man, you're good. I'm turning 42 in a few months and I can do path of pain in around 20 minutes and think Hollow Knight only has 2 hard bosses (Abs Rad and NKG), am currently nearing the end of Rabi Ribi on hardest difficulty (the hardest metroidvania boss experience whos early game bosses are Nightmare King Grim difficulty), and have not too long ago finshed Aeterna Noctis (a metroidvania based on platforming that hits path of pain difficulty halfway through and keeps getting harder). I also play Celeste on C-sides before I start feeling challenged. Sekiro is an easy rhythm game and Malenia was the only Elden Ring boss that actually felt hard.

I say this not as a brag, because it's just playing games for fun, but to make the point that this whole "hard games can't be played by older people" is absolutely 100% bunk. If anything, in my older age the focus and patience I have is _waaaaaaaaay_ more of a bonus and help than any loss of reflex and makes up for it. Games feel easier now than they did when I was 30, which again felt easier than they did when I was 20. The older I get, the more I push difficulty settings _up_ in games.

Not sure where you heard games would get harder now that you're pushing 30, but they straight up lied. And this is someone a good 12ish years older than you saying this.

So, you're good.
112% is possible without doing any bindings or Pantheon of Hallownest.

I know because the only achievement I have left is PoH and I'm not able to do it.
I'm 52 and finally picked up Hollow Knight for my PS5 a week ago.   I had watched my teenage son play a few years ago and remembered how original it looked.   Was in the mood for some platforming action and am blown away by how amazing this game is (though I haven't finished it yet).    Looking forward to the sequel whenever it comes out!
I'm 37 and managed to get 112%. Not bragging, just saying you got this. Though there are things I've yet to achieve, like beating absolute radiance on radiant
(Guilt tripping Team Cherry into releasing soon! Lemme get into it) I also am ageing quite fast, I'll be 20 in a few months. Who knows how much time left I got. I just wish I get to see the day the sequel to my favourite game, not release... but get a release date...
not aging curveüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ dude you‚Äôre 30 that is not that old, if you feel like this join a gym or something
    like cmon bro stop dragging it üò≠
Might as well save the money from Silksong for your inevitable hip replacement. 

Seriously dude. 30 is not old. Get over yourself.
Maybe you should consider your simply bad at gaming
    Why, why would you type this? Who‚Äôs life are you making better going around beating people fealing shit down for. Just to stroke your own fragile ego???
        dude its a joke about gaming, who cares, it speaks louder that you would take something so remotely unimportant this seriously.
I do feel bad for all those who have passed while looking forward to seeing this game release, either expectedly or unexpectedly. Although I guess they don‚Äôt really care anymore since they‚Äôre dead. Peace, in a way.
Oh my days everyone, please...
Might as well hang up the controller and load the fridge up with prune juice, you're officially dead.

I'm 34 and I wreck kids in FPS all the time.  They might be a little faster, but I'm wise.  They can't snap to my head because I knew they were coming and blew theirs off already.

30 isn't that old, any failing on your part is a cop out.  Gitgud, scrub.
    Why, why would you type this? Who‚Äôs life are you making better going around beating people fealing shit down for. Just to stroke your own fragile ego???
Silksong doesnt exist so no point waiting for it
I'd whish you people would stop whinging so much about it
I didn‚Äôt play Hollow Knight until I was 33-34. You‚Äôre fine.
I'm also 35 and only just started Hollow Knight. We will be fine üòÇ
    dude are you sure you can make it to dirtmouth?
        It took me 9 days of blood and tears but I got there
I hope it doesn‚Äôt come out until I‚Äôve beaten P5AB
Bruh if your reflexes are going at 30 I worry for you when you're actually old
You're making it out like this game is gonna take another 50 years to come out and you'd be literally unable to play it-
uhh just saying i'm 33 and i did 112% lmao. i did this with no prior experience with playing metroidvanias, especially not one like hollow knight. it just takes time and dedication to do it.
I think this is just your state of mind. I am also 30 and consistently still rank high in fps and multiplayer games. You‚Äôre reflexes might be slowing but it‚Äôs negligible if you build muscle memory. Remember experience beats talent, just keep at it and you‚Äôll still improve. Make P5 with bindings a goal and go for it. Good luck with the completion!
To be fair, the pantheons are insanely difficult and tedious regardless of age. ESPECIALLY with any bindings on.
Omfg lol there are 90 year olds playing first person shooters on twitch, you're fiiiine.
For me, what I think it comes down to is that to see basically all of the content in the game, you don't 'need' to do 112%, let alone something like P5AB (individual lower Pantheons with only 1-2 bindings aren't nearly as bad). You ger ~30+ hours of fun even without that final challenge.

Most multiplayer FPS games are different in that you're specifically 'competing' against other people, so a small skill/practice difference will quickly snowball into getting iced. But that's different in a single-player game. Even P5 gives you options (grinding specific bosses in hall of gods, getting the Lifeblood cocoons) that let you get through it more smoothly, and you can always physically step away and take a break partway through a run even if you can't save and quit.
I hope I won't be too old when it comes out (I'm a teen)
I'm 36 and I've done P5 with each binding (individually, not together... yet). You're fine, ha ha
Your age is literally a non factor. That's just a fact.
I'm 36, definitely still ABLE to do those things. 112% wasn't too difficult but took a few tries for sure. Don't blame your age, if you put in the time it's definitely obtainable.
Hey I understand that it may seem daunting but worst case scenario just enjoy the exploration and play it at a slower pace, and foremost avoid comparing yourself to other players, I have friends that are 18-20 that play video games all day and still never beat P5 some not even HKG or pure vessel one guy gave up at sly. 

Just think about enjoying it and take the journey calmly
Have fun and just do what makes you feel satisfied. If you're a completionist, just remember that younger players also need lots of time and practice to achieve the maximum percentage. It's viable! I'll be 36 this year.
I'm 21 I have minor heart issues. I was on verge of passing out from 1v1 in fortnite one time due to vasovagal syncope. I thought I was actually going to have a heart attack battling nightmare king grimm, my heart rate will go almost 150-160 and I start getting pre-syncope symptoms from playing. I can only imagine what will come in silk song and my poor blood pressure and cortisol levels.
there's no hope, this entire fandom will be dead by the time it's out, if not, extremely old
About to turn 41 in March. Did 112% . If i can, you can. Reflexes are not what they used to be? Rely on experience then! C'mon buddy, you're 30! Is like the new 20s in this times!
Everyone got way too serious at "E sports" type games. You may not have changed at all. People have only taken things more and more seriously which isn't inherently a bad thing, but you should understand that way more people are playing games to optimize their skill first, then have fun second.
Daigo Umehara still competes in top level Street Fighter at 42. 
You got no excuse boy.
It‚Äôs not impossible. I hate to say it but It‚Äôs just a skill issue. There are plenty of professional gamers who still compete at the highest level who are 30 and above. There are plenty of people with significant mental/physical disabilities who can beat games like dark souls, elden ring and cup head. It‚Äôs just yourself using your age as an excuse when you just need to keep practicing!
30 here and got PoH with all bindings (separately) and RadHoG. Persistence goes a long way
I'm 41 and platinumed Hollow Knight
I had to do a double take, because I unfollowed the silksong thread for this reason lol
You did 111% that's still realy good you should be fine with the basic run of the game
If it makes you feel any better the pantheon are insanely difficult and most players probably can't beat them. Myself included and you're a couple years older than I am.
Idk man I‚Äôm 24 and I can‚Äôt get 111% so I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs an age issue unless you have a degenerative condition.  30 isn‚Äôt old üò≠
git gud
a lot of people are saying how they're older and still able to be good at the game, but i'll offer the opposite: i'm younger and worse than you. i'm 21 and only have 110%.
I hear once you hit 35, the government revokes your gaming license because there's just no way you could handle something so difficult anymore.

Don't worry dude, you'll be fine. It'll just take a bit of practice is all.
18 and have no such problems, have fun
Has there been ANYTHING? Like I feel like there's been zero news for anything
I'm much older than you and I've done PoH. It's not about being fast, it's about seeing what's coming as early as possible and reacting appropriately.
U'll do good enough to enjoy it for sure I feel . But that competitiveness , am not really sure . Keeping good routines and some exercise slows down motor ability degeneration overall , so try to keep healthy lifestyle too man . PS. i do know some people in 40s who OWN the game when they play it . So its not impossible ofc .
Bruh, you‚Äòre only 30 but you can‚Äòt keep up? In many professional sports people only reach their prime by their 30‚Äòs. 

I‚Äòm 27 and i still whoop ass in many games
If you were 60, I'd agree with you. But 30..
Should be out in a year or two.
I've noticed that the older I get I like more difficult stuff and I challenge myself more. I'm only 25 tho. But still
I'm not sure if I'm wrong but I think you can do the bindings one by one
Late fourties‚Ä¶ 107% iirc? Need to practice more on the pantheons and trial of the fool, but they‚Äôre not out of reach.
Keep at it! I‚Äôll be 43 soon, and I just got the Platinum trophy not to long ago on ps5
>age is just a number

don't say this in the court btw
    Jail is just a room¬†
39. I stopped at 111% üò≠
Seriously, I'm 27 so a few years off of 30, but I'm playing harder games and I'm generally better than anything I played than when I was a teenager. I think OP will be fine with some practice
Fr, I swear people hit their physical peak at around 30 lmao
    Rethink what that means! You're on the decline after. 

I'm kidding but I kind of agree with OP. 

I got hollow knight for ps4 on release, 5 years ago. 

I played for hours and got to 106% in a few sittings. 

I replayed it from the start and I'm aiming for 112%, I'm currently at 107%. 

It's taken me like 3 weeks with work and life, one night I played for 40 minutes and it made me so sad. I fucked up the coliseum a few times and just had to go to bed feeling like a loser because I had work in the morning. 

Nightmare grimm seems impossible, the pantheons seem impossible. I'll do them, but I remember when I was just good at all games all the time.
        That feeling has everything to do with how we're treated at a "workplace" and nothing related to who we are. It's dehumanizing.
Do you really feel a decay in your capabilities or is it more of a time/commitment type of problem? Having families and responsibilities doesn‚Äôt give you as much time than if you were 14 and gaming 27 hours a day.
    I'm 31 and I was never really good at videogames, achieving 109% on HK is probably my biggest achievement (along with beating Farewell in Celeste I guess). While I don't really feel any decay in my abilities, I do feel like modern games can be visually overwhelming, like I'm a bit sensitive to crazy particles effects, I believe more so than  20-something people that were exposed to screens earlier than me. 

Maybe it's just my brain though, 30 is definitely not super old when it comes to playing games!
        Farewell is harder than Path of Pain, and for me, P5, too (I've done both to testify). I've only gotten through the first half of farewell so far.
            Farewell was absolutely horrible, aha, I hated the game by the time I got to the finish line and only beat it like 4 years after buying the game. I'm still glad I went for it but damn, some bits were NOT FUN at all. 

Congrats on beating P5, this looks insurmountable for me!
                Well, you are clearly a skilled gamer to beat Farewell. You will definitely be able to get your 112% and more soon, bro.
                    Thanks for the kind words! üôåüèª
                        I beat p5 using mark of pride, long nail, quick focus and I think grub song. The plan was to just stay far away from anything that could hurt me. It did take 2 weeks of practicing PV and Markoth and Abs Rad until I could beat them 8/10 times in a row then I went for it. Took only 2 tries when I got consistent on those bosses.
    I'm 42, and I'd say it's a little bit of both for me. I just spent a lot of time trying to complete the Trial of the Fool. I did it, but there was a moment in the middle where I wondered if maybe it was beyond me due to my old man reflexes.

After I put my kids to bed I have a couple hours to play games before I get tired. So I was getting frustrated that i was spending all my me-time banging my head against the wall with that damn trial. I finally settled on giving it 3 attempts every night, and then stopping. And I got it within 4 days of doing that. 

It just takes a little more time and patience. I'm at 110% right now. We'll see if I feel the same way when I start Path of Pain, and Pantheon of Hallownest.
    I‚Äôm 39. Gaming is a skill, and with the passage of time, comes less time you have to either maintain or improve the skill. I play a variety of games, but my favorite are Metroidvania‚Äôs, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any decline in skill. I‚Äôm not trying to brag or anything, but I don‚Äôt feel any sort of advanced cognitive decline where i cant make my character jump in time to dodge a projectile. I have less time for gaming, but Im not like grandpa trying to play a video game for the first time. In some ways I‚Äôm better than I was when I was younger, because of the accumulated experience of playing other similar games
    Both
    Definitely a bit of both, having at most 6-8 hours a week to game makes it a lot difficult to build up reflexes for a game‚Äôs timings.

But also it gets harder and harder to play as I get older, although things like rear paddles have made a huge difference in ergonomics and probably took 10 years off of relative age.
        What do you use the rear paddles for? I haven't found a use for them yet.
            I usually bind the right one to dash and the left one to parry. Really makes a big difference when you need to quickly go from jump to dash.
                Uhhh am I an idiot? What is parry in this game?

Like I know there's some parry mechanic when you cancel out someones attack by hitting it but I am unaware of a specific parry button.
                    There‚Äôs no parry in Hollow Knight, but that‚Äôs what I use in games like Blasphemous. I think in Hollow Knight I had it paired to Vengeful Spirit.
                        Fair, ty.
    I‚Äôm 31 and I‚Äôll answer it‚Äôs time commitment. Even if I have a day off and my wife tells me I‚Äôm free to do anything I want there is always so much to do that even if I take a day to game I can‚Äôt get past the guilt of losing a day.
    Time and commitment for me. My friends and I still play competitive shooters and I do just as good as I did a decade ago. Maybe I‚Äôm keeping up or I‚Äôm the same level trash I‚Äôve always been but either way I haven‚Äôt noticed a decline. I was able to beat NKG in 4 hours and I‚Äôve seen people take almost double that. So that‚Äôs an accomplishment in and of itself in my mind. Especially because my skill level is somewhere between trash and mid on any given day, with wild random and rare fluctuations into godly. But only brief moments of unlocking ultra instinct. 

But as difficult as NKG was I saw myself getting better every hour until finally I did it. It‚Äôs just time. Practice. Commitment. Maybe some people are declining and i certainly could be, and my buddy who is 30 claims he‚Äôs declining, but i feel I perform the same as I always have.
I think it‚Äôs all the more reason to play difficult games as you age. It keeps you sharp. You can still accomplish anything in any game; the variable is really just how many times it takes you. Comparing yourself to a version of your younger self that is probably not even accurate is also a recipe for unhappiness. Try to improve what skills you have and don‚Äôt judge yourself for failure- that‚Äôs advice for gaming and life
Respect for the username
    Hah yup, that‚Äôs what the morph ball was called in the  original NES manual for Metroid. The only time it was called by its Japanese name.

Not many people recognize it these days!
fellow 30 year old here, lol it isnt that old but if you spend enough time on the internet all the kids born in like 2010 and up calling you "grandpa" will condition you to think it is lol.
lol you being the wife was such a twist. you have a talent, I'm sure :D
Bold to assume silk song will be out in the next 40 years.
I think the comma he used implies he knows that, and was just making a point he can't do either (Could be wrong)
    Haha well I mean, I'm 27 now and I can't do that either. I mean maybe I could if I invested 50 hours for that, but I think he could di it with 50-100 hours too. You just need dedication and good set-up.
        I'm 28 also at 111% and not grinding P5 lmfao. Like I know I could do it if I really tried but 50 hours of repetition is a lot (those 50 hours could be spent practicing clarinet üòÇ)

Edit: I forgot I'm at 112% üíÄ still not grinding P5 was my point my fault
            Does clarinet give you amazing cutscene? I don't think so!
            You don't need P5 for 112%. Only the first 4 count.
            P5 isnt a %, I was told.
            You're probably missing something so minor, I got up to 106 without realising I was missing a charm notch
                Wait I meant 112%**** my fault.

I forgot P5 isn't a %. Idgaf 112% without p5 is good enough
*Radiant Obblobles enter the chat*
    *much more*, I didn‚Äôt say there aren‚Äôt any. But yes, I got most of the bosses in Radiant, but Obblobles were none of them. Also Markoth. ü•≤
        the multi hit nail art with knockback charm is pretty good against them.
I went through it this year at 36.
Yo I'm on team arthritis at 30. Took nearly 5 years but I just had my very first blood test with normal inflammation levels. You will beat this, and silksong!

Why, why would you type this? Who‚Äôs life are you making better going around beating people fealing shit down for. Just to stroke your own fragile ego???
    dude its a joke about gaming, who cares, it speaks louder that you would take something so remotely unimportant this seriously.

    It took me 9 days of blood and tears but I got there
Jail is just a room¬†
Rethink what that means! You're on the decline after. 

I'm kidding but I kind of agree with OP. 

I got hollow knight for ps4 on release, 5 years ago. 

I played for hours and got to 106% in a few sittings. 

I replayed it from the start and I'm aiming for 112%, I'm currently at 107%. 

It's taken me like 3 weeks with work and life, one night I played for 40 minutes and it made me so sad. I fucked up the coliseum a few times and just had to go to bed feeling like a loser because I had work in the morning. 

Nightmare grimm seems impossible, the pantheons seem impossible. I'll do them, but I remember when I was just good at all games all the time.
    That feeling has everything to do with how we're treated at a "workplace" and nothing related to who we are. It's dehumanizing.
I'm 31 and I was never really good at videogames, achieving 109% on HK is probably my biggest achievement (along with beating Farewell in Celeste I guess). While I don't really feel any decay in my abilities, I do feel like modern games can be visually overwhelming, like I'm a bit sensitive to crazy particles effects, I believe more so than  20-something people that were exposed to screens earlier than me. 

Maybe it's just my brain though, 30 is definitely not super old when it comes to playing games!
