[[What happens in the true ending]]


I just defeated radiance, and saw that our bro is dead, but didn't understand anything. Is radiance good or bad? Is everyone happy in Hallownest about this ending?


The radiance has been (for the time being) defeated, removing the infection, at the same time the knight has unified the void within all the vessels. Healing the wounds of being cast away like failed expirements from the greedy pale king. The kingdom of hallownest is not longer held in a stasis by the opposing forces of the pale king and the radiance. In my headcanon they were both bad, now they're both gone. No longer will bugs dream and be taken into the radiance hive mind, and now finally the thousands of vessels created, discarded, and forgotten by the pale king can rest at peace
    Okay, now i understand a little more. Thanks!
        I would recommend watching mossbags mostly complete lore video.

It explains the basic lore of the game.

Just a note, it isn’t really a true ending cause the devs don’t really support a specific ending and it’s more referred as the achievement says: the Dream no more ending.

 The Radiance is bad cause it was infecting the whole ass place and controlling the minds of the bugs, nobody liked that and the knight kills the radiance, making that whole problem disappear and all the vessels finally rest in peace after “completing” their goal, my guess is that it includes the knight. And most bugs are happy about that.
    Okay, thank you. I just thought that's a true ending, because u need to do the most of work. Like getting awoken dreamnail with void heart, and then killing radiance which wasn't an easy boss for me.

Is there only 3 endings? Or should I consider doing another save?
        There's a 4th ending, but you don't need to start another save to get it.
            There’s actually two more endings, but they happen in the same place just with different circumstances and they both can be done on the same save.
                I personally don't consider >!Embrace the void with the delicate flower!< a separate ending from >!embrace the void!<, since it doesn't have it's own achievement associated with it, which is why I said there was only 4 endings.
                    Yeah that makes sense
        There's 5 endings in total, and a 6th sub-ending you can get
            What is the 6th sub ending?
                I assume they’re talking about Mr. Mushroom
                    or >!embrace the void w the delicate flower!<
                    Yes, you are correct. (My favourite ending and the only fully 100% confirmed canon one by team cherry)
                Put on a certain shroom and Rome a bit around oro's hut....
        You can get all endings on one save, as long as you get the Vessel ending before acquiring Voidheart.
I'm good.

Just look at the light.

Everything will be better afterwards.
To quote mossbag “there’s a whole Zote load of lore we could get into”, but the short answer is the Radiance is gone and that’s a good thing. She was enslaving the minds of the bugs of Hallownest. Sure, she herself got a pretty raw deal when her people abandoned her but that doesn’t justify her actions and nobody was in favour of her taking over.

There isn’t exactly a lot of people left to be happy about it, but now things can finally change in the land of Hallownest. Maybe for good, maybe for bad, but at least it’s no longer being held in stasis. It’s likely given time some new kingdom/civilization will arise in it’s place.

The void appears to mostly go back to sleep in that ending, with the siblings disappearing back into the void. It too could eventually maybe become something else *cough godseekers cough*
Shes neither and so is the pale king their isn’t really a villain in the game each side had their reasons for what they did and their fuck ups
