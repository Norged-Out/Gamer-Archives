[[Finally got my 5hr speedrun achievement!]]





Is that Metroid Knight: Zero Silksong???Â¿Â¿
Dang I wondered what was going on there for a good 30 secs. Well played mods.
Next mission? What the fuck?
    Silksong, obviously
    I got it. Happy April Fools everyone
Nice, great job. What an achievement.
The sub is now metroid and the genre is now Hollowvania
The new Silksong game looking real good
Wait a second... This isn't right...
nice pal
Im so confused
    You are going to be confused a lot of times *today*
Man I wish Nintendo would implement a screenshot button. Then allow users to copy them to their smartphones with some [simple steps](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53138/~/how-to-transfer-screenshots-and-video-captures-to-a-smart-device-wirelessly).
    Didnâ€™t know I could send screenshots to myself, thanks for the tip!
        ðŸ˜‚ No prob. I wish it was more streamlined. 

Maybe an app that lets you pull up your album on the phone and browse. As long as the switch is in standby and connected to Wi-Fi, would be able to select and save to camera roll on phone wherever you are.

Could still happen one day
