[[Have you 112% the game, and if not, why]]





I haven't because I suck lol
    Same thing + lazy :/
    same x) and I HATE 
Colosseum of Fools
        The colosseum is the least if your problems when doing 112%
            \* Flashing memories of a certain transport quest in HK \*
                YOU BROKE IT AGAIN YOU FUCKING IDIOT, THESE ARE RARE YOU KNOW! Anyway here's another one, I know I said it before the last 386 times but this is the last one.
                    You said to yourself at 4 AM in the morning after having tried since the afternoon 😂
        Nailmasters Glory makes it a walk in the park.

I couldn't beat it before using that. Some of the no floor sections are just so challenging.
    Saaame
    Me too
No because I suck at pantheons
    this seems to be a common theme
        Because it's unbalanced, and it has way too many bosses in a  row.
            It's all about practice. It's meant to be an optional sequence for those who truly want to test their skill. Once you remember the attack patterns you can easily go through one entire sequence without losing much health. The hall of gods is basically a practice arena for that.
                It's a  terrible post-game area that drains you of that good feeling you get from beating a boss, because beating one boss is worthless there. I would have beaten it all by now if it was one boss at a time and you didn't need to kill a bunch of them in a row. All except Nightmare King Grimm and the Absolute Radiance. 4 bosses in a row would have been fine too, but the amount is so excessive. And they reuse bosses all the time, which is even more annoying.
                    That's the challenge of it. Fighting the same boss again one at a time is basically just repetition of the game itself. Which is why it's been converted to back to back boss fight. It's not at all impossible, a couple of tries and you'll automatically start to understand the patterns and react accordingly. I was intimidated at first seeing the number of bosses but its doable after a couple of attempts. It basically tests that you are truly capable of taking on any boss in the game no matter the handicap. 

If you're struggling with a section it just indicates that you are not prepared enough. It can be boring for some people but most of the folks like me just love that the game forces you to push beyond your comfort level to get better.
                        I already can't play Hollow Knight at all right now because of how horrible the Pantheons were and how many hours I wasted on them already. In the end, I just don't enjoy the Pantheons, which are just the extra post-game challenges. I'd rather replay the actual game.
            *clears throat* GIT GUD
                People who say that shit are the worst.
            You just need to git gud. I haven't played hollow knight in like a year and I bet I can do P5 first try
                Bro really said he could do P5 first try 💀
                    I have beaten P5 before but it's been over a year. I wolud stream it if you're interested
                        Just because you've beaten it before doesn't mean you can beat it first try after not playing for a year
                            Check DM
                                Damn even though you didnt complete it thats really impressive. Sorry for being so rude
                                    For anyone curious I died to failed champion
    You don't need pantheons to gain 112%

Edit: I was wrong.
        Yes you do, P1-P4 all give 1% each
            Yeah, really. Sorry my bad
                All good :)
I have

Because I have nothing better to do
    lol

oh wait that's true
    Saaaaame
    Do not upvote this any more, it's at 112!
        Now it’s at 259%
I’m stuck at watcher knight and am too busy to sit down and beat the hell out of ‘em
    Sharp Shadow + Quick Slash + Shaman Stone. Just keep hitting it until it hits back then dash through it. If it rolled also dash through. If they are both infront of you shade soul. If you're in between descending dark
        I don’t have Sharp Shadow or Quick Slash yet - something tells me I need to do some exploring first…
            Just use dive the entire time with shamans, they will melt before you
    There's also a way to kill one of them before the fight if you're really struggling.
    Quickslash, fragile strength, mark of pride, soul catcher absolutely destroys them
        You forgot skill
            Not even dude. This build is just unga bunga
    I got stuck on WK my first playthrough. Ran at them for over 5 hours, activated the last one once. Quit for years. Got sucked back in during lockdown but this time with a little bit of internet support.

I missed a *lot* of exploration in that first playthrough, and if I had just gone back I would have been intrinsically stronger and probably beat them.

Spoilers of some things I missed:

>!- Wasn't able to beat Mantis Lords early, so I went elsewhere. In my mind, they would have been harder than WK so I never went back. Never found Deepnest.!<

>!- City of Tears, I never went west of that first elevator entrance somehow, got fixated on those platforms to the right (I wonder if I ever made it all the way down, probably went straight into the sewers). Never upgraded my nail. Found ore but had no idea what to do with it.!<

>!- Never found Kingdom's Edge
!<

Moral of the story: if you hit a boss wall, go explore. I've now 112%'d it, and very glad I did.
        Hey i think that’s what I’m going to do, I’m under the impression I actually found them prematurely
I'm too lazy
Currently at 111%, Pantheon 4 is stopping me.

Bosses were never my strong suit. Outside of Godhome, I had a lot of fun figuring out a charm build that could cheese whichever boss I was stuck on, but in Pantheons that isn't really an option. You're stuck with the same charm loadout for 5 or more bosses in a row. Pantheon 3 had me stuck for a while, but I did eventually beat it after a lot of time-consuming failures. I consider that enough for me.
    I use mainly strength, quick focus, long nail, grubsong, soul catcher
        Builds like that work if you know the bosses' patterns. I prefer builds that work even when you don't know them.

In my first playthrough I beat THK first try by heal spamming. Thorns, Spores, Grubsong, Quick Focus, Defender's Crest, Stalwart Shell. It was hilarious.
            Lol Quick Fart build.
            That sounds like a mad crazy build I can’t believe I’ve never thought of combining all of those
                Fair warning, you won't be able to see what you're doing at all. Defender's Crest + Spores combo spawns an obnoxious amount of particles when you heal.
        For pantheons, and everything in general, just use the build most experienced players used.

Quick Slash, Strength, Shaman

2 notches left, I use longnail but it’s fairly interchangeable.

PV does 2 hearts of damage hurting grubsong and quick focus, quick slash,strength, and shamans are just so much damage you don’t want to give up.
    Reached PV I assume? I got to about 33% win rate against him in practice then lucked out after a few attempts in the pantheon. Used the sharp shadow method rather than jumping. Tough and there is a tight cool-down window. Worst part is last phase where you have to stay out or range of tentacles or jump… muscle memory has you doing the opposite. 

Noped out of the final pantheon completely… I’ll never beat pure radiance.
        No, I haven't reached PV in Pantheon. I can't even beat him in Hall of Gods (though admittedly I haven't tried very hard). Once I beat P3, I basically abandoned that file.
            Pure Vessel reminded me a lot of Nightmare King Grimm. When you don’t know what you are doing, it’ll destroy you. But if you just spend time practicing dodging you’ll quickly (well, like 50 attempts but still just a few hours) get to the point where he’s almost easy. Because all his moves have strict patterns and strict timings.
    same here, pv is fucking hard in p4
    Yeah, getting through 3 was so time consuming and frustrating for me that I wasn't even about to attempt 4.
    if you ever decide to come back i can give tips ✌ i have so much to say about the bosses in this game but literally no one cares lol
Nope, too busy grinding goldens in Celeste
    112 is far easier than Golden Berry runs! Especially if you're talking farewell lol. 🍓🍓🍓
        I know, but when I get used to the hollow knight controls it takes a while to revert back to “Celeste mode”
            I learned the hk controls first so I ended up remapping my Celeste controls to fit hk controls better.
            That's funny, I had the same problem going back to Celeste after getting really into HK, I ended up switching to using keyboard in Celeste when I used to use controller (dpad) for both.
        I got a bit into the wavedashing part of Farewell before I stopped playing! That chapter is really insane.
    Im trying to get a golden in the  Oshiro haunted hotel level and its pain ;_;

Which one are you currently trying to get?
        I’m on the hotel chapter b-side. Pain.
            Oof if im struggling so much just on the hotel a-side I can imagine how much fun im going to have with the b-side lol😅

Also good luck!
                Thank you! 3a is tough, you’ll get it eventually!
    I have done steel heart without save quitting but I am still struggling with 3A golden. Help me ;-;
    As someone with all goldens except farewell

mood
        Join the club. I managed to do a run of Farewell with only 8 deaths, but that's still so far from 0.
    I've got about five Goldens left myself, currently on a five month break lol
    well... ok

BUT DO IT SOMETIME ok?
I have not, because i got lazy and played Dead Cells
    Same, now i'm stuck in both!
    Nooooo
        Roguelites are like crack i swear
            100% I'm playing hades, it's more addictive than drugs
                Fr, i went on a vacation and played Hades for days
                Used to play Hades, abandoned it a few weeks ago for terraria
No. Not enough time, also not enough patience to bang my head against walls trying to beat pantheons. I have other games I want to play.

I did get to 100% though!
I didn't because I can't get past the trial of the fool
    Same
        Same
    Upgrade nail and get NMG
    I can't even pass the Soul Master :(
        Do you have shaman stone?
    trial of the fool was spikes and suffering
Yes, for games with so much content like this, I have trouble leaving them incomplete. That’s why I spent so much time on p5, some celeste goldens, cuphead s-ranks, and what I think is hardest, most of the shovel knight achievements. I feel bad leaving them, even if it’s a smaller game like haiku, the robot, which I felt bad for leaving incomplete and went back to finish.
yes, to get all achievements
    Good reasoning
I don’t want to ruin the game for myself by trying to achieve a goal that I don’t care strongly for. To those that did it and helped show the rest of us the alt endings. Thank you. But me? I enjoyed the game up to 108% ish, not enough lore for me personally. Nothing ground breaking about missing the godseeker endings for me, but seeing others complete it is cool
    I even used an easy mode mod and a  mod that let me equip every charm, and still died to Nightmare King Grimm, after getting through most of the 5th Pantheon.

Before that, I sort of ruined the game for myself trying over and over again to get through the Pantheons. I stopped when I realized that I am only trying to be a  completionist out of some compulsion, and not because I enjoy it... I like the game too much for it to be destroyed permanently though.
    Most resonable human being right here. I actualy did 112% including Patheon 5 but idk if it was worth it. Sisters of battle and Pure vessel are cool fights and all but time I spent grinding to for P4 and ESPECIALY P5( I know p5 is not needed for 112% but I felt like I had to do it) made me quit HK for a year then this summer I replayed the game on PC and did P5. I do not feel like I became super good or am now a pro but like I am finaly done and can wait for Silksong
No because difficult
No because 5 fps laptop
    I just upgraded, played on switch, am now getting 112 pc. I tried on my old laptop, 15fps isn't enough either
I hate trial of fools with every single cell of my body.
abs rad
    Not needed for 112%. Only Pure Vessel is. If you are at the final pantheon but don’t have 112% you are missing something elsewhere.

Though it is needed to get all achievements.
    understandable
I haven't because I don't own the game...*yet*
    This sounds like it's going somewhere good
        **It Will**
            lets goo
    Strong recommendation. I don’t like dark souls, metroidvanias, or platformers.

Hollow Knight is in my top 3 games.
Got the game 2 months ago, still struggling on the colosseum
Yeah twice, 1 in normal and 1 in steel soul
I haven't because i will never beat Sly
    he gave me more trouble than pure vessel
    Would you like a bit of advice on Sly?
        no thanks

&#x200B;

i'm at fifth stage of grief from now and for eternity
    The trick that worked for me was just clinging to the walls and dashing over him for the first phase. It negates all but his double slash jumpspin move. Phase two you just gotta dash away when he charges you and swing back with mark of pride.
Lazy. Other games to play. No other game I’ve played has locked its only real lore and endings behind entirely optional extremely difficult challenges. I normally play games right up until the last thing is merely an achievement - some super mega secret boss who gives a proof you killed him or whatever. I’ll skip that final thing. But in this case that final thing is just way more than I’m willing to do. Thing is, I will also not watch on YouTube something about a game I haven’t earnt. So I’m just left not knowing what I played, haha. And please don’t tell me, I’m happy for it to just be a mystery forever.
I don't have to explain myself to you.
    true. but that comment tells me enough
Because I don’t play it my girlfriend does and I got it and don’t play it much to make her happy about being farther ahead
Yes because, ✨✨I HAVE NO LIFE!!!✨✨
    yooo same same
I didnt beat p4 cause of wrist problems. They're gone, luckily, but break wasnt good for my skill

111% is also a nice number or smth~
    oh come on

regain the muscle memory
I cant even beat normal radiance how tf am I supossed to win against a harder version of her, following EVERY BOSS in the damn game
    uhh... practice?
    P5 is not needed for 112%
The fifth pantheon is genuinely scaring me. I honestly might get to it once I get my steam deck though. It’s been so long since I last played through it, I’m starting to feel the itch to get back in.
I have and I still don't know how I did it
    That is a weird one
No because I personally don't really like the whole collecting part of the game, I play games to challenge myself that's why I beat all the bosses radiant and speedran pop but didn't 112%. 
(Ofc it's just personal preference and I can very much understand people that don't like to do that)
    I can get behind that view
I haven't because I can't get past the third fcuking pantheon. Grimm sucks ass.
    just wait for nkg
        Oh my God no
            Don’t worry about nkg, abs Rad is so very much worse. Pure vessel isn’t a push over either.
no because i am hot garbage  
if i ever git gud then maybe i'll try
I did because I’m a NERD
[deleted]
    You may as well use your main save for 112 if you get tired of early game. P4 is hard enough. As for speed running, to easily do that, just don't do greenpath fireball skip or explosion pogo. It is pretty easy then.
Currently at 108%, I still have the damn flower, the last pantheon and the second palace to do
    grind time
Not yet, but I just downloaded it 2 weeks ago. I’ll get there, I’m at like 70% on my second playthrough
    Did you type this up on your third monitor while in load screens?
        Lol, no I’m at work right now so regrettably not playing at the moment. 

It is how I’ve spent almost all of my free time since I got it though haha
            well that's a good reason, and a good way to spend free time
I have not. I am trying to do the pantheons.
I couldn't. I got stuck on P4 and I did make little progress with the grind, but life happenes and had to take a big break. Since then I'm twice as busy and not nearly as sharp as I was.

I love this game but I'm not talented enough to beat it without a long grind
No. Sawblade in White Palace keeps cutting my skull in half. Still a few bosses left too.
Yes, I did. Yes it was absolutely fun and frustrating. But worth, really worth. 

(I suppose this applies for anything)
yes, because it was fun
Im working on it
I have, on steel soul as well this is what no silksong does to people
    very true
I have a save with 112%, but haven’t gotten the achievement yet because I want to get it alongside Embrace the Void
Because I’ve yet to even beat it normally, and I also need to git gud.
im going to make it
Working on it!
Can’t pass third pantheon(at sly) and can’t find last two mask shards
    those maks make all the difference
3 times lmao. This game is really good
Yes because the game is amazing and I want to finally get all the achievements in a game. Unfortunately, P5 has moths.
I can’t beat pure vessel. I know all of his attacks and whatnot. I just can’t stop making small mistakes when I’m fighting him. It’s so frustrating because I can go destroy nightmare Grimm  so I can do fast pacing. I just cant hack it with pv for some reason.
    just practice I guess, try different charms
not yet, p3 and p4
I have just recently! Took like a year on and off though
    nice
Steel soul and godhome achievements
Pantheon of hallownest
Potk
    definitely one of the most difficult portions of the game
Because I suck
pantheons are too impossible
Don’t know what else to do, AND MOTHERFUCKING MARKOTH DJDISMSIVOGNEUSYFN
    ok this one is truly a good reason
Cuz p4
I do :)
Yes I have, and I very proud of myself :)))
I have 111%. I only have nkg/banish left and I don’t want to banish, but I don’t have the motivation to get good at nkg
    You could banish him but then fight in Godhome when you have the time
    do it, it shouldn't take too too many atempts
I did, as well as fifth pantheon and path of pain. The only thing I'm missing is beating all bosses in radiant, but I just don't want to do that because of Markoth :(
    I know the feeling
Yes, took a good while but it was worth the effort! 
I'm glad I did it.
Because the damn watcher knights
    took me a good few tries to beat them. You can do it, I'm now doing a challenge where I can't dash or use dive, doing it hitless
Yes, but I don't have the achievement yet (didn't get an ending after getting to 112%)
I have , multiple times
I got to 110%, got a new console, and my save corrupted when I transferred it :( This made me so sad that I didn’t play for like a year; I finally restarted a couple weeks back and I’m at 107%. Three pantheons, trial of the fool, and NKG left — and I haven’t ever beat ToF or NKG so wish me luck!
    nice job!
Too hard, can’t git gud … sad llama
    nooo
No because pantheons. I’m currently at 110%
No.  
Pure Vessel.  
(so close)
    It only gets easier

&#x200B;

unless you die break your hand, lose the game....
Watcher Knight
Unironically, the Pantheons, and to be specific, I haven't even beat the first one.
Stuck at 111% with P4 left
I did all the achievements because I wanted to say I’d done everything in the game and was over it. 
Then I learn about mods
    that's where I am lol
Yep
i have

and now ive become a silksong clown
    IVE FOUND ONE MODS OVER HER--
I have, 8 times ( going for 9)
Don't ask how or why






Send help
    I can not help
no, last pantheon too hard :(
SHAW
    EDENO
I am at the point that I have beaten every boss on radiant difficulty except Absolute Radiance. I haven’t beaten Abs Rad on ascended difficulty either. As of writing this, I can defeat Abs Rad at a win/ loss ratio of about 1/10 on average. Considering that it takes me the better part of an hour to approach the end of P5, and I still struggle with occasionally just losing runs to compounding mistakes and have never carried a lifeblood mask more than two bosses, I want to improve my consistency against Abs Rad to at least 1/2, if not better before I seriously consider grinding P5. Besides that, I still need to do the work to complete the speed run achievements.

Edit: for the record, I generally run Quick Slash, Strength, Shaman Stone and Spell Twister.
    the grind is real
I have because I wasted too much of my time to give up at 111%
I have, just need to beat (Pantheon spoilers) >!ABR, I’ve gotten to the last phase twice but then I scuff it up, I’ve beater her once but that was a practice run!<
    oof
yes, because it's my favorite game ever probably so why wouldn't i. only thing i have left to do is pantheon 5, and if i wanted to go insane, the hall of gods.
Haven’t yet, still getting good.
    \*Gud
I’m still figuring out what I’ve missed and I don’t want to look it up just yet.
Yes, because this game is a masterpiece.
I have it because it was the most important goal of all my life.

Now i feel empty, so I think I'm doing it good
    I know the feeling
    good job
I haven't because I've seen too much in this sub to know I can't. I've stopped at 106%
I haven’t because I’m bad at the game. Haven’t given up yet, but it’ll probably take me another year to accomplish.
    well, so long as you haven't given up
No.
1. Haven’t had time
2. Trying to get money for the breakable charms via trial of the fool with no success
3. I don’t wanna PoP T-T
4. Moth won’t fkn die
I was about to not, but then I found a new OP charm vessels that made all but the pure vessel easy as heck.

Stalwart shell + quick focus + deep focus + grubsong + wayward compass.

You can literally heal in the invulnerability time after getting hit, for just 3 soul

Practicing Pure Vessel was fun, a lot more fun than practicing all the other bosses would be (especially GPZ). Actually I did it without deep focus and with sharp shadow, NMG and something else instead
    wow
The 4th pantheon is too difficult for me to complete. I'm forever going to gave 111% :(
    nooo you can do it
I can’t beat the Moss Charger. And I have bunch of other things left undone.
I took a break, I suck now
Nope, can't beat the Pure Vessel. Been over a year since I tried, so I'm sure I've lost the muscle memory to even stand a chance.
Admittedly, I'm too scared to go through deepest to continue and everywhere else I can go is also just as scary. Pls help
One thing, I let Zote live and I refuse to start a new save file
I do not own the game
No. Pure Vessel.
I'm at Pantheon 4. Started doing attempts today. Keep dying to Pure Vessel. I practiced him in the Hall but in the Pantheon, I just die. With that boss, it's easier if I'm in tune with his moves, like when I'm fighting him back to back, but right after Soul Tyrant, I keep dropping the spaghetti.
Not yet, I'm still stuck on that goddamn soul master
I havent because i beat zote in the overworld, but his dadbod is to hot for me to beat him a second time.
Learning curves are real. Gruesome 56 fckn hours (thank you Delicate Flower and Panth) to get to 112% the first time. Once that was done and over, I finally thought I was somewhat good. Steelheart taught me otherwise :)

&#x200B;

Stay safe and have fun in Hallownest!
I have



Because
I haven't social life
Because real life always finds away to break my playthrough!
I haven't. Im not gud enough
Yes, but my god it might have been the hardest thing I’ve ever achieved in a game.
sly. that crack cocaine addict with a 10meter long sword is what's stopping me
Zote

I hate myself for saving him
I just started steel soul
No because charmless p3 and then just p4
I have but i still gotta do panthon 5
spoiled myself with youtube lets plays and speedrunners so I lost motivation to even attempt to clear it
    you can do it!
I did and it’s definitely doesn’t worth it, 100+ hours lots of tears, and all I got was a cut scene!?
I lost motivation after losing 52 hours of play
yup! even 112% my steelsoul file and did the speedrun achievements during my steelsoul file

was very intense.
    nice
I haven't,
Because I don't remember what I am missing for the remaining 6% lol
Yes, just to experience the entire thing once over
111% but that save is corrupted, my backup save was 110% :)
Yes because a friend bet he could beat me. Anyhow thanks for the 5 bucks for cockiness from my mate on that end.
Yes, I have. The hardest ones to get it were pantheon of sage (third one) and the trial of fool (also the third one)
Zote. Can never beat him with more than one or two masks left, which destroys my chances at finishing the third pantheon. 

Even if I did get to 4 I know I'd have the same problem with NKG
    I had that problem for a while. started a new save and let zote die
I got stuck and third pantheon and the trial of the fool because my potato pc couldn't handle all the lights in the trial and in Sly boss fight and the fps would drop so much that I just stopped playing the game.
No. I got stuck at Pantheon 3 and then got busy with school. I want to get 112% before Silksong releases however
I can't figure out how to get through deepest. I keep dying.
110% here. Pantheon 3 is my wall.
Yep, definetly one of the hardest things I've ever done in a videogame

Got PTSD btw
I got 112% but not the Achievement because I need to beat the 5th pantheon to get it. So I’m working on it
I've got 112%, all bosses radiant except absrad, and done a few full binded pantheons. I told myself I would radiant all bosses before Silksong but honestly I'm just tired now and frustrated that I can't beat absrad. 

I might be done and just start fresh with Silksong.
No. Trial of the Fool. Sorry :(
Im trying! 

I’m stuck on the third pantheon, I keep getting messed up by either Umuu, God Tamer, or Nosk.
I have
No. It took me 80 years to beat the Radiance and I just don’t have the will to go on past that point.
Hollow Knight is my 100% GOAT Metroidvania, my absolute favorite game in my absolute favorite genre. I have no interest in a boss rush; that's not why I play the game. I've got other worlds to explore before Silksong comes out.
No.

I'm stuck on Zote in P3
I started a new save on my switch and 112% the game while my pc was being fixed, it gave me something fun to do
I didn’t do just 112%, I got every achievement on steam
I haven't as I'm still very new to this game, I'm stuck on Hornet's last fight and the Watcher's Knights
    hard ones on the first playthrough, keep going!
No because every time I pick it back up I can't remember how to do things so I restart. Something happens so I stop gaming and repeat
Unfortunately I didn’t, why? Because I’m not finished yet ; )
I haven’t because I repeatedly get to a certain point (varies each playthrough) then restart again. I think it’s because I don’t want the game to “end” and I always want to have more new things to do.

I’ve beaten the game of course but when it comes to getting 112% and doing all of the optional stuff, I leave some to come back to next time. Eventually I’ll have to finish everything but for now I’m making it last as long as possible.
Working on the last percent now
110, 2 more pantheons to go

Edit: fck Prince Zote
Pantheons hard
I hate grinding god home
I skipped false Knight
    lol
I think im at 89% I wanna get 112% before silk song drops. I guess I haven't because of two reasons. One, I took a break playing for a while and when I tried to get back I was just getting my ass kicked mlby dream bosses. It was so hard. And 2. I wanna get max health before I continue going through all the dream bosses but don't remember where I got all my health before so I have to check the wiki and go through every single spot just to find two mask shards... so I'm not looking forward to that.
I did even in steel soul because i am waiting for silksong :(
111% and I have no clue what the 1% missing is, feels bad
    I have a friend with this problem
I can finally say: yes, i fucking have.
The game technically gave me 112% (apparently P5 doesn't count in the 112%)...but I can't, for the life of Me, beat Absolute Radiance in P5, I just panic...

At one point I went trough almost 3 weeks where, everyday, I wouldn't be satisfied until I managed to beat NKG and Pure Vessel 5 times in a row each.

But Absolute Radiance never went down...
I haven't, but I'm on my way and I'm inching closer. I'm adiment to get it before silksong releases. Considering it'll release never I probably have more than enough time.
    true
I have not. I have 111%. I've been trying for 6 months and I still haven't figured out how to beat POH Markoth.
    2nd hardest fight in the game
I have, and after I did finish it, I realized that I still missed a steam achievement, namely P5.

Now I just want to cry everytime I see 62/63 when lauching the game.
Waiting for silksong is can be boring sometimes
I have because the game is so much fun. The pantheons were rough though. The colosseum and grey mourner quest weren't actually so bad, at least not in comparison to Godhome.
I was like.

Imma beat the hall of gods radiant fights as I go thru the pantheons.

Things went well, I got every radiant from the first three pantheon's fights.

Then I reached the pantheon ofnthe knight and Markoth destroyed my ambitions.
Im working on it
I forgot I had done this bc for some reason panth 5 doesn’t count and in my head I still haven’t fully completed it yet. Gotta have all bindings and fully radiant hall of gods too.
Pantheons are the single biggest thinking keeping me from total Hollow Knight completion. I honestly wish I could beat them, but it’s just a time cost. And I don’t have the patience or free time to do them
I did. Yesterday. Up until then, I had not. And the why was because I put off things that are hard. I took a 2 week break after completing P3 to do steal soul/heart and complete the hunter’s journal (mind you, this is after finally getting the game on PC vs my switch. Before the PC, I was just stuck on P3 indefinitely). Started trying P4 finally on Tuesday. Practiced PV for maybe an hour Tuesday and yesterday until I could pretty consistently beat it. Then completed P4 and did sealed siblings for 112%
Yes, got all achievements actually. Love the game that much which is why XD

Took me a long time to complete that’s for sure
I haven't simply because, it's too hard, I can't even get the true ending or do the first pantheon
    called godhome for a reason
No because its to hard and I can't be asked to grind. Have beaten Malenia tho so
i didn't bcuz boring
    noo we have another evil one guys
No.  Don't want to
    This is a bannable offence
I’m at 113% now. You guys know about the hidden Pantheon, right?

Edit: did I need to put the /s ?  Wow, a lot of you guys have zero sense of humor huh?
    your profile says 112% on it
        Thus, the joke. 🤦‍♂️
    mmmmk
I’m not a masochist
    It’s not that bad
        Then I’m simply too lazy
            Fair
No I haven't because I have better things to do.
because i have the big suck
I did 112 in steel soul but I didn’t 100% steam achievements yet cuz I’m lazy
Colo 3 sucks, and I’ve been playing other games
p3-4
I haven't because I bought assassins creed and I had to uninstall it for storage
Because I Lost me save of 50 hours
    oof

&#x200B;

\*thinks of my own 200 hours in game\*
4th Pantheon
    .... is difficult
I lack the ability to do it, 100% is good enough for me.
First of all i ain't doing steel soul second i can't beat flukemarm in P4 third i'm lazy
    lol just dash to her, then pogo next to her until she spits flukes, then dop down and abyss shriek until she dies
I'm bad at video games... :(
    you can do it. Practice
Non-Steam
P3 is to hard for me. Forever at %109 lol.
    if you saved zote oof
Long and hard.... o.o
I have 112% but P3 was the most time consuming Bc I used to suck at sly
Close (just missing P4 and 5) but haven’t because I failed to git gud
    oof big mistake
I have 1xx% the game at every expansion but then again I have no life
No because pantheon 3.
P5 and flower quest. I have time for path of pain but fighting a few bosses and delivering a flower are the last things I do
My playstation plus subscription ended
    And you didn't buy it??
Absolute Radiance kicks my ass lol
Because I can't find the things I'm missing and I'm too lazy to go around the hole map to find them
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQ9TT0JbFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQ9TT0JbFY) If you aren't going to look, you may as well use this
It’s hard
    factcheck: true
I haven't yet
Yes
I have not because of FUCKING P4 I AM GOING TO COMMIT ARSON AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    ok ok calm down
        lol
Ye :)
Pure Vessel lol
    took me a while to get
yes I no longer have a social life
Nope, because GPZ hard walls me in the Pantheons
Can't do the PoH, Uumuu and GPZ kill me
    It's a bad combo. For uummuu, dash to him then pogo untill he spits flukes, drop down and abyss shriek. For zote... get gud is all I can think
That fourth fucking pantheon...
I'm at 111% and don't currently plan on getting 112%. I've only got p4 left and just can't bring myself to put in the effort necessary to beat it. I've only tried it like 5 times maybe
Trial of the fool is bugged with my PC and created strobing lights and sprites getting stuck on the screen.
    haven't heard that one before
I'm bad at battles

I found the PoP surprisingly easy tho
Pantheon of Hallownest
No because I haven’t done p2-5 and colo 3
Because I am bad at the game, and don't play the game all that often to hone my skills.
    that could be a problem
No, because I can’t beat Nosk and Traitor Lord (among plenty of other bosses…)
    those are weird ones. Just practice is best for those if you ask me
Is rather not break my controller with the first album pantheon
I have on my switch, but not pc cuz I just can’t be bothered to
I have, but I really want to complete the fifth pantheon but I am finding it difficult to be motivated to do so and I have not touched the game in a couple weeks.
I just started playing
í've just gotten the game, not even a month ago
Yes, now I’m ready for Silksong
    well guess what? WAIT
im bad and the fools challenge is hard
Havent because lazy and I suck
I know its not part of the percentage but I want to beat the fool trial before godhome
    understandable
I can't even beat the base level gray prince. You want me to beat him but *f a s t*
almost there but overwatch 2 decided to be available for download today
    not a common crossover community
I haven't yet

because I'm too busy with school now, and because i fucking hate Sly and can't beat the third pantheon xd
    be calm, don't join that guy somewhere down in the comments with his arson plan
No. And time
Too bad to beat Dream Bosses
    they used to be so hard for me, but I can get all of them easily now. keep practicing
Help me, ive done everything except P5AB, and im trying to do it.
    just practice the bosses you have trouble with. Follow the precepts: always win your battles.
I haven’t done any of the Pantheons, I will at some point, I’m just too lazy rn
Collo of fools
Pantheon 4 keeps kicking my ass
Markoth and absolute radiant. I got 111% man
    ya. you can do it!
Yes. Steel soul to.
Edit: cause I have no friends
I prefer to spend my time with various games, don't like the idea of having a main game for too much time.  


Also i suck so it would take a lot of time.
I beat this game like 3 years ago, and have been slowly beating it as time goes on. At this point, all I have left to do in the whole game:

-Defeat the absolute radiance on ascended and radiant difficulty (I have every other boss in hall of gods radiant) 

-Pantheon 4 bindings 

-beat Pantheon 5, also with bindings
111%. only missing pantheon 4, which I haven't been able to beat yet
Not before defeating lost kin
Pantheon 4 is hard :/
I’m just sick of NKG tbh
yes 💪💪 (I know, I’m awesome)
It's like Stardew Valley, you can, but you are so lazy to do it.
because i don’t hate myself enough to do path of pain or absolute radiance
Yea, it was pretty hard tho
How do you know which percentage of the game are you in?
No. P4
I have once but never again lol
I suck and I don’t have the time like I used to when I first started playing
Because it's fucking hard.
110%

Gave up at the pantheons.
I've only 111% the game about a bug in void
Have. Was a teenager at the time during the summer holidays. What a time to be alive.
I want to but I know I won’t
I have, I’ve done every achievement, every secret everything
“Did you get gud? If not, why?”
I haven’t and won’t because school
Nah, I got a couple of the endings but never did any godhome stuff or a lot of optional bosses or the last colosseum trial. I was drawn in by the exploration, and suffered boss grinds only so I could keep exploring. When that was over, I was done.
I’m at 111% I keep dying to pure vessel in pantheon of the knight. Annoying thing is I’ve defeated him so many times in the hall of gods. I can’t take the pressure.
The game is too hard for me lol
I haven’t. Because I can’t be bothered to scour the internet for the last 6%
Just need to beat p5
Im at 110 on both my normal save and my Steel Soul save, for some reason I just can't beat Nailsage Sly
I completed the story and got all the abilities and badges, more than content to just watch people who are actually good at the game do everything else.

I've seen so many speed runs that it feels like I did it all myself at this point lol
PATHEON 3 IN GOD HOME
I beat the Pantheon of Hallownest and was met with a 111% on the title screen. Must have missed a wanderer’s journal or something but I’m too salty to go back and finish it
Have been having trouble beating the radiance, not sure what to do other than get good
Hit 99%, and got into other games
I beat the Radiance and my monkey brain immediately went “okay you finished the game play something else now”

The only game I have truely 100% was LEGO Marvel Superheroes
I have not. Reason: Pantheon of the Sage
cause I go outside
I have a really hard time doing certain things. 

I also seem to be quite dumb and have gotten stuck on bosses only to realize that I am MAJORLY underpowered because I forgot to do certain things. it took an embarrassingly long time to beat hornet in kingdom’s edge because I was missing an ability + like 2 charm notches

doing better tho! i’ll probably take ages to beat it still just because of how bad I am at boss fights lmao
No 110% because of the trial of fools and the 4th pantheon mainly the pure vessel
I am stuck on pure vessel, so not past 110% yet
I have. But I never bothered to commit to beating P5 because it wasn’t part of the 112% so now I feel like I stopped shorting of fulling finishing.
Of course I have. Game good
I can’t beat the pantheons
I haven't because NKG exists
Hinestly, I just don't feel like it. Love the game, but when only Colloseum of fools nr.3 was left plus the pantheons, I felt it was time to just put it away. Would love to finish off steel soul, but the game is kinda like Majoras mask for me, where that first playthrough was so special, going through it again really doesn't tempt me. Still the game is a 9/10 for me. Practicaly perfect and might be my favourite of all time. At least the most impactful and special for me
not yet.

pantheon 4 is fucking hard, especially getting a good run where I am able to defeat pv. not talking about hall of gods.

I'm at 11%
The damn pantheons and trial of the fool
P3 Zote
One world: Pantheon 5
One world: Pantheon 5
I have completed it a week ago
no

trial of the fool
Yes I have. In fact hollow knight was the first game I ever got a platinum for (100%).
I don’t have the time to get good enough for P5
No because phanteon 4 💀
I beat p5 but am too lazy to get all charms lol
Pantheon 5 that’s it that’s the reason
I’ll raise you one. Have you gotten 112% on steel soul?
No, PV is a jerk and wont let me win in P4. I can beat him in the hall, not in the pantheon ;-;
I did very recently, since I really enjoyed the game, I’m currently trying P5 runs
Yep, 3 times
Once I realized Godhome existed I became too stubborn to leave the game be even when p3 was driving me crazy (and then I slaved over practicing absrad in the hall until I got good enough to beat p5 because I couldn't not do that either)
Yes, and beaten all bosses except Absolute Radiance on Radiant. I haven't done P5 bindings either.
yes
I probably will someday but not for now, was busy with fromsoft games, actually Dark Souls is probably the game that ended up leading me to HK too

To busy dying to sly
Sure, because I don't have Friends or anything else in my life
Switch joycons slowly degraded and I so scared of braking my switch that I don't want to fix it (switch lite, so I can't send it to nintendo)
Just yesterday I beat the radiance for the first time after like, a hundred tries. I'm done now.
No. Because its hard
cus why should I. Ive done everything thats fun
Because 2 pantheons left. And a potato pc
I havent since my pc can not handle the trial of the fool, but once i have a better pc i will get 112% easy (111%)
I have, more times than I would like to admit
I was wondering when someone would ask this. I have such a huge backlog of games to finish. I always figured that I would go back for some different endings and mess around with the DLC when I had made a bigger dent in the backlog.
I havnt beaten all the stuff in the god home. Havnt beaten path of pain. Havnt gotten the hunters mark. Not sure if all these things are required but those are some things I havnt done.
I’ve 111% the game, the pantheon of Hallownest is just too much bro.
Absolutely not, because a.) I'm not that good and b.) I cherish my sanity.
I’m at 111% right now. Trying to beat the pure vessel in their pantheon. Then it’s the radiance pantheon. Gods help me
I typically don't derive a lot of joy from doing something that does not reward me.
P5 can go crawl back to the dream world ):
I did, almost beat PoH too but my switch broke lmao
Trial of the fool…
Radiance
I did. It was hard as fuck but glad I persevered. Very rewarding.
can’t be bothered
    nooo
I haven’t yet but plan on it
I have because I had a lot of fun in the pantheons.

I have not ascended PoH because I wouldn't have had fun.
I haven't because skill issue
I just can't beat the Pantheons. . . I'd love to get platinum for this game because I love it so much but these challenges just break me. . .
Same thing + lazy :/
same x) and I HATE 
Colosseum of Fools
    The colosseum is the least if your problems when doing 112%
        \* Flashing memories of a certain transport quest in HK \*
            YOU BROKE IT AGAIN YOU FUCKING IDIOT, THESE ARE RARE YOU KNOW! Anyway here's another one, I know I said it before the last 386 times but this is the last one.
                You said to yourself at 4 AM in the morning after having tried since the afternoon 😂
    Nailmasters Glory makes it a walk in the park.

I couldn't beat it before using that. Some of the no floor sections are just so challenging.
Saaame
Me too
this seems to be a common theme
    Because it's unbalanced, and it has way too many bosses in a  row.
        It's all about practice. It's meant to be an optional sequence for those who truly want to test their skill. Once you remember the attack patterns you can easily go through one entire sequence without losing much health. The hall of gods is basically a practice arena for that.
            It's a  terrible post-game area that drains you of that good feeling you get from beating a boss, because beating one boss is worthless there. I would have beaten it all by now if it was one boss at a time and you didn't need to kill a bunch of them in a row. All except Nightmare King Grimm and the Absolute Radiance. 4 bosses in a row would have been fine too, but the amount is so excessive. And they reuse bosses all the time, which is even more annoying.
                That's the challenge of it. Fighting the same boss again one at a time is basically just repetition of the game itself. Which is why it's been converted to back to back boss fight. It's not at all impossible, a couple of tries and you'll automatically start to understand the patterns and react accordingly. I was intimidated at first seeing the number of bosses but its doable after a couple of attempts. It basically tests that you are truly capable of taking on any boss in the game no matter the handicap. 

If you're struggling with a section it just indicates that you are not prepared enough. It can be boring for some people but most of the folks like me just love that the game forces you to push beyond your comfort level to get better.
                    I already can't play Hollow Knight at all right now because of how horrible the Pantheons were and how many hours I wasted on them already. In the end, I just don't enjoy the Pantheons, which are just the extra post-game challenges. I'd rather replay the actual game.
        *clears throat* GIT GUD
            People who say that shit are the worst.
        You just need to git gud. I haven't played hollow knight in like a year and I bet I can do P5 first try
            Bro really said he could do P5 first try 💀
                I have beaten P5 before but it's been over a year. I wolud stream it if you're interested
                    Just because you've beaten it before doesn't mean you can beat it first try after not playing for a year
                        Check DM
                            Damn even though you didnt complete it thats really impressive. Sorry for being so rude
                                For anyone curious I died to failed champion
You don't need pantheons to gain 112%

Edit: I was wrong.
    Yes you do, P1-P4 all give 1% each
        Yeah, really. Sorry my bad
            All good :)
lol

.

.

oh wait that's true
Saaaaame
Do not upvote this any more, it's at 112!
    Now it’s at 259%
Sharp Shadow + Quick Slash + Shaman Stone. Just keep hitting it until it hits back then dash through it. If it rolled also dash through. If they are both infront of you shade soul. If you're in between descending dark
    I don’t have Sharp Shadow or Quick Slash yet - something tells me I need to do some exploring first…
        Just use dive the entire time with shamans, they will melt before you
There's also a way to kill one of them before the fight if you're really struggling.
Quickslash, fragile strength, mark of pride, soul catcher absolutely destroys them
    You forgot skill
        Not even dude. This build is just unga bunga
I got stuck on WK my first playthrough. Ran at them for over 5 hours, activated the last one once. Quit for years. Got sucked back in during lockdown but this time with a little bit of internet support.

I missed a *lot* of exploration in that first playthrough, and if I had just gone back I would have been intrinsically stronger and probably beat them.

Spoilers of some things I missed:

>!- Wasn't able to beat Mantis Lords early, so I went elsewhere. In my mind, they would have been harder than WK so I never went back. Never found Deepnest.!<

>!- City of Tears, I never went west of that first elevator entrance somehow, got fixated on those platforms to the right (I wonder if I ever made it all the way down, probably went straight into the sewers). Never upgraded my nail. Found ore but had no idea what to do with it.!<

>!- Never found Kingdom's Edge
!<

Moral of the story: if you hit a boss wall, go explore. I've now 112%'d it, and very glad I did.
    Hey i think that’s what I’m going to do, I’m under the impression I actually found them prematurely
I use mainly strength, quick focus, long nail, grubsong, soul catcher
    Builds like that work if you know the bosses' patterns. I prefer builds that work even when you don't know them.

In my first playthrough I beat THK first try by heal spamming. Thorns, Spores, Grubsong, Quick Focus, Defender's Crest, Stalwart Shell. It was hilarious.
        Lol Quick Fart build.
        That sounds like a mad crazy build I can’t believe I’ve never thought of combining all of those
            Fair warning, you won't be able to see what you're doing at all. Defender's Crest + Spores combo spawns an obnoxious amount of particles when you heal.
    For pantheons, and everything in general, just use the build most experienced players used.

Quick Slash, Strength, Shaman

2 notches left, I use longnail but it’s fairly interchangeable.

PV does 2 hearts of damage hurting grubsong and quick focus, quick slash,strength, and shamans are just so much damage you don’t want to give up.
Reached PV I assume? I got to about 33% win rate against him in practice then lucked out after a few attempts in the pantheon. Used the sharp shadow method rather than jumping. Tough and there is a tight cool-down window. Worst part is last phase where you have to stay out or range of tentacles or jump… muscle memory has you doing the opposite. 

Noped out of the final pantheon completely… I’ll never beat pure radiance.
    No, I haven't reached PV in Pantheon. I can't even beat him in Hall of Gods (though admittedly I haven't tried very hard). Once I beat P3, I basically abandoned that file.
        Pure Vessel reminded me a lot of Nightmare King Grimm. When you don’t know what you are doing, it’ll destroy you. But if you just spend time practicing dodging you’ll quickly (well, like 50 attempts but still just a few hours) get to the point where he’s almost easy. Because all his moves have strict patterns and strict timings.
same here, pv is fucking hard in p4
Yeah, getting through 3 was so time consuming and frustrating for me that I wasn't even about to attempt 4.
if you ever decide to come back i can give tips ✌ i have so much to say about the bosses in this game but literally no one cares lol
112 is far easier than Golden Berry runs! Especially if you're talking farewell lol. 🍓🍓🍓
    I know, but when I get used to the hollow knight controls it takes a while to revert back to “Celeste mode”
        I learned the hk controls first so I ended up remapping my Celeste controls to fit hk controls better.
        That's funny, I had the same problem going back to Celeste after getting really into HK, I ended up switching to using keyboard in Celeste when I used to use controller (dpad) for both.
    I got a bit into the wavedashing part of Farewell before I stopped playing! That chapter is really insane.
Im trying to get a golden in the  Oshiro haunted hotel level and its pain ;_;

Which one are you currently trying to get?
    I’m on the hotel chapter b-side. Pain.
        Oof if im struggling so much just on the hotel a-side I can imagine how much fun im going to have with the b-side lol😅

Also good luck!
            Thank you! 3a is tough, you’ll get it eventually!
I have done steel heart without save quitting but I am still struggling with 3A golden. Help me ;-;
As someone with all goldens except farewell

mood
    Join the club. I managed to do a run of Farewell with only 8 deaths, but that's still so far from 0.
I've got about five Goldens left myself, currently on a five month break lol
well... ok

BUT DO IT SOMETIME ok?
Same, now i'm stuck in both!
Nooooo
    Roguelites are like crack i swear
        100% I'm playing hades, it's more addictive than drugs
            Fr, i went on a vacation and played Hades for days
            Used to play Hades, abandoned it a few weeks ago for terraria
Same
    Same
Upgrade nail and get NMG
I can't even pass the Soul Master :(
    Do you have shaman stone?
trial of the fool was spikes and suffering
Good reasoning
I even used an easy mode mod and a  mod that let me equip every charm, and still died to Nightmare King Grimm, after getting through most of the 5th Pantheon.

Before that, I sort of ruined the game for myself trying over and over again to get through the Pantheons. I stopped when I realized that I am only trying to be a  completionist out of some compulsion, and not because I enjoy it... I like the game too much for it to be destroyed permanently though.
Most resonable human being right here. I actualy did 112% including Patheon 5 but idk if it was worth it. Sisters of battle and Pure vessel are cool fights and all but time I spent grinding to for P4 and ESPECIALY P5( I know p5 is not needed for 112% but I felt like I had to do it) made me quit HK for a year then this summer I replayed the game on PC and did P5. I do not feel like I became super good or am now a pro but like I am finaly done and can wait for Silksong
I just upgraded, played on switch, am now getting 112 pc. I tried on my old laptop, 15fps isn't enough either
Not needed for 112%. Only Pure Vessel is. If you are at the final pantheon but don’t have 112% you are missing something elsewhere.

Though it is needed to get all achievements.
understandable
This sounds like it's going somewhere good
    **It Will**
        lets goo
Strong recommendation. I don’t like dark souls, metroidvanias, or platformers.

Hollow Knight is in my top 3 games.
he gave me more trouble than pure vessel
Would you like a bit of advice on Sly?
    no thanks

&#x200B;

i'm at fifth stage of grief from now and for eternity
The trick that worked for me was just clinging to the walls and dashing over him for the first phase. It negates all but his double slash jumpspin move. Phase two you just gotta dash away when he charges you and swing back with mark of pride.
true. but that comment tells me enough
yooo same same
oh come on

regain the muscle memory
uhh... practice?
P5 is not needed for 112%
That is a weird one
I can get behind that view
just wait for nkg
    Oh my God no
        Don’t worry about nkg, abs Rad is so very much worse. Pure vessel isn’t a push over either.
You may as well use your main save for 112 if you get tired of early game. P4 is hard enough. As for speed running, to easily do that, just don't do greenpath fireball skip or explosion pogo. It is pretty easy then.
grind time
Did you type this up on your third monitor while in load screens?
    Lol, no I’m at work right now so regrettably not playing at the moment. 

It is how I’ve spent almost all of my free time since I got it though haha
        well that's a good reason, and a good way to spend free time
very true
those maks make all the difference
just practice I guess, try different charms
nice
definitely one of the most difficult portions of the game
ok this one is truly a good reason
You could banish him but then fight in Godhome when you have the time
do it, it shouldn't take too too many atempts
I know the feeling
took me a good few tries to beat them. You can do it, I'm now doing a challenge where I can't dash or use dive, doing it hitless
nice job!
nooo
It only gets easier

&#x200B;

unless you die break your hand, lose the game....
that's where I am lol
IVE FOUND ONE MODS OVER HER--
I can not help
EDENO
the grind is real
oof
\*Gud
I know the feeling
good job
well, so long as you haven't given up
wow
nooo you can do it
you can do it!
nice
I had that problem for a while. started a new save and let zote die
hard ones on the first playthrough, keep going!
lol
I have a friend with this problem
true
2nd hardest fight in the game
called godhome for a reason
noo we have another evil one guys
This is a bannable offence
your profile says 112% on it
    Thus, the joke. 🤦‍♂️
mmmmk
It’s not that bad
    Then I’m simply too lazy
        Fair
oof

&#x200B;

\*thinks of my own 200 hours in game\*
.... is difficult
lol just dash to her, then pogo next to her until she spits flukes, then dop down and abyss shriek until she dies
you can do it. Practice
if you saved zote oof
oof big mistake
And you didn't buy it??
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQ9TT0JbFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQ9TT0JbFY) If you aren't going to look, you may as well use this
factcheck: true
ok ok calm down
    lol
took me a while to get
It's a bad combo. For uummuu, dash to him then pogo untill he spits flukes, drop down and abyss shriek. For zote... get gud is all I can think
haven't heard that one before
that could be a problem
those are weird ones. Just practice is best for those if you ask me
well guess what? WAIT
understandable
not a common crossover community
be calm, don't join that guy somewhere down in the comments with his arson plan
they used to be so hard for me, but I can get all of them easily now. keep practicing
just practice the bosses you have trouble with. Follow the precepts: always win your battles.
ya. you can do it!

        YOU BROKE IT AGAIN YOU FUCKING IDIOT, THESE ARE RARE YOU KNOW! Anyway here's another one, I know I said it before the last 386 times but this is the last one.
            You said to yourself at 4 AM in the morning after having tried since the afternoon 😂
Nailmasters Glory makes it a walk in the park.

I couldn't beat it before using that. Some of the no floor sections are just so challenging.
Because it's unbalanced, and it has way too many bosses in a  row.
    It's all about practice. It's meant to be an optional sequence for those who truly want to test their skill. Once you remember the attack patterns you can easily go through one entire sequence without losing much health. The hall of gods is basically a practice arena for that.
        It's a  terrible post-game area that drains you of that good feeling you get from beating a boss, because beating one boss is worthless there. I would have beaten it all by now if it was one boss at a time and you didn't need to kill a bunch of them in a row. All except Nightmare King Grimm and the Absolute Radiance. 4 bosses in a row would have been fine too, but the amount is so excessive. And they reuse bosses all the time, which is even more annoying.
            That's the challenge of it. Fighting the same boss again one at a time is basically just repetition of the game itself. Which is why it's been converted to back to back boss fight. It's not at all impossible, a couple of tries and you'll automatically start to understand the patterns and react accordingly. I was intimidated at first seeing the number of bosses but its doable after a couple of attempts. It basically tests that you are truly capable of taking on any boss in the game no matter the handicap. 

If you're struggling with a section it just indicates that you are not prepared enough. It can be boring for some people but most of the folks like me just love that the game forces you to push beyond your comfort level to get better.
                I already can't play Hollow Knight at all right now because of how horrible the Pantheons were and how many hours I wasted on them already. In the end, I just don't enjoy the Pantheons, which are just the extra post-game challenges. I'd rather replay the actual game.
    *clears throat* GIT GUD
        People who say that shit are the worst.
    You just need to git gud. I haven't played hollow knight in like a year and I bet I can do P5 first try
        Bro really said he could do P5 first try 💀
            I have beaten P5 before but it's been over a year. I wolud stream it if you're interested
                Just because you've beaten it before doesn't mean you can beat it first try after not playing for a year
                    Check DM
                        Damn even though you didnt complete it thats really impressive. Sorry for being so rude
                            For anyone curious I died to failed champion
Yes you do, P1-P4 all give 1% each
    Yeah, really. Sorry my bad
        All good :)
Now it’s at 259%
I don’t have Sharp Shadow or Quick Slash yet - something tells me I need to do some exploring first…
    Just use dive the entire time with shamans, they will melt before you
You forgot skill
    Not even dude. This build is just unga bunga
Hey i think that’s what I’m going to do, I’m under the impression I actually found them prematurely
Builds like that work if you know the bosses' patterns. I prefer builds that work even when you don't know them.

In my first playthrough I beat THK first try by heal spamming. Thorns, Spores, Grubsong, Quick Focus, Defender's Crest, Stalwart Shell. It was hilarious.
    Lol Quick Fart build.
    That sounds like a mad crazy build I can’t believe I’ve never thought of combining all of those
        Fair warning, you won't be able to see what you're doing at all. Defender's Crest + Spores combo spawns an obnoxious amount of particles when you heal.
For pantheons, and everything in general, just use the build most experienced players used.

Quick Slash, Strength, Shaman

2 notches left, I use longnail but it’s fairly interchangeable.

PV does 2 hearts of damage hurting grubsong and quick focus, quick slash,strength, and shamans are just so much damage you don’t want to give up.
No, I haven't reached PV in Pantheon. I can't even beat him in Hall of Gods (though admittedly I haven't tried very hard). Once I beat P3, I basically abandoned that file.
    Pure Vessel reminded me a lot of Nightmare King Grimm. When you don’t know what you are doing, it’ll destroy you. But if you just spend time practicing dodging you’ll quickly (well, like 50 attempts but still just a few hours) get to the point where he’s almost easy. Because all his moves have strict patterns and strict timings.
I know, but when I get used to the hollow knight controls it takes a while to revert back to “Celeste mode”
    I learned the hk controls first so I ended up remapping my Celeste controls to fit hk controls better.
    That's funny, I had the same problem going back to Celeste after getting really into HK, I ended up switching to using keyboard in Celeste when I used to use controller (dpad) for both.
I got a bit into the wavedashing part of Farewell before I stopped playing! That chapter is really insane.
I’m on the hotel chapter b-side. Pain.
    Oof if im struggling so much just on the hotel a-side I can imagine how much fun im going to have with the b-side lol😅

Also good luck!
        Thank you! 3a is tough, you’ll get it eventually!
Join the club. I managed to do a run of Farewell with only 8 deaths, but that's still so far from 0.
Roguelites are like crack i swear
    100% I'm playing hades, it's more addictive than drugs
        Fr, i went on a vacation and played Hades for days
        Used to play Hades, abandoned it a few weeks ago for terraria
Same
Do you have shaman stone?
**It Will**
    lets goo
no thanks

&#x200B;

i'm at fifth stage of grief from now and for eternity
Oh my God no
    Don’t worry about nkg, abs Rad is so very much worse. Pure vessel isn’t a push over either.
Lol, no I’m at work right now so regrettably not playing at the moment.
