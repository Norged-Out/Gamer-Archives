        Do you have an artstation or personal art blog? Would love to see more of your work!
            Actually, yea. Artstation and Instagram. In insta you can find me by nick "hellg_forge". I post more art in my Insta. Thank you!!
                You have a tremendous amount of talent my man or woman! Your felt dolls look adorable. 

My personal favorite has to be your drunk hero sketch. Look at him. He's totally done for the day.
                    Awwww! Thank you so much! Really appreciate it! Damn.. hollow knight community is so awesome
                        I think the folks here would love your Hornet fanart as well
                            Actually, I've draw Hornet even before Knight. I'll upload Hornet art soon ðŸ¤º
    Is gud
Holy shit that is good
Looks sick mate! Do you have a phone wallpaper version of it by any chance?
    Ahah) I think you can use this image. Thank you!
        Unfortunately the knight doesn't fully fit in the screen when you zoom to fit the whole screen. But thanks anyway mate!
I love it! Nice work!
For some odd reason, this is giving me Ori and the Blind Forest vibes.
    It's the blue I'm telling you.
Thats awesome.
You expect me to believe that isnâ€™t computer generated ( thatâ€™s really good!)
    Ahaha) Thank you!
        Ur welcome!
Did you beat it at 100%
    I must check it. I beat everything except Pantheon (cuz omg).
        Well even if you did 100% it, you still have to do steel soul
            Totaly agree. I'll try speed run it on a steel soul. Just need to have some free time :D
                I definitely do not recommend trying to speedrun Steel Soul.
Wow amazing art!
