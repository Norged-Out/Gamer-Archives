[[I was sweating at the final boss. (5hr achievement)]]


I got to HK in 2 hours and 13 minutes. Needless to say, he is bloody hard with just 5 masks and 1 upgrade to nail. 


Good job, now youre ready to do speed completion
    once you do speedrun 2, speed completion in 20 hours is honestly no sweat. I think it took me around 12 hours and I comfortably completed it
    Is speed completion 100% in 20 hours? I actually did that before this one haha

        once you do speedrun 2, speed completion in 20 hours is honestly no sweat. I think it took me around 12 hours and I comfortably completed it
    I've done speed completion in 10 hrs with steel heart but i've not done speedrun 2
        Did the same. Wanted steelheart and saw that I was on time to complete speed completion as well!
Good job! But that % is the lowest I've ever seen! Hahaha
    Iirc 16% completion is what you get in the any% NMG speedrun.
    I think it's the lowest you can get without some insane strats
        Not insane necessarily, just some decently difficult skips
            I think to get 23 percent you have to grind a lot of essence without dream bosses, making the run really long
                That’s only for Dream No More ending, the actual minimum percent is like 16 or something like that. The essence grind is unnecessary if you’re just going for the normal ending

Edit: nvm, I just looked it up and the actual minimum is 11%

Edit again: or 8% with some extra glitches
I did this achievement recently and was also similarly very close. Only difference is Hollow Knight only took maybe 20 minutes, but I was on a tight enough schedule that it could've been a run killer if I didn't focus. Luckily his patterns are pretty clearly telegraphed.

What REALLY made me waste a lot of time were the Watcher Knights. I just could not defeat them with 5 masks and one nail upgrade. I had to leave to get Shaman Stone and the fireball upgrade to kill them, and that took a bit.
    Lol I just spammed desolate dive because of the invincibility frames and somehow beat the watcher knights
    With watcher knights it’s often more effective to just get the nail upgrade afterwards and just rely on shamened spells as they get more health when you upgrade your nail
        Only nail 3 and 4 give them more health, so you can do 2 upgrades - which for speed completion is often all you will get.
            That’s cool thanks for telling me
    I usually go down to mantis Lord after getting the claw so I can use long nail
Nice! I've tried that so many times. Maybe I should pick it up again.
    Fireborn has a steam guide with photos of the path to take if you require guidance. Definitely helps with pathing.
I did it this weekend too! 

Took me 4hr 30 min and got 46%. Technicallty coukd have been quicker, but I wanted to prepare a bit more
    Yeah I definitely had time to prepare more but instead thought “3 hours will be plenty for HK right?” Wrong haha
        YOU SPENT AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES ON THK!?!?? 

That unbielivable. Did you just not get wings or what? I have trouble thinking someone could spend so long on a boss who I complained about for being too easy in my first playthrough. Idk maybe dont get nail upgrades and abuse spells?
            Yep! No wings in this run (follows Fireborn’s pathing guide). My first playthrough I thought he was very easy as well but of course I had wings, the dark versions of vengeful sprit and ddark, full nail etc. Here it’s just 1 nail upgrade, and base skills, 5 masks. 

I even had a run that went over the 5 hours, I just sucked at HK :( but the practice has definitely helped!
That's basically me back then. Follow a speed run path to get to the HK and spend like almost 2 hours fighting him. I beat him like 2nd try on my original run. It was so difficult without all the upgrades and double jump and shade dash
    Yeah the run before this went over 5 hours so I would have been quite upset if this failed too haha
good job
I got into a similar situation in mine, and what I did is reload my first save (non-speedrun one) and practiced the HK fight repeatedly with no charms on until I could reliably beat it while taking less than 5 hits of damage.

Then I loaded back into my speedrun save and beat him with a few minutes to spare.
    Pretty much exactly what I did haha I had a save that went over the 5 hour mark and just practiced him there until I felt confident to return to this save (at 4.5 hours) and thankfully got it first or second try. Was very relieved!
Love the background setup. That's a true gamers one
I did this too recently, but I was struggling way more with watcher knights than HK😭
    I did struggle with watcher knights at first too but I now seem to have them down to first try attempts. I got dream nail before hand and you can fill up on soul as they’re spawning and spam D-dive on them 2 at a time.
I spent more time getting nail upgrades and stuff, but I guess that helps a lot more than I thought
    I definitely should have after 2 hours, I thought 3 hours would be enough to do HK but time flies when you’re failing / learning haha
up
Try steel soul speedrun completion
    Yep just started that now although it probably wont be a speed run haha
        I got 4 achievments in under 10 hours (coulda shaved it down to 5 and 5 achievemnts if I ignored godhome)
Beat the game for the first time yesterday!  99% completion only took me 24 hours in game playtime and now i’m sad it’s “over”.
    There’s still 13% to go for!
I remember going for the speedrun achievements, for whatever reason i could swear there was one for 2 hours, so i made a whole plan of the route, screwed up a bunch of stuff because i'd never done it before, and still somehow did it in less than 2 hours.  
Then i realized i did that for nothing
Wait wait wait!!! How in the heck???? 
I suck at video games but I cannot imagine doing this game in the time you show. I’m soo curious what that speed looks like. You have videos of gameplay? Cuz that’s insane!!!
    Hey man, this is after weeks of practice and still considered a little slow haha. I think the world record is 31 minutes. My first playthrough which fully explored everything was over 100 hours.
Good i got the achievement in 3.5 hour it was fun
    Yeah with a bit more HK practice, I think I could get this down to 2.5. I just spent so long on him
Just got all 3 speedrun achievements AGAIN on steam this time myself (already did switch, + Xbox)

I'm gonna let you know my best tip, get shade soul asap, and use shaman, simple as that. That spell is so bs. Honestly they all are. Spells are so strong.
congratulations on your achievement my friend, it cost me to complete this achievement
    Thank you. What did it cost you?
        it took me 2 weeks to reach 5 hours
nice. now to beat the final boss
    I’ve done radiance on my first playthrough. I’m at 110% because I can’t beat P3. Damn Zote killing my runs haha
nice, but that’s not the final boss ;)

    Which pale ore did you grab? The additional damage would certainly help. Why wouldn’t you grab Ddark?
        The Ancient Basin Pale Ore is the easiest to get. If you are getting into city through the tram, like you would do in the Steel Soul speedrun, it's right on the way. Even if you got to city through blue like, it should only take you maybe five to ten minutes of time loss to go down there and back up
            I’m literally just starting my first steel soul run now so I’ll keep that in mind
                The path you might wanna take is: Vengeful Spirit -> Dash -> Claw -> Deepnest -> Tram Pass -> Pale Ore -> City. If you save 4 grubs in Crossroads, 3 in Greenpath, 1 in Wastes on the way to Deepnest, and 2 in Deepnest, that's exactly enough Grubs to get Grubsong, the best charm for survivability in the game IMO. You also get a mask shard from that, which you can combine with the shard in Crossroads, the shard in Queen's Station, and the shard in Sly's to get a full mask fairly easily and without much time loss.
                    Thanks heaps for the tips / route!
                    Is early deepnest good for steel soul? I mean, I did early deepnest on my first playtrhough, but is it good for steel soul?
                        If you take the correct route, it's not that bad. You are avoiding the hardest part of Deepnest with the spiders, and you can save on the bench near the tram, go and grab the tram pass, then wiit and return to that bench. The scariest part there is probably the Carver Hatchers, but you can avoid them pretty easily since you don't have to make your way back.
                If you're doing a steel soul, remember you are not in a hurry, so get prepared the best you can for every boss fight, it's better to do it in 30 hours patiently than hurrying up and dying 10 hours in
        Im not really sure od i had nail 3 or 2 but i did speedrun strats and had only about 3 hours do i fot some pale ores and upgraded my nail
        Personally for speedrun 2 I find a spell build much easier as you can get spell twister, shaman stone, ddark and shade soul with like an hour of detour and that’s easily enough to beat all the bosses.
    I did it in a hour and a half using fireb0rn's guide
        1:50 with the same guide!
        I watched a lot od speedruns and it was my first time speedrunning, i didnt need any guide
    How?
        SPEED!
    why did you get downvoted?
        I don’t downvote personally but maybe because people seeing it as shitting on my achievement haha instead of saying good job? He just opens with “here’s my time, it’s easy”.
            well… thinking it, that could be right.

anyways, great timer!
        reddit ppl weird
