[[Silk song hype]]





Just in love with that !
Nice neon
Don't give me hope like that
... why do you do this to me, I tought there would’ve been a silksong update due to the post titel :,(
I want it in neon lights on my wall
I love the art & its style
question:when is the silksong release date i genuinely dont know
    Neither do we lmao
    whenever team cherry feels the game is finished
        It'll probably be a little while longer then, they probably won't feel satisfied until the team can agree it's an improvement on hollow Knight.
            Fuck, guess we're never gonna see Silksong then, because how could one possibly improve Hollow Knight??
                I'm sure there are ways, no game is perfect, especially in the eyes of it's dev team
                    Probably, but to me HK is one of very few games where I would say it did absolutely everything right in my eyes :D
                        My only flaw is the horrible effects that turning on v sync had. It either shifted the screen so i appeared to be somewhere slightly off to where i was or just fucked with my inputs. Doesnt matter until you try the path and realise how bad it gets. But gameplay wise its amazing and i felt it did what it needed to.
Silksong Release Date: TBD

Karma Farmers: It's free real estate.

Downvote if you want, speaking my mind feels way too good.
What even is Silksong? Never heard of it... neither did devs for sure.
    It's a new game coming up for the Hollow knight series so it's like Hollow knight two
        My comment is abviously sarcastic and refering to a lack of new information about Silksong

            Kinda weird dude
            Not that obvious, you must be on a whole 'nother level of smarts. We should bow down to this lad fellas.
            That was indeed obvious to anyone with a brain, don't mind these people
    Nonexistent
    It's "neither"
        Thanks for helping a non native speaker, any criticism appreciated.
My flare.
Wonderful job, Birb.
Great pic, but I’ve lost hype. I’m looking forward to the game but at this point until there’s an update about release, I’m not paying it any mind. It’s just sad to see the days pass with no updates or info, I’d rather pay attention to other upcoming games or releases
    I prefer they take their time to make the game as awesome as possible rather than rushing the release like most devs nowadays.
        Yea that’s fine, I don’t care how long it takes, but being left in the dark is what killed the hype for me
            It's weird to me anyway how we live in that hype culture where it's all about hyping games waaaay before release, about teasers, trailers, pre-orders and  in the end only very few games actually deliver, simply because peoples' expectations have been driven way beyond anything reasonable.

We both know as soon as Team Cherry releases some new trailer or gameplay footage or maybe another boss theme,  your hype will be back in no time buddy xD
    So basically you're joining the sane population? 

Welcome! What took you so long?
        Lost hype a long time ago, 5 months in to be exact
            Having hype isn't mutually exclusive from being rational. My comment was tongue-in-cheek if you didn't know. My point is that patience is a virtue and that trying to rush the release of something you're looking forward to is selfish and many people still need to be told that.
No nosk 2 electric boogaloo spoilers!
Is there any news on the release?
    I dunno, what does google say?
        Same thing the fox says
I love how minimalist it is, perfect.
is the exact datum known?
Yes very nice reminds me about how long I’ll have to wait for silk song
Neither do we lmao
