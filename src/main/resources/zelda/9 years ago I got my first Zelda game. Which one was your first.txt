[[9 years ago I got my first Zelda game. Which one was your first]]





good lord....the first one on nes. i was really young but still liked to run around on my parent's file
    I actually had aLttP first despite owning a NES for several years before the SNES
        that was my 2nd one. i was a bit older so i was able to read and enjoy the story. i think that's partly why lttp is my favorite of the series
        me too, aLttP was the second game I ever played. I got stuck all the time and my mom had to help me with the harder parts. She is surprisingly good at that game lol.
    Og gold cart and never left
        i still have it too, though the nes was lost a long time ago
    I was actually old (and fortunate) enough to have my first experience on LoZ at 9. Played every game up to OOT and didn't really pick the series back up proper until BOTW.

Imagine how much people our age have seen in the world of gaming. Mind blowing.
        i dont feel quite as old then, i was around 2 i think when we had the first one. right? it's baffling to actually sit down and think about how things used to look compared to know. even when the internet was first starting to pick up and finding [gamefaq.com](https://gamefaq.com) early on was a huge game changer, and i will admit i did call the nintendo hotline once; i was stuck in alttp in turtle rock and couldn't find the secret key for months. it felt so obvious after the helpline told me what to do xD
Mine was twilight princess
    Same
    can’t imagine…
I grew up with OoT but was too young to beat it so Wind Waker came then TP, which was phenomenal as ever. Loved the motion controls. Miss em in TOTK now.
        i almost exclusively use gyro aiming in totk and its the best
    TP was like my first real experience with a real game. So freaking cool.
Zelda 2: Adventure of Link. I feel so old.
    This is mine also. It was so difficult. Or that’s how I remember it anyway.
    I was the big blue Bot (slime thing) for Halloween at age 8. Lots of fabric and newspaper.
WIND WAKER didn’t even know Zelda was a *whole thing* when I played it, I just liked it for the game. 

Googled the title one time and now, roughly four years later, I’m in multiple Zelda subreddits, literally playing TotK for most of today.

I regret nothing.
    WIND WAKER WAS MY FIRST, its still my fav in the franchuse and one of my fav games ever
    Welcome! May you have a life of Zelda's to look forward to.
        Thank you!! :D
First Zelda game I played? ALTTP. First Zelda game I bought? Wind Waker.
First legend of zelda, however my personal favorite has always been Link's Awakening DX
36 years ago, I got my first Zelda game. 

It was called “The Legend of Zelda”.
    Same I have experienced the whole timeline to today. My personal favorites were Breath of the Wild, Windwaker, Ocarina of Time. I most want to see remakes of Minish Cap (probably never happen as it was made by Capcom), Majora’s Mask and Seasons/Ages. They could use the links awakening engine in my opinion especially for seasons/ages. Majora’s Mask needs a full 3d update like they did for Metroid Prime Remaster. Windwaker just needs to be rereleased on switch it was already “made” he. The 40th Anniversary is coming up in a couple of years so I would love to see a remaster again of Ocarina and Majora’s mask together. I think the most overrated Zelda is Link to the past. I have played it and in my opinion Ocarina was way better. Most underrated is Spirit Tracks, Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity and NintendoLand Zelda Battlequest. Worst games are Zelda CDI, Zelda 2 (the only game to level up by kill experience and grinding) anything that is a Tingle game and Links Crossbow training.  I will never forget the first time seeing a Goron and getting the master sword repaired. I got that same feeling when I paraglided in BOTW. I will never forget Beetle saying thank you in Windwaker I wish he did that in all the games or Error in Zelda 2 because it seemed like they knew or Saria in the woods or Sheik or Lon Lon Ranch or Skullkid and the moon. No one steals Epona no one. Such a great series.
The collection on the GameCube for Christmas like 20 years ago haha
    Same! So I can’t remember if the first one was wind waker, ocarina of time or Majora’s mask.
    It bothers me so much that they left off Link to the Past. Link’s Awakening I can get over, but arguably the best 2D game in the series?!
I loved this one. My first was the first zelda game. My aunt owned it
    Yeah it’s awesome. I was young when I got it, I remember being at a restaurant seeing my cousin play it and it looked like an awesome game, flash forward a year and my mom took me to GameStop and that’s where I got the game.
I played Ocarina of Time on and off when I was 7-8 years old, and I beat it when I was 9 or 10 with the help of a magazine guide! Every OoT remake got me psyched, too. I love guiding friends and family who are new to the game because I basically know it by heart.
    This was my first too. I watched my older brother beat it and was hooked. Even as an adult I would play through it again whenever I was having a hard time and needed distraction.
        A timeless classic! I'm glad I can just whip it up on 3DS when I need it.
    I did the exact same thing except with Majora’s Mask! Kind of a freaky intro to the series but I loved it as a kid.
        That's awesome! Majora hits the same as OoT for me except that I didn't beat it until I got my 3DS lol. I freaking love this franchise.
A link to the past was my first one!
Minish Cap on an emulator.. I didn't grow up playing loz, but fell in love with the series in my teens.
NES Zelda.
Mine was Majora's mask let me just say not my favorite my favorite would be ocarina of Time
Probably Spirit Tracks if I remember right. Second one was Ocarina of Time remake. My uncle told be he played it in his childhood and so recommended the remake to me.
When my family got a Wii my brother's favourite colour was yellow so my dad bought the Loz skyward sword to give him the golden remote
I was allowed to play the game since my brother wasn't interested and I instantly fell in love with the game
NES The Legend of Zelda, it was a long time ago! I bought a Switch a couple years ago, my first Nintendo product since SNES. I loved BTOW, Link's Awakening was amazing and I absolutely cannot stop playing TOTK!
    Yeah I’m a bit obsessed with tears, I’ve already passed my playtime of botw and I’m still working on the main quest line
My first Zelda was the remaster of Ocarina of Time for the 3DS. I am so glad I picked it up. I think this was around 2011-2012, just as I was finishing high school and I remember staying up late doing the dungeons and following along to YouTube walkthroughs for areas I couldn't figure out. My mind was blown. I played a handful of other Zelda titles after that but didn't get sucked in like OoT until Botw and now Tears.
OOT I watched my brothers friend play it and I said I'd like to play that game. When he was finished with it he gave me the game. To this day it's still one of my favorite games.
Ocarina of Time before I could even read.  I would replay the first two dungeons every couple months and inevitably get stuck cuz yk I couldn’t read lol
You started hella stronk.
Bros first Zelda was link between world ffs I’m so old…
Skyward Sword was my first
My first game was Oracle of Seasons, but Ocarina 3D was the first one I actually completed.
I got Twilight Princess for the Wii when I was a kid. I didn’t have the attention span to get past the beginning of the game. After falling in love with Breath of the Wild I bought a Wii U to play as many Zelda games as possible. Beating Twilight Princess was amazing, but I wish my first Zelda was Wind Waker.
Ocarina of Time
Botw
Ocarina of Time on N64

Would still replay to this day.
Ocarina of time, Majoras mask or a link to the past idk which one was my first but I played all of them
The legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
The Legend of Zelda
Bro my first one was BOTW. I loved it. 610 hours day and night.
Ocarina of time
Funny enough tried emulating LA and Minish cap on my phone a few years back. Never got into it as a kid during the n64/GameCube days but I love TOTK so I’d say it’ll be the first I finish
    Definitely easier to emulate on pc, only game I’ve ever emulated though was four swords adventures
Lowkey this was my first game I might have stole it from my cousin as a child….but hey at least it’s my favorite series now!
Maybe it's because A Link to the Past is my favorite Zelda game, but this is a game that I absolutely love returning to at least once a year. Great first Zelda game!
The original gold nes cartridge
My first was the first one. A friend had the gold version.
My first was a link to the past when it was rereleased on the GBA. I could have played other ones before that but I was into Pokemon first
Gold cartridge
My first was Botw. After that I got Oot, Mm and Lbw
    Was it weird going from the gameplay style of botw to the gameplay style of OoT or MM
        Oh absolutely, it was weird being on a fixed path with the main story  but I still really enjoyed it. My favorite being Majoras mask.
3DS OOT SQUAD
Twilight Princess on the Wii. Watched my sister play it first and it looked so fun. Never got to complete the game until I got it for the WiiU
Alttp, still either favorite or second favorite. Never played link between worlds but would like to one day.
1997 - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (SNES)
I have that game for the three ds Xl
Legend of Zelda -NES. 
That being said, My favorite will forever be:
Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time.
Mine were either ocarina of time or link between worlds
OOT 3DS Remake
The Legend of Zelda
Oot, but I don't remember if I ever got past water temple.
Original NES game. I was 7. Started an obsession that has lasted 35 years. Now I’m 150 hours into totk.
I did play the first Zelda on the original Nintendo when it was a NEW game (I’m old).
I'm 36, so for me it was LttP. It was just... So radically different and grand compared to everything else. Between that and Final Fantasy, I was convinced Japan was just the best at everything.
My first Zelda was aLttP,   had the Atari for the longest time,  then the genesis, followed by the snes, never owned the nes,
This is not a flex because I was like 5 or 6 at the time and did not vibe w it at all then but the original Zelda on nes was my first hands on to the series. Link between worlds is a wonderful game.
Link's Awakening. Then the Oracle games. The first one I played that actually took place in Hyrule was Ocarina of Time, and I remember being so excited getting out of the forest and seeing all the things I'd only heard about, *and* finally getting to meet the title character of the freaking franchise!
Reminds me I need to finish this one lol
Funny thing the prequel to your first was my first! Back in 2004 i got my first gameboy advance sp, and along with with i got pokemon ruby,emerald, and sapphire. Best of all i got LOZ Link to the past! Its been a staple for me in my journey through each and every game. Honestly Tears of the Kingdom has come close to taking my favorite 😂
    TotK is amazingly good, but majoras mask will always be my favorite, it’s probably nostalgia but I just love the story of the game so much and it has a feeling to it like no other Zelda game
        Man i love majoras mask! My current order of favorites is LTTP, TOTK, OOT, MM! All of them really cant be compared in how good they are though 😂
            Yep those are the greats
                LTTP is mostly the first due to nostalgia, but it definitely is one of the better games in the sequel! Sadly cant say the same about 4 swords 😂😂😂 its the only game other than TOTK i havnt finished yet. Never had anyone to play with and i am not playing it on an emulator lol
A Link to the Past ❤️🗡
my first was the original. But LTTP was the first one I really played completely through and beat.
    Probably because the original is so cryptic, how far into the game did you make it
        First 5 or six dungeons.
Majora’s Mask for me.
Technically, Zelda II: Adventure of Link. But the first one that had impact and actually taught me to read? Link's Awakening
My first was the first, “the legend of Zelda.” Thou admittedly, I was about 5, so I never got past the first dungeon, just went around killing things and saving up for the big buys like the ring and trying to get past the dog (we called it a dog) guarding the master sword.
First one I was given was OoT but the first I played was Link to the Past. Definitely too young to see how amazing that game was until a bit later in life.
a link to the past was my first Zelda game. I had a gameboy
OOT. On 3ds. I didn’t even know the 64 version existed for a full year almost
    I got OoT 3d first but I enjoy the 64 version more, mostly because it’s on the tv and I enjoy playing games on the tv rather than handheld
Original Zelda in the NES. I still remember that gold cartridge
I first got interested in Zelda because of alttp on the virtual game thing on switch,I gave up when I got to the dark world tho. I got botw for Christmas and got stuck on the great plateau because of the cryonics shrine location but once I got done with the great plateau I was hooked on the franchise, I then beat oot, and wind waker, until I get a better PC I can't play to though... But I will one day! And I pre-ordered the collectors edition for totk and I've almost done every shrine, haven't beaten the game yet but once i do all shrines I'll beat the game
My first was twilight princess.  Eventually I did get a GBA emulator and my first 2D zelda game was minish cap.  I remember having a lot of fun with both of those.
Mine was A Link to the Past when I was 6 or 7, but this was around 2004, and I didn’t like the little I played very much. I played Ocarina of Time in 2006, after I turned 9, and that is when I fell in love with the series
OoT on 64
Four Swords: Anniversary edition 
definitely one of the lesser known zelda games, but was an absolute banger to play with my brother and sister
    I WANT THAT GAME SO BAD! it’s the only Zelda game I haven’t beat ): your very lucky
        do you have a 3ds available or an emulator? if yea dm me id be glad to show you how to play it
            I tried to emulate it but I do have a 3ds
First Zelda game I played was the first one on Nintendo but the first one I actually owned was Ocarina of time.
Mine was A Link to the Past on GBA. Since then I emulated a whole bunch, until I got Link's Awakening Switch, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
What a great game to start on too btw
The Legend of Zelda when it was first released. Still have my original NES and gold Zelda game cartridge. Both still work.
First love as a kid was OoT on the N64.  Until I got Majora's Mask a couple years later.  Great memories figuring out the dungeons with my cousin. I had no internet at the time.... I'm old.
It was either Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time
I forgot, but I know it was either BotW or OoT
The first zelda game on nes was the first game I asked to have.  I was 6 at the time.   The sequal on the snes was probably my favorite game of my middle child hood (maybe chrono trigger of ff3)
My parents got me both of the NES Zelda games.  Never finished either of them.

First to finish and also 100% was aLttP.
A Link to the Past
Mine was links awakening, watched a bunch of zelda YouTubers like PBG when I was younger so I downloaded the rom on my phone

Years later here I am playing totk and I'm so glad
Spirit tracks
    YESSSS!!!!
Link to the Past on SNES
A Link Between Worlds was my first as well! I had an absolute blast playing it, and had no idea there were more untill botw came out. After I finished botw I went into a 'zelda playing frenzy' and played most of the other games as well.
First played first game, first to own both Oracle games
I’m old
So the OG 8 bit legend of Zelda
Crazy to me to hear everyone’s stories. Wind waker for some, twilight for others? Etc etc. wow can’t really even believe it. It was a link to the past for me. Some of the fondest memories I have are of my Dad and Brother and I sitting at the edge of the bed, taking turns with the controller and figuring the game out together.
    Sounds like a fun time, I’ve always played Zelda alone but I have recently been playing age of calamity 2 player with my brother
Links awakening for the original gameboy
Zelda 2 Adventures of link. Got that & Mega Man 2 for Christmas. Beat Mega Man by Boxing Day dinner, dad mad as hell. Took 2 years to beat Adventures of Link. Love that game. Still the standard I judge all Zelda games by. TOTK is the 1st game to come close to it in terms of difficulty (yes I love AOL for the difficulty, I was raised on NES hard, not whatever happens now).
    That game is very difficult, I can only make it all the way up to the end of the game before I have to start using save points, maybe one day I’ll be able to beat that game without save points
        Don’t be ashamed of the save points. If there’s anything that game does need it’s something that doesn’t send you back to the start after dying! Replaying it on the NES mini made me love it even more & made the game accessible to my son, who now loves & appreciates it as well. Far too much hate for this game on the inter web. It’s a certain generation that grew up with ‘Nintendo hard’. But if you can, it’s always great to experience it. Cheers thanks for the post
I don't remember exactly but I think it was either Hyrule Warriors or Four Swords Adventure
Hmmm....Ocarina of Time was my first experience playing, but the first one I ever beat was Oracle of Seasons. 

Link's Awakening is my favorite.
Ocarina of Time. I didn’t play it for the storyline most of the time. My dad would bargain that he would play it if I ate a certain amount of meat for dinner (had an aversion because of a bad incident regarding fat on meat once). I would watch him play the story line, and I would play the mini games lol.
Botw
That beautiful shiny gold original The Legend of Zelda on NES.
Link's Crossbow Training
    Definitely one of the best
The very first Loz was my first, but that I actually played all the way? Spirit tracks. The soundtrack is probably one of THE most NOSTALGIC and MEMORABLE list of songs of ANY video game. And that’s fact
    Oh yeah, the train theme is so good. I haven't played it in 5ish years but the music still haunts my dreams.
Links Awakening for good old GB. It's not only the first Zelda Game but also the first Game I have memories of at all. And still kind of my Favorite Game of all Time.
The Majoras mask remake for 3Ds, but I had played the og game OG the wii
My first was Botw. I didn’t really like it specifically because I didn’t know it was open world, but they game that got me into the series is the game I’m playing right now, Ocarina of Time. I’ve tried breath of the wild a few days ago and I like it a lot if I look past the open world part.
TECHNICALLY I think the first one I've ever owned was the very first Zelda, but that was a hand-me-down and I only actually played it a bit a few years back. Breath of the wild was the first Zelda I've *properly* played and 100% owned myself. Either Majora's mask or wind waker was the first one I ever heard about. I can't remember exactly now.
Link’s Awakening on Game Boy. Some of the best tunes of the series are in that game - Marin’s song gets to me every time.
Oracle of Ages for GBC. My brother got Seasons, and we swapped once we’d beaten them. I still replay them occasionally, and am happy to say that I still own my original copy. Made me fall in love with the series.
    Actually working on a 100% of those games right now, it’s fun but it’s a pain getting all the rings since you have to do both games twice
        It’s definitely a pain. I bought them both for 3DS back when the eshop was still open, and hopped back and forth between them for things like the Biggoron sword and the upgraded shield. I never 100% completed them, but put the time in to get all of the equipment and things like that. Trying to get all of the rings sounds like a rough time. Being able to share between the two was such a cool experience as a kid though. Really brought my brother and me together.
Link’s Awakening DX on game boy color.
Links awakening DX on gameboy color. 

The music still gets to me.
Phantom Hourglass (which most people would tell me was not actually a zelda game, still do not understand why). Still one of my favorite ds games
    Literally in my top 5, it was also my first
    Whoever says it’s not a Zelda game doesn’t know anything, no matter what people say I think the ds games are amazing
Links awakening dx on my new gameboy color. I still remember taking years to beat it... talking like 5+ years before I even knew it had a color dungeon. Game was very cryptic for 10yr old me. Took me a couple days just to get the sword lol... which my brother figured out for me.
The Wind Waker
I believe it was the 3ds remake of ocarina of time
Z1 was my first Zelda.
twilight princess, it’s my favorite game
My first one was Ocarina of Time. It was on offer in a bundle with Star Wars Pod racer. I didn't know anything about the Zelda series, but I wanted the Star Wars game. Funny how that chance purchase has probably altered my gaming preferences for the last 20 years
My grandpa gave me he's NES and SNES when I graduated high school so I had zelda 1 and 2 and a link to the past
Phantom hourglass, my second was Spirit Tracks. I adored those games. SS is my overall favorite because of the story, but the DS games have a special place. They are also often overlooked which is sad.
    After reading all the comments I've got the itch to play all the games in cronilogical order by release date..... anyone else?
Ocarina of Time, about 21 years ago now
    16 years for me, I didn’t get around to it until the Wii virtual console since I never had an n64. Also didn’t know it was on the GameCube as a kid.
I so much wanted to say that zelda game Philips made (I forgot what it’s called) for the memes but unfortunately it was breath of the wild (and my favorite is majora’s mask or as markiplier once said majojo’s mask)
A link to the past
When I was a kid, my parents were able to score an NES in good condition with about 15 games for around 400 bucks. This is in the late '80s/early '90s. They would let us have access to about one new game a month, to extend the newness of the system as long as possible. When I got my hands on The Legend of Zelda, it was all I played. It took me a good month to get to Ganon but I was having trouble beating him. One day, while I'm in the middle of a game and had to run to the bathroom, my sister comes in the room and decides to remove the game cartridge. She didn't know to hold down the reset button before pressing the power button and wipe my save file. I was extremely upset, but found I could get back to where I was in about a week.
My first was a combination: I began playing Zelda when OoT, Link’s Awakening, and Oracle of Seasons & Ages were new. I had the Oracle strategy guide
Mine was 4 swords on the 3DS when they gave it out for free on the eshop. My “second” was Skyward Sword which I played for like 10 minutes at a demo kiosk at the mall.
My first zelda game was actually owned by my sister, but we shared everything we had.
So phantom hourglass
Haven't seen anyone else saying it, but Phantom Hourglass. I absolutely loved playing PH growing up, unironically loved the touch screen controls and drawing on the maps. The ocean temple was so fun, the phantoms terrifying and a power trip once you got the sword to beat them up.
My first was BOTW 🤣
The horrifying child nightmare that was majora’s mask. It was so fun but i could never bring myself to actually complete ikana. Though i must say, i do miss the re-deads since they were essentially a staple of my childhood and one of the reasons the game was so memorable to me.
The Legend of Zelda, on NES.
Four swords. But I didn't finish it. Ocarina of time was the next one and I actually finished it
Gold cartridge TLOZ on the NES.
My first was botw but technically it was a link between worlds I had played on my then-SO’s 3DS ~8 years ago!
The Legend of Zelda.  The first one.  On the NES.  Yes, I’m old.
Wow I feel ancient now. First one was Link to the Past back when I was a child.
Wind waker on Wii U
One of my favorite memories from the 80s was my cousin sitting me down in front of the TV and guiding me through the original LOZ. I had to have been 6 or 7 at the time.
I started with Ocarina Of Time 3d when I was about 10.
First game I played was my sisters links awakening but the first I owned myself was collectors edition but can’t say which of the games on that I played first
First one I played was oot. First one I bought was tp
The Legend of Zelda. OG
Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.
First one I owned? Hmmmmmm it might have been ocarina.  Zelda 1 2 and 3 i remember playing at friends houses or renting.  I actually believe I had zelda 2 but I hated it.  And I got cookies in the cartridge lol.
Twilight Princess was mine.
It was the original, I played it at my Grandparents as a kid. 

Also I love A Link Between Worlds, 3rd favorite Zelda game.
Twilight Princess was my first zelda game
Mine was Link’s awakening
I was in 5th grade and my first was OoT, changed the way I see games
Like for many others.. it was OoT. Played the crap out of that cartridge man, Majora's Mask after. Then i took a lonnnnng hiatus from Zelda until BOTW came out then got hooked again.
Oot 3DS
A link to the past or wind waker
Nintendo DS Ocarina of Time
Ocarina of Time was my first game ever on the N64. The nostalgia of that game is through the roof!
My first was possibly a link to the past? But if it was I am too young to properly remember.

First solid one was Ocarina of time.
My first was my brother's GBA version of A Link To The Past. We both have fond memories of getting stuck in the middle, because it was in English and we couldn't speak it yet. 

Later I stumbled over Spirit Tracks and a whole world opened up when I discovered it was actually a whole series of awesome games!
OOT
A Link To The Past, my parents got it for me since the N64 was too expensive for us. My dad ended up enjoying ALTTP that we ended up getting the N64 with OOT Christmas 1999 and ever since, I've played just about every Zelda game.
First ever purchased was the multi-game pack on GC that had a bunch of Zelda games including OOT & Majora’s Mask.

First ever played game was OOT. 

First ever owned game that really opened my eyes to Zelda was TP.
My first was Phantom Hourglass
my first was phantom hourglass. i love a link between worlds
Botw was my first and I'll be honest, I've heard of Zelda long before that but didn't get into it all that much. But when I got BOTW, I got REALLY into it. Tho I know the main backstory and timeline of the games the only in depth one I know about is the garudo.
Literally this one and now I have a strong bias towards it and no one can convince me otherwise
Breath of the wild, then I played oot
I got majoras mask for the ds first
    Also never finished it though
Oh damn, you started with a great one. I started with the og on nes but could never figure anything out. Got back on the horse with orciana of time and then i played catch up.
Original NES gold cartridge. Birthday in 1986. Came home from school to find my older bro already started it up… I was crestfallen.
Spirit Tracks is the goat
PH, amazing start
BOTW, got it as a gift because they thought it was a Final Fantasy series game. Played FF7 as a kid and liked the open world so I gave BOTW a shot and loved it. Playing TOTK now
First one I played was the Original one on NES I was a kid and only ran around cutting tall grass 🤣

First game I actually played and got into was Wind Waker but I played on Wii U it came with my LOZ Wii U
Twilight princess on the wii. I can remember waking up on my 8th birthday asking my mom if I can play it.
Wind waker and then i fell in love with the series  years later i bought every game and so much promotional stuff including the crappy cartoon i will never take out of the packaging but yeah
    I have that cartoon too 😂
        Like ok story time. mine was in the packaging right before dvd stop closed and i saw a mint in package complete series original set do 19.95 it still has the sticker. And i bought it immediately thinking it was like when i brought mewtwo returns on dvd for 9$ but i had a phone with internet  so after i bought it and shredded the recipt so i couldnt give it back i saw the first episode online and... i just i was crying at the fact i sacrificed my   dignity for my pride as a fan in the best game series ever made in the history of the world. Luckily thats my only sacrifice lol
The first Zelda game I ever played was The Legend of Zelda a Link To the Past on SNES when I was about 4-5 years old. It's what set me on this long and beautiful journey that I'm currently on. lve enjoyed every single title, and every single moment of it thus far 💯
First one I played was ALTTP, first I personally owned was OOT3D. I played that game until I had memorized every dungeon’s layout
Literally the prequel to this one was my first
Wind waker I also started twilight princess and ocarina at the same time I had a special game cube disk of ocarina with normal and master quest
Ocarina of time on n64, I still remember how long it took for me to figure out the great deku tree, and then a week to find enough courage to beat the boss
The Minish Cap on a Lime/Orange edition GBA-SP. Such a beautiful game.. So many nights up late trying not to get caught rofl. The moment I finished it I asked where I could play more, and never stopped
My first was ocarina of time on the 3DS
My first, if I remember right, was twilight Princess. I didn’t get to finish it though
    My second was OoT, and I completed that
Links Awaking!
Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64.
Ocarina of time
I forget if it was four swords on the DSI or wind waker HD on the Wii u
Ocarina of Time on the N64. Still an awesome game don’t care what anyone says lol After that, A Link to the Past and Wind Waker around the same time. I touched Link’s Awakening but never owned it so didn’t get far. But those were my early titles.
First one I played was link’s awakening (switch)(I’m a more new fan) but the first one I beat was Ocarina of Time 3D
I started out healthy and lean with the gamecube compilation. I started with OOT technically but I remember being stuck early on and jumping between the games on there doing my 4 year old best to learn zelda. I remember watching the trailers on the main menu and being so jealous that it was only a wind waker demo on it. I didn't end up playing wind waker till wayyyy later just because that game seemed impossible to find in the store growing up.
My first ever was Phantom hourglass, but i was so young i could barely get into it, love it today tho. First actually actively played ones was twilight princess.. I was seven years old. You can imagine the nightmares 😂
A link to the past was my first
It was golden, it was glorious.  It required to be blown.  It was the Mac
M8ne was Phantom hourglass from 15 years ago😁
5 years ago it was either Ocarina of Time or Link between worlds but I think it was Ocarina of time
Breath of the Wild
N64 Ocarina of Time 🙂
Mine was the NES, I beat the first dungeon when I was four. Somehow. Also I'm still a teenager, so not born in the 80's
twilight princess at 6 years old.... it was terrifying
First Zelda game I “played” was Link to the Past on my dads and sisters game files. The first one I beat on my own was Twilight Princess.
I can’t remember if I played Twilight Princess or Phantom Hourglass first but Phantom was the first one I ever beat on my DS
Ocarina of Time on Project64. Then my buddy played Twilight Princess on the gamecube and I thought It was cool and when I played it I realized it was a Zelda game.
Legend of zelda gold cartridge for the Nintendo entertainment system.  Still have the cartridge and NES from the late 80's.
Link's Awakening Dx
Link's Awakening.

Young enough to not understand how to progress so any progression was accidental.
Link to the past on SNES
Pretty sure mine was Wind Waker.  As a kid, I remember having so much fun living the island life on Link’s island.
This one followed by Oot. This game holds a special place in my heart.
    Same here, even though it’s not my favorite I always come back to it for nostalgia
Alttp/four swords on gba
botw was my first, but now i own almost all the mainline games
Majoras mask. Still my personal favorite Zelda title. When I got the cart it already had a save file with every mask and was nearly 100% missing two bottles and a few hearts.
I was very young and ran around this save file figuring puzzles out in reverse order. 
Few years later I tried playing through on my own and got to appreciate the actual progress. Probably know Termina better than the city I live in. 

Anyways, cool post and game! I haven’t played this title but I know it’s good
My first Zelda game was the first Zelda game.  Sears was out of the SMB/Duck Hunt bundle and they gave me The Legend of Zelda because no one was buying it.
Twilight Princess.  
Unless you mean the first one I owned. Then it's BotW
Mine too was A Link Between Worlds, loved it to bits. My husband introduced me to the game when we first started dating and we have been playing Zelda games ever since. It’s our favorite!
My first was the 1986 nes the legend of Zelda
My first was windwaker HD on the wii u I didnt really know what it was and i couldnt get past the forsaken fortress so i just kept starting new files. then I played botw on my friends switch (not knowing it was a zelda game) and loved that and after saving up for it i played the shit out of that then after finding my dads old n64 I ordered a copy of ocarina of time and played the game along while watching the game grumps ocarina of time playthrough. I have yet to try the others but i do want to save up to buy a wii (my old one broke) and get twilight princess and skyward sword.
    You can play Wii games on the Wii U, there is even a Wii U version of Twilight Princess and a Switch Version of Skyward Sword. Wii U Twilight Princess is going for 100$ though
        Oh yeah thats right thanks for telling
Dang i got my first game a long time ago majora's mask was the game a creepy but fun game to start with.
Legend of Zelda the first
wind waker hd! zelda 1 was soon after that
Botw
the first zelda i ever played was botw, but My first zelda was oot
What a great game!
God did not realize this game was that old I feel old. 
Lttp was my first
Phantom Hourglass. I know it gets a lot of crap for the structure of its main dungeon and how you have to replay the same sections over and over, but it was my first nintendo game. I remember running around the dungeons and areas for hours just trying to figure out the puzzles while having the time limit, and how I felt getting around the phantoms faster and faster each time. 

It's certainly not the best game ever, but damn my nostalgia glasses feel pretty good to wear after all these years.
Ocarina of time 3D and I've been a fan ever since
OG NES Gold Cartridge gang
The first one. Then, A Link To The Past dropped on the SNES and changed my whole life.
LoZ OoT on the 3ds for me
Breath of the wild (I came in a bit late)
Wind Waker
[removed]
    Your not new anymore, botw came out 6 years ago, that’s only 3 years after I became a fan
Skyward Sword was my first and fell in love. My first 2d Zelda was Link to the past. Absolutely loved both and took every opportunity to play the rest in the years after. Even the original.
Skyward sword on Wii still s tier for me
My first was breath of the wild. I’m late to the party
Zelda 1 for nes
Legend of Zelda ocarina of time on the 3DS
OoT
Twilight princess baby!
Ocarina of time baby
The gold cartridge Nintendo 1985 Adventures of Link
My first Zelda game was literally the prequel to this game! I feel old now... Lol
OoT. 

It was so difficult for me...
The OG BABY!  Had to remember to hold in reset when turning off the console
My first Zelda game was ocarina of time 3D. I fell in love with the series and I’m trying to collect and play all of the games
    Luckily you don’t need every Nintendo system to have all the games, I only have 3ds, Wii U and switch and I have all but one
well actually all but two, i emulated four swords adventurers
        I don’t really like emulation. I’m a purist game collector. I like the feeling of having as close to the original experience as I can. Including refusing to use the internet for puzzles. Which I may make an exception for the original game since it came with a guide
            Yeah I enjoy owning the game more, the only reason I emulated four swords is because I don’t have a GameCube, I’ve only emulated 1 game and I’m probably gonna keep it that way, and I like solving things myself as well, it was weird playing TotK without guides and then seeing my brother look everything up and progressing much quicker than me
                I have a version of every Nintendo consoles aside from the virtual boy. I have 11 of the 19 original mainline games. I’m still missing: ocarina of time, majoras mask, links awakening, both oracle games, four swords, minis cap. Phantom hourglass, spirit tracks, and tri force heros. I do have the remakes of ocarina, majoras mask and links awakening but not the originals
My first was a Link to the past. It was fun. I never have played link between worlds tho, is it fun?
    Yes very, it’s actually a sequel to a link to the past
my first was phantom hour glass, makes me sad no one ever talks about it :<
    I love phantom hourglass man
Yikes, for me it was Link's awakening on Game Boy. Good Lord that had to have been almost 30 yrs ago
Orcarina of time for the N64
Spirit Tracks. Never beat it, but I really liked what I played. Would’ve played The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass before if I knew it was one of the direct sequels.
mine was breath of the wild. i somehow had never heard of legend of zelda as a whole before then (i don't know how either) and i instantly fell in love
Phantom hourglass. I loved that game despite not being able to draw a figure 8
OoT was my first but specifically the version on the zelda collectors edition on the gamecube.
Albw was my first one too
Wind waker 😊😊 link between worlds is top 3 for sure
My first Zelda game was twilight princess
Probably 5-6 years ago I got ocarina of time. Then I got Majora's mask a few years after I first got OOT
    For me it was the opposite, I beat majoras mask before ocarina of time
My first was OoT, but 4 swords will have my heart
Mine was Ocarina of Time, and let me just say, it was definitely worth it. In my opinion Ocarina of time is the best zelda game out there. Yeah botw and totk were great but I'll never get the same first vibe that I got from playing Ocarina of time for the first time. When playing totk and botw, I would always find myself wearing the tunic of time cause it's my favorite and it's such a unique design for Link.
My first Zelda was wind waker but the Zelda that I got hooked to was oot
My first was Majora's Mask remake for the 3ds because my mom wanted me to try it which I enjoyed running around as deku scrub link but now I'm currently playing a randomized N64 version and it brings me joy to see the game again.
    I got the 3d version before n64, it was my second Zelda game actually, but I prefer the n64 version over the 3d version, same goes for ocarina of time
Good ole’ Ocarina of Time was mine. Still have my original save file. I named him “JOE” because I didn’t know his name was Link until my mom bought me the original Super Smash Bros.
Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64.
There was only one
Botw was mine..
My first one was Link to the Past. I loved the storytelling almost instantly, and the sound effects for getting items. \*Sword swish of triumph\*
Ocarina of Time was my first. 

Never had a NES Or SNES. First system was Genesis, then N64

Have played most all Zelda's since. I am not the biggest fan of 2d Zelda's, just don't like the controls/fighting of 2d top view games that much.
I guess technically it was me fooling around on my dads save on majora’s mask, but the first one I actually played and finished was skyward sword on my dads wii. It took me months both because of my little 10 year old brain, but also cause I was only able to play it for about a day and a half every two weeks
i grew up playing twilight princess, i got older and my parents finally got me ocarina of time
Alttp was my first Zelda game, I would watch my uncle play to all the time when I was little. Then he showed me OoT. Both are the best Zelda games!!
Link’s awakening… the switch remake not the original.
The Legend of Zelda (NES)
A link to the past
My first Zelda game was the original legend of Zelda for NES
That I owned? Minish Cap

That I played? Majora’s Mask (would’ve been Ocarina of Time as well if my cousin hadn’t lent it out to a friend, them I would’ve gotten who Sheik was half a decade early)
First one I played was Oracle of Seasons, first one I owned was Twilight Princess
windwaker for the wii u 😍
I actually had aLttP first despite owning a NES for several years before the SNES
    that was my 2nd one. i was a bit older so i was able to read and enjoy the story. i think that's partly why lttp is my favorite of the series
    me too, aLttP was the second game I ever played. I got stuck all the time and my mom had to help me with the harder parts. She is surprisingly good at that game lol.
Og gold cart and never left
    i still have it too, though the nes was lost a long time ago
I was actually old (and fortunate) enough to have my first experience on LoZ at 9. Played every game up to OOT and didn't really pick the series back up proper until BOTW.

Imagine how much people our age have seen in the world of gaming. Mind blowing.
    i dont feel quite as old then, i was around 2 i think when we had the first one. right? it's baffling to actually sit down and think about how things used to look compared to know. even when the internet was first starting to pick up and finding [gamefaq.com](https://gamefaq.com) early on was a huge game changer, and i will admit i did call the nintendo hotline once; i was stuck in alttp in turtle rock and couldn't find the secret key for months. it felt so obvious after the helpline told me what to do xD
Same
can’t imagine…
I grew up with OoT but was too young to beat it so Wind Waker came then TP, which was phenomenal as ever. Loved the motion controls. Miss em in TOTK now.
    i almost exclusively use gyro aiming in totk and its the best
TP was like my first real experience with a real game. So freaking cool.
This is mine also. It was so difficult. Or that’s how I remember it anyway.
I was the big blue Bot (slime thing) for Halloween at age 8. Lots of fabric and newspaper.
WIND WAKER WAS MY FIRST, its still my fav in the franchuse and one of my fav games ever
Welcome! May you have a life of Zelda's to look forward to.
    Thank you!! :D
Same I have experienced the whole timeline to today. My personal favorites were Breath of the Wild, Windwaker, Ocarina of Time. I most want to see remakes of Minish Cap (probably never happen as it was made by Capcom), Majora’s Mask and Seasons/Ages. They could use the links awakening engine in my opinion especially for seasons/ages. Majora’s Mask needs a full 3d update like they did for Metroid Prime Remaster. Windwaker just needs to be rereleased on switch it was already “made” he. The 40th Anniversary is coming up in a couple of years so I would love to see a remaster again of Ocarina and Majora’s mask together. I think the most overrated Zelda is Link to the past. I have played it and in my opinion Ocarina was way better. Most underrated is Spirit Tracks, Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity and NintendoLand Zelda Battlequest. Worst games are Zelda CDI, Zelda 2 (the only game to level up by kill experience and grinding) anything that is a Tingle game and Links Crossbow training.  I will never forget the first time seeing a Goron and getting the master sword repaired. I got that same feeling when I paraglided in BOTW. I will never forget Beetle saying thank you in Windwaker I wish he did that in all the games or Error in Zelda 2 because it seemed like they knew or Saria in the woods or Sheik or Lon Lon Ranch or Skullkid and the moon. No one steals Epona no one. Such a great series.
Same! So I can’t remember if the first one was wind waker, ocarina of time or Majora’s mask.
It bothers me so much that they left off Link to the Past. Link’s Awakening I can get over, but arguably the best 2D game in the series?!
Yeah it’s awesome. I was young when I got it, I remember being at a restaurant seeing my cousin play it and it looked like an awesome game, flash forward a year and my mom took me to GameStop and that’s where I got the game.
This was my first too. I watched my older brother beat it and was hooked. Even as an adult I would play through it again whenever I was having a hard time and needed distraction.
    A timeless classic! I'm glad I can just whip it up on 3DS when I need it.
I did the exact same thing except with Majora’s Mask! Kind of a freaky intro to the series but I loved it as a kid.
    That's awesome! Majora hits the same as OoT for me except that I didn't beat it until I got my 3DS lol. I freaking love this franchise.
Yeah I’m a bit obsessed with tears, I’ve already passed my playtime of botw and I’m still working on the main quest line
Definitely easier to emulate on pc, only game I’ve ever emulated though was four swords adventures
Was it weird going from the gameplay style of botw to the gameplay style of OoT or MM
    Oh absolutely, it was weird being on a fixed path with the main story  but I still really enjoyed it. My favorite being Majoras mask.
TotK is amazingly good, but majoras mask will always be my favorite, it’s probably nostalgia but I just love the story of the game so much and it has a feeling to it like no other Zelda game
    Man i love majoras mask! My current order of favorites is LTTP, TOTK, OOT, MM! All of them really cant be compared in how good they are though 😂
        Yep those are the greats
            LTTP is mostly the first due to nostalgia, but it definitely is one of the better games in the sequel! Sadly cant say the same about 4 swords 😂😂😂 its the only game other than TOTK i havnt finished yet. Never had anyone to play with and i am not playing it on an emulator lol
Probably because the original is so cryptic, how far into the game did you make it
    First 5 or six dungeons.
I got OoT 3d first but I enjoy the 64 version more, mostly because it’s on the tv and I enjoy playing games on the tv rather than handheld
I WANT THAT GAME SO BAD! it’s the only Zelda game I haven’t beat ): your very lucky
    do you have a 3ds available or an emulator? if yea dm me id be glad to show you how to play it
        I tried to emulate it but I do have a 3ds
YESSSS!!!!
Sounds like a fun time, I’ve always played Zelda alone but I have recently been playing age of calamity 2 player with my brother
That game is very difficult, I can only make it all the way up to the end of the game before I have to start using save points, maybe one day I’ll be able to beat that game without save points
    Don’t be ashamed of the save points. If there’s anything that game does need it’s something that doesn’t send you back to the start after dying! Replaying it on the NES mini made me love it even more & made the game accessible to my son, who now loves & appreciates it as well. Far too much hate for this game on the inter web. It’s a certain generation that grew up with ‘Nintendo hard’. But if you can, it’s always great to experience it. Cheers thanks for the post
Definitely one of the best
Oh yeah, the train theme is so good. I haven't played it in 5ish years but the music still haunts my dreams.
Actually working on a 100% of those games right now, it’s fun but it’s a pain getting all the rings since you have to do both games twice
    It’s definitely a pain. I bought them both for 3DS back when the eshop was still open, and hopped back and forth between them for things like the Biggoron sword and the upgraded shield. I never 100% completed them, but put the time in to get all of the equipment and things like that. Trying to get all of the rings sounds like a rough time. Being able to share between the two was such a cool experience as a kid though. Really brought my brother and me together.
Literally in my top 5, it was also my first
Whoever says it’s not a Zelda game doesn’t know anything, no matter what people say I think the ds games are amazing
After reading all the comments I've got the itch to play all the games in cronilogical order by release date..... anyone else?
16 years for me, I didn’t get around to it until the Wii virtual console since I never had an n64. Also didn’t know it was on the GameCube as a kid.
Also never finished it though
I have that cartoon too 😂
    Like ok story time. mine was in the packaging right before dvd stop closed and i saw a mint in package complete series original set do 19.95 it still has the sticker. And i bought it immediately thinking it was like when i brought mewtwo returns on dvd for 9$ but i had a phone with internet  so after i bought it and shredded the recipt so i couldnt give it back i saw the first episode online and... i just i was crying at the fact i sacrificed my   dignity for my pride as a fan in the best game series ever made in the history of the world. Luckily thats my only sacrifice lol
My second was OoT, and I completed that
Same here, even though it’s not my favorite I always come back to it for nostalgia
You can play Wii games on the Wii U, there is even a Wii U version of Twilight Princess and a Switch Version of Skyward Sword. Wii U Twilight Princess is going for 100$ though
    Oh yeah thats right thanks for telling
Your not new anymore, botw came out 6 years ago, that’s only 3 years after I became a fan
