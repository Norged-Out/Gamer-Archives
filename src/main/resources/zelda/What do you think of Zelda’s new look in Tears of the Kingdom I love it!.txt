[[What do you think of Zelda‚Äôs new look in Tears of the Kingdom I love it!]]





Is it just me or are there "tears" painted on her face? I wonder if that's something involved in the plot?
    Most definitely!
    I thought that was anime cheek lighting‚Ä¶
    I finally get why they call it tears of the kingdom
        So Zelda is the entire kingdom?
            Yup she's the whole kingdom
    Shes killed 2 people‚Ä¶ what you been up to zelda?
        When did Zelda kill two people?
            Joke about the tears on her face. A teardrop for whatever reason means youve killed someone. Usually gang related shit
                I see. Well, if Zelda does kill two people it‚Äôs certainly gonna be a first.

    90% sure its lighting but that sounds cool edit: nvm I forgot there were 2 images LMAO
    Or is it prenounced ‚Äútares‚Äù as in the sky islands were torn up from the ground?
        nintendo confirmed its tears as in cry
It is clearly a very very rich game with lots of things to do, can't wait for it.
It's giving even more Princess Mononoke vibes and I'm fricking here for it!
I love it too
she. looks. so. good.
I love short-hair Zelda! It‚Äôs a nice change of pace!
This makes me want to get a haircut so bad
She looks so pretty
It's really pretty
Omg ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Fine as hell for an animation
I LOVE THE SHORT HAIR
Honestly love it gives me very traditional Zelda vibes with a hint of modernization
Not a fan of this specific look but I am a fan of Zelda and her new haircut
I am here for the bisexual bob
It's nice.
Yes
It‚Äôs a unique look
queen
When will they finally make her playable?
    There‚Äôs a mod.
Those earrings look painfully large. My mom‚Äôs worn a few pairs that big before, and always complained that it felt like her ears were getting pulled further down the side of her head.
To live well is to receive a reward from heaven every few years in the form of a new Legend of Zelda game from Nintendo.
The greatest feeling is that Link is no longer as lonely as he was in Breath of the Wild. In Breath of the Wild, only the souls of the four champions accompanied him. But this time, not only are there new generations of champions, but also more teammates. Let's go together with the brothers and sisters of Hyrule.
shes beautiful no matter what game shes in
I really like it! Maybe I'm wrong but It looks like her dress at the end of the game with new parts to it. And her earrings have the same pattern as the lights in that white stone room in the trailer. Side note, I think the tall man that puts his hand on Zelda's shoulder kind of looks like the villain in Twilight princess but with more sheikah stuff on him.
Her hair keeps getting shorter and link‚Äôs keeps getting longer lol.
üî•üî•üî•
I like the design, I just don‚Äôt like how it implies that Zelda will unfortunately not be a big part of the story as I thought it would in the first trailer
    This is a trailer after all. They could be saving a special moment for players to connect with. It is rare to see Zelda with the Master Sword. I am curious if we might connect not just with this version of Zelda, but other timelines as well.

Playable? I would not doubt it. Just have faith. Something special is in store
I much prefer it to the blue outfit she had in the flashbacks. 

And it‚Äôs more interesting than the white gown she had for awakening duties. 

Nice.
Excellent. 
I also hope there's a world where they have her as a playable character that they've kept under wraps this whole time.
My daughter has a short haircut! She was so happy to see the princess had hair like hers :)
I love the short hair!
I think Zelda could pull off a pixie for sure. She looks badass in anything lol
I‚Äôm a sucker for that style of hair, so I love it
Basic white bich vibes. Still hot though.
This game looks the exact same as the last one, this game ain‚Äôt even that good, botw was mid and this game is about to be the same stuff

not related but is she on the great plateau?
Yes
Short hair is giving me BioShock Elizabeth vibes
I just hope she's a playable character.
Her triforce is pink.
She look married
I prefer longer hair
Every few years, the divine creator Nintendo bestows upon the mortal realm a new Legend of Zelda.
Her new style is very interesting and cool! But I prefer the original still
Gorgeous gorgeous girl!!
spoiler warnings PLEASE!!! I'm trying to go in blind and this showed up on my feed. Saw it before I could scroll üò≠

Most definitely!
