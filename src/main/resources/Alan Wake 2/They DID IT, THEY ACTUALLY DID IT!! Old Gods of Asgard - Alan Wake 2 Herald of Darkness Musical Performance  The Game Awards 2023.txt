[[They DID IT, THEY ACTUALLY DID IT!! Old Gods of Asgard - Alan Wake 2 Herald of Darkness Musical Performance  The Game Awards 2023]]





I was thinking it was just going to be the band by themselves. But the fact that everyone was there, plus that epic dance made everything so iconic.
    PLUS Alan Wakes actor AND Voice actor!!!
        Both Alans 🥰
            Alans Wake.
                Wakes.
            One is scratch watch out
        Was so happy to see Dr Darling!
        Matthew Poretta got a great singing voice and stage presence
            Yeah, I was surprised he could sing so well. I probably shouldn't have been after the Dr Darling video in Control, but somehow it still caught me off guard
                DYNOMITE!
            Afaik, his father and his brother are opera singers.
    I had no idea door would be singing haha
I couldn’t stop smiling
    I found myself just giggling to myself by the end. Such a fun and joyful performance.
        The sheer joy on Sam's face when he started the dance number was so infectious! Grinning ear to ear watching this.
        Same lol I loved it
Best video game moment ever for me. I've been gaming for 34 years. This was the best culmination of a great product in gaming into this. Wow.
    The game, followed by this was just incredible. Such a genuinely happy moment.
Absolutely incredible
    And they had EVERYONE THERE!!!!!!
        I was really wondering how they'd work both Matthew Poretta and Ikka Villi into it, but damn if they didn't make it work! 

This was just such a magnificent moment in gaming history
I couldn't stop laughing and crying and singing. So happy that they included Matthew Porretta. Though I would've liked to see him as Dr. Darling xD
    To bad he dances on the right in the end and we cant see if he has the same smile as lake
I’m going to be watching it multiple times again, I already know it!
    I’ve already re-watched the video about 5x… I was so excited for this and I was beyond words that they pulled this off. <3
    Yeah, I've already watched it 5 times today lmao
This is canon now.
I was surprised Matthew was there on stage. I guess I expected them to stick to the original choreography. But the way they did it with David and Matthew singing a duet on the side while Ilkka did the dance moves on the center stage was the right decision and it was great to both hear and see everyone.
It's just so fucking joyful. Exuberant. Sam Lake is clearly STOKED. I love this more than I'm capable of expressing right now.

Absolute madlads. I love them all.
It was incredibly immersing/uncanny watching that live having just recently played the section in the game, quite unlike anything else I’ve experienced media wise.
I just watched the performance and I'm so emotional 😭 could maybe be because I've also just finished work for the year about an hour ago, so I'm feelin some things! I cannot wait to get into NG+ while I'm off 😍
Show me the Champion of Light!!  
I'll show you the Herald of Darkness!!  
Lost in a never-ending night!!  
Diving deep to the surface!!
It was so good! I was so glad to see David for the announcement, and then Matthew for the vocal. AND THEN Illa was on stage and Sam as well?! So perfect! And they seemed to have the time of their lives! I was so happy for them!
It was brilliant. There were a few good announcements too but this part and the band playing the pagan type music for Senua 2 was epic. I think the senua band was the best bit of the whole night, so ethereal and I don't know, just felt ancient with the hypnotic drums and the fire, like it felt so human and supernatural at the same time.
    Heilung! That's the band for Senua. They're pretty incredible.
        It was incredible, I'll have to check out their albums
    I loved that bit, probably the best of the whole show. I made the mistake of looking at the live chat on YT, and everyone was talking about how boring it was or to skip it. Like, are we hearing the same thing right now?! It was the same with the Alan Wake performance, too. The show is definitely bloated with ads and cringe worthy guests, but I don't get the hate with the performances.
        The chat are just dumb kids, I ignore all that. I was watching asmongold react and it was the same. I'm looking forward to the next couple of years where asmongold realises he doesn't relate to his chat at all anymore cos the age gap is too vast lol. I'm a few years older than him and his opinions are already starting to change as he's passed 30 lol
Bro the entire time I was watching this part everyone in the chat just kept saying “John wick got his own song?”
I was bouncing around like a kid on Christmas morning. Loved every second of it.
This is so great I can’t even
 We are characters in his story
Extremely impressive that they did that all live with everyone on board.

Marko of POTF is a god-like live voice (see [vocal coach analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZifi5UbBGY) of his Carnival of Rust performance), but unfortunately he was missing some high notes especially 1:15-> which was a bit of a shame! Maybe they're not used to these kind of audiences, as they very rarely even do open-air gigs?
    Yeah, I saw them live plenty enough to say he wasn't at his absolute best but that's absolutely understandable - there might be a lot of factors having an impact here, I think the whole journey/last minute work visas deal and not a lot of time left to prep/time zone changes along with their 20th anniversary tour that has just finished is enough on itself to put a strain on his voice. Plus, the guy's 53 if I'm not mistaken. Nevertheless, he still did great, as everyone else on that stage.
Glad they got Matthew Poretta involved, wouldn’t have been right with him not there
Alan just writing himself into the Game Awards, including bagging himself a couple of awards.
It honestly was perfect. It literally was everything I could have asked for and more. My face was hurting by the end because I didn’t realize I was smiling so much.
We are in the Dark Place, confirmed. Would explain a lot of what's going on in the world but at least we have bangers like AW2 to keep us company!
Just Epic!
I had a smile on my face the whole time watching this performance!
Seriously one of the best TGA moments ever. The entire performance was flawless!
I was honestly a little surprised at how uncaring the audience seems after the performance culminates, like they had no clue how epic this moment is, both for the game, but also for the fact that it's rather unique to have this kind of performance from a game. >.>
Yeah I enjoyed this, sat with a stupid grin on my face watching it!
Outside of the musical, does anyone hear like the old gods of asgard music from Alan wake 1-poets of the fall-war
It was everything I hoped it would be and 10 times more. I'm gonna learn that dance.
just played this part of the game, so epic, one of the best experiences i had in gaming
I was looking forward to this but I was bummed when the song began and it was immediately noticeable that it was all playback, and not a "real" live performance. I mean aside from Odin, his singing seemed to be real (good)!
    It was live, there are notes with the instruments and mess ups that aren't in the recorded version.
        Listened to it again and yes, I'd say instrumetals are played live by the band.  
Still, David and Matthew were 100% playback.
            You need better ears, they're not playback at all.

There is a rhythm guitar track that's playing in the background, and bass as well.

That's it for playback, everyones voices were live.

If you care enough to listen meticulously, David Harewoods voice at the end of a verse tapers off a little breathy, and Poretta you can tell is singing because of a similar occurrence, but in the middle of one of the verses.

My source?

Me, a musician who gets annoyed when people falsely state something isn't "live".
                Yes, after not less than ten listens to both versions I can say thay the TGA performance is different from what we can hear on youtube and iTunes. Some vocal differences here and there prove it easily. But can we deny the possibility of the 'kinda live' new recording? Also, the guitars (bass at least) is not played by Marko live cause there's no way in this realm you could heroically point your hand upwards and still strum the strings.
                    I mentioned the bass is tracked.

As a guitar player though, I believe the lead parts on the guitar were played.

It looks so on point that I can't say otherwise.
                        Yeah, I know you mentioned it, no doubt there. I was just wondering if sometimes a "kinda live" backtrack is being made and not just a studio version played.
highlight of the night!
Oke time to play the song on repeat for the 500th time
Omg this is the best day of my entire life
I hope they come back at a future event and reprise with the fourth part of the song! Absolutely legendary performance
favorite moment was sam lake joining in. i love him so much. a king.
This made my year! It'll be tough to beat for the next TGA
Now  we need a world tour with sam lake dancing
PLUS Alan Wakes actor AND Voice actor!!!
    Both Alans 🥰
        Alans Wake.
