[[Alan Wake 2 is absolutely worth full price.]]


What an incredible experience. Recently I've read that it didn't do well financially, and that really is a shame. Remedy is an incredible studio that deserves the support of gamers. If we don't invest on risk taking titles, we are just going to get the same old garbage.


After seeing the fun at the Game Awards I decided I'd get it. I'm playing through the remaster first so I don't miss anything. The combat is so repetitive but the game world is really engaging so I soldier on.
    It's also not a bad idea to finish or at least get familiar with Control. Without some knowledge from Control, a couple of plot points in AW2 could maybe feel a bit random and it just helps to put the world together a bit more.
        This sounds like some of the reason the sales aren’t great. People think they need to put 40 hours into previous games just to get up to speed on things
            The only game you really should play before AW2 is the first game. The rest is just for context filling and to catch the more subtle references. And even then, there is an official recap to put you up to speed.

I can see thought that it could affect sales. Especially the fact that the first Alan Wake was not really immensely popular when it came out (despite being highly anticipated) and the remaster didn't sell too well either, so some people could see that as a sequel to a game that they were not really interested in in the first place. 

What also definitely affects sales is the lack of a physical version. After looking at some of the data from the Insomniac leak, it's impressive how well physical games still sell.
                I tell people to go watch a twenty minute you tube video explaining AW1, and control/AW tie in. An hour of homework and you can be balls deep in AW2 when you play it.
                    Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
                        Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.

Thanks:)
                        Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
                Ok but AW1 is really, really hard to play. I wanted to like it but I just couldn’t bear running round in identical forests for that many hours
                    Seriously
                I can definitely confirm that the game is highly appealing to me but that I put it off my list for not getting a physical release.
At a time where the question of media conservation is more discussed than ever, I find it a really crazy move.

There is no way I'm spending 50$ on a game that is not mine, I'll either spend 60$ on a physical copy, or get it on sale for 15$ in a year or two.

That's just sad cause I'm sure they deserved more sales, but hell I'm already pissed when an indie is digital only, but an AAA ? 

Same goes for Baldurs gate tbh, Larian did release both Divinity games on physical, but not for their record-breaking GOTY ?

That's not the industry I want, and I'm not paying for that. Nobody should tbh, I know Remedy doesn't have infinite budget but we have to realize digital games are a scam, you do not own anything, you just rent it for an unlimited time.
I feel like paying 80$ for a game is more debated than paying 60$ for a rent that looks like a purchase, and I don't understand it :)
                    Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
            I mean I own but haven’t finished Alan wake 1, American Nightmare, and Control, so I’m def not buying Alan Wake 2 yet lol
            It's the Blade Runner 2049 effect.

That movie bombed because it was a sequel to a 30 year old movie that a mass audience has no idea exists.

Alan Wake is the same situation. And on top of all that, it's a horror game, so most mass audience members write it off almost instantly. 

It's a game designed for a very small subset of customers and making money seems to come second to the passion of just getting it made and played by people who love it.
            Yea I’m not playing control, which I didn’t even know were related just to play Alan wake 2. To be fair I also didn’t play the first one, and don’t want to. Don’t have that kind of time.
            Or you could just watch a recap video on YouTube for 20min.
            Yeah I started playing AW2 this week and it is pretty confusing. I played the first game years ago and don’t remember how it ended. I didn’t really care for Control so I never beat it.

Also, you need to know some Max Payne lore. He’s sort of a major character but has a different name. Remedy made the first Max Payne before selling it to Rockstar. One of the characters in this game has the same voice actor, face model, clothes, and personality/attitude as Max Payne.

I’m not very far into Alan Wake yet, but so far the story is very meta and is doing a sort of multiverse type of thing with Remedy’s games.
            I mean, it's called Alan Wake 2. I get that it's one of the big talking points of the day, and people don't want to feel left out, but it's also a sequel, and it's not asking that much in terms of prior investment. It's not like they're asking you to go pick up an Alan Wake novel or whatever
                But it's a sequel to an extremely story-focused game, which is different than someone picking up the next Call of Duty or whatever. Feeling like you need to play a 15-year-old game to understand the new one is absolutely a barrier for a lot of people, fair or not.
                Plenty of sequels are pretty easy to pick up and play with no context, and this is exactly the reason. Asking people to go play a damn near 15 year old game to get up to speed is just not gonna workout financially. Red Dead 2 was also a sequel to an older game, but there was no real need to go play the first one.
            Better to be a patient gamer and just play the first game as intended
        Is it necessary to play the Control expansions?
            The AWE expansion pretty much explains the events from Alan Wake 1 and puts it all into a different perspective. It also serves as a great narrative lead-up to Alan Wake 2.

It's not necessary, but I can definitely recommend it. The AWE expansion is also great in its own regard, especially if you enjoyed the base game.
                I didn’t really like Control, enjoying AW1 so far though! Thanks :)
                    I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
                        U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
                            Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
                            I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
                        Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
                        I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
                        I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
                        Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
                            I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
                            Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
                                I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
                            I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
                        You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
                        You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
            Necessary, no, recommended, yes.

The AWE expansion of *Control* is very much a part of the *Alan Wake II* story, but you don't have to have played it to understand the story by any means, but I would recommend it.
                Is control part of the alan universe??
                    Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
            Both expansions are good and I’d recommend them. The Foundation answers a lot of questions (although raises some others). And the AWE just sets up Alan Wake 2 (but doesn’t add a ton of lore)
            I would actually say the entire main game of Control is unimportant to the Wake-iverse. (if you only care about AW. 95% of the main game is not AW related) but you have to play it in order to get to the AWE DLC, so basically run through it so you get to the good stuff.

Had a buddy who didn't have the best time with Control, but really wanted to be in on the "Wake-iverse". I told him if you really wanna feel like you're in the loop, the Control DLC is fundamental.   

After he gave it another try and played the Control DLC he admits its atleast worth the run thru, because it puts into perspective just how powerful Alan is. He overall found a better time in general the 2nd try, and actually wants to play Control 2, whenever that comes out.
            Nah. One is a neat little tie in to Alan Wake and a good teaser for II, but it’s not strictly necessary.
            I didn’t love Control.

Alan Wake 2 was amazing tho.
        I disagree. I played Alan Wake 1 years ago and loved it. Played the remaster as well. Tried Control and hated it. Stopped playing it after a couple hours. Played Alan Wake 2 this year and it is my GOTY. And I had no issue following the story.
            You just answered my question about whether I needed to like Control, which didn’t stick for me. Now I’m interested in AW2.
    I am currently trying to get through the remaster myself and man…I want to quit so bad lol. you’re right, the world itself is interesting but the gameplay is very very dated.
    The gameplay of the first one is janky bullshit but the story is cool.

AWII is 1000% better.
        I actually think AW1 combat is much cleaner and straightforward plus it has no bs boss fights
            With Alan Wake as my GOTY I understand what you mean. 1 had straight forward shine light and shoot. It was simple and every enemy worked the same way. 

In 2 you have enemies that disappear with just light (making you waste bullets), enemies that die without shining a light and enemies that seem to take way more light and bullets but for no real reason.

I don’t think it’s necessarily worse but it’s very different. In 1 it helps combat fear because you know what to do in every situation.

In 2, I find combat to be far more chaotic
                I personally liked the enemies that just disappear brought a lot of tension, but generally agree the combat in general is a bit more chaotic. I think it's to do with the closer camera, especially in the forest where it can get disorientating. It was a bit goofy, but having the camera zoom in on new enemies spawning in in AW1 I started to miss haha.
            I agree AW2 combat was it's weakest part, well that and the plotboard sections, I loved it at first as it was very novel but my god I don't know how Saga takes a shit without first looking through 3 files and 15 photos and then profiling the turd.
            Boss fights are a staple of video games and the first one definitely had them. Or did you forget about the possessed Construction vehicles?
                I haven't played 2, so can't compare, but 1 had what, 2 "bossfights"? namely, >!the bulldozer and the tornado.!<
                I do remember them. They weren’t good but nowhere near the level frustration AW2 bosses have caused me
            lol. No.
    100% agree, the combat is awful but i keep hearing about how good the story/atmosphere is
    It’s a beautiful and fun game but the story is meandering and self-indulgent. And I agree, the Taken are a bit repetitive and combat is limited. Worth a play, not a replay IMO
    You nailed Remedy in a nutshell. Gameplay has never felt satisfying to me, it always feels like a struggle against the enemy AI, too tight of a camera and clunky movement. But the visuals, setting and story are usually terrific.
        Why are people so eager to heap such praise upon a studio that consistently, spectacularly fails at the single most important aspect of making a videogame? Do you really care about story and visuals so much more that you’re willing to completely overlook shallow, repetitive, boring gameplay? Why not just watch movies or TV at that point? Or are standards for gameplay so low that the bare minimum will pass as top shelf quality as long as it’s dressed up in a “cinematic” coat of paint?
            Fair criticism. You can make a similar argument for Resident Evil games. 

Playing Bungie games since I was a teen has spoiled me on smooth gameplay, so I guess I try not to be too critical on gameplay some cases as I’ve enjoyed multiple Remedy games in spite of the gameplay.
    Play control aswell, your experience will be heightened
Horror games are always a tough sell. You cut a massive portion of the market there itself so I am not shocked that it didn’t sell well. Oh and also not having a physical release also feels like a big miss on their part.
    Not being physical is 100% hurting their sales. I don’t understand why they went that route. Like why would you purposefully not have your game on shelves so that someone can impulse buy because the cover looked cool?
        They say it's due to more costs and also it might have meant delaying the game because the disc version has to be ready earlier. I don't know if it is true or they just made up something to provide an excuse. But a disc version would have been cool
            Saying it's due to costs is ridiculous. It's published by Epic Games. I will not buy it at full price because of this. You don't own digital games and they had no real reason to not do a physical.
                100%. They are talking shite. They thought that people buying disc and reselling would hurt their bottom line so they went digital only.  At this point I put my money back in my wallet out of principal… 👍🏻
                    Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
                Supposedly Epic does not have a physical game infrastructure in place, so I could see Epic not letting them do a disc version
        I'm not getting it specifically because of the lack of physical copies. The only games I get digitally are very cheap/smaller games like a Telltale game or something like that.
        [deleted]
            Lol nobody is using it "as an experiment"

It's almost definitely just a numbers thing. Somebody behind the scenes saw this was a niche title and thought that the physical sales wouldn't make up the price of printing physical copies. Were they right? Who knows! But I guarantee you nobody in this thread knows.
            Yea I really want the game but I want to actually own the disc. I have a huge backlog now so I don’t mind waiting until a potential disc version comes out.
        Yep, think how many ‘casual gamers’ who don’t keep up with reddit or GOTY news will never know that AW2 even exists.

Having space on store shelves is free advertising that is directly aimed at potential buyers.
            What makes you think casual gamers are more likely to buy physical?
                Yea casual gamers are more likely to scroll the digital stores than randomly browse a game store.
                Because they are? John Gamer is much more likely to come across the game if it's on target shelves or whatever. Lot less visual competition and a lot more likely to just happen to be at a store with it. 

 The only way someone is coming across Alan Wake 2 casually is if they happen to be browsing the store and see among the thousands of games already there. It's already pretty buried
        I disagree. Digital only is the future and studios like Remedy will benefit from it. The “impulse buy from the shelf” is a minuscule demographic that is dwarfed by “buy 2nd hand.” Having new players buy it from them and not eBay/resellers means they will get more sales as time goes on & have control over the price.

It’s also a huge waste of time and resources getting a game ready on disc too. This takes man hours to create and test & loss of margin to manufacturing, distribution, retailers, etc.

Edit: And I’m getting downvoted spammed by people who just don’t like reality. Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway. It’s an inefficient physical license. Every other industry has moved on from discs & the downvote spam comes from an entitled shrinking demographic who wants more ewaste so they can nickel and dime on games. No matter how much you whine on the internet, the days of discs are numbered. For those who want something to collect… there’s collectables.
            Fair point about the second hand market.
            >Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway.

What's up with this?Most of the games that I bought on my PS5 (disc versions) are playable from the start.  


I do understand that most games come with day 1 patches, hotfixes, etc. But that does not mean the game is not in the disk and you will have to download something in order to play. 

I can think just of  a few examples where you NEED to download something beforehand. IIRC it was a Call of Duty and Fallen Survivor(?), but that's it.  Why are you making this overgeneralization anyway?
    Idk resident evil seems to sell really well
        It's basically just Resident Evil that sells for horror games. Silent Hill as a franchise has sold less than 10 mil.
    It doesn't help that the first game is niche and the second game is EGS exclusive on PC. That has to be hurting them massively.
        Not to mention it’s a GOTY but there’s no copy that people can put under the tree as a present. What an idiotic plan.
        I mean epic is publishing it, its not like cs and dota is coming on epic.
            They could have had another company publish it. They chose to go with Epic and can't be surprised that they're not getting tons of PC sales due to it.
                Well companies are not lining up to publish a sequel to alan wake which was financially a flop, remedy was lucky to even have epic publishing it for them. Why do you think 505 didn’t publish this while the did for control? They knew alan wake 2 wouldn’t sell well, while control which is an action game to its core will sell more.
                Theyve tried to make the game for 8 years with different publishers and Epic was the only company that would let them (a) make it and (b) make it the way remedy wanted to make it
                > They could have had another company publish it

You don't know how video game publishing and development works.
    Ya I'm not a horror fan at all, the jump scare aspect of the game is really holding me back from buying it. But the world and story looking so cool, I really want to try it.
        Yeah, when you play it with headphones the random jumpscares are really anxiety inducing but other than that it’s a fantastic game
            No kidding, they really were something else. Something about the overall atmosphere of the game elevated those scares to a whole 'nother level, I don't normally get scared in any horror games like Amnesia or Resident Evil or Outlast or whatever there is, but something about AW2 was just different.
                I guess what makes it a true horror game is that it feels like there are barely any NPC’s there to interact with and it’s quiet all the time with almost no background music! It feels like one of those eerie dreams where you wander alone somewhere
            The jump scares are bs tbh! Just walking along then out of nowhere an image pops up with a scream. The cheapest way to get a jump ever! That said I am enjoying the game so far, but I've never been a fan of cheap jump scares. The atmosphere alone is spooky enough.
                I’m hoping they add an accessibility option to turn off those jump scares 😅
    Yup the most “horror” I can take is TLOU. Definitely can’t play anything more scarier than that.
    The no physical copy thing is nuts. After the game awards, I went to GameStop to try and grab a copy and the employee told me the game didn't exist and that I was thinking of Alan Wake Remastered
    I was about to say, I want to play it but I don't buy digital for consoles. There is exactly one digital media distributor I trust right now.
It's gonna be 20% off tomorrow
    I hope so im just finishing up the control dlc hahah
        I just played through AW1 last week and am halfway through Control now. Can't wait for AW2
    I know this is the PS5 subreddit, but if you can run it on PC, I was able to grab it from the Epic Games store for $26 due to their holiday sale plus coupon.
    How do you know?
        The deal has been up for 8 hours in my timezone
        $47.99 on PSN right now
            Amazing, I saw it on sale on Xbox yesterday and had my fingers crossed for it to come to PS too. Got the deluxe edition 👍👍👍
    If you happen to have a PC capable of playing it, it's $28 on Epic Games until January 10th.
Easily my Game of the Year. Finished AW1, American Nightmare and Control DLC before it and IMO it was all worth it. Remedy puts so many little details in their games like no one else.
I got interested in AW because of the Game awards concert, playing through remastered now. I plan on moving onto Control and then AW2 after that.
No physical and locked to the EGS on pc not surprised it didn’t sell as much as they liked. Game is good but their own decisions definitely played a part in low sales
    I have been waiting for AW2 since I finished AW1 almost 13 years ago. But my entire collection of PC games is pretty much on Steam. I played around with EGS when I tried Fortnite out and I just didn't like it. It's like Steam with a bunch of features removed. So I will patiently wait until Steam gets it or buy it on a console if that doesn't seem likely. But I want to see some high quality path tracing so holding out for Steam for a year or so.
It is an outstanding game. Hope more people pick it up.
    i will as soon as I see a physical release.
        Same. It's literally the only reason I haven't purchased it yet, I've been hyped for it for years but I just will not buy a digital product at full price. So it's just a waiting game, either it gets a physical release or hits like 50% off first.

Hell, I'd probably buy a Collector's Edition of a physical release just because of how much I loved the CE of the original game, it was so good.
            I was holding out for a physical version but it was on sale on Epic + Epic was giving out coupons for the holidays so I got it for $26, couldn't pass that up
                Oh damn, is that still going on? That's not bad.
        Bad for the environment, just get the digital version
            So is driving but I'm sure you do that.
    How can people pick up something that has no physical form?
        I mean...people are playing it.
        [deleted]
            Same here. I’m sure AW2 is great but I can happily wait for a mega sale or a disc. 

Judging by the game’s awful sales figures it seems most people feel the same.
            You love them?
        deep.
    Can't "pick up" a game that isn't physically there.
I believe a reason the game isnt doing well is because its digital only. The casuals dont really get any exposure to the game out in public. As moms are buying games for little timmy off walmart shelves, the game isnt available to obtain a possible buyer. And on the flipside it hasnt had months of praise and word of mouth like baulder's gate 3.
    It literally is a major factor. Having a disc on shelves is like a billboard aimed directly at your target audience.
        Still surprisedthey went that route
I wish I loved it as much as everyone else did, but it was a bit cerebral for my tastes. That being said, I have to applaud Remedy for being willing to get weird with it and take some risks. It’s definitely not like other games
    did you play Alan Wake 1 and its dlcs? 

I played through them right before starting AW2 and it made a big difference imo, its a game you kind of have to be patient with and know that you wont understand everything unt its over
        Sometimes not even then! I feel like coming here to talk theories is almost as much fun as playing the game.
        is the gameplay in Alan Wake 2 significantly better? 

Just finished the main story in 1 but I had a hard time completing it cause the gameplay was painful as hell. Felt like a duty to finish it.
            It’s better, but it’s still not amazing. That was actually a minor point of frustration that I had, was that some enemies can move really fast but you can’t keep up. So there were a few times where I felt like I got bullshit deaths because enemies were basically just able to be cheap and kill me
    I had the same experience. Played through the first game and control, but this one just really didnt do it for me. Stoked its getting recognition though, it's a good team
        Yeah I love Remedy getting recognition, and the fact that the game exists at all is pretty amazing. And I didn’t hate it, there was a lot about the game that worked for me. I am glad that I played it, but I just don’t think I necessarily loved it and I’m not sure how willing I’d be to recommend it to someone else
    Yeah, I get it. The game was definitely...wierd. I really respect the fact that you gave it a chance.
I'll buy the physical copy. If that happens.
    If they won't ever release the physical copy, I'll just wait a couple of years until it's like $10 digitally.
        This is my plan.

I'll buy digital here and there, but if it's something I'm buying full price at release it's gotta be physical. If I can't, I don't mind waiting for a while.
        That was a huge problem when buying digital releases on console, it took years for some games to get a sale and when it did go on sale it wasn't for much. Epic store on PC has a huge discount, ended up getting it for $23. Sale goes on through Jan 10th. With the increase in PS plus sub I just had to step away from console altogether, I'd say it'd be worth it if they brought more quality games every month.
I would have probably bought it if they put a physical version. As it is not interested in it digitally until it's $20.  

I really think going digital only was a miscalculation. Digital sales are more dominant but the industry isn't quite there yet.
I just picked Alan Wake 2 and Alan Wake Remaster off the Epic store for $27. What a crazy value. Can't believe it was so cheap so soon after release.
I would have bought it, but no physical release 🤷‍♂️
    Same for me.
        It seems many people feel the same judging by the recent IGN article that pointed out the game’s woeful sales. It was something like the 150th best selling game on PS and Xbox that month lol.
            Doubt. It was the 7th-most downloaded game on PS5 in Europe last month, and 12th in the US. Wherever that leaves it in overall sales, it certainly isn't anywhere outside the top 50.

    Also EGS exclusive on PC.
    Interesting. You only buy physical copies of games?
        If the PS5 had been digital-only I would have passed on the entire console.
            I got the disc version but I can’t recall buying a disc in over a year now. I like using my PS5 as a blu ray player but I could care less about having physical games anymore. I do always like having the option but I think digital is more convenient. It’s unlikely I’ll come back to this system 10yrs from now.

Personally, I think you should always have the option so I think making the game digital only was a bad call.
        Why is it interesting?
            [deleted]
                I won’t pay “60-70 dollar” larger studio experiences as digital only. I want a physical product, seems plenty enough agree. Each to their own, but I’d rather support physical formats.
            Because it’s abnormal. You’re missing out on an amazing game because of the format it’s being offered in. Why do you only purchase physical copies?
                Because I don’t own the content, only a digital licence. As I said above, not for 60-70 dollar games. I prefer to own a physical copy.
                Another reason to buy physical copies over Digital is being able to resell the game after I'm done, well at least for me. For example, I only play the main story for most of the games I purchase since I only have maybe 1 hour to play at nights after the kids have gone to bed. Most games I put in about 20 hours total into them and then get to resell them for $35-40. So being able to play that for half or even less of the full retail is amazing.
                    That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
Correction: BOTH Alan Wake games are worth full price.

Bought, beat and platinum the original on the 360 on launch day. I'm a MASSSSSSSSSIVE Remedy fan. Always have been.

Please tell every gamer you know. I can't wait another 13 years for the 3rd one.

Alan Wake is their Inception. Keep 'em coming, Sam!
I will buy it, playing through AW1 now. We need to support studios that make games like this
Remedy is one of the very few gaming companies that is willing to take risks, experiment and push the boundaries when it comes to creating AAA experiences.

I find the overwhelming majority of AAA games, even the highly acclaimed ones, to feel very safe or very typical and it's saddening to see the few that try something unique end up being a financial flop.
    Spider-Man 2 is just about the most perfectly engineered game I've played in a very long time. I loved every minute of it, but at the same time it felt _extremely_ safe the whole way through. It doesn't push the boundaries of games as a medium at all. It just does all the typical stuff extremely well. I get it, when you make a huge financial investment in a game like that, you _need_ it to pay off. But it really sucks how that line of thinking stifles creativity, and I'm thrilled that we have studios like Remedy out there to do the things that major publishers and studios tend to avoid out of fear.
    I fully agree. The majority of this thread seems to be people posting about wanting to buy the game, but not actually buying it, and it's this lack of support for anything out of the mainstream that's the reason we see the same formulaic games year after year.
Physical copy or bust.
I’d buy it if they’d release a physical copy with the full game on the disc. Otherwise I’ll just watch a play through on YouTube. It looks like an interesting lore/story.
Alan Wake 2 might be the most striking game i have ever played. It is truly a 1 of 1 experience and seems to be shaping up as an all time game for me.
I’d love to purchase and play it! But they didn’t release a physical copy, and that was completely, 100% their decision to lose all of those sales.
    There will almost definitely be a physical GOTY addition.
        i’ll just wait for that
    I’m still hoping that limitedrun or iam8bit will release a physical copy of the game at some point!
    I agree with this. I often buy a game at full price if it’s physical because I can resell it after I complete it. 

A digital only title is going to have to wait till it’s in the sale before I buy it, especially if it comes out at £50

Now it’s down to £39.99 in the sale I’ll be buying it.
    90% of Control's sales were digital according to Remedy. 

Don't think they're missing out on too many sales because they went digital only. Which, you know, is why they went digital only.
        > 90% of Control's sales were digital according to Remedy.

Either the game sold way way more on PC on console or it's been very discounted, because that's weird. 

[The recent leaks showed how much physical games still sell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18magu9/sales_numbers_for_a_ton_of_sony_games_including/) For the vast majority of Sony AAA games (the ones getting a physical release), they don't even get to 50% digital sales.
            I saw that. I think it's just a case by case basis thing.


Sony first party games are not necessarily representative of the entire industry. They tend to be sold in bundles prominently, for one thing.
        Then there should be no complaints from them about reduced sales or the game not doing well financially! More power to ‘em if some sales instead of all possible sales is good enough for them.
            The cost to produce physical copies of the game would not have netted a profit from those who’d buy it physically but refuse it digitally.
                Quite so. A physical release has its costs as well. All those copies need to be made and distributed. In this case we don't know for sure if it was up to Epic or Remedy that there was no physical release at launch. But Remedy's recent real experiences with physical copies are not great. AW Remastered sold less than they hoped for, and I understand there was a lot of physical copies left unsold (which means that they represented straight-up loss). And then with Control, the great majority of the sales was digital.

Based on those experiences, Remedy may well have looked at what a physical release would cost, by Epic's estimate, in addition to a digital release, and predict that it would not likely make them profit with the expected sales numbers.

Some might argue that with the current balance between the numbers of digital and physical copies sold in gaming, we are approaching an era where physical copies do not represent a money-making part of the business, but merely a courtesy to collectors and (the small minority of) players who prefer physical. Whether it makes a profit may be a toss-up, and some companies may practically only do it for marketing/visibility and image reasons.
                    Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
                I’d love to see the numbers supporting that!
                    This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
                    I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
                        Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
                        I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
                        Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
            nobody is complaining though.
                That you’ve seen. I’ve seen a lot of it. People complaining that not enough people bought it or gave it a chance when there’s a line of people waiting to support it physically. Hopefully no complaints to come from Remedy though, they’ve made their bed.
                    So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
                    Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
                        You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
                    You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
                        Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
                    I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
                    If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.
            There haven’t been any complaints from them whatsoever. They are enjoying the success of their game and are actively supporting/updating it to make it an even more polished experience. Also, it might not be selling well compared to top-selling AAA games but it is doing great compared to other Remedy titles.
    It was the publisher’s/Epic’s decision, not Remedy’s.
        Nope, Remedy decided to partner with Epic knowing they wouldn’t support physical release.
            And without epics funding the game wouldn’t have been made at all, so either way there’s no physical release.
            See my other comment replying to you. I don’t think you’re acknowledging the reality of game development. It would be great if we lived in a world where risky, costly games like AW2 can get the funding for physical releases. But that’s not the world we live in. And I don’t think it’s fair to hold that against the developer who made an incredible experience that flies in the face of what is “safe” and “profitable” in today’s gaming market. We need to support these types of games so that hopefully in the future they will be able to justify physical releases.
                I mean, they could partner with someone like Limited Run Games, who knows how to make profitable physical runs of potentially risky titles.
                Physical release would be a very tiny part of the budget of the games though. It doesn't cost as much as you imagine. Plenty of smaller games get a physical release too. 

Epic is publishing this, it's one of the biggest gaming companies there is, it's not a budget problem.
                I simply disagree with you. If games like Senua’s Sacrifice, Outlast, Life is Strange, and other similar titles can get physical releases, there’s no excuse for a huge production like Alan Wake. It doesn’t fly in the face of what is profitable, as the entire reason for digital only release is to increase profits at the expense of the consumer. If you’re fine with that, by all means rent all of your games for $60, $70+. To each their own!
                    The games you listed are anywhere from 6 years to over a decade old. They reflect a completely different market and landscape for game development that is no longer relevant, especially post-pandemic. 

I’m not saying that the current state of things is better - in fact I would say it’s worse, and I agree that anti-consumer profit motives drive most decisions these days. But when a title like AW2 has the chance to shift the mainstream mindset about what types of games can succeed, and we choose to shun it due to capitalistic forces beyond Remedy’s control, we may be playing into those same forces’ hands and only exacerbating the problem.
            So, just to be clear here, you'd rather that Remedy didn't make the game they wanted and ended up making something that potentially isn't even half as good, as long as it got a physical release?
            Oh yeah, they should have picked one of those ten other companies offering to finance and publish the game.

Wait, there were none. Microsoft refused the game years ago and it's really not easy finding an investor for this kind of project.
            just wanna say no matter if you’re right or wrong, the way ur presenting ur side of the matter is just so obnoxious that im going to return a physical copy of any random game I own so I can replace it with a digital copy, just to spite you.

Alan Wake 2 is as amazing as it is because of Remedy partnering with Epic and therefore getting a budget in order to make such a masterpiece. Sucks that there’s no physical copy but the game is worth every single penny.
                I don’t mind at all if you want to return your owned games for long term rentals! To each their own. Enjoy.
                    get a job
                        a job is how i afford a bunch of physical games lol
                            people are just salty that you didn't play a game they like, it's common here
        Same thing, the money you pay for the game also goes to Epic anyway (maybe completely even if Remedy was already paid and got no royalties, depends of their contract)

So the lesson can be for them.
    Same. Fuck these types of decisions. They want to play it like that?  I'll easily play something else and vote with my money.
        So edgy. So brave.
    Neither did BG3 on launch and that's done just fine.

It's nothing to do with a lack of physical media, more down to releasing the game during a stacked period of releases.

Edit: What's with the downvotes lol?
        It's cute how they thought moving it up a week from Spiderman 2 was gonna make a difference.
I don’t get where these rumours are coming from? I watched a recent interview (in finnish) of Remedys CEO, and based on him the sales have been promising so far, and better than Control for example.

But i agree, this game is worth the price for sure!
blame them for not releasing a physical disk version. I am not buying anymore digital games after what happened with sony system glitching banning accounts, and Sony removing paid video content.
    Sony removed it cuz Warner discovery is currently being run into the ground. Either way people need to realize it’s going to keep happening to digital, they’re licenses not products.
        There needs to be a law change, you buy a license you get to watch/play it. They remove it and you get a full refund.
    You don’t look very deep into things do you? Probably just read headliners and go off of that.
I would love to play it but they alienated us folks who like to own the disc copy.

So until it's available on disc, I'll just crack on with my other games.
    It’s mad that they fell into the double trap of being an Epic PC exclusive and having no disc. No wonder it’s flopping sales-wise.
Alan Wake was a blast to play through. The tension, eeriness and story was amazing. Control was a whole other beast. Equally great but had so many refreshing mechanics and once again, great storytelling with weird twists and turns. Just picked up Alan Wake 2 and can’t wait.
Absolutely
Id like to play It, but im waiting physical release.
    See you never 💀
>  Recently I've read that it didn't do well financially, and that really is a shame.

Where? One analyst said it has sold approximately 850k copies on consoles by the end of November – one month since release. So we can quite safely say it has broken over 1 million copies with PC sales within the first two months. Control took 15 months to sell 2 million copies, AW2 is on track to reach those numbers way faster. Also with no physical sales the publisher's cut for each sale is higher than it would be with physical sales.

It's no means a financial failure. People just have a very skewed understanding of what constitutes a success when games like Spider-man 2, a game that has x times higher budget than AW2, sell 5 million copies in a week.
I dont care. Not buying this until a physical release comes out.
    Same. The lack of physical release really puts me off.
No interest in digital only games as in my experience digital games cost more than physical games due to reduced competition (shops sell below RRP).That's not something I'm willing to support.
    If they want my money they need to do a physical release
The game is fantastic, it doesn’t feel like a game and more like an experience!
I’m holding out on either a boutique physical release or a steeper discount
I played the first one years ago and have the remaster..playing atm will pick up 2 shortly after loved control
Ima still wait for a big sale
I would have preordered a physical edition. As it is, I'll wait for a hefty discount with the DLC included.
Gonna check this out now PTO has started!
Genuinely my favorite game of the year. Everything else was a disappointment except it.
Got it full price as a blind buy despite not playing the first one, mainly because I already exhausted every other AAA title I wanted to play on PS5. It was having nothing else to buy on top of also having enjoyed Control and its lore that I decided to this game a try, despite still not really getting the story of the first game (plus DLCs) via recaps and thinking the game looked kinda boring on streams.

Beyond glad I did. It was one of the best and most memorable games I've ever played (amusingly, the previous games make a lot more sense now after playing the AW2). The story has stayed rent free in my head for the past week since finishing it. A lot of the themes are themes I'm into IRL so this game felt made for me. Not that I regret any of the $100+ of sweet cosmetics I bought in Fortnite, but knowing Epic Games published this game makes me a little happier about that money I spent if it in some really indirect way contributed in the tiniest way to Alan Wake 2's publishing. 

Now I'm beyond hyped for Control 2 and heading back into Control to tackle the DLCs that I skipped the first time around. 

What a game. I'm bummed that beyond the usual AAA first party titles released so far, I also blew through Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, and Alan Wake 2 all within a 12 month span, all of them being the first games of their kind that I played. And now I have to face knowing that it'll be a while before I play such games again.
The fact that they didnt release a physical copy makes me really off put with this title.
Sounds fantastic. I didn’t play Alan Wake 1 - will this impact my enjoyment of 2 or should I still go for it?
    So, it's a narrative focused experience. I would definitely watch a recap at least. There's this whole crazy "object of power" thing. So.. it's like if Stephen King had a magical flashlight and had to confront evil with a Finnish metal band. I can't make that up.
        Sounds incredible. Will definitely start with AW1!
    You can totally jump into 2, but I’d strongly recommend playing AW1 first. There are a ton of nods, references, and callbacks you’ll miss. Plus the stakes of the story, what the characters have gone through, and the whereabouts of other side characters are directly informed by the events of the first game. 

To get the most out of it you’ll at least want to have played/watched a playthrough of both AW1 and Control. If you want to add a little more flavor, the Bright Falls web series will give you a bit more of a look at the world you’ll be stepping into as well.
        Appreciate this - will start with AW1 and fully immerse myself. Excited to begin.
    Alan Wake 2 is a DIRECT sequel. Going into it without watching a play through or full story recap will leave you very confused as to what’s going on. I’d play AW1 if you can but if you deem it too much then at least watch a story explanation.

Control is a game that is very important to the story too but not so much as AW1 - I recommend playing it or getting familiar with what it is atleast.
        Good to know - thanks very much! Will start with AW1.
    I came to it with no experience of AW1 or any Remedy games but was impatient to play it, and I don’t regret it at all, it’s a fantastic game and I haven’t felt at any moment that I wish it hadn’t been my first experience in the AW world, so if you’re impatient don’t worry, it is still great!
I’m glad I paid for this one because it was really like no game I’ve ever played. I’ll support remedy fully after this masterpiece
I’m playing through it and made a post on this sub about it. It’s killer. I jumped into it, not knowing anything about the first, and I’ve been enjoying the ride ever since. Not the scariest game I’ve played, but definitely has the best narrative in a horror game I’ve played. Make no mistake. Just because it isn’t the scariest one of I’ve played, doesn’t mean it isn’t scary at all. This one has made me jump and shriek more times than I’d like to admit.
    Haha, right!? What a ride!
I bought this game and I honestly regret it. It was advertised as a survival horror type game and I was expecting something to Resident Evil. Instead it was mostly a walking Twin Peaks simulator. I appreciate all the work and creativity that went into it, but it fell short of my expectations, there was barely any actual gameplay.
    I didn’t enjoy getting killed so fast by the taken. Made some sections and boss fights really annoying
    Lol no gameplay? There was plenty of gameplay. It was never meant to be a Resident Evil type of game. Way more narrative focused.
        Again, it was advertised as a survival horror game. I wouldn’t qualify it as such. If I had known it was so narrative heavy I wouldn’t have bought it.
Does the story conclude or is it left open?

While I have enjoyed remedy games I’ve found their storytelling to be frustratingly obtuse and never end in a satisfying way. 

It’s a bit like the first few seasons of LOST where it starts strong but you soon realise they’re presenting more questions than they intend to answer and I lose interest.
    You get a lot of answers, but the story does not conclude completely. But not really in a "left open" way. More in a "there will be a third installment" kinda way.
    It is left open in such a way that it’s basically screaming “stay tuned for AW3/Control 2 to find out what’s next”. We’re still waiting on a few dlc expansions though so I’m sure we’ll get more clarification there.
    It is left open, and completely non nonsensical. Calling it a "story" is stretching that word a bit far. It is more like a series of strange events. It is an interesting series of events. But it isn't really a story, it doesn't go anywhere and whatever it tries to say is so unclear that you can't make it out.
        It goes everywhere and it is explained very clearly in all the texts and cutscenes and dialogues and whatnot. But if you don't pay attention to any of those and just rush through the game playing like it's a shooter, then sure.
        That's not true at all. It's true that it isn't spelled out to you. It requires a lot of knowledge, reading, and analysis, but the entire story is there, everything makes sense, and the answers are there for you to find. Anything that's still unknown is made pretty clear to be a mystery to be answered later.
I agree that it’s worth full price. I think I’m only about halfway through it, but it has blown me away so far. Never really experienced anything like it.
Hoping they'll release a disc with the DLC once it's out. I have 100GB for downloads per month, and Alan Wake 2 is 80GB. Otherwise it would've been a day 1 buy for me.
I'll play it when it comes to steam. 


Also no physical release...?
No wonder the sales didn't reflect well.
    Shhhh you’re not allowed to mention that it didn’t get a physical release, people will get mad lol
        Despite the fact that like 60% of the comments in any *Alan Wake II* thread, including this one, are heavily upvoted criticising the lack of a physical release?
        What? That’s what literally 80% of the comments are in any thread even tangentially related to AW2.
        Really? 95% of the comments in this thread are people waiting for physical lmao, in 2023. Completely in vain.
        Rather than going mad, people are likely to point out that a physical release would likely not make for huge additional sales for a (niche) game like this. Maybe 10-20% more sales could be expected with a physical option. Remedy knows this from their recent experience with Control, so they are not taking a big risk with a purely digital release.
            It's not about how much extra money they'll make, it's about supporting physical media over digital, which has had plenty of examples of companies just removing access to digitally bought content. With no physical release one day you'll end up not being able to play a game you paid money for, so digital only is extremely anti-consumer.
                We should expect companies to work for preserving their games so that people who bought them can play them in the future. But it would be reductionist to say that physical discs are the only side to the matter. The issue is institutional readiness to have it as a priority to look after the interests of your customers, it is not merely a matter of format.

Companies like Remedy have a vested interest in preserving the games they have made so people can keep playing them in the future as well. Remedy has no interest to remove access to its digital content. It would go against its very business model.

To give an example: with AW1 Remedy had issues with licensed music expiring, which led to the game being removed from different storefronts in 2017, something the company really didn't want to happen. With AW2, they solved the above problem by not having licensed music at all, but owning the rights to all the music in the game, made for the game. All the music is DMCA free, as well. This way, there are no issues related to external IP rights with this game to cause it availability issues down the line.

Remedy's future success is based on the Remedy Connected Universe they are building with the Control and Alan Wake franchises connected to each other in many ways. They want to keep selling their games, and for them to have a long tail. For this, they need to be continually available for both old and new players.

Given that today you'll need to download a lot of content for games even if they are on a physical disc, too, I would not say that physical is a silver bullet for game preservation in any case. Many games today and especially tomorrow are so big in file size that you couldn't comfortable fit them into one or even two discs, anyway. Many companies that have a "physical release" will still need you to download much or most of the content. And then there are the updates. Alan Wake 2 alone has received over a dozen downloadable updates over less than two months. Remedy has been pretty responsive with those updates, too, fixing issues specifically pointed out to them by the players, and so on.

We all share the same concerns, we want game companies to be responsive and fair to their players, customers and fans. So, let's take a broad perspective into these issues.
                    This was a good comment
                    Really well said, I hope people take this into consideration.
    Serious question. I'm  in a very fortunate situation where i have every current gen console. I also have a decent gaming laptop. So you know what my background with gaming is. My question is this. What's the big deal? Why won't you click on a different icon? I really truly don't understand. Is it a moral thing? Did epic do something untoward?
    It will never come to Steam, it's published by Epic.

And why would you care about physical if you're waiting for Steam, lol.
I'll wait until they actually decide to release the game. digital only isn't a real release
    Are you writing from the 1990s?
        Why is it so offensive that people want to own a physical copy of something they spend their hard earned money on?

            I didn’t say it was offensive, I was just commenting how hilariously outdated it was to think that digital only isn’t a real release.
            No one is offended, its just weird to think that a game that was released digitally isn't a real release.
Damn I wanted this but no physical? No thanks. I had no idea until right now tbh.
They fucked themselves by going digital only. I woulda bought it day one physical if not for that. 120 AUD for standard? No thank you. Ended up buying on EGS for less than 50 AUD. No brainer.
Can’t believe how different it is from AW1. Remedy don’t give a fuck about following formulas. Even Control 2 could end up being completely different from the original.
Unsurprising, given how the vast majority of gamers only play the same few immensely popular multiplayer games.

Or sports games.

It's a miracle when any narrative game not developed by a Sony first party studio sells any copies at all.
My GOTY. Incredibly unique experience from start to finish
I love anything Sam Lake touches so I plan on picking this up when I have the funds.
I recently bought PS5 and this is the first game I paid full price for. It absolutely deserves it, we need more like it. My new favorite game of all time.
Literally any game that gets cheaper two months after release is worth waiting for. Also I have too many games to buy any brand new ones unless they’re the kind that jump straight to the front of the order. AWII is on the list, but it isn’t a list jumper.
i had never played the first one, picked up the remastered edition for nine bucks and i’m loving it. can’t wait to get the new one when i’m done.
Alan Sleep 2 on the other hand is not even worth half the price
Yes I know it’s only a key.  But if we go by that line of thinking all video games are a rip off and theft by deception.  IMO Buying Digital is such a load.  I smell WEF!

Here buy my product for $75.00!! 

Disclaimer:  I can stop access to this product anytime I choose.

They sell you a digital copy that’s step #1.  Then in step #2 make you sign the Eula agreement which is essentially you sticking your own neck in the hangman’s noose.
Bought it and it’s an amazing game. Highly recommend
There's so many good free games there is no reason to spend money on games anymore.
I will always support Remedy.  I just, can't right now, financially.  But I will carry their good name forever.
Recently finished the game. Amazing story!
Looks fun but I’ll probably die before they release any physical version so I wig choose to “miss out” here. Not a fan of any AAA not having physical when it’s a viable option. Not surprised it didn’t do well financially as I’m sure I’m not alone with skipping this due to that choice.
Is the first one necessary to play or would a recap video suffice? 
  
…for those of us with no time lol
Personally waiting for a sale. Gameplay didn't really impress me but the story and production values are great.
This might be a bad take but often when the devs announce they are making DLC's for a game it sometimes makes me want to wait for the complete edition :( Will definitely be picking this game up as it looks amazing but I have such a massive backlog I'll wait for the complete edition in a couple of years.
I was gonna get another copy on PC to play on Nightmare difficulty and new game plus because controller is a bit difficult for me in this game. I feel even better about my decision after I heard they didn't sell much. It deserves so much more
It is a fantastic game.  Very innovative way to tell a story.  The way it all weaves together is fantastic!
Alan Wake is in my top 10 greatest games of all time and I’ve been gaming since 1987 so that’s how highly I rate it so I can’t wait to play this sad to hear it’s not sold well though btw I always wait a few months to get new games to allow the devs to iron out the bugs with updates 👍🏻
I'm currently playing through it and loving it. I played the original years ago, but bought the remaster and completed that and the additional episodes to set myself up for the sequel. I've got Control in my library, but I've not played that yet, I didn't realise it tied into AW in a big way, I'll have to play that once I've finished AW2.

Three of my favourite shows are Twin Peaks, True Detective and The Twilight Zone, this game is basically a distillation of those three shows as a game, and I bloody love it. Definitely getting more Twin Peaks: The Return vibes from AW2 though.
I did Not buy a Game on full price the Last ten years and Just in this minute I finished the main Story and the Credits are rolling. Never have i (except for god of war) thought to myself: What a Ride! IT was worth it all the way i still got goosebumps and I bought the full digital Deluxe Edition for 80 bucks. Cant wait to Play new Game plus AND the upcoming content for the season Pass. This Game brought me Back to write Storys myself again, the Last Time i did this was as a child. Thank you remedy !
Didn’t do well financially because they didn’t release a disc version. Ridiculous decision given how much the game would have cost to make, missed a massive % of sales because of this decision.
I’m trying to play through the first one first and the combat is sooo clunky.

The story is interesting though. Should I just watch a summary and skip to the second game? Is the gameplay smoother?
no physical no moni 💯
I hated AW 1 due to the jank and repetition. I also quit Control after the first main fight/boss due to terrible performance.

I want to like AW2 though, because ive heard it'sa massive improvement over the first. Can anyone confirm, or should I just save my money?
It's a fuckin blast.. definitely in my top 10 favs of all time.. the game play isn't all that different from the first one, but the characters and world are phenomenal.. the lore is exciting to those that have been around aw1 and control too..
I am a fan of all things horror, being it video games, movies or books. I consume the media even when it's not that good. Alan wake 2 is a refreshing take on what horror games can present the viewer. The inclusion of musical like sections was surprising and well done.
Played Quantam Break about 2 months before Alan Wake 2, just beat the remaster, now I'm going through Control again especially for the Alan Wake DLC, i really want to replay the Max Paynes next. It's so awesome how all of their games are connected. Characters from every game are woven into Alan Wake 2 and were some of my favorite moments! Can't wait for the Alan Wake 2 DLC!!
Because there is no physical release people would rather not purchase a game that they want to play, and that pays the wages of the team that brought it to life.. because they want a shiny bit of polycarbonate.. sort yourself out..
Yep, I paid full price for Deluxe. After _Control_, Remedy basically have a customer for life. I will single-handedly support any and all of Sam Lake's harebrained schemes because chances are they contain some bomb-ass storytelling.
They need a physical release for me to support it
    Are you 40 or what
I played through all of Alan Wake 1 and Control + DLC. While I think it’s really cool that they are interconnected and stuff, I don’t recall a single thing about the plot for either of those games. I wish I did, because I’d like to get AW2 someday (hopefully as a physical release), but I’d also rather not replay either of said prior entries.
I’m still not getting the hype myself and that’s on high end PC with full path tracing etc.

Art direction is great, but story is convoluted just for the sake of being so and the combat is honestly very dull.
For people who have time to play it , i for one will never buy a game full price again. Why ? Well because i don’t really have the time to enjoy it ++ I don’t know if its just me, but i still go back to replay the classic games. Also you can get it at a decent price in after some months. But ya for those of you who just have the time go for it
    Buying at launch almost never makes sense it's all risk and the reward is only being able to play the game earlier. For some that might make sense for example you have a certain window of free time to burn. But more than likely buying at launch there will be bugs and balance changes and it will take multiple weeks to patch it. I'm seeing more games even from trustworthy studios adding content later because it was just not ready for launch (like new game plus modes). As we've seen here just waiting a few months you can already get games on discount especially if they launched the second half of the year where you get closer to black Friday and Christmas sales boost (games launching in August already getting discounts).
I'll get it when it's very cheap since it's download only.
Unpopular opinion but since the reception of the first game was lukewarm, it's very difficult for this game to be recommended since I wouldn't personally recommend people slog through the first game.
    Except most fans are saying you dont need the first one to enjoy this one
        Except I'm talking about why the game is underselling. 90% of people buying games are not buying a game because of the box art anymore. They won't have played the first one and if they have, they would have bought this game on release. 
  
The fanbase is small, the hype was medium, but the game is good.
        Honestly, as a fan who's played both, I think you do. Yeah you  *can* skip it, but this is a narrative heavy game with some gameplay here and there. What's the point if you miss key references and stuff? While I love AW1 it's combat is atrocious and tiresome. I'd suggest watching an in depth YT video explainer instead.
No physical release plus Epic Games exclusive on PC…. No wonder it didn’t sell well.
God I wish they’d come out with a physical copy tho…
    This, for me buying single player, story driven game that you can't resell after finishing is a waste of money, so unless they won't include it in the Game Pass or PS+, I won't buy this game. Which is a shame, because I loved AW on my X360 and Control on XSX.
Not offering a physical copy of the game was a terrible decision.
I just seems like the most unappealing game ever
    It’s an acquired taste and somehow both intellectual and not
    How so?
        People just like to hate on things that are popular and getting worldwide acclaim. Nothing to see here.
        Too cerebral for him and not enough explosions, I'd guess.
It's not worth full price. No AAA game is. AAA game budgets are about the same as movie budgets and the gaming industry makes significantly more money.
    I’ll extend that and say that to me, not many overall games are worth full price to me, and the ones that are have a physical version that I can buy and are games that I have faith in that I can enjoy, even though they may not be the most critically acclaimed at times.

(Although critical reception is important to me as money gets tighter over time).
I would pay more than full price for this game… if it got a physical copy. They could release a $90-$100 dollar special edition and I would buy it. It looks like an incredible game. But I can’t in good conscious support the phasing out of actually owning media. 

I know a lot of people don’t mind games becoming digital only, but I am not one of them.
    Exactly this. I’d be happy to pay full price for a physical copy but absolutely refuse to support companies who want to phase out physical games and media.
        Wow, I didn't know that. So.. they simply refused to put out a disk version? Why would Remedy make that decision?
            >Why would Remedy make that decision?

They didn't. Epic Games did.
            Pure greed. They don’t care about consumers or game preservation at all, and that’s a problem that will only grow the more companies like theirs are supported, unfortunately.
                I find that so hard to believe though. The game just has so much heart. I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, it just doesn't track
                    Unfortunately, they’ve admitted it’s to cut costs on their end (and increase their profits at consumer and game preservation’s expense, is how that translates). Some people will never care about physical media and will simply pay whatever the company charges for digital rentals, as that’s what “buying” digital is, and just accept if a company decides to cut off their access to the game entirely. It’s sad to say about a company that’s made a cool game, but it very much tracks.
                        How can they be increasing their profits when the game is cheaper than any other AAA game out there? It’s $59.99 as opposed to $69.99 on console and cheaper on PC too. 

If they wanted greed and profit why did they price it lower?
                            Probably because it’s a niche horror IP, wouldn’t sell at $69.99. No physical means they don’t have to pay the manufacturing costs.
                Idk why you're blaming Remedy when Epic Games is the one publishing the game and making that decision.
                    Remedy agreed to the conditions of making and releasing their game under Epic Games, and there’s no shot they didn’t, at absolute bare minimum, know Epic Games wouldn’t release a physical copy. They’re absolutely at fault, along with Epic.
                        So would you rather they didn’t agree to those terms, and the game didn’t get made at all? Remedy is a niche developer that makes niche games that take risks - chances are no other publisher was willing to fund development of the game at all, let alone a physical release.
                            PS funded Returnal and Death Stranding, MS published Quantum Break. There are probably plenty of publishers who would’ve been willing to publish it.
                                Slightly different contexts to all of those games though, aren't there?

*Returnal* is made by a Sony first-party studio, so its going to get backing, and Sony tend to back their own studios. *Death Stranding* is made by probably one of, if not *the* most well-known game director on the planet - he's the very literal definition of "give the man what he wants", hence why he gets games made and even just partnered with Xbox for a new game.

Also, Microsoft published *Quantum Break* because, like Sony with *Returnal*, Remedy had a partnership agreement with them then. 

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
                                Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
                        Supremely idiotic take.
                            And you’re entitled to this nothing take lol
                                You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
                                    You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
                            I agree. That person would prefer Remedy just shut down when AW2 doesn't sell a million units rather than they take help from epic.
            Yeah they have repeatedly said they don’t plan to release a physical edition. They said it was to help keep costs down. And they also claimed that having to have a download upon inserting the disc would hurt the experience…? But if you buy it digitally you also have to wait for a download.
                They are making excuses alan wake 1 remastered came out on disc for both xbox and playstation(both ps4 and ps5 discs),but they can't make physical copies of the sequel for some reason. They couldn't put the game on Steam becasue epic want an exclusive. Epic sabotaged the games sales hard there is no way they didn't realize this.
    Haha so many people get so butthurt when you say that you won’t buy digital only games. But we will be the ones laughing when inevitably they cannot access those digital only games at some point down the line.
        They always do for some reason haha. We’ll still be able to play nearly every game we’ve ever bought in the future, and that’s vindication enough!
            I think you don’t realize that a lot of people don’t ever replay their games, especially not ones from previous generations. Once a new console comes out, the old one goes into some box in the garage and is never touched again. I have a box full of Xbox 360 games that haven’t been touched in a decade. I have no interest in playing such old games. For most casual gamers like me, there’s no difference between physical and digital. Digital might be better since physical games could be damaged and take up space.
                Can I have your stuff then? They'll have a great home in my collection.
            It’s so weird because this is something that hurts the entire gaming community. And yet everyone gets out their pitchforks to defend it. 

If this was an indie game I could understand the digital only release. But I think that sending AAA companies the message that we will essentially pay for long term rentals of their games is just mad.
        Not to start anything but if I had to guess, it's that you guys kind of come off really condescending when making statements like that. Like, I think the OP of this thread made a reasonable comment, but there's other people straight up insulting the game, the developer, and the people that bought it digitally just because there's no physical version.

And overall there's just far more nuance to the situation than people are really presenting here. It's a reasonably low budget avant-garde horror game, they probably need to cut what costs they can to make a profit. I'd be upset if this was Call of Duty doing this.
I can’t wait to play the game myself, and I’m sure the game will be as incredible as Control was, but holy fuck the way people talk about this game just makes me roll my eyes.
    Maybe it’s just that good
        I’m sure it is very good, but from the limited amount I’ve seen the gameplay looks like Resident Evil survival horror. That’s not risk taking.
            Lol. I mean if you want to base your opinion about a game on some 5 minute gameplay video on youtube, sure. Your miss.
            From what I understand, the narrative is very cerebral and risk-taking.
    Its another one of those "I'm 14 and this is deep" game that really has mediocre gameplay and story, but they make it seem like a revolutionary masterpiece. Its exactly the type of game journalist love though I give em that.
        Doesn't help that the fanbase's go-to-response whenever someone criticizes anything about the game is "lol skill issue".
I can’t wait. I’m playing through AW right now, AW2 is up next!
20% off on the store now. I think it was a bad move making it digital-only though.
> Recently I've read that it didn't do well financially 

Who could've guessed with no physical release and epic exclusivity lmao what a dumb way of publishing such a banger.
    He's stating a completely unfounded rumor, we have no data of how well it's selling since digital sales can't be tracked and Epic doesn't ever disclose game sales. They might release a statement giving some idea of how it's doing after the holidays.
I’m currently playing through Alan Wake 1 (for the first time) because I’m very interested in the 2nd
Which means if you can get it on a deal its essentially a steal lol noted
    Yeah, but what I am trying to say is that it should not be stolen. It is worth full price.
It's not. No game ever is. That's why they go on sale eventually. They can ask for less and they do. Nothing wrong about it.
Release it physically and i'll buy it. It's that simple.
Cool. Give me a physical option and I'd buy it
If there was a physical copy, I would have bought it at launch. As it is, I'll buy it heavily discounted on PC (or console but PC will likely be cheaper) in a few years. 

Personal reasons (it's simply more expensive for a game I'm not sure I'll like as survival horror is not even a genre I like very much) and for the principle of the thing, I don't support AAA games going all digital
I don’t buy digital games but if they make a physical disc I’ll get it for $70
I didn’t buy it because it’s digital only and I’ve got a stack of games still to play
It didn't sell well cause that's all on Remedy.

On consoles, they didn't release a physical version and on PC, they made it an Epic exclusive.
I bet they'd sell a lot more if they were on Steam. But as Epic was involved, it won't be. Skipping Steam is a significant loss.
    This.
I adored the first one. Second one took a little longer to get into (mind palace annoyed me at first) but once I got in the swing I couldn’t put it down. Absolutely brilliant game. Well worth anyone’s time and money.
Don’t care still waiting for a sale 2-3 years from now.
Just picked it up on pc. Got a free Fortnite outfit and Alan wake remaster. Only cost me £21.49 for all that.
I wish they would have released a physical copy. That might account for some lost sales. It's how they lost mine.
EGS exclusive = shoot yourself in the foot and act surprised when it bleeds
    Epic funded the game, ofc it's exclusive, no one else in the industry wanted to take the risk to fund this weird crazy idea for a game. Remedy asked Microsoft multiple times.
        There were other avenues they could've taken to secure funding that wouldn't have locked them out of physical release on console and steam release on pc. If scamware can raise millions on a kickstarter, so could they. But they destroyed their future profits for quick epic cash. Considering how many gamers didn't even know this game launched at all, they really hurt themselves here.
I would buy it if they release it on disc...
I would buy it if it was physical. Refuse to support this lame ass movement. Sorry!
Why are there so many of these posts? It almost feels like a deliberate attempt to shill for a product that was adequately advertised but  many decided wasn't worth their time.
    Thats what it is  the game was literally in goty awards with many nominations thats more marketing than most games can say they have if it still failed people just don't want the game. Doesn't help they didn't put it on steam imagine making a digital only release than only putting it on Epic Games of all things. They wanted the game to fail to than to play underdog its actually a masterpiece card like they are now.
No physical release, means I won't buy it. Digital only is not acceptable.
Not gonna buy it unless they release a physical copy. Won't support anti-consumer digital only BS.
[deleted]
    Well said. Some of these posts on Xbox & PlayStation subs feel like a direct marketing attempt. I don’t know if OP is a real gamer or some sock account that got paid to market a game.
No physical copy, no purchase. Plain and simple.
Glad you’re happy OP. No way I’m touching that digital only game near full price.
It hasn’t done well due to no physical copy and epic store exclusivity on pc.
    There's zero indication of how well or poorly it's doing, that's just baseless speculation.
        There’s indications, 850k in two months on consoles is not great.

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/alan-wake-2-lack-of-sales-update-suggests-it-didn’t-sell-too-well.1664654/
    But I’ve been told that physical media is dead and no one buys physical games anymore /s
it flopped sadly cause they didn't release physical copies
Maybe I was misinformed but I heard there’s way too many cutscenes. Half the reason I haven’t got it yet. And also hearing you play as someone else more than him.
Unless they release a physical edition, the best price is zero.
Not after they decided to not sell physical copies. I know all companies are greedy, but THAT level of greedines crosses a line. I'm waiting for a VERY good sale.
    All companies operating in the market economy want to make a profit. That is how business works. 

What exactly is especially greedy about not releasing a physical copy?
        Tanking physical copies resales where they have no control over the price. Physical copies gets cheaper faster than digital. I also believe that no physical copies helps them keep the price higher on digital storefronts on consoles for longer periods.
            If the decision to make the release digital only was made by Remedy (and not Epic), I don't believe the resale of physical copies was really a major factor for them. I think they would have just thought that doing a physical release was likely to cost more than they would gain from it, cutting into their profits.

Based on their experience of Alan Wake Remastered and Control, they likely didn't expect to sell many physical copies anyway (which would have been the very issue, as making and distributing physical copies carries a certain additional price anyway even if sales are small).
When it’s physical, yes I agree.
Control was an overrated mediocre game that received praise so people are probably hesitant.
    Mediocre and overrated? Definitely a minority opinion.
        Bland characters, repetitive enemies and environment and an awful final boss. The main story is also not great. The world building? Sure. The music segment? Fantastic. Nearly everything else? Bland.
It’s worth it for the visuals and style alone. I really wish we could get a ‘walking tour’ mode with no enemies so I can simply take in all the amazing details without getting pestered by respawning enemies (my only real gripe with the game)
    It cracks me up (sadly), that I battle evil souls with a flashlight and the most outrageous thing is that Saga's power bill is only 48 bucks.
I would've bought AW2 had it got a physical release, but I won't support publishers who do digital only releases.
[deleted]
They should release a physical copy then. Will never support fully digital games.
Remedy deserves everything they receive; poor sales included.  After how they treated their fans with the next gen upgrade for Control, they can F right off.  I hope they eat this game.
    You know that’s most likely the publisher making a call like that, right?
        Yes, and they chose their publisher.  Not the other way around.  I doubt they had a problem with it either because it netted them more money anyway.
Fuck off I'm not renting a digital licence.
    This.... this.... this....
Tell me when it’s physical then I’ll buy it, fucking predators.
Absolutely, I picked up the expansion pass a few hours into the game as well! Then again I love anything remedy put out
Anyone on PS5 it is now $47.99 for the holiday sale
It would probably do WAY BETTER if Remedy hadn't done the dumb decision to skip a physical release. Then again, Remedy games have never sold gangbusters (except for Max Payne, which sold very well for its time and is a legendary franchise). Still, Alan Wake 2 has a lot of hype and positive word-of-mouth right now, so more people will check it out for sure. Remedy should SERIOUSLY reconsider releasing it physically though. The recent Insomniac hack revealed that physical purchases still make up THE MAJORITY of sales, so that definitely ends the narrative that most people have switched to digital on consoles (for now).

I just hope that the Alan Wake franchise can turn things around, similar to the Nier franchise. That franchise also suffered bad sales initially with the first game, but word-of-mouth and the sequel (Automata) boosted its popularity immensely. Same with the Soulsborne games (FromSoftware are now a household name). Crossing my fingers for Remedy.
    Remedy's experience with Control was that the great majority of sales were digital. In 2020, which was the best year for the sales of the game, physical copies made up only 10% of the sales. From their subjective POV, not having a physical copy is not a major loss.

In any case, we should not worry about the sales of AW2. By the best available information the game has already sold well over a million copies and will make a profit by 2024. It will also have a long tail like Control did.
Anyone who didn't buy this because of digital only is doing themself an absolute disservice, couldn't convince me otherwise.
Will consider buying it if they ever release a physical version, otherwise I'm good, there's plenty of games out there which didn't decide to make aggressively anti consumer decisions.
I'd buy it on steam or a physical copy. Due to Tim Sweeney we will get neither though.
I cant purchase digital media from companies that don't give a fuck about taking it back whenever they want.

 Till it gets a physical release, I'm sure it's a blast.
    But is not a physical release just the same? It gives you a key to download the game from a server. Once the game is removed from the server, your key won't do anything right?
And if there happens to be a CD In there I don't think a game that's 80GB+ would be fitting on the cd/DVD/blueray anyway
        youre half (probably less) correct. Physical games arent codes, they are discs. If you buy a "physical code", you bought a digital game. A PS5 disc can hold 100GB, some games come in 2 discs. The issue would be a lot of games have been added incomplete to the disc, and they need huge patches to be downloaded. You'd still have a game, just not perfectly functional.
it’s a quality game but super repetitive combat with boring enemies. fun first playthrough but hardly any replayability. game is not the 2nd coming of christ like you make it out to be.
No we won't invest on digital only games.
I really want to buy this game and support Remedy, but I paid $100 extra for my console for a reason. I'm a collector, and I like physical, tangible media. If they release a physical version, I'll buy it day one.
That means it will even more worth it when it goes physical and on sale!
Not for me, I only buy physical. 

I'm now content with the fact that I'll never play it. Shame, but oh well.
I didn’t like the first one. Can I still enjoy AWII?
    Who knows. Depends on what you didn't like. If you didn't like the story and the overall atmosphere then you are likely to not enjoy the second one. If you only disliked the combat in the first one then there is still much more to enjoy here.
    Absolutely. It plays almost nothing like the first.
    I didn't like Alan Wake 1 at all. Hated the story, characters, setting, style, repetitive shooting...

But I loved Control and thought AW2 sounded promising. I'm so glad I bought AW2 because I love it!

If you like the Silent Hill games, or Evil Within, then I think you'd like the scavenging/survival horror gameplay of AW2.
I played the original many years ago and don’t remember the story at all, I also never finished Control so don’t have all the lore, is it worth me trying AW2?
    Absolutely. Watch a recap by Sam Lake on YouTube. But you don't even have to do that, the game explains what you need to know.
    Watch a story recap to refresh your mind and you should be good.
Very cool, I'll wait for sale just like I did for every game, though.
Ugh it makes me so mad that its only on Epic. I make money via steam sales and it kills me that this is the only game I cant afford.
I just wish it was technically a bit more polished. The framerate feels very uneven in quality mode. I don’t mind 30 fps at all but the stutters and slowdowns made is unpleasant to play for me. Performance mode looks so blurry in comparison.
I would say it’s not worth 70.  40 is about right
I’m just waiting for a sale. It’s a digital only game. If it was physical I would have bought it day one. Also I’m trying to clear up some backlog as well hence waiting for the sale.
It deserves all the praise and success there is. No doubt GOTY for me!
I was looking forward to Alan Wake 2 after enjoying the original and a even more recent playthrough of the "remastered" edition. 

I love the narrative, the crossover with Control and it looks lovely BUT that is where it ends really 

The mechanics have not really advanced in ten years, it's still very clunky to play 

The size of the game is very limited as is the travel through the game though they have tried to disguise this. 

The mind place is nice but really used more to advance the narrative and in someways restricts the flow of the game 

Like Control I found the game overlong, I know this might be a weird thing to say these days. 

Remedy's best game is still Quantum Break as it did everything right they haven't managed to match it since 

I would argue Supermassive games have offered better horror/supernatural narratives in the past few years too, they really excel in this genre while blurring the lines between film and game better 

Alan Wake 2 worth a playthrough at least
I got it for free with my GPU. Then after I finished I went and bought it on PlayStation for the full $80 deluxe edition, out of respect.
Best looking game on the market right now, imo.  Avater being a close 2nd.  Boy, im excited for whats coming next, this generation is finally heating up
I believe a reason the game isnt doing well is because its digital only. The casuals dont really get any exposure to the game out in public. As moms are buying games for little timmy off walmart shelves, the game isnt available to obtain a possible buyer. And on the flipside it hasnt had months of praise and word of mouth like baulder's gate 3.
Are there jump scares?  I'll play it if there aren't any jump scares.
Yeah I would have paid $70, such a good game. The only game I replayed right away.
So…I loved Control (finished it multiple times) but really did not like Alan Wake 1, it just felt super dated when I played the remaster. 

Is Alan Wake 2 more of the same or some more along the lines of Control?
What’s good about it? I’m not a horror guy but what’s the buzz about
Risk taking? It’s not a new IP, it’s simple a sequel. 

Real risk is making something new. Alan Wake TWO, isn’t NEW.

Just like TLOU, combat is repetitive and boring after your 5th encounter.
They should probably put out physical copies. They'd make an abundance more money that way. Digital only put a cap on them.
They would sell a lot more copies if they released a physical disk and not just a digital version.
All those "physical" comments are weird to me. Wasn't aware people liked that format that much anymore. Personally the disk reader on my PS5 was never used yet.
I was really looking forward to this game but it’s just not worth it due to being a digital only release. Not having the ability to trade in a game if i don’t like it, or once it’s completed is completely and uttery unattractive to me.
No physical release = no sale.
Jesus, it’s amazing how many people are still clinging to disk.
Absolutely agreed.
Absolutely phenomenal game. I just rolled credits a few days ago, and I can't wait to see what comes next in the series. 

I will say that it's disappointing to see post after post in this thread just saying 'I really want to play this, but I'm going to wait for a deep sale / etc', and while I get that money is tight these days, this is the type of game people should be supporting, because while it's a sequel, it's also very creative and original, and without people supporting it, the game industry is just going to continue to water itself down into the formulaic drivel and games-as-a-service we've been seeing.
    Agreed. Maybe people should consider the fact that by now half of every dollar/euro/etc they pay for this game will go towards making Control 2, or the next Alan Wake game. Or something else dreamed up by Sam Lake and his merry crew. The gaming public will be better off for every game Remedy gets to make.

(The other half will go to Epic, of course, but I guess they'll need to get their due for paying Remedy to make this game when nobody else would for many years...)
        I’m not holding up multimillion dollar corporations with my money they simply need to do better, the way yall just tell people “they don’t have to buy it” when they have problems with something.
worth full price ? 

%100 AGREE

worth full price DIGITAL ?

get the F outa here....in a few weeks will be %30 to %50 off, never pay full price for digital is how i live, only suckas do that.

they want my money ? by all means, this and BG3 ain't getting a cent out of me until i see a brand new shiny disc .
Many people here voicing their displeasure of a digital only release. The superfans are butthurt and downvote them, disregarding their true honest opinion. 

Downvoting people isn't going to boost your sales numbers. It flopped, and would have greatly benefitted a physical release to increase sale numbers.
As soon as they make a physical disc, Im in.
It absolutely is not.
A masterpiece. Everyone not buying this game is missing one of the best gaming experiences this year plus THE "gaming moment" of 2023.

Oh, and buy Dead Island 2 too - because it's extremely fun to play.
I agree with the sentiment to vote with your wallet and now I prefer digital games because I hate swapping discs. Ideologically I always wanted to own the physical medium, but now I lean towards comfort.

If you don’t buy it because there is no physical release, you are missing out on a stellar game.
    But people aren’t missing out. The game will still be great when it’s priced at $15.
It's their own fucking fault if it didn't do too well financially as you say.

They restricted it to EPIC store only, dumb clowns, EPIC is shit.

Get it on STEAM and some money will come in.
\>If we don't invest on risk taking titles

&#x200B;

What risk was taken with this title? It's Alan Wake 2, same boring combat just drastically reduced to combat fatigue and boredom which the first one suffered from and dragged out puzzle sections, pompous writing at best, I loved Alan Wake even for its flaws but the sequel blows, Alan Wake's portion blows even harder than Saga's, you can tell they put so much more effort into her side of the story, not to mention they turned Alan Wake into a crappy "Control universe" game for some reason.

&#x200B;

Hurr durr, gotta connect our games in some stupid way, "wow this charatcer from this game is here and now this connection can be made? Oh my lord", it's such a tired, boring and predictable concept. Alan Wake didn't need any of that to stand on it's own two legs.

&#x200B;

There are so many poor decisions made with this game that I despise and you're gonna sit here and pretend that this is some revolutionary game we have to support?..

&#x200B;

I get that I'm awfully critical and I'm going to get a bunch of upset people coming after me but I just don't see how Alan Wake 2 is worthy of a "please blindly support product" tag, I really liked the first game for it's cheesy nature but the second one fails at everything I was looking forward to in an Alan Wake sequel.
It's boring asf
Would do a lot better on a disc version, you know so all of us people that bought disc playstations could use a disc and not have to download 80GB plus over slow data capped connections
Well, it might've been had they opted for a physical release.
Not when it’s digital only. If I’m paying a full fat $60 or more, I want a complete disc copy of it.
I’ll wait till it’s twenty bucks. They decided against physical, i decided against buying at a price that digital isn’t worth outside of on GOG
Remedy deserve absolutely 0 support until they release a physical version.
I want to play it but theres still no physical release, waiting on that, or if they will at least release it on steam :/
It's also not a bad idea to finish or at least get familiar with Control. Without some knowledge from Control, a couple of plot points in AW2 could maybe feel a bit random and it just helps to put the world together a bit more.
    This sounds like some of the reason the sales aren’t great. People think they need to put 40 hours into previous games just to get up to speed on things
        The only game you really should play before AW2 is the first game. The rest is just for context filling and to catch the more subtle references. And even then, there is an official recap to put you up to speed.

I can see thought that it could affect sales. Especially the fact that the first Alan Wake was not really immensely popular when it came out (despite being highly anticipated) and the remaster didn't sell too well either, so some people could see that as a sequel to a game that they were not really interested in in the first place. 

What also definitely affects sales is the lack of a physical version. After looking at some of the data from the Insomniac leak, it's impressive how well physical games still sell.
            I tell people to go watch a twenty minute you tube video explaining AW1, and control/AW tie in. An hour of homework and you can be balls deep in AW2 when you play it.
                Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
                    Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.
                    >Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.

Thanks:)
                    Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
            Ok but AW1 is really, really hard to play. I wanted to like it but I just couldn’t bear running round in identical forests for that many hours
                Seriously
            I can definitely confirm that the game is highly appealing to me but that I put it off my list for not getting a physical release.
At a time where the question of media conservation is more discussed than ever, I find it a really crazy move.

There is no way I'm spending 50$ on a game that is not mine, I'll either spend 60$ on a physical copy, or get it on sale for 15$ in a year or two.

That's just sad cause I'm sure they deserved more sales, but hell I'm already pissed when an indie is digital only, but an AAA ? 

Same goes for Baldurs gate tbh, Larian did release both Divinity games on physical, but not for their record-breaking GOTY ?

That's not the industry I want, and I'm not paying for that. Nobody should tbh, I know Remedy doesn't have infinite budget but we have to realize digital games are a scam, you do not own anything, you just rent it for an unlimited time.
I feel like paying 80$ for a game is more debated than paying 60$ for a rent that looks like a purchase, and I don't understand it :)
                Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
        I mean I own but haven’t finished Alan wake 1, American Nightmare, and Control, so I’m def not buying Alan Wake 2 yet lol
        It's the Blade Runner 2049 effect.

That movie bombed because it was a sequel to a 30 year old movie that a mass audience has no idea exists.

Alan Wake is the same situation. And on top of all that, it's a horror game, so most mass audience members write it off almost instantly. 

It's a game designed for a very small subset of customers and making money seems to come second to the passion of just getting it made and played by people who love it.
        Yea I’m not playing control, which I didn’t even know were related just to play Alan wake 2. To be fair I also didn’t play the first one, and don’t want to. Don’t have that kind of time.
        Or you could just watch a recap video on YouTube for 20min.
        Yeah I started playing AW2 this week and it is pretty confusing. I played the first game years ago and don’t remember how it ended. I didn’t really care for Control so I never beat it.

Also, you need to know some Max Payne lore. He’s sort of a major character but has a different name. Remedy made the first Max Payne before selling it to Rockstar. One of the characters in this game has the same voice actor, face model, clothes, and personality/attitude as Max Payne.

I’m not very far into Alan Wake yet, but so far the story is very meta and is doing a sort of multiverse type of thing with Remedy’s games.
        I mean, it's called Alan Wake 2. I get that it's one of the big talking points of the day, and people don't want to feel left out, but it's also a sequel, and it's not asking that much in terms of prior investment. It's not like they're asking you to go pick up an Alan Wake novel or whatever
            But it's a sequel to an extremely story-focused game, which is different than someone picking up the next Call of Duty or whatever. Feeling like you need to play a 15-year-old game to understand the new one is absolutely a barrier for a lot of people, fair or not.
            Plenty of sequels are pretty easy to pick up and play with no context, and this is exactly the reason. Asking people to go play a damn near 15 year old game to get up to speed is just not gonna workout financially. Red Dead 2 was also a sequel to an older game, but there was no real need to go play the first one.
        Better to be a patient gamer and just play the first game as intended
    Is it necessary to play the Control expansions?
        The AWE expansion pretty much explains the events from Alan Wake 1 and puts it all into a different perspective. It also serves as a great narrative lead-up to Alan Wake 2.

It's not necessary, but I can definitely recommend it. The AWE expansion is also great in its own regard, especially if you enjoyed the base game.
            I didn’t really like Control, enjoying AW1 so far though! Thanks :)
                I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
                    U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
                        Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
                        I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
                    Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
                    I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
                    I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
                    Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
                        I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
                        Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
                            I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
                        I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
                    You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
                    You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
        Necessary, no, recommended, yes.

The AWE expansion of *Control* is very much a part of the *Alan Wake II* story, but you don't have to have played it to understand the story by any means, but I would recommend it.
            Is control part of the alan universe??
                Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
        Both expansions are good and I’d recommend them. The Foundation answers a lot of questions (although raises some others). And the AWE just sets up Alan Wake 2 (but doesn’t add a ton of lore)
        I would actually say the entire main game of Control is unimportant to the Wake-iverse. (if you only care about AW. 95% of the main game is not AW related) but you have to play it in order to get to the AWE DLC, so basically run through it so you get to the good stuff.

Had a buddy who didn't have the best time with Control, but really wanted to be in on the "Wake-iverse". I told him if you really wanna feel like you're in the loop, the Control DLC is fundamental.   

After he gave it another try and played the Control DLC he admits its atleast worth the run thru, because it puts into perspective just how powerful Alan is. He overall found a better time in general the 2nd try, and actually wants to play Control 2, whenever that comes out.
        Nah. One is a neat little tie in to Alan Wake and a good teaser for II, but it’s not strictly necessary.
        I didn’t love Control.

Alan Wake 2 was amazing tho.
    I disagree. I played Alan Wake 1 years ago and loved it. Played the remaster as well. Tried Control and hated it. Stopped playing it after a couple hours. Played Alan Wake 2 this year and it is my GOTY. And I had no issue following the story.
        You just answered my question about whether I needed to like Control, which didn’t stick for me. Now I’m interested in AW2.
I am currently trying to get through the remaster myself and man…I want to quit so bad lol. you’re right, the world itself is interesting but the gameplay is very very dated.
The gameplay of the first one is janky bullshit but the story is cool.

AWII is 1000% better.
    I actually think AW1 combat is much cleaner and straightforward plus it has no bs boss fights
        With Alan Wake as my GOTY I understand what you mean. 1 had straight forward shine light and shoot. It was simple and every enemy worked the same way. 

In 2 you have enemies that disappear with just light (making you waste bullets), enemies that die without shining a light and enemies that seem to take way more light and bullets but for no real reason.

I don’t think it’s necessarily worse but it’s very different. In 1 it helps combat fear because you know what to do in every situation.

In 2, I find combat to be far more chaotic
            I personally liked the enemies that just disappear brought a lot of tension, but generally agree the combat in general is a bit more chaotic. I think it's to do with the closer camera, especially in the forest where it can get disorientating. It was a bit goofy, but having the camera zoom in on new enemies spawning in in AW1 I started to miss haha.
        I agree AW2 combat was it's weakest part, well that and the plotboard sections, I loved it at first as it was very novel but my god I don't know how Saga takes a shit without first looking through 3 files and 15 photos and then profiling the turd.
        Boss fights are a staple of video games and the first one definitely had them. Or did you forget about the possessed Construction vehicles?
            I haven't played 2, so can't compare, but 1 had what, 2 "bossfights"? namely, >!the bulldozer and the tornado.!<
            I do remember them. They weren’t good but nowhere near the level frustration AW2 bosses have caused me
        lol. No.
100% agree, the combat is awful but i keep hearing about how good the story/atmosphere is
It’s a beautiful and fun game but the story is meandering and self-indulgent. And I agree, the Taken are a bit repetitive and combat is limited. Worth a play, not a replay IMO
You nailed Remedy in a nutshell. Gameplay has never felt satisfying to me, it always feels like a struggle against the enemy AI, too tight of a camera and clunky movement. But the visuals, setting and story are usually terrific.
    Why are people so eager to heap such praise upon a studio that consistently, spectacularly fails at the single most important aspect of making a videogame? Do you really care about story and visuals so much more that you’re willing to completely overlook shallow, repetitive, boring gameplay? Why not just watch movies or TV at that point? Or are standards for gameplay so low that the bare minimum will pass as top shelf quality as long as it’s dressed up in a “cinematic” coat of paint?
        Fair criticism. You can make a similar argument for Resident Evil games. 

Playing Bungie games since I was a teen has spoiled me on smooth gameplay, so I guess I try not to be too critical on gameplay some cases as I’ve enjoyed multiple Remedy games in spite of the gameplay.
Play control aswell, your experience will be heightened
Not being physical is 100% hurting their sales. I don’t understand why they went that route. Like why would you purposefully not have your game on shelves so that someone can impulse buy because the cover looked cool?
    They say it's due to more costs and also it might have meant delaying the game because the disc version has to be ready earlier. I don't know if it is true or they just made up something to provide an excuse. But a disc version would have been cool
        Saying it's due to costs is ridiculous. It's published by Epic Games. I will not buy it at full price because of this. You don't own digital games and they had no real reason to not do a physical.
            100%. They are talking shite. They thought that people buying disc and reselling would hurt their bottom line so they went digital only.  At this point I put my money back in my wallet out of principal… 👍🏻
                Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
            Supposedly Epic does not have a physical game infrastructure in place, so I could see Epic not letting them do a disc version
    I'm not getting it specifically because of the lack of physical copies. The only games I get digitally are very cheap/smaller games like a Telltale game or something like that.
    [deleted]
        Lol nobody is using it "as an experiment"

It's almost definitely just a numbers thing. Somebody behind the scenes saw this was a niche title and thought that the physical sales wouldn't make up the price of printing physical copies. Were they right? Who knows! But I guarantee you nobody in this thread knows.
        Yea I really want the game but I want to actually own the disc. I have a huge backlog now so I don’t mind waiting until a potential disc version comes out.
    Yep, think how many ‘casual gamers’ who don’t keep up with reddit or GOTY news will never know that AW2 even exists.

Having space on store shelves is free advertising that is directly aimed at potential buyers.
        What makes you think casual gamers are more likely to buy physical?
            Yea casual gamers are more likely to scroll the digital stores than randomly browse a game store.
            Because they are? John Gamer is much more likely to come across the game if it's on target shelves or whatever. Lot less visual competition and a lot more likely to just happen to be at a store with it. 

 The only way someone is coming across Alan Wake 2 casually is if they happen to be browsing the store and see among the thousands of games already there. It's already pretty buried
    I disagree. Digital only is the future and studios like Remedy will benefit from it. The “impulse buy from the shelf” is a minuscule demographic that is dwarfed by “buy 2nd hand.” Having new players buy it from them and not eBay/resellers means they will get more sales as time goes on & have control over the price.

It’s also a huge waste of time and resources getting a game ready on disc too. This takes man hours to create and test & loss of margin to manufacturing, distribution, retailers, etc.

Edit: And I’m getting downvoted spammed by people who just don’t like reality. Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway. It’s an inefficient physical license. Every other industry has moved on from discs & the downvote spam comes from an entitled shrinking demographic who wants more ewaste so they can nickel and dime on games. No matter how much you whine on the internet, the days of discs are numbered. For those who want something to collect… there’s collectables.
        Fair point about the second hand market.
        >Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway.

What's up with this?Most of the games that I bought on my PS5 (disc versions) are playable from the start.  


I do understand that most games come with day 1 patches, hotfixes, etc. But that does not mean the game is not in the disk and you will have to download something in order to play. 

I can think just of  a few examples where you NEED to download something beforehand. IIRC it was a Call of Duty and Fallen Survivor(?), but that's it.  Why are you making this overgeneralization anyway?
Idk resident evil seems to sell really well
    It's basically just Resident Evil that sells for horror games. Silent Hill as a franchise has sold less than 10 mil.
It doesn't help that the first game is niche and the second game is EGS exclusive on PC. That has to be hurting them massively.
    Not to mention it’s a GOTY but there’s no copy that people can put under the tree as a present. What an idiotic plan.
    I mean epic is publishing it, its not like cs and dota is coming on epic.
        They could have had another company publish it. They chose to go with Epic and can't be surprised that they're not getting tons of PC sales due to it.
            Well companies are not lining up to publish a sequel to alan wake which was financially a flop, remedy was lucky to even have epic publishing it for them. Why do you think 505 didn’t publish this while the did for control? They knew alan wake 2 wouldn’t sell well, while control which is an action game to its core will sell more.
            Theyve tried to make the game for 8 years with different publishers and Epic was the only company that would let them (a) make it and (b) make it the way remedy wanted to make it
            > They could have had another company publish it

You don't know how video game publishing and development works.
Ya I'm not a horror fan at all, the jump scare aspect of the game is really holding me back from buying it. But the world and story looking so cool, I really want to try it.
    Yeah, when you play it with headphones the random jumpscares are really anxiety inducing but other than that it’s a fantastic game
        No kidding, they really were something else. Something about the overall atmosphere of the game elevated those scares to a whole 'nother level, I don't normally get scared in any horror games like Amnesia or Resident Evil or Outlast or whatever there is, but something about AW2 was just different.
            I guess what makes it a true horror game is that it feels like there are barely any NPC’s there to interact with and it’s quiet all the time with almost no background music! It feels like one of those eerie dreams where you wander alone somewhere
        The jump scares are bs tbh! Just walking along then out of nowhere an image pops up with a scream. The cheapest way to get a jump ever! That said I am enjoying the game so far, but I've never been a fan of cheap jump scares. The atmosphere alone is spooky enough.
            I’m hoping they add an accessibility option to turn off those jump scares 😅
Yup the most “horror” I can take is TLOU. Definitely can’t play anything more scarier than that.
The no physical copy thing is nuts. After the game awards, I went to GameStop to try and grab a copy and the employee told me the game didn't exist and that I was thinking of Alan Wake Remastered
I was about to say, I want to play it but I don't buy digital for consoles. There is exactly one digital media distributor I trust right now.
I hope so im just finishing up the control dlc hahah
    I just played through AW1 last week and am halfway through Control now. Can't wait for AW2
I know this is the PS5 subreddit, but if you can run it on PC, I was able to grab it from the Epic Games store for $26 due to their holiday sale plus coupon.
How do you know?
    The deal has been up for 8 hours in my timezone
    $47.99 on PSN right now
        Amazing, I saw it on sale on Xbox yesterday and had my fingers crossed for it to come to PS too. Got the deluxe edition 👍👍👍
If you happen to have a PC capable of playing it, it's $28 on Epic Games until January 10th.
I have been waiting for AW2 since I finished AW1 almost 13 years ago. But my entire collection of PC games is pretty much on Steam. I played around with EGS when I tried Fortnite out and I just didn't like it. It's like Steam with a bunch of features removed. So I will patiently wait until Steam gets it or buy it on a console if that doesn't seem likely. But I want to see some high quality path tracing so holding out for Steam for a year or so.
i will as soon as I see a physical release.
    Same. It's literally the only reason I haven't purchased it yet, I've been hyped for it for years but I just will not buy a digital product at full price. So it's just a waiting game, either it gets a physical release or hits like 50% off first.

Hell, I'd probably buy a Collector's Edition of a physical release just because of how much I loved the CE of the original game, it was so good.
        I was holding out for a physical version but it was on sale on Epic + Epic was giving out coupons for the holidays so I got it for $26, couldn't pass that up
            Oh damn, is that still going on? That's not bad.
    Bad for the environment, just get the digital version
        So is driving but I'm sure you do that.
How can people pick up something that has no physical form?
    I mean...people are playing it.
    [deleted]
        Same here. I’m sure AW2 is great but I can happily wait for a mega sale or a disc. 

Judging by the game’s awful sales figures it seems most people feel the same.
        You love them?
    deep.
Can't "pick up" a game that isn't physically there.
It literally is a major factor. Having a disc on shelves is like a billboard aimed directly at your target audience.
    Still surprisedthey went that route
did you play Alan Wake 1 and its dlcs? 

I played through them right before starting AW2 and it made a big difference imo, its a game you kind of have to be patient with and know that you wont understand everything unt its over
    Sometimes not even then! I feel like coming here to talk theories is almost as much fun as playing the game.
    is the gameplay in Alan Wake 2 significantly better? 

Just finished the main story in 1 but I had a hard time completing it cause the gameplay was painful as hell. Felt like a duty to finish it.
        It’s better, but it’s still not amazing. That was actually a minor point of frustration that I had, was that some enemies can move really fast but you can’t keep up. So there were a few times where I felt like I got bullshit deaths because enemies were basically just able to be cheap and kill me
I had the same experience. Played through the first game and control, but this one just really didnt do it for me. Stoked its getting recognition though, it's a good team
    Yeah I love Remedy getting recognition, and the fact that the game exists at all is pretty amazing. And I didn’t hate it, there was a lot about the game that worked for me. I am glad that I played it, but I just don’t think I necessarily loved it and I’m not sure how willing I’d be to recommend it to someone else
Yeah, I get it. The game was definitely...wierd. I really respect the fact that you gave it a chance.
If they won't ever release the physical copy, I'll just wait a couple of years until it's like $10 digitally.
    This is my plan.

I'll buy digital here and there, but if it's something I'm buying full price at release it's gotta be physical. If I can't, I don't mind waiting for a while.
    That was a huge problem when buying digital releases on console, it took years for some games to get a sale and when it did go on sale it wasn't for much. Epic store on PC has a huge discount, ended up getting it for $23. Sale goes on through Jan 10th. With the increase in PS plus sub I just had to step away from console altogether, I'd say it'd be worth it if they brought more quality games every month.
Same for me.
    It seems many people feel the same judging by the recent IGN article that pointed out the game’s woeful sales. It was something like the 150th best selling game on PS and Xbox that month lol.
        Doubt. It was the 7th-most downloaded game on PS5 in Europe last month, and 12th in the US. Wherever that leaves it in overall sales, it certainly isn't anywhere outside the top 50.

Also EGS exclusive on PC.
Interesting. You only buy physical copies of games?
    If the PS5 had been digital-only I would have passed on the entire console.
        I got the disc version but I can’t recall buying a disc in over a year now. I like using my PS5 as a blu ray player but I could care less about having physical games anymore. I do always like having the option but I think digital is more convenient. It’s unlikely I’ll come back to this system 10yrs from now.

Personally, I think you should always have the option so I think making the game digital only was a bad call.
    Why is it interesting?
        [deleted]
            I won’t pay “60-70 dollar” larger studio experiences as digital only. I want a physical product, seems plenty enough agree. Each to their own, but I’d rather support physical formats.
        Because it’s abnormal. You’re missing out on an amazing game because of the format it’s being offered in. Why do you only purchase physical copies?
            Because I don’t own the content, only a digital licence. As I said above, not for 60-70 dollar games. I prefer to own a physical copy.
            Another reason to buy physical copies over Digital is being able to resell the game after I'm done, well at least for me. For example, I only play the main story for most of the games I purchase since I only have maybe 1 hour to play at nights after the kids have gone to bed. Most games I put in about 20 hours total into them and then get to resell them for $35-40. So being able to play that for half or even less of the full retail is amazing.
                That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
Spider-Man 2 is just about the most perfectly engineered game I've played in a very long time. I loved every minute of it, but at the same time it felt _extremely_ safe the whole way through. It doesn't push the boundaries of games as a medium at all. It just does all the typical stuff extremely well. I get it, when you make a huge financial investment in a game like that, you _need_ it to pay off. But it really sucks how that line of thinking stifles creativity, and I'm thrilled that we have studios like Remedy out there to do the things that major publishers and studios tend to avoid out of fear.
I fully agree. The majority of this thread seems to be people posting about wanting to buy the game, but not actually buying it, and it's this lack of support for anything out of the mainstream that's the reason we see the same formulaic games year after year.
There will almost definitely be a physical GOTY addition.
    i’ll just wait for that
I’m still hoping that limitedrun or iam8bit will release a physical copy of the game at some point!
I agree with this. I often buy a game at full price if it’s physical because I can resell it after I complete it. 

A digital only title is going to have to wait till it’s in the sale before I buy it, especially if it comes out at £50

Now it’s down to £39.99 in the sale I’ll be buying it.
90% of Control's sales were digital according to Remedy. 

Don't think they're missing out on too many sales because they went digital only. Which, you know, is why they went digital only.
    > 90% of Control's sales were digital according to Remedy.

Either the game sold way way more on PC on console or it's been very discounted, because that's weird. 

[The recent leaks showed how much physical games still sell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18magu9/sales_numbers_for_a_ton_of_sony_games_including/) For the vast majority of Sony AAA games (the ones getting a physical release), they don't even get to 50% digital sales.
        I saw that. I think it's just a case by case basis thing.


Sony first party games are not necessarily representative of the entire industry. They tend to be sold in bundles prominently, for one thing.
    Then there should be no complaints from them about reduced sales or the game not doing well financially! More power to ‘em if some sales instead of all possible sales is good enough for them.
        The cost to produce physical copies of the game would not have netted a profit from those who’d buy it physically but refuse it digitally.
            Quite so. A physical release has its costs as well. All those copies need to be made and distributed. In this case we don't know for sure if it was up to Epic or Remedy that there was no physical release at launch. But Remedy's recent real experiences with physical copies are not great. AW Remastered sold less than they hoped for, and I understand there was a lot of physical copies left unsold (which means that they represented straight-up loss). And then with Control, the great majority of the sales was digital.

Based on those experiences, Remedy may well have looked at what a physical release would cost, by Epic's estimate, in addition to a digital release, and predict that it would not likely make them profit with the expected sales numbers.

Some might argue that with the current balance between the numbers of digital and physical copies sold in gaming, we are approaching an era where physical copies do not represent a money-making part of the business, but merely a courtesy to collectors and (the small minority of) players who prefer physical. Whether it makes a profit may be a toss-up, and some companies may practically only do it for marketing/visibility and image reasons.
                Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
            I’d love to see the numbers supporting that!
                This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
                I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
                    Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
                    I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
                    Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
        nobody is complaining though.
            That you’ve seen. I’ve seen a lot of it. People complaining that not enough people bought it or gave it a chance when there’s a line of people waiting to support it physically. Hopefully no complaints to come from Remedy though, they’ve made their bed.
                So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
                Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
                    You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
                You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
                    Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
                I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
                If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.
        There haven’t been any complaints from them whatsoever. They are enjoying the success of their game and are actively supporting/updating it to make it an even more polished experience. Also, it might not be selling well compared to top-selling AAA games but it is doing great compared to other Remedy titles.
It was the publisher’s/Epic’s decision, not Remedy’s.
    Nope, Remedy decided to partner with Epic knowing they wouldn’t support physical release.
        And without epics funding the game wouldn’t have been made at all, so either way there’s no physical release.
        See my other comment replying to you. I don’t think you’re acknowledging the reality of game development. It would be great if we lived in a world where risky, costly games like AW2 can get the funding for physical releases. But that’s not the world we live in. And I don’t think it’s fair to hold that against the developer who made an incredible experience that flies in the face of what is “safe” and “profitable” in today’s gaming market. We need to support these types of games so that hopefully in the future they will be able to justify physical releases.
            I mean, they could partner with someone like Limited Run Games, who knows how to make profitable physical runs of potentially risky titles.
            Physical release would be a very tiny part of the budget of the games though. It doesn't cost as much as you imagine. Plenty of smaller games get a physical release too. 

Epic is publishing this, it's one of the biggest gaming companies there is, it's not a budget problem.
            I simply disagree with you. If games like Senua’s Sacrifice, Outlast, Life is Strange, and other similar titles can get physical releases, there’s no excuse for a huge production like Alan Wake. It doesn’t fly in the face of what is profitable, as the entire reason for digital only release is to increase profits at the expense of the consumer. If you’re fine with that, by all means rent all of your games for $60, $70+. To each their own!
                The games you listed are anywhere from 6 years to over a decade old. They reflect a completely different market and landscape for game development that is no longer relevant, especially post-pandemic. 

I’m not saying that the current state of things is better - in fact I would say it’s worse, and I agree that anti-consumer profit motives drive most decisions these days. But when a title like AW2 has the chance to shift the mainstream mindset about what types of games can succeed, and we choose to shun it due to capitalistic forces beyond Remedy’s control, we may be playing into those same forces’ hands and only exacerbating the problem.
        So, just to be clear here, you'd rather that Remedy didn't make the game they wanted and ended up making something that potentially isn't even half as good, as long as it got a physical release?
        Oh yeah, they should have picked one of those ten other companies offering to finance and publish the game.

Wait, there were none. Microsoft refused the game years ago and it's really not easy finding an investor for this kind of project.
        just wanna say no matter if you’re right or wrong, the way ur presenting ur side of the matter is just so obnoxious that im going to return a physical copy of any random game I own so I can replace it with a digital copy, just to spite you.

Alan Wake 2 is as amazing as it is because of Remedy partnering with Epic and therefore getting a budget in order to make such a masterpiece. Sucks that there’s no physical copy but the game is worth every single penny.
            I don’t mind at all if you want to return your owned games for long term rentals! To each their own. Enjoy.
                get a job
                    a job is how i afford a bunch of physical games lol
                        people are just salty that you didn't play a game they like, it's common here
    Same thing, the money you pay for the game also goes to Epic anyway (maybe completely even if Remedy was already paid and got no royalties, depends of their contract)

So the lesson can be for them.
Same. Fuck these types of decisions. They want to play it like that?  I'll easily play something else and vote with my money.
    So edgy. So brave.
Neither did BG3 on launch and that's done just fine.

It's nothing to do with a lack of physical media, more down to releasing the game during a stacked period of releases.

Edit: What's with the downvotes lol?
    It's cute how they thought moving it up a week from Spiderman 2 was gonna make a difference.
Sony removed it cuz Warner discovery is currently being run into the ground. Either way people need to realize it’s going to keep happening to digital, they’re licenses not products.
    There needs to be a law change, you buy a license you get to watch/play it. They remove it and you get a full refund.
You don’t look very deep into things do you? Probably just read headliners and go off of that.
It’s mad that they fell into the double trap of being an Epic PC exclusive and having no disc. No wonder it’s flopping sales-wise.
See you never 💀
Same. The lack of physical release really puts me off.
If they want my money they need to do a physical release
So, it's a narrative focused experience. I would definitely watch a recap at least. There's this whole crazy "object of power" thing. So.. it's like if Stephen King had a magical flashlight and had to confront evil with a Finnish metal band. I can't make that up.
    Sounds incredible. Will definitely start with AW1!
You can totally jump into 2, but I’d strongly recommend playing AW1 first. There are a ton of nods, references, and callbacks you’ll miss. Plus the stakes of the story, what the characters have gone through, and the whereabouts of other side characters are directly informed by the events of the first game. 

To get the most out of it you’ll at least want to have played/watched a playthrough of both AW1 and Control. If you want to add a little more flavor, the Bright Falls web series will give you a bit more of a look at the world you’ll be stepping into as well.
    Appreciate this - will start with AW1 and fully immerse myself. Excited to begin.
Alan Wake 2 is a DIRECT sequel. Going into it without watching a play through or full story recap will leave you very confused as to what’s going on. I’d play AW1 if you can but if you deem it too much then at least watch a story explanation.

Control is a game that is very important to the story too but not so much as AW1 - I recommend playing it or getting familiar with what it is atleast.
    Good to know - thanks very much! Will start with AW1.
I came to it with no experience of AW1 or any Remedy games but was impatient to play it, and I don’t regret it at all, it’s a fantastic game and I haven’t felt at any moment that I wish it hadn’t been my first experience in the AW world, so if you’re impatient don’t worry, it is still great!
Haha, right!? What a ride!
I didn’t enjoy getting killed so fast by the taken. Made some sections and boss fights really annoying
Lol no gameplay? There was plenty of gameplay. It was never meant to be a Resident Evil type of game. Way more narrative focused.
    Again, it was advertised as a survival horror game. I wouldn’t qualify it as such. If I had known it was so narrative heavy I wouldn’t have bought it.
You get a lot of answers, but the story does not conclude completely. But not really in a "left open" way. More in a "there will be a third installment" kinda way.
It is left open in such a way that it’s basically screaming “stay tuned for AW3/Control 2 to find out what’s next”. We’re still waiting on a few dlc expansions though so I’m sure we’ll get more clarification there.
It is left open, and completely non nonsensical. Calling it a "story" is stretching that word a bit far. It is more like a series of strange events. It is an interesting series of events. But it isn't really a story, it doesn't go anywhere and whatever it tries to say is so unclear that you can't make it out.
    It goes everywhere and it is explained very clearly in all the texts and cutscenes and dialogues and whatnot. But if you don't pay attention to any of those and just rush through the game playing like it's a shooter, then sure.
    That's not true at all. It's true that it isn't spelled out to you. It requires a lot of knowledge, reading, and analysis, but the entire story is there, everything makes sense, and the answers are there for you to find. Anything that's still unknown is made pretty clear to be a mystery to be answered later.
Shhhh you’re not allowed to mention that it didn’t get a physical release, people will get mad lol
    Despite the fact that like 60% of the comments in any *Alan Wake II* thread, including this one, are heavily upvoted criticising the lack of a physical release?
    What? That’s what literally 80% of the comments are in any thread even tangentially related to AW2.
    Really? 95% of the comments in this thread are people waiting for physical lmao, in 2023. Completely in vain.
    Rather than going mad, people are likely to point out that a physical release would likely not make for huge additional sales for a (niche) game like this. Maybe 10-20% more sales could be expected with a physical option. Remedy knows this from their recent experience with Control, so they are not taking a big risk with a purely digital release.
        It's not about how much extra money they'll make, it's about supporting physical media over digital, which has had plenty of examples of companies just removing access to digitally bought content. With no physical release one day you'll end up not being able to play a game you paid money for, so digital only is extremely anti-consumer.
            We should expect companies to work for preserving their games so that people who bought them can play them in the future. But it would be reductionist to say that physical discs are the only side to the matter. The issue is institutional readiness to have it as a priority to look after the interests of your customers, it is not merely a matter of format.

Companies like Remedy have a vested interest in preserving the games they have made so people can keep playing them in the future as well. Remedy has no interest to remove access to its digital content. It would go against its very business model.

To give an example: with AW1 Remedy had issues with licensed music expiring, which led to the game being removed from different storefronts in 2017, something the company really didn't want to happen. With AW2, they solved the above problem by not having licensed music at all, but owning the rights to all the music in the game, made for the game. All the music is DMCA free, as well. This way, there are no issues related to external IP rights with this game to cause it availability issues down the line.

Remedy's future success is based on the Remedy Connected Universe they are building with the Control and Alan Wake franchises connected to each other in many ways. They want to keep selling their games, and for them to have a long tail. For this, they need to be continually available for both old and new players.

Given that today you'll need to download a lot of content for games even if they are on a physical disc, too, I would not say that physical is a silver bullet for game preservation in any case. Many games today and especially tomorrow are so big in file size that you couldn't comfortable fit them into one or even two discs, anyway. Many companies that have a "physical release" will still need you to download much or most of the content. And then there are the updates. Alan Wake 2 alone has received over a dozen downloadable updates over less than two months. Remedy has been pretty responsive with those updates, too, fixing issues specifically pointed out to them by the players, and so on.

We all share the same concerns, we want game companies to be responsive and fair to their players, customers and fans. So, let's take a broad perspective into these issues.
                This was a good comment
                Really well said, I hope people take this into consideration.
Serious question. I'm  in a very fortunate situation where i have every current gen console. I also have a decent gaming laptop. So you know what my background with gaming is. My question is this. What's the big deal? Why won't you click on a different icon? I really truly don't understand. Is it a moral thing? Did epic do something untoward?
It will never come to Steam, it's published by Epic.

And why would you care about physical if you're waiting for Steam, lol.
Are you writing from the 1990s?
    Why is it so offensive that people want to own a physical copy of something they spend their hard earned money on?

        I didn’t say it was offensive, I was just commenting how hilariously outdated it was to think that digital only isn’t a real release.
        No one is offended, its just weird to think that a game that was released digitally isn't a real release.
Are you 40 or what
Buying at launch almost never makes sense it's all risk and the reward is only being able to play the game earlier. For some that might make sense for example you have a certain window of free time to burn. But more than likely buying at launch there will be bugs and balance changes and it will take multiple weeks to patch it. I'm seeing more games even from trustworthy studios adding content later because it was just not ready for launch (like new game plus modes). As we've seen here just waiting a few months you can already get games on discount especially if they launched the second half of the year where you get closer to black Friday and Christmas sales boost (games launching in August already getting discounts).
Except most fans are saying you dont need the first one to enjoy this one
    Except I'm talking about why the game is underselling. 90% of people buying games are not buying a game because of the box art anymore. They won't have played the first one and if they have, they would have bought this game on release. 
  
The fanbase is small, the hype was medium, but the game is good.
    Honestly, as a fan who's played both, I think you do. Yeah you  *can* skip it, but this is a narrative heavy game with some gameplay here and there. What's the point if you miss key references and stuff? While I love AW1 it's combat is atrocious and tiresome. I'd suggest watching an in depth YT video explainer instead.
This, for me buying single player, story driven game that you can't resell after finishing is a waste of money, so unless they won't include it in the Game Pass or PS+, I won't buy this game. Which is a shame, because I loved AW on my X360 and Control on XSX.
It’s an acquired taste and somehow both intellectual and not
How so?
    People just like to hate on things that are popular and getting worldwide acclaim. Nothing to see here.
    Too cerebral for him and not enough explosions, I'd guess.
I’ll extend that and say that to me, not many overall games are worth full price to me, and the ones that are have a physical version that I can buy and are games that I have faith in that I can enjoy, even though they may not be the most critically acclaimed at times.

(Although critical reception is important to me as money gets tighter over time).
Exactly this. I’d be happy to pay full price for a physical copy but absolutely refuse to support companies who want to phase out physical games and media.
    Wow, I didn't know that. So.. they simply refused to put out a disk version? Why would Remedy make that decision?
        >Why would Remedy make that decision?

They didn't. Epic Games did.
        Pure greed. They don’t care about consumers or game preservation at all, and that’s a problem that will only grow the more companies like theirs are supported, unfortunately.
            I find that so hard to believe though. The game just has so much heart. I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, it just doesn't track
                Unfortunately, they’ve admitted it’s to cut costs on their end (and increase their profits at consumer and game preservation’s expense, is how that translates). Some people will never care about physical media and will simply pay whatever the company charges for digital rentals, as that’s what “buying” digital is, and just accept if a company decides to cut off their access to the game entirely. It’s sad to say about a company that’s made a cool game, but it very much tracks.
                    How can they be increasing their profits when the game is cheaper than any other AAA game out there? It’s $59.99 as opposed to $69.99 on console and cheaper on PC too. 

If they wanted greed and profit why did they price it lower?
                        Probably because it’s a niche horror IP, wouldn’t sell at $69.99. No physical means they don’t have to pay the manufacturing costs.
            Idk why you're blaming Remedy when Epic Games is the one publishing the game and making that decision.
                Remedy agreed to the conditions of making and releasing their game under Epic Games, and there’s no shot they didn’t, at absolute bare minimum, know Epic Games wouldn’t release a physical copy. They’re absolutely at fault, along with Epic.
                    So would you rather they didn’t agree to those terms, and the game didn’t get made at all? Remedy is a niche developer that makes niche games that take risks - chances are no other publisher was willing to fund development of the game at all, let alone a physical release.
                        PS funded Returnal and Death Stranding, MS published Quantum Break. There are probably plenty of publishers who would’ve been willing to publish it.
                            Slightly different contexts to all of those games though, aren't there?

*Returnal* is made by a Sony first-party studio, so its going to get backing, and Sony tend to back their own studios. *Death Stranding* is made by probably one of, if not *the* most well-known game director on the planet - he's the very literal definition of "give the man what he wants", hence why he gets games made and even just partnered with Xbox for a new game.

Also, Microsoft published *Quantum Break* because, like Sony with *Returnal*, Remedy had a partnership agreement with them then. 

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
                            Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
                    Supremely idiotic take.
                        And you’re entitled to this nothing take lol
                            You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
                                You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
                        I agree. That person would prefer Remedy just shut down when AW2 doesn't sell a million units rather than they take help from epic.
        Yeah they have repeatedly said they don’t plan to release a physical edition. They said it was to help keep costs down. And they also claimed that having to have a download upon inserting the disc would hurt the experience…? But if you buy it digitally you also have to wait for a download.
            They are making excuses alan wake 1 remastered came out on disc for both xbox and playstation(both ps4 and ps5 discs),but they can't make physical copies of the sequel for some reason. They couldn't put the game on Steam becasue epic want an exclusive. Epic sabotaged the games sales hard there is no way they didn't realize this.
Haha so many people get so butthurt when you say that you won’t buy digital only games. But we will be the ones laughing when inevitably they cannot access those digital only games at some point down the line.
    They always do for some reason haha. We’ll still be able to play nearly every game we’ve ever bought in the future, and that’s vindication enough!
        I think you don’t realize that a lot of people don’t ever replay their games, especially not ones from previous generations. Once a new console comes out, the old one goes into some box in the garage and is never touched again. I have a box full of Xbox 360 games that haven’t been touched in a decade. I have no interest in playing such old games. For most casual gamers like me, there’s no difference between physical and digital. Digital might be better since physical games could be damaged and take up space.
            Can I have your stuff then? They'll have a great home in my collection.
        It’s so weird because this is something that hurts the entire gaming community. And yet everyone gets out their pitchforks to defend it. 

If this was an indie game I could understand the digital only release. But I think that sending AAA companies the message that we will essentially pay for long term rentals of their games is just mad.
    Not to start anything but if I had to guess, it's that you guys kind of come off really condescending when making statements like that. Like, I think the OP of this thread made a reasonable comment, but there's other people straight up insulting the game, the developer, and the people that bought it digitally just because there's no physical version.

And overall there's just far more nuance to the situation than people are really presenting here. It's a reasonably low budget avant-garde horror game, they probably need to cut what costs they can to make a profit. I'd be upset if this was Call of Duty doing this.
Maybe it’s just that good
    I’m sure it is very good, but from the limited amount I’ve seen the gameplay looks like Resident Evil survival horror. That’s not risk taking.
        Lol. I mean if you want to base your opinion about a game on some 5 minute gameplay video on youtube, sure. Your miss.
        From what I understand, the narrative is very cerebral and risk-taking.
Its another one of those "I'm 14 and this is deep" game that really has mediocre gameplay and story, but they make it seem like a revolutionary masterpiece. Its exactly the type of game journalist love though I give em that.
    Doesn't help that the fanbase's go-to-response whenever someone criticizes anything about the game is "lol skill issue".
He's stating a completely unfounded rumor, we have no data of how well it's selling since digital sales can't be tracked and Epic doesn't ever disclose game sales. They might release a statement giving some idea of how it's doing after the holidays.
Yeah, but what I am trying to say is that it should not be stolen. It is worth full price.
This.
Epic funded the game, ofc it's exclusive, no one else in the industry wanted to take the risk to fund this weird crazy idea for a game. Remedy asked Microsoft multiple times.
    There were other avenues they could've taken to secure funding that wouldn't have locked them out of physical release on console and steam release on pc. If scamware can raise millions on a kickstarter, so could they. But they destroyed their future profits for quick epic cash. Considering how many gamers didn't even know this game launched at all, they really hurt themselves here.
Thats what it is  the game was literally in goty awards with many nominations thats more marketing than most games can say they have if it still failed people just don't want the game. Doesn't help they didn't put it on steam imagine making a digital only release than only putting it on Epic Games of all things. They wanted the game to fail to than to play underdog its actually a masterpiece card like they are now.
Well said. Some of these posts on Xbox & PlayStation subs feel like a direct marketing attempt. I don’t know if OP is a real gamer or some sock account that got paid to market a game.
There's zero indication of how well or poorly it's doing, that's just baseless speculation.
    There’s indications, 850k in two months on consoles is not great.

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/alan-wake-2-lack-of-sales-update-suggests-it-didn’t-sell-too-well.1664654/
But I’ve been told that physical media is dead and no one buys physical games anymore /s
All companies operating in the market economy want to make a profit. That is how business works. 

What exactly is especially greedy about not releasing a physical copy?
    Tanking physical copies resales where they have no control over the price. Physical copies gets cheaper faster than digital. I also believe that no physical copies helps them keep the price higher on digital storefronts on consoles for longer periods.
        If the decision to make the release digital only was made by Remedy (and not Epic), I don't believe the resale of physical copies was really a major factor for them. I think they would have just thought that doing a physical release was likely to cost more than they would gain from it, cutting into their profits.

Based on their experience of Alan Wake Remastered and Control, they likely didn't expect to sell many physical copies anyway (which would have been the very issue, as making and distributing physical copies carries a certain additional price anyway even if sales are small).
Mediocre and overrated? Definitely a minority opinion.
    Bland characters, repetitive enemies and environment and an awful final boss. The main story is also not great. The world building? Sure. The music segment? Fantastic. Nearly everything else? Bland.
It cracks me up (sadly), that I battle evil souls with a flashlight and the most outrageous thing is that Saga's power bill is only 48 bucks.
You know that’s most likely the publisher making a call like that, right?
    Yes, and they chose their publisher.  Not the other way around.  I doubt they had a problem with it either because it netted them more money anyway.
This.... this.... this....
Remedy's experience with Control was that the great majority of sales were digital. In 2020, which was the best year for the sales of the game, physical copies made up only 10% of the sales. From their subjective POV, not having a physical copy is not a major loss.

In any case, we should not worry about the sales of AW2. By the best available information the game has already sold well over a million copies and will make a profit by 2024. It will also have a long tail like Control did.
But is not a physical release just the same? It gives you a key to download the game from a server. Once the game is removed from the server, your key won't do anything right?
And if there happens to be a CD In there I don't think a game that's 80GB+ would be fitting on the cd/DVD/blueray anyway
    youre half (probably less) correct. Physical games arent codes, they are discs. If you buy a "physical code", you bought a digital game. A PS5 disc can hold 100GB, some games come in 2 discs. The issue would be a lot of games have been added incomplete to the disc, and they need huge patches to be downloaded. You'd still have a game, just not perfectly functional.
Who knows. Depends on what you didn't like. If you didn't like the story and the overall atmosphere then you are likely to not enjoy the second one. If you only disliked the combat in the first one then there is still much more to enjoy here.
Absolutely. It plays almost nothing like the first.
I didn't like Alan Wake 1 at all. Hated the story, characters, setting, style, repetitive shooting...

But I loved Control and thought AW2 sounded promising. I'm so glad I bought AW2 because I love it!

If you like the Silent Hill games, or Evil Within, then I think you'd like the scavenging/survival horror gameplay of AW2.
Absolutely. Watch a recap by Sam Lake on YouTube. But you don't even have to do that, the game explains what you need to know.
Watch a story recap to refresh your mind and you should be good.
Agreed. Maybe people should consider the fact that by now half of every dollar/euro/etc they pay for this game will go towards making Control 2, or the next Alan Wake game. Or something else dreamed up by Sam Lake and his merry crew. The gaming public will be better off for every game Remedy gets to make.

(The other half will go to Epic, of course, but I guess they'll need to get their due for paying Remedy to make this game when nobody else would for many years...)
    I’m not holding up multimillion dollar corporations with my money they simply need to do better, the way yall just tell people “they don’t have to buy it” when they have problems with something.
But people aren’t missing out. The game will still be great when it’s priced at $15.
This sounds like some of the reason the sales aren’t great. People think they need to put 40 hours into previous games just to get up to speed on things
    The only game you really should play before AW2 is the first game. The rest is just for context filling and to catch the more subtle references. And even then, there is an official recap to put you up to speed.

I can see thought that it could affect sales. Especially the fact that the first Alan Wake was not really immensely popular when it came out (despite being highly anticipated) and the remaster didn't sell too well either, so some people could see that as a sequel to a game that they were not really interested in in the first place. 

What also definitely affects sales is the lack of a physical version. After looking at some of the data from the Insomniac leak, it's impressive how well physical games still sell.
        I tell people to go watch a twenty minute you tube video explaining AW1, and control/AW tie in. An hour of homework and you can be balls deep in AW2 when you play it.
            Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
                Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.

Thanks:)
                Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
        Ok but AW1 is really, really hard to play. I wanted to like it but I just couldn’t bear running round in identical forests for that many hours
            Seriously
        I can definitely confirm that the game is highly appealing to me but that I put it off my list for not getting a physical release.
At a time where the question of media conservation is more discussed than ever, I find it a really crazy move.

There is no way I'm spending 50$ on a game that is not mine, I'll either spend 60$ on a physical copy, or get it on sale for 15$ in a year or two.

That's just sad cause I'm sure they deserved more sales, but hell I'm already pissed when an indie is digital only, but an AAA ? 

Same goes for Baldurs gate tbh, Larian did release both Divinity games on physical, but not for their record-breaking GOTY ?

That's not the industry I want, and I'm not paying for that. Nobody should tbh, I know Remedy doesn't have infinite budget but we have to realize digital games are a scam, you do not own anything, you just rent it for an unlimited time.
I feel like paying 80$ for a game is more debated than paying 60$ for a rent that looks like a purchase, and I don't understand it :)
            Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
    I mean I own but haven’t finished Alan wake 1, American Nightmare, and Control, so I’m def not buying Alan Wake 2 yet lol
    It's the Blade Runner 2049 effect.

That movie bombed because it was a sequel to a 30 year old movie that a mass audience has no idea exists.

Alan Wake is the same situation. And on top of all that, it's a horror game, so most mass audience members write it off almost instantly. 

It's a game designed for a very small subset of customers and making money seems to come second to the passion of just getting it made and played by people who love it.
    Yea I’m not playing control, which I didn’t even know were related just to play Alan wake 2. To be fair I also didn’t play the first one, and don’t want to. Don’t have that kind of time.
    Or you could just watch a recap video on YouTube for 20min.
    Yeah I started playing AW2 this week and it is pretty confusing. I played the first game years ago and don’t remember how it ended. I didn’t really care for Control so I never beat it.

Also, you need to know some Max Payne lore. He’s sort of a major character but has a different name. Remedy made the first Max Payne before selling it to Rockstar. One of the characters in this game has the same voice actor, face model, clothes, and personality/attitude as Max Payne.

I’m not very far into Alan Wake yet, but so far the story is very meta and is doing a sort of multiverse type of thing with Remedy’s games.
    I mean, it's called Alan Wake 2. I get that it's one of the big talking points of the day, and people don't want to feel left out, but it's also a sequel, and it's not asking that much in terms of prior investment. It's not like they're asking you to go pick up an Alan Wake novel or whatever
        But it's a sequel to an extremely story-focused game, which is different than someone picking up the next Call of Duty or whatever. Feeling like you need to play a 15-year-old game to understand the new one is absolutely a barrier for a lot of people, fair or not.
        Plenty of sequels are pretty easy to pick up and play with no context, and this is exactly the reason. Asking people to go play a damn near 15 year old game to get up to speed is just not gonna workout financially. Red Dead 2 was also a sequel to an older game, but there was no real need to go play the first one.
    Better to be a patient gamer and just play the first game as intended
Is it necessary to play the Control expansions?
    The AWE expansion pretty much explains the events from Alan Wake 1 and puts it all into a different perspective. It also serves as a great narrative lead-up to Alan Wake 2.

It's not necessary, but I can definitely recommend it. The AWE expansion is also great in its own regard, especially if you enjoyed the base game.
        I didn’t really like Control, enjoying AW1 so far though! Thanks :)
            I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
                U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
                    Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
                    I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
                Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
                I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
                I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
                Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
                    I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
                    Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
                        I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
                    I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
                You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
                You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
    Necessary, no, recommended, yes.

The AWE expansion of *Control* is very much a part of the *Alan Wake II* story, but you don't have to have played it to understand the story by any means, but I would recommend it.
        Is control part of the alan universe??
            Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
    Both expansions are good and I’d recommend them. The Foundation answers a lot of questions (although raises some others). And the AWE just sets up Alan Wake 2 (but doesn’t add a ton of lore)
    I would actually say the entire main game of Control is unimportant to the Wake-iverse. (if you only care about AW. 95% of the main game is not AW related) but you have to play it in order to get to the AWE DLC, so basically run through it so you get to the good stuff.

Had a buddy who didn't have the best time with Control, but really wanted to be in on the "Wake-iverse". I told him if you really wanna feel like you're in the loop, the Control DLC is fundamental.   

After he gave it another try and played the Control DLC he admits its atleast worth the run thru, because it puts into perspective just how powerful Alan is. He overall found a better time in general the 2nd try, and actually wants to play Control 2, whenever that comes out.
    Nah. One is a neat little tie in to Alan Wake and a good teaser for II, but it’s not strictly necessary.
    I didn’t love Control.

Alan Wake 2 was amazing tho.
I disagree. I played Alan Wake 1 years ago and loved it. Played the remaster as well. Tried Control and hated it. Stopped playing it after a couple hours. Played Alan Wake 2 this year and it is my GOTY. And I had no issue following the story.
    You just answered my question about whether I needed to like Control, which didn’t stick for me. Now I’m interested in AW2.
I actually think AW1 combat is much cleaner and straightforward plus it has no bs boss fights
    With Alan Wake as my GOTY I understand what you mean. 1 had straight forward shine light and shoot. It was simple and every enemy worked the same way. 

In 2 you have enemies that disappear with just light (making you waste bullets), enemies that die without shining a light and enemies that seem to take way more light and bullets but for no real reason.

I don’t think it’s necessarily worse but it’s very different. In 1 it helps combat fear because you know what to do in every situation.

In 2, I find combat to be far more chaotic
        I personally liked the enemies that just disappear brought a lot of tension, but generally agree the combat in general is a bit more chaotic. I think it's to do with the closer camera, especially in the forest where it can get disorientating. It was a bit goofy, but having the camera zoom in on new enemies spawning in in AW1 I started to miss haha.
    I agree AW2 combat was it's weakest part, well that and the plotboard sections, I loved it at first as it was very novel but my god I don't know how Saga takes a shit without first looking through 3 files and 15 photos and then profiling the turd.
    Boss fights are a staple of video games and the first one definitely had them. Or did you forget about the possessed Construction vehicles?
        I haven't played 2, so can't compare, but 1 had what, 2 "bossfights"? namely, >!the bulldozer and the tornado.!<
        I do remember them. They weren’t good but nowhere near the level frustration AW2 bosses have caused me
    lol. No.
Why are people so eager to heap such praise upon a studio that consistently, spectacularly fails at the single most important aspect of making a videogame? Do you really care about story and visuals so much more that you’re willing to completely overlook shallow, repetitive, boring gameplay? Why not just watch movies or TV at that point? Or are standards for gameplay so low that the bare minimum will pass as top shelf quality as long as it’s dressed up in a “cinematic” coat of paint?
    Fair criticism. You can make a similar argument for Resident Evil games. 

Playing Bungie games since I was a teen has spoiled me on smooth gameplay, so I guess I try not to be too critical on gameplay some cases as I’ve enjoyed multiple Remedy games in spite of the gameplay.
They say it's due to more costs and also it might have meant delaying the game because the disc version has to be ready earlier. I don't know if it is true or they just made up something to provide an excuse. But a disc version would have been cool
    Saying it's due to costs is ridiculous. It's published by Epic Games. I will not buy it at full price because of this. You don't own digital games and they had no real reason to not do a physical.
        100%. They are talking shite. They thought that people buying disc and reselling would hurt their bottom line so they went digital only.  At this point I put my money back in my wallet out of principal… 👍🏻
            Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
        Supposedly Epic does not have a physical game infrastructure in place, so I could see Epic not letting them do a disc version
I'm not getting it specifically because of the lack of physical copies. The only games I get digitally are very cheap/smaller games like a Telltale game or something like that.

    Lol nobody is using it "as an experiment"

It's almost definitely just a numbers thing. Somebody behind the scenes saw this was a niche title and thought that the physical sales wouldn't make up the price of printing physical copies. Were they right? Who knows! But I guarantee you nobody in this thread knows.
    Yea I really want the game but I want to actually own the disc. I have a huge backlog now so I don’t mind waiting until a potential disc version comes out.
Yep, think how many ‘casual gamers’ who don’t keep up with reddit or GOTY news will never know that AW2 even exists.

Having space on store shelves is free advertising that is directly aimed at potential buyers.
    What makes you think casual gamers are more likely to buy physical?
        Yea casual gamers are more likely to scroll the digital stores than randomly browse a game store.
        Because they are? John Gamer is much more likely to come across the game if it's on target shelves or whatever. Lot less visual competition and a lot more likely to just happen to be at a store with it. 

 The only way someone is coming across Alan Wake 2 casually is if they happen to be browsing the store and see among the thousands of games already there. It's already pretty buried
I disagree. Digital only is the future and studios like Remedy will benefit from it. The “impulse buy from the shelf” is a minuscule demographic that is dwarfed by “buy 2nd hand.” Having new players buy it from them and not eBay/resellers means they will get more sales as time goes on & have control over the price.

It’s also a huge waste of time and resources getting a game ready on disc too. This takes man hours to create and test & loss of margin to manufacturing, distribution, retailers, etc.

Edit: And I’m getting downvoted spammed by people who just don’t like reality. Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway. It’s an inefficient physical license. Every other industry has moved on from discs & the downvote spam comes from an entitled shrinking demographic who wants more ewaste so they can nickel and dime on games. No matter how much you whine on the internet, the days of discs are numbered. For those who want something to collect… there’s collectables.
    Fair point about the second hand market.
    >Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway.

What's up with this?Most of the games that I bought on my PS5 (disc versions) are playable from the start.  


I do understand that most games come with day 1 patches, hotfixes, etc. But that does not mean the game is not in the disk and you will have to download something in order to play. 

I can think just of  a few examples where you NEED to download something beforehand. IIRC it was a Call of Duty and Fallen Survivor(?), but that's it.  Why are you making this overgeneralization anyway?
It's basically just Resident Evil that sells for horror games. Silent Hill as a franchise has sold less than 10 mil.
Not to mention it’s a GOTY but there’s no copy that people can put under the tree as a present. What an idiotic plan.
I mean epic is publishing it, its not like cs and dota is coming on epic.
    They could have had another company publish it. They chose to go with Epic and can't be surprised that they're not getting tons of PC sales due to it.
        Well companies are not lining up to publish a sequel to alan wake which was financially a flop, remedy was lucky to even have epic publishing it for them. Why do you think 505 didn’t publish this while the did for control? They knew alan wake 2 wouldn’t sell well, while control which is an action game to its core will sell more.
        Theyve tried to make the game for 8 years with different publishers and Epic was the only company that would let them (a) make it and (b) make it the way remedy wanted to make it
        > They could have had another company publish it

You don't know how video game publishing and development works.
Yeah, when you play it with headphones the random jumpscares are really anxiety inducing but other than that it’s a fantastic game
    No kidding, they really were something else. Something about the overall atmosphere of the game elevated those scares to a whole 'nother level, I don't normally get scared in any horror games like Amnesia or Resident Evil or Outlast or whatever there is, but something about AW2 was just different.
        I guess what makes it a true horror game is that it feels like there are barely any NPC’s there to interact with and it’s quiet all the time with almost no background music! It feels like one of those eerie dreams where you wander alone somewhere
    The jump scares are bs tbh! Just walking along then out of nowhere an image pops up with a scream. The cheapest way to get a jump ever! That said I am enjoying the game so far, but I've never been a fan of cheap jump scares. The atmosphere alone is spooky enough.
        I’m hoping they add an accessibility option to turn off those jump scares 😅
I just played through AW1 last week and am halfway through Control now. Can't wait for AW2
The deal has been up for 8 hours in my timezone
$47.99 on PSN right now
    Amazing, I saw it on sale on Xbox yesterday and had my fingers crossed for it to come to PS too. Got the deluxe edition 👍👍👍
Same. It's literally the only reason I haven't purchased it yet, I've been hyped for it for years but I just will not buy a digital product at full price. So it's just a waiting game, either it gets a physical release or hits like 50% off first.

Hell, I'd probably buy a Collector's Edition of a physical release just because of how much I loved the CE of the original game, it was so good.
    I was holding out for a physical version but it was on sale on Epic + Epic was giving out coupons for the holidays so I got it for $26, couldn't pass that up
        Oh damn, is that still going on? That's not bad.
Bad for the environment, just get the digital version
    So is driving but I'm sure you do that.
I mean...people are playing it.
[deleted]
    Same here. I’m sure AW2 is great but I can happily wait for a mega sale or a disc. 

Judging by the game’s awful sales figures it seems most people feel the same.
    You love them?
deep.
Still surprisedthey went that route
Sometimes not even then! I feel like coming here to talk theories is almost as much fun as playing the game.
is the gameplay in Alan Wake 2 significantly better? 

Just finished the main story in 1 but I had a hard time completing it cause the gameplay was painful as hell. Felt like a duty to finish it.
    It’s better, but it’s still not amazing. That was actually a minor point of frustration that I had, was that some enemies can move really fast but you can’t keep up. So there were a few times where I felt like I got bullshit deaths because enemies were basically just able to be cheap and kill me
Yeah I love Remedy getting recognition, and the fact that the game exists at all is pretty amazing. And I didn’t hate it, there was a lot about the game that worked for me. I am glad that I played it, but I just don’t think I necessarily loved it and I’m not sure how willing I’d be to recommend it to someone else
This is my plan.

I'll buy digital here and there, but if it's something I'm buying full price at release it's gotta be physical. If I can't, I don't mind waiting for a while.
That was a huge problem when buying digital releases on console, it took years for some games to get a sale and when it did go on sale it wasn't for much. Epic store on PC has a huge discount, ended up getting it for $23. Sale goes on through Jan 10th. With the increase in PS plus sub I just had to step away from console altogether, I'd say it'd be worth it if they brought more quality games every month.
It seems many people feel the same judging by the recent IGN article that pointed out the game’s woeful sales. It was something like the 150th best selling game on PS and Xbox that month lol.
    Doubt. It was the 7th-most downloaded game on PS5 in Europe last month, and 12th in the US. Wherever that leaves it in overall sales, it certainly isn't anywhere outside the top 50.

[**https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/08/playstation-store-november-2023s-top-downloads/**](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/08/playstation-store-november-2023s-top-downloads/)
If the PS5 had been digital-only I would have passed on the entire console.
    I got the disc version but I can’t recall buying a disc in over a year now. I like using my PS5 as a blu ray player but I could care less about having physical games anymore. I do always like having the option but I think digital is more convenient. It’s unlikely I’ll come back to this system 10yrs from now.

Personally, I think you should always have the option so I think making the game digital only was a bad call.
Why is it interesting?
    [deleted]
        I won’t pay “60-70 dollar” larger studio experiences as digital only. I want a physical product, seems plenty enough agree. Each to their own, but I’d rather support physical formats.
    Because it’s abnormal. You’re missing out on an amazing game because of the format it’s being offered in. Why do you only purchase physical copies?
        Because I don’t own the content, only a digital licence. As I said above, not for 60-70 dollar games. I prefer to own a physical copy.
        Another reason to buy physical copies over Digital is being able to resell the game after I'm done, well at least for me. For example, I only play the main story for most of the games I purchase since I only have maybe 1 hour to play at nights after the kids have gone to bed. Most games I put in about 20 hours total into them and then get to resell them for $35-40. So being able to play that for half or even less of the full retail is amazing.
            That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
i’ll just wait for that
> 90% of Control's sales were digital according to Remedy.

Either the game sold way way more on PC on console or it's been very discounted, because that's weird. 

[The recent leaks showed how much physical games still sell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/18magu9/sales_numbers_for_a_ton_of_sony_games_including/) For the vast majority of Sony AAA games (the ones getting a physical release), they don't even get to 50% digital sales.
    I saw that. I think it's just a case by case basis thing.


Sony first party games are not necessarily representative of the entire industry. They tend to be sold in bundles prominently, for one thing.
Then there should be no complaints from them about reduced sales or the game not doing well financially! More power to ‘em if some sales instead of all possible sales is good enough for them.
    The cost to produce physical copies of the game would not have netted a profit from those who’d buy it physically but refuse it digitally.
        Quite so. A physical release has its costs as well. All those copies need to be made and distributed. In this case we don't know for sure if it was up to Epic or Remedy that there was no physical release at launch. But Remedy's recent real experiences with physical copies are not great. AW Remastered sold less than they hoped for, and I understand there was a lot of physical copies left unsold (which means that they represented straight-up loss). And then with Control, the great majority of the sales was digital.

Based on those experiences, Remedy may well have looked at what a physical release would cost, by Epic's estimate, in addition to a digital release, and predict that it would not likely make them profit with the expected sales numbers.

Some might argue that with the current balance between the numbers of digital and physical copies sold in gaming, we are approaching an era where physical copies do not represent a money-making part of the business, but merely a courtesy to collectors and (the small minority of) players who prefer physical. Whether it makes a profit may be a toss-up, and some companies may practically only do it for marketing/visibility and image reasons.
            Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
        I’d love to see the numbers supporting that!
            This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
            I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
                Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
                I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
                Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
    nobody is complaining though.
        That you’ve seen. I’ve seen a lot of it. People complaining that not enough people bought it or gave it a chance when there’s a line of people waiting to support it physically. Hopefully no complaints to come from Remedy though, they’ve made their bed.
            So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
            Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
                You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
            You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
                Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
            I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
            If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.
    There haven’t been any complaints from them whatsoever. They are enjoying the success of their game and are actively supporting/updating it to make it an even more polished experience. Also, it might not be selling well compared to top-selling AAA games but it is doing great compared to other Remedy titles.
Nope, Remedy decided to partner with Epic knowing they wouldn’t support physical release.
    And without epics funding the game wouldn’t have been made at all, so either way there’s no physical release.
    See my other comment replying to you. I don’t think you’re acknowledging the reality of game development. It would be great if we lived in a world where risky, costly games like AW2 can get the funding for physical releases. But that’s not the world we live in. And I don’t think it’s fair to hold that against the developer who made an incredible experience that flies in the face of what is “safe” and “profitable” in today’s gaming market. We need to support these types of games so that hopefully in the future they will be able to justify physical releases.
        I mean, they could partner with someone like Limited Run Games, who knows how to make profitable physical runs of potentially risky titles.
        Physical release would be a very tiny part of the budget of the games though. It doesn't cost as much as you imagine. Plenty of smaller games get a physical release too. 

Epic is publishing this, it's one of the biggest gaming companies there is, it's not a budget problem.
        I simply disagree with you. If games like Senua’s Sacrifice, Outlast, Life is Strange, and other similar titles can get physical releases, there’s no excuse for a huge production like Alan Wake. It doesn’t fly in the face of what is profitable, as the entire reason for digital only release is to increase profits at the expense of the consumer. If you’re fine with that, by all means rent all of your games for $60, $70+. To each their own!
            The games you listed are anywhere from 6 years to over a decade old. They reflect a completely different market and landscape for game development that is no longer relevant, especially post-pandemic. 

I’m not saying that the current state of things is better - in fact I would say it’s worse, and I agree that anti-consumer profit motives drive most decisions these days. But when a title like AW2 has the chance to shift the mainstream mindset about what types of games can succeed, and we choose to shun it due to capitalistic forces beyond Remedy’s control, we may be playing into those same forces’ hands and only exacerbating the problem.
    So, just to be clear here, you'd rather that Remedy didn't make the game they wanted and ended up making something that potentially isn't even half as good, as long as it got a physical release?
    Oh yeah, they should have picked one of those ten other companies offering to finance and publish the game.

Wait, there were none. Microsoft refused the game years ago and it's really not easy finding an investor for this kind of project.
    just wanna say no matter if you’re right or wrong, the way ur presenting ur side of the matter is just so obnoxious that im going to return a physical copy of any random game I own so I can replace it with a digital copy, just to spite you.

Alan Wake 2 is as amazing as it is because of Remedy partnering with Epic and therefore getting a budget in order to make such a masterpiece. Sucks that there’s no physical copy but the game is worth every single penny.
        I don’t mind at all if you want to return your owned games for long term rentals! To each their own. Enjoy.
            get a job
                a job is how i afford a bunch of physical games lol
                    people are just salty that you didn't play a game they like, it's common here
Same thing, the money you pay for the game also goes to Epic anyway (maybe completely even if Remedy was already paid and got no royalties, depends of their contract)

So the lesson can be for them.
So edgy. So brave.
It's cute how they thought moving it up a week from Spiderman 2 was gonna make a difference.
There needs to be a law change, you buy a license you get to watch/play it. They remove it and you get a full refund.
Sounds incredible. Will definitely start with AW1!
Appreciate this - will start with AW1 and fully immerse myself. Excited to begin.
Good to know - thanks very much! Will start with AW1.
Again, it was advertised as a survival horror game. I wouldn’t qualify it as such. If I had known it was so narrative heavy I wouldn’t have bought it.
It goes everywhere and it is explained very clearly in all the texts and cutscenes and dialogues and whatnot. But if you don't pay attention to any of those and just rush through the game playing like it's a shooter, then sure.
That's not true at all. It's true that it isn't spelled out to you. It requires a lot of knowledge, reading, and analysis, but the entire story is there, everything makes sense, and the answers are there for you to find. Anything that's still unknown is made pretty clear to be a mystery to be answered later.
Despite the fact that like 60% of the comments in any *Alan Wake II* thread, including this one, are heavily upvoted criticising the lack of a physical release?
What? That’s what literally 80% of the comments are in any thread even tangentially related to AW2.
Really? 95% of the comments in this thread are people waiting for physical lmao, in 2023. Completely in vain.
Rather than going mad, people are likely to point out that a physical release would likely not make for huge additional sales for a (niche) game like this. Maybe 10-20% more sales could be expected with a physical option. Remedy knows this from their recent experience with Control, so they are not taking a big risk with a purely digital release.
    It's not about how much extra money they'll make, it's about supporting physical media over digital, which has had plenty of examples of companies just removing access to digitally bought content. With no physical release one day you'll end up not being able to play a game you paid money for, so digital only is extremely anti-consumer.
        We should expect companies to work for preserving their games so that people who bought them can play them in the future. But it would be reductionist to say that physical discs are the only side to the matter. The issue is institutional readiness to have it as a priority to look after the interests of your customers, it is not merely a matter of format.

Companies like Remedy have a vested interest in preserving the games they have made so people can keep playing them in the future as well. Remedy has no interest to remove access to its digital content. It would go against its very business model.

To give an example: with AW1 Remedy had issues with licensed music expiring, which led to the game being removed from different storefronts in 2017, something the company really didn't want to happen. With AW2, they solved the above problem by not having licensed music at all, but owning the rights to all the music in the game, made for the game. All the music is DMCA free, as well. This way, there are no issues related to external IP rights with this game to cause it availability issues down the line.

Remedy's future success is based on the Remedy Connected Universe they are building with the Control and Alan Wake franchises connected to each other in many ways. They want to keep selling their games, and for them to have a long tail. For this, they need to be continually available for both old and new players.

Given that today you'll need to download a lot of content for games even if they are on a physical disc, too, I would not say that physical is a silver bullet for game preservation in any case. Many games today and especially tomorrow are so big in file size that you couldn't comfortable fit them into one or even two discs, anyway. Many companies that have a "physical release" will still need you to download much or most of the content. And then there are the updates. Alan Wake 2 alone has received over a dozen downloadable updates over less than two months. Remedy has been pretty responsive with those updates, too, fixing issues specifically pointed out to them by the players, and so on.

We all share the same concerns, we want game companies to be responsive and fair to their players, customers and fans. So, let's take a broad perspective into these issues.
            This was a good comment
            Really well said, I hope people take this into consideration.
Why is it so offensive that people want to own a physical copy of something they spend their hard earned money on?

        [removed]
            [removed]
    I didn’t say it was offensive, I was just commenting how hilariously outdated it was to think that digital only isn’t a real release.
    No one is offended, its just weird to think that a game that was released digitally isn't a real release.
Except I'm talking about why the game is underselling. 90% of people buying games are not buying a game because of the box art anymore. They won't have played the first one and if they have, they would have bought this game on release. 
  
The fanbase is small, the hype was medium, but the game is good.
Honestly, as a fan who's played both, I think you do. Yeah you  *can* skip it, but this is a narrative heavy game with some gameplay here and there. What's the point if you miss key references and stuff? While I love AW1 it's combat is atrocious and tiresome. I'd suggest watching an in depth YT video explainer instead.
People just like to hate on things that are popular and getting worldwide acclaim. Nothing to see here.
Too cerebral for him and not enough explosions, I'd guess.
Wow, I didn't know that. So.. they simply refused to put out a disk version? Why would Remedy make that decision?
    >Why would Remedy make that decision?

They didn't. Epic Games did.
    Pure greed. They don’t care about consumers or game preservation at all, and that’s a problem that will only grow the more companies like theirs are supported, unfortunately.
        I find that so hard to believe though. The game just has so much heart. I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, it just doesn't track
            Unfortunately, they’ve admitted it’s to cut costs on their end (and increase their profits at consumer and game preservation’s expense, is how that translates). Some people will never care about physical media and will simply pay whatever the company charges for digital rentals, as that’s what “buying” digital is, and just accept if a company decides to cut off their access to the game entirely. It’s sad to say about a company that’s made a cool game, but it very much tracks.
                How can they be increasing their profits when the game is cheaper than any other AAA game out there? It’s $59.99 as opposed to $69.99 on console and cheaper on PC too. 

If they wanted greed and profit why did they price it lower?
                    Probably because it’s a niche horror IP, wouldn’t sell at $69.99. No physical means they don’t have to pay the manufacturing costs.
        Idk why you're blaming Remedy when Epic Games is the one publishing the game and making that decision.
            Remedy agreed to the conditions of making and releasing their game under Epic Games, and there’s no shot they didn’t, at absolute bare minimum, know Epic Games wouldn’t release a physical copy. They’re absolutely at fault, along with Epic.
                So would you rather they didn’t agree to those terms, and the game didn’t get made at all? Remedy is a niche developer that makes niche games that take risks - chances are no other publisher was willing to fund development of the game at all, let alone a physical release.
                    PS funded Returnal and Death Stranding, MS published Quantum Break. There are probably plenty of publishers who would’ve been willing to publish it.
                        Slightly different contexts to all of those games though, aren't there?

*Returnal* is made by a Sony first-party studio, so its going to get backing, and Sony tend to back their own studios. *Death Stranding* is made by probably one of, if not *the* most well-known game director on the planet - he's the very literal definition of "give the man what he wants", hence why he gets games made and even just partnered with Xbox for a new game.

Also, Microsoft published *Quantum Break* because, like Sony with *Returnal*, Remedy had a partnership agreement with them then. 

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
                        Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
                Supremely idiotic take.
                    And you’re entitled to this nothing take lol
                        You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
                            You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
                    I agree. That person would prefer Remedy just shut down when AW2 doesn't sell a million units rather than they take help from epic.
    Yeah they have repeatedly said they don’t plan to release a physical edition. They said it was to help keep costs down. And they also claimed that having to have a download upon inserting the disc would hurt the experience…? But if you buy it digitally you also have to wait for a download.
        They are making excuses alan wake 1 remastered came out on disc for both xbox and playstation(both ps4 and ps5 discs),but they can't make physical copies of the sequel for some reason. They couldn't put the game on Steam becasue epic want an exclusive. Epic sabotaged the games sales hard there is no way they didn't realize this.
They always do for some reason haha. We’ll still be able to play nearly every game we’ve ever bought in the future, and that’s vindication enough!
    I think you don’t realize that a lot of people don’t ever replay their games, especially not ones from previous generations. Once a new console comes out, the old one goes into some box in the garage and is never touched again. I have a box full of Xbox 360 games that haven’t been touched in a decade. I have no interest in playing such old games. For most casual gamers like me, there’s no difference between physical and digital. Digital might be better since physical games could be damaged and take up space.
        Can I have your stuff then? They'll have a great home in my collection.
    It’s so weird because this is something that hurts the entire gaming community. And yet everyone gets out their pitchforks to defend it. 

If this was an indie game I could understand the digital only release. But I think that sending AAA companies the message that we will essentially pay for long term rentals of their games is just mad.
Not to start anything but if I had to guess, it's that you guys kind of come off really condescending when making statements like that. Like, I think the OP of this thread made a reasonable comment, but there's other people straight up insulting the game, the developer, and the people that bought it digitally just because there's no physical version.

And overall there's just far more nuance to the situation than people are really presenting here. It's a reasonably low budget avant-garde horror game, they probably need to cut what costs they can to make a profit. I'd be upset if this was Call of Duty doing this.
I’m sure it is very good, but from the limited amount I’ve seen the gameplay looks like Resident Evil survival horror. That’s not risk taking.
    Lol. I mean if you want to base your opinion about a game on some 5 minute gameplay video on youtube, sure. Your miss.
    From what I understand, the narrative is very cerebral and risk-taking.
Doesn't help that the fanbase's go-to-response whenever someone criticizes anything about the game is "lol skill issue".
There were other avenues they could've taken to secure funding that wouldn't have locked them out of physical release on console and steam release on pc. If scamware can raise millions on a kickstarter, so could they. But they destroyed their future profits for quick epic cash. Considering how many gamers didn't even know this game launched at all, they really hurt themselves here.
There’s indications, 850k in two months on consoles is not great.

https://www.neogaf.com/threads/alan-wake-2-lack-of-sales-update-suggests-it-didn’t-sell-too-well.1664654/
Tanking physical copies resales where they have no control over the price. Physical copies gets cheaper faster than digital. I also believe that no physical copies helps them keep the price higher on digital storefronts on consoles for longer periods.
    If the decision to make the release digital only was made by Remedy (and not Epic), I don't believe the resale of physical copies was really a major factor for them. I think they would have just thought that doing a physical release was likely to cost more than they would gain from it, cutting into their profits.

Based on their experience of Alan Wake Remastered and Control, they likely didn't expect to sell many physical copies anyway (which would have been the very issue, as making and distributing physical copies carries a certain additional price anyway even if sales are small).
Bland characters, repetitive enemies and environment and an awful final boss. The main story is also not great. The world building? Sure. The music segment? Fantastic. Nearly everything else? Bland.
Yes, and they chose their publisher.  Not the other way around.  I doubt they had a problem with it either because it netted them more money anyway.
youre half (probably less) correct. Physical games arent codes, they are discs. If you buy a "physical code", you bought a digital game. A PS5 disc can hold 100GB, some games come in 2 discs. The issue would be a lot of games have been added incomplete to the disc, and they need huge patches to be downloaded. You'd still have a game, just not perfectly functional.
I’m not holding up multimillion dollar corporations with my money they simply need to do better, the way yall just tell people “they don’t have to buy it” when they have problems with something.
The only game you really should play before AW2 is the first game. The rest is just for context filling and to catch the more subtle references. And even then, there is an official recap to put you up to speed.

I can see thought that it could affect sales. Especially the fact that the first Alan Wake was not really immensely popular when it came out (despite being highly anticipated) and the remaster didn't sell too well either, so some people could see that as a sequel to a game that they were not really interested in in the first place. 

What also definitely affects sales is the lack of a physical version. After looking at some of the data from the Insomniac leak, it's impressive how well physical games still sell.
    I tell people to go watch a twenty minute you tube video explaining AW1, and control/AW tie in. An hour of homework and you can be balls deep in AW2 when you play it.
        Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
            Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.

Thanks:)
            Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
    Ok but AW1 is really, really hard to play. I wanted to like it but I just couldn’t bear running round in identical forests for that many hours
        Seriously
    I can definitely confirm that the game is highly appealing to me but that I put it off my list for not getting a physical release.
At a time where the question of media conservation is more discussed than ever, I find it a really crazy move.

There is no way I'm spending 50$ on a game that is not mine, I'll either spend 60$ on a physical copy, or get it on sale for 15$ in a year or two.

That's just sad cause I'm sure they deserved more sales, but hell I'm already pissed when an indie is digital only, but an AAA ? 

Same goes for Baldurs gate tbh, Larian did release both Divinity games on physical, but not for their record-breaking GOTY ?

That's not the industry I want, and I'm not paying for that. Nobody should tbh, I know Remedy doesn't have infinite budget but we have to realize digital games are a scam, you do not own anything, you just rent it for an unlimited time.
I feel like paying 80$ for a game is more debated than paying 60$ for a rent that looks like a purchase, and I don't understand it :)
        Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
I mean I own but haven’t finished Alan wake 1, American Nightmare, and Control, so I’m def not buying Alan Wake 2 yet lol
It's the Blade Runner 2049 effect.

That movie bombed because it was a sequel to a 30 year old movie that a mass audience has no idea exists.

Alan Wake is the same situation. And on top of all that, it's a horror game, so most mass audience members write it off almost instantly. 

It's a game designed for a very small subset of customers and making money seems to come second to the passion of just getting it made and played by people who love it.
Yea I’m not playing control, which I didn’t even know were related just to play Alan wake 2. To be fair I also didn’t play the first one, and don’t want to. Don’t have that kind of time.
Or you could just watch a recap video on YouTube for 20min.
Yeah I started playing AW2 this week and it is pretty confusing. I played the first game years ago and don’t remember how it ended. I didn’t really care for Control so I never beat it.

Also, you need to know some Max Payne lore. He’s sort of a major character but has a different name. Remedy made the first Max Payne before selling it to Rockstar. One of the characters in this game has the same voice actor, face model, clothes, and personality/attitude as Max Payne.

I’m not very far into Alan Wake yet, but so far the story is very meta and is doing a sort of multiverse type of thing with Remedy’s games.
I mean, it's called Alan Wake 2. I get that it's one of the big talking points of the day, and people don't want to feel left out, but it's also a sequel, and it's not asking that much in terms of prior investment. It's not like they're asking you to go pick up an Alan Wake novel or whatever
    But it's a sequel to an extremely story-focused game, which is different than someone picking up the next Call of Duty or whatever. Feeling like you need to play a 15-year-old game to understand the new one is absolutely a barrier for a lot of people, fair or not.
    Plenty of sequels are pretty easy to pick up and play with no context, and this is exactly the reason. Asking people to go play a damn near 15 year old game to get up to speed is just not gonna workout financially. Red Dead 2 was also a sequel to an older game, but there was no real need to go play the first one.
Better to be a patient gamer and just play the first game as intended
The AWE expansion pretty much explains the events from Alan Wake 1 and puts it all into a different perspective. It also serves as a great narrative lead-up to Alan Wake 2.

It's not necessary, but I can definitely recommend it. The AWE expansion is also great in its own regard, especially if you enjoyed the base game.
    I didn’t really like Control, enjoying AW1 so far though! Thanks :)
        I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
            U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
                Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
                I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
            Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
            I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
            I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
            Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
                I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
                Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
                    I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
                I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
            You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
            You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
Necessary, no, recommended, yes.

The AWE expansion of *Control* is very much a part of the *Alan Wake II* story, but you don't have to have played it to understand the story by any means, but I would recommend it.
    Is control part of the alan universe??
        Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
Both expansions are good and I’d recommend them. The Foundation answers a lot of questions (although raises some others). And the AWE just sets up Alan Wake 2 (but doesn’t add a ton of lore)
I would actually say the entire main game of Control is unimportant to the Wake-iverse. (if you only care about AW. 95% of the main game is not AW related) but you have to play it in order to get to the AWE DLC, so basically run through it so you get to the good stuff.

Had a buddy who didn't have the best time with Control, but really wanted to be in on the "Wake-iverse". I told him if you really wanna feel like you're in the loop, the Control DLC is fundamental.   

After he gave it another try and played the Control DLC he admits its atleast worth the run thru, because it puts into perspective just how powerful Alan is. He overall found a better time in general the 2nd try, and actually wants to play Control 2, whenever that comes out.
Nah. One is a neat little tie in to Alan Wake and a good teaser for II, but it’s not strictly necessary.
I didn’t love Control.

Alan Wake 2 was amazing tho.
You just answered my question about whether I needed to like Control, which didn’t stick for me. Now I’m interested in AW2.
With Alan Wake as my GOTY I understand what you mean. 1 had straight forward shine light and shoot. It was simple and every enemy worked the same way. 

In 2 you have enemies that disappear with just light (making you waste bullets), enemies that die without shining a light and enemies that seem to take way more light and bullets but for no real reason.

I don’t think it’s necessarily worse but it’s very different. In 1 it helps combat fear because you know what to do in every situation.

In 2, I find combat to be far more chaotic
    I personally liked the enemies that just disappear brought a lot of tension, but generally agree the combat in general is a bit more chaotic. I think it's to do with the closer camera, especially in the forest where it can get disorientating. It was a bit goofy, but having the camera zoom in on new enemies spawning in in AW1 I started to miss haha.
I agree AW2 combat was it's weakest part, well that and the plotboard sections, I loved it at first as it was very novel but my god I don't know how Saga takes a shit without first looking through 3 files and 15 photos and then profiling the turd.
Boss fights are a staple of video games and the first one definitely had them. Or did you forget about the possessed Construction vehicles?
    I haven't played 2, so can't compare, but 1 had what, 2 "bossfights"? namely, >!the bulldozer and the tornado.!<
    I do remember them. They weren’t good but nowhere near the level frustration AW2 bosses have caused me
lol. No.
Fair criticism. You can make a similar argument for Resident Evil games. 

Playing Bungie games since I was a teen has spoiled me on smooth gameplay, so I guess I try not to be too critical on gameplay some cases as I’ve enjoyed multiple Remedy games in spite of the gameplay.
Saying it's due to costs is ridiculous. It's published by Epic Games. I will not buy it at full price because of this. You don't own digital games and they had no real reason to not do a physical.
    100%. They are talking shite. They thought that people buying disc and reselling would hurt their bottom line so they went digital only.  At this point I put my money back in my wallet out of principal… 👍🏻
        Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
    Supposedly Epic does not have a physical game infrastructure in place, so I could see Epic not letting them do a disc version
Lol nobody is using it "as an experiment"

It's almost definitely just a numbers thing. Somebody behind the scenes saw this was a niche title and thought that the physical sales wouldn't make up the price of printing physical copies. Were they right? Who knows! But I guarantee you nobody in this thread knows.
Yea I really want the game but I want to actually own the disc. I have a huge backlog now so I don’t mind waiting until a potential disc version comes out.
What makes you think casual gamers are more likely to buy physical?
    Yea casual gamers are more likely to scroll the digital stores than randomly browse a game store.
    Because they are? John Gamer is much more likely to come across the game if it's on target shelves or whatever. Lot less visual competition and a lot more likely to just happen to be at a store with it. 

 The only way someone is coming across Alan Wake 2 casually is if they happen to be browsing the store and see among the thousands of games already there. It's already pretty buried
Fair point about the second hand market.
>Disc’s currently don’t even house the game & it needs to be downloaded digitally anyway.

What's up with this?Most of the games that I bought on my PS5 (disc versions) are playable from the start.  


I do understand that most games come with day 1 patches, hotfixes, etc. But that does not mean the game is not in the disk and you will have to download something in order to play. 

I can think just of  a few examples where you NEED to download something beforehand. IIRC it was a Call of Duty and Fallen Survivor(?), but that's it.  Why are you making this overgeneralization anyway?
They could have had another company publish it. They chose to go with Epic and can't be surprised that they're not getting tons of PC sales due to it.
    Well companies are not lining up to publish a sequel to alan wake which was financially a flop, remedy was lucky to even have epic publishing it for them. Why do you think 505 didn’t publish this while the did for control? They knew alan wake 2 wouldn’t sell well, while control which is an action game to its core will sell more.
    Theyve tried to make the game for 8 years with different publishers and Epic was the only company that would let them (a) make it and (b) make it the way remedy wanted to make it
    > They could have had another company publish it

You don't know how video game publishing and development works.
No kidding, they really were something else. Something about the overall atmosphere of the game elevated those scares to a whole 'nother level, I don't normally get scared in any horror games like Amnesia or Resident Evil or Outlast or whatever there is, but something about AW2 was just different.
    I guess what makes it a true horror game is that it feels like there are barely any NPC’s there to interact with and it’s quiet all the time with almost no background music! It feels like one of those eerie dreams where you wander alone somewhere
The jump scares are bs tbh! Just walking along then out of nowhere an image pops up with a scream. The cheapest way to get a jump ever! That said I am enjoying the game so far, but I've never been a fan of cheap jump scares. The atmosphere alone is spooky enough.
    I’m hoping they add an accessibility option to turn off those jump scares 😅
Amazing, I saw it on sale on Xbox yesterday and had my fingers crossed for it to come to PS too. Got the deluxe edition 👍👍👍
I was holding out for a physical version but it was on sale on Epic + Epic was giving out coupons for the holidays so I got it for $26, couldn't pass that up
    Oh damn, is that still going on? That's not bad.
So is driving but I'm sure you do that.
Same here. I’m sure AW2 is great but I can happily wait for a mega sale or a disc. 

Judging by the game’s awful sales figures it seems most people feel the same.
You love them?
It’s better, but it’s still not amazing. That was actually a minor point of frustration that I had, was that some enemies can move really fast but you can’t keep up. So there were a few times where I felt like I got bullshit deaths because enemies were basically just able to be cheap and kill me
Doubt. It was the 7th-most downloaded game on PS5 in Europe last month, and 12th in the US. Wherever that leaves it in overall sales, it certainly isn't anywhere outside the top 50.

I got the disc version but I can’t recall buying a disc in over a year now. I like using my PS5 as a blu ray player but I could care less about having physical games anymore. I do always like having the option but I think digital is more convenient. It’s unlikely I’ll come back to this system 10yrs from now.

Personally, I think you should always have the option so I think making the game digital only was a bad call.
[deleted]
    I won’t pay “60-70 dollar” larger studio experiences as digital only. I want a physical product, seems plenty enough agree. Each to their own, but I’d rather support physical formats.
Because it’s abnormal. You’re missing out on an amazing game because of the format it’s being offered in. Why do you only purchase physical copies?
    Because I don’t own the content, only a digital licence. As I said above, not for 60-70 dollar games. I prefer to own a physical copy.
    Another reason to buy physical copies over Digital is being able to resell the game after I'm done, well at least for me. For example, I only play the main story for most of the games I purchase since I only have maybe 1 hour to play at nights after the kids have gone to bed. Most games I put in about 20 hours total into them and then get to resell them for $35-40. So being able to play that for half or even less of the full retail is amazing.
        That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
I saw that. I think it's just a case by case basis thing.


Sony first party games are not necessarily representative of the entire industry. They tend to be sold in bundles prominently, for one thing.
The cost to produce physical copies of the game would not have netted a profit from those who’d buy it physically but refuse it digitally.
    Quite so. A physical release has its costs as well. All those copies need to be made and distributed. In this case we don't know for sure if it was up to Epic or Remedy that there was no physical release at launch. But Remedy's recent real experiences with physical copies are not great. AW Remastered sold less than they hoped for, and I understand there was a lot of physical copies left unsold (which means that they represented straight-up loss). And then with Control, the great majority of the sales was digital.

Based on those experiences, Remedy may well have looked at what a physical release would cost, by Epic's estimate, in addition to a digital release, and predict that it would not likely make them profit with the expected sales numbers.

Some might argue that with the current balance between the numbers of digital and physical copies sold in gaming, we are approaching an era where physical copies do not represent a money-making part of the business, but merely a courtesy to collectors and (the small minority of) players who prefer physical. Whether it makes a profit may be a toss-up, and some companies may practically only do it for marketing/visibility and image reasons.
        Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
    I’d love to see the numbers supporting that!
        This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
        I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
            Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
            I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
            Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
nobody is complaining though.
    That you’ve seen. I’ve seen a lot of it. People complaining that not enough people bought it or gave it a chance when there’s a line of people waiting to support it physically. Hopefully no complaints to come from Remedy though, they’ve made their bed.
        So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
        Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
            You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
        You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
            Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
        I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
        If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.
There haven’t been any complaints from them whatsoever. They are enjoying the success of their game and are actively supporting/updating it to make it an even more polished experience. Also, it might not be selling well compared to top-selling AAA games but it is doing great compared to other Remedy titles.
And without epics funding the game wouldn’t have been made at all, so either way there’s no physical release.
See my other comment replying to you. I don’t think you’re acknowledging the reality of game development. It would be great if we lived in a world where risky, costly games like AW2 can get the funding for physical releases. But that’s not the world we live in. And I don’t think it’s fair to hold that against the developer who made an incredible experience that flies in the face of what is “safe” and “profitable” in today’s gaming market. We need to support these types of games so that hopefully in the future they will be able to justify physical releases.
    I mean, they could partner with someone like Limited Run Games, who knows how to make profitable physical runs of potentially risky titles.
    Physical release would be a very tiny part of the budget of the games though. It doesn't cost as much as you imagine. Plenty of smaller games get a physical release too. 

Epic is publishing this, it's one of the biggest gaming companies there is, it's not a budget problem.
    I simply disagree with you. If games like Senua’s Sacrifice, Outlast, Life is Strange, and other similar titles can get physical releases, there’s no excuse for a huge production like Alan Wake. It doesn’t fly in the face of what is profitable, as the entire reason for digital only release is to increase profits at the expense of the consumer. If you’re fine with that, by all means rent all of your games for $60, $70+. To each their own!
        The games you listed are anywhere from 6 years to over a decade old. They reflect a completely different market and landscape for game development that is no longer relevant, especially post-pandemic. 

I’m not saying that the current state of things is better - in fact I would say it’s worse, and I agree that anti-consumer profit motives drive most decisions these days. But when a title like AW2 has the chance to shift the mainstream mindset about what types of games can succeed, and we choose to shun it due to capitalistic forces beyond Remedy’s control, we may be playing into those same forces’ hands and only exacerbating the problem.
So, just to be clear here, you'd rather that Remedy didn't make the game they wanted and ended up making something that potentially isn't even half as good, as long as it got a physical release?
Oh yeah, they should have picked one of those ten other companies offering to finance and publish the game.

Wait, there were none. Microsoft refused the game years ago and it's really not easy finding an investor for this kind of project.
just wanna say no matter if you’re right or wrong, the way ur presenting ur side of the matter is just so obnoxious that im going to return a physical copy of any random game I own so I can replace it with a digital copy, just to spite you.

Alan Wake 2 is as amazing as it is because of Remedy partnering with Epic and therefore getting a budget in order to make such a masterpiece. Sucks that there’s no physical copy but the game is worth every single penny.
    I don’t mind at all if you want to return your owned games for long term rentals! To each their own. Enjoy.
        get a job
            a job is how i afford a bunch of physical games lol
                people are just salty that you didn't play a game they like, it's common here
It's not about how much extra money they'll make, it's about supporting physical media over digital, which has had plenty of examples of companies just removing access to digitally bought content. With no physical release one day you'll end up not being able to play a game you paid money for, so digital only is extremely anti-consumer.
    We should expect companies to work for preserving their games so that people who bought them can play them in the future. But it would be reductionist to say that physical discs are the only side to the matter. The issue is institutional readiness to have it as a priority to look after the interests of your customers, it is not merely a matter of format.

Companies like Remedy have a vested interest in preserving the games they have made so people can keep playing them in the future as well. Remedy has no interest to remove access to its digital content. It would go against its very business model.

To give an example: with AW1 Remedy had issues with licensed music expiring, which led to the game being removed from different storefronts in 2017, something the company really didn't want to happen. With AW2, they solved the above problem by not having licensed music at all, but owning the rights to all the music in the game, made for the game. All the music is DMCA free, as well. This way, there are no issues related to external IP rights with this game to cause it availability issues down the line.

Remedy's future success is based on the Remedy Connected Universe they are building with the Control and Alan Wake franchises connected to each other in many ways. They want to keep selling their games, and for them to have a long tail. For this, they need to be continually available for both old and new players.

Given that today you'll need to download a lot of content for games even if they are on a physical disc, too, I would not say that physical is a silver bullet for game preservation in any case. Many games today and especially tomorrow are so big in file size that you couldn't comfortable fit them into one or even two discs, anyway. Many companies that have a "physical release" will still need you to download much or most of the content. And then there are the updates. Alan Wake 2 alone has received over a dozen downloadable updates over less than two months. Remedy has been pretty responsive with those updates, too, fixing issues specifically pointed out to them by the players, and so on.

We all share the same concerns, we want game companies to be responsive and fair to their players, customers and fans. So, let's take a broad perspective into these issues.
        This was a good comment
        Really well said, I hope people take this into consideration.

I didn’t say it was offensive, I was just commenting how hilariously outdated it was to think that digital only isn’t a real release.
No one is offended, its just weird to think that a game that was released digitally isn't a real release.
>Why would Remedy make that decision?

They didn't. Epic Games did.
Pure greed. They don’t care about consumers or game preservation at all, and that’s a problem that will only grow the more companies like theirs are supported, unfortunately.
    I find that so hard to believe though. The game just has so much heart. I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, it just doesn't track
        Unfortunately, they’ve admitted it’s to cut costs on their end (and increase their profits at consumer and game preservation’s expense, is how that translates). Some people will never care about physical media and will simply pay whatever the company charges for digital rentals, as that’s what “buying” digital is, and just accept if a company decides to cut off their access to the game entirely. It’s sad to say about a company that’s made a cool game, but it very much tracks.
            How can they be increasing their profits when the game is cheaper than any other AAA game out there? It’s $59.99 as opposed to $69.99 on console and cheaper on PC too. 

If they wanted greed and profit why did they price it lower?
                Probably because it’s a niche horror IP, wouldn’t sell at $69.99. No physical means they don’t have to pay the manufacturing costs.
    Idk why you're blaming Remedy when Epic Games is the one publishing the game and making that decision.
        Remedy agreed to the conditions of making and releasing their game under Epic Games, and there’s no shot they didn’t, at absolute bare minimum, know Epic Games wouldn’t release a physical copy. They’re absolutely at fault, along with Epic.
            So would you rather they didn’t agree to those terms, and the game didn’t get made at all? Remedy is a niche developer that makes niche games that take risks - chances are no other publisher was willing to fund development of the game at all, let alone a physical release.
                PS funded Returnal and Death Stranding, MS published Quantum Break. There are probably plenty of publishers who would’ve been willing to publish it.
                    Slightly different contexts to all of those games though, aren't there?

*Returnal* is made by a Sony first-party studio, so its going to get backing, and Sony tend to back their own studios. *Death Stranding* is made by probably one of, if not *the* most well-known game director on the planet - he's the very literal definition of "give the man what he wants", hence why he gets games made and even just partnered with Xbox for a new game.

Also, Microsoft published *Quantum Break* because, like Sony with *Returnal*, Remedy had a partnership agreement with them then. 

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
                    Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
            Supremely idiotic take.
                And you’re entitled to this nothing take lol
                    You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
                        You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
                I agree. That person would prefer Remedy just shut down when AW2 doesn't sell a million units rather than they take help from epic.
Yeah they have repeatedly said they don’t plan to release a physical edition. They said it was to help keep costs down. And they also claimed that having to have a download upon inserting the disc would hurt the experience…? But if you buy it digitally you also have to wait for a download.
    They are making excuses alan wake 1 remastered came out on disc for both xbox and playstation(both ps4 and ps5 discs),but they can't make physical copies of the sequel for some reason. They couldn't put the game on Steam becasue epic want an exclusive. Epic sabotaged the games sales hard there is no way they didn't realize this.
I think you don’t realize that a lot of people don’t ever replay their games, especially not ones from previous generations. Once a new console comes out, the old one goes into some box in the garage and is never touched again. I have a box full of Xbox 360 games that haven’t been touched in a decade. I have no interest in playing such old games. For most casual gamers like me, there’s no difference between physical and digital. Digital might be better since physical games could be damaged and take up space.
    Can I have your stuff then? They'll have a great home in my collection.
It’s so weird because this is something that hurts the entire gaming community. And yet everyone gets out their pitchforks to defend it. 

If this was an indie game I could understand the digital only release. But I think that sending AAA companies the message that we will essentially pay for long term rentals of their games is just mad.
Lol. I mean if you want to base your opinion about a game on some 5 minute gameplay video on youtube, sure. Your miss.
From what I understand, the narrative is very cerebral and risk-taking.
If the decision to make the release digital only was made by Remedy (and not Epic), I don't believe the resale of physical copies was really a major factor for them. I think they would have just thought that doing a physical release was likely to cost more than they would gain from it, cutting into their profits.

Based on their experience of Alan Wake Remastered and Control, they likely didn't expect to sell many physical copies anyway (which would have been the very issue, as making and distributing physical copies carries a certain additional price anyway even if sales are small).
I tell people to go watch a twenty minute you tube video explaining AW1, and control/AW tie in. An hour of homework and you can be balls deep in AW2 when you play it.
    Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
        Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.

Thanks:)
        Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
Ok but AW1 is really, really hard to play. I wanted to like it but I just couldn’t bear running round in identical forests for that many hours
    Seriously
I can definitely confirm that the game is highly appealing to me but that I put it off my list for not getting a physical release.
At a time where the question of media conservation is more discussed than ever, I find it a really crazy move.

There is no way I'm spending 50$ on a game that is not mine, I'll either spend 60$ on a physical copy, or get it on sale for 15$ in a year or two.

That's just sad cause I'm sure they deserved more sales, but hell I'm already pissed when an indie is digital only, but an AAA ? 

Same goes for Baldurs gate tbh, Larian did release both Divinity games on physical, but not for their record-breaking GOTY ?

That's not the industry I want, and I'm not paying for that. Nobody should tbh, I know Remedy doesn't have infinite budget but we have to realize digital games are a scam, you do not own anything, you just rent it for an unlimited time.
I feel like paying 80$ for a game is more debated than paying 60$ for a rent that looks like a purchase, and I don't understand it :)
    Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
But it's a sequel to an extremely story-focused game, which is different than someone picking up the next Call of Duty or whatever. Feeling like you need to play a 15-year-old game to understand the new one is absolutely a barrier for a lot of people, fair or not.
Plenty of sequels are pretty easy to pick up and play with no context, and this is exactly the reason. Asking people to go play a damn near 15 year old game to get up to speed is just not gonna workout financially. Red Dead 2 was also a sequel to an older game, but there was no real need to go play the first one.
I didn’t really like Control, enjoying AW1 so far though! Thanks :)
    I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
        U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
            Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
            I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
        Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
        I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
        I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
        Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
            I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
            Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
                I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
            I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
        You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
        You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
Is control part of the alan universe??
    Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
I personally liked the enemies that just disappear brought a lot of tension, but generally agree the combat in general is a bit more chaotic. I think it's to do with the closer camera, especially in the forest where it can get disorientating. It was a bit goofy, but having the camera zoom in on new enemies spawning in in AW1 I started to miss haha.
I haven't played 2, so can't compare, but 1 had what, 2 "bossfights"? namely, >!the bulldozer and the tornado.!<
I do remember them. They weren’t good but nowhere near the level frustration AW2 bosses have caused me
100%. They are talking shite. They thought that people buying disc and reselling would hurt their bottom line so they went digital only.  At this point I put my money back in my wallet out of principal… 👍🏻
    Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
Supposedly Epic does not have a physical game infrastructure in place, so I could see Epic not letting them do a disc version
Yea casual gamers are more likely to scroll the digital stores than randomly browse a game store.
Because they are? John Gamer is much more likely to come across the game if it's on target shelves or whatever. Lot less visual competition and a lot more likely to just happen to be at a store with it. 

 The only way someone is coming across Alan Wake 2 casually is if they happen to be browsing the store and see among the thousands of games already there. It's already pretty buried
Well companies are not lining up to publish a sequel to alan wake which was financially a flop, remedy was lucky to even have epic publishing it for them. Why do you think 505 didn’t publish this while the did for control? They knew alan wake 2 wouldn’t sell well, while control which is an action game to its core will sell more.
Theyve tried to make the game for 8 years with different publishers and Epic was the only company that would let them (a) make it and (b) make it the way remedy wanted to make it
> They could have had another company publish it

You don't know how video game publishing and development works.
I guess what makes it a true horror game is that it feels like there are barely any NPC’s there to interact with and it’s quiet all the time with almost no background music! It feels like one of those eerie dreams where you wander alone somewhere
I’m hoping they add an accessibility option to turn off those jump scares 😅
Oh damn, is that still going on? That's not bad.
I won’t pay “60-70 dollar” larger studio experiences as digital only. I want a physical product, seems plenty enough agree. Each to their own, but I’d rather support physical formats.
Because I don’t own the content, only a digital licence. As I said above, not for 60-70 dollar games. I prefer to own a physical copy.
Another reason to buy physical copies over Digital is being able to resell the game after I'm done, well at least for me. For example, I only play the main story for most of the games I purchase since I only have maybe 1 hour to play at nights after the kids have gone to bed. Most games I put in about 20 hours total into them and then get to resell them for $35-40. So being able to play that for half or even less of the full retail is amazing.
    That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
Quite so. A physical release has its costs as well. All those copies need to be made and distributed. In this case we don't know for sure if it was up to Epic or Remedy that there was no physical release at launch. But Remedy's recent real experiences with physical copies are not great. AW Remastered sold less than they hoped for, and I understand there was a lot of physical copies left unsold (which means that they represented straight-up loss). And then with Control, the great majority of the sales was digital.

Based on those experiences, Remedy may well have looked at what a physical release would cost, by Epic's estimate, in addition to a digital release, and predict that it would not likely make them profit with the expected sales numbers.

Some might argue that with the current balance between the numbers of digital and physical copies sold in gaming, we are approaching an era where physical copies do not represent a money-making part of the business, but merely a courtesy to collectors and (the small minority of) players who prefer physical. Whether it makes a profit may be a toss-up, and some companies may practically only do it for marketing/visibility and image reasons.
    Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
I’d love to see the numbers supporting that!
    This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
    I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
        Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
        I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
        Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
That you’ve seen. I’ve seen a lot of it. People complaining that not enough people bought it or gave it a chance when there’s a line of people waiting to support it physically. Hopefully no complaints to come from Remedy though, they’ve made their bed.
    So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
    Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
        You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
    You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
        Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
    I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
    If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.

If you’re fine with that, by all means rent all of your games for $60, $70+. To each their own!

Companies like Remedy have a vested interest in preserving the games they have made so people can keep playing them in the future as well. Remedy has no interest to remove access to its digital content. It would go against its very business model.

To give an example: with AW1 Remedy had issues with licensed music expiring, which led to the game being removed from different storefronts in 2017, something the company really didn't want to happen. With AW2, they solved the above problem by not having licensed music at all, but owning the rights to all the music in the game, made for the game. All the music is DMCA free, as well. This way, there are no issues related to external IP rights with this game to cause it availability issues down the line.

Remedy's future success is based on the Remedy Connected Universe they are building with the Control and Alan Wake franchises connected to each other in many ways. They want to keep selling their games, and for them to have a long tail. For this, they need to be continually available for both old and new players.

Given that today you'll need to download a lot of content for games even if they are on a physical disc, too, I would not say that physical is a silver bullet for game preservation in any case. Many games today and especially tomorrow are so big in file size that you couldn't comfortable fit them into one or even two discs, anyway. Many companies that have a "physical release" will still need you to download much or most of the content. And then there are the updates. Alan Wake 2 alone has received over a dozen downloadable updates over less than two months. Remedy has been pretty responsive with those updates, too, fixing issues specifically pointed out to them by the players, and so on.

We all share the same concerns, we want game companies to be responsive and fair to their players, customers and fans. So, let's take a broad perspective into these issues.
    This was a good comment
    Really well said, I hope people take this into consideration.

I find that so hard to believe though. The game just has so much heart. I'm not suggesting that you are wrong, it just doesn't track
    Unfortunately, they’ve admitted it’s to cut costs on their end (and increase their profits at consumer and game preservation’s expense, is how that translates). Some people will never care about physical media and will simply pay whatever the company charges for digital rentals, as that’s what “buying” digital is, and just accept if a company decides to cut off their access to the game entirely. It’s sad to say about a company that’s made a cool game, but it very much tracks.
        How can they be increasing their profits when the game is cheaper than any other AAA game out there? It’s $59.99 as opposed to $69.99 on console and cheaper on PC too. 

If they wanted greed and profit why did they price it lower?
            Probably because it’s a niche horror IP, wouldn’t sell at $69.99. No physical means they don’t have to pay the manufacturing costs.
Idk why you're blaming Remedy when Epic Games is the one publishing the game and making that decision.
    Remedy agreed to the conditions of making and releasing their game under Epic Games, and there’s no shot they didn’t, at absolute bare minimum, know Epic Games wouldn’t release a physical copy. They’re absolutely at fault, along with Epic.
        So would you rather they didn’t agree to those terms, and the game didn’t get made at all? Remedy is a niche developer that makes niche games that take risks - chances are no other publisher was willing to fund development of the game at all, let alone a physical release.
            PS funded Returnal and Death Stranding, MS published Quantum Break. There are probably plenty of publishers who would’ve been willing to publish it.
                Slightly different contexts to all of those games though, aren't there?

*Returnal* is made by a Sony first-party studio, so its going to get backing, and Sony tend to back their own studios. *Death Stranding* is made by probably one of, if not *the* most well-known game director on the planet - he's the very literal definition of "give the man what he wants", hence why he gets games made and even just partnered with Xbox for a new game.

Also, Microsoft published *Quantum Break* because, like Sony with *Returnal*, Remedy had a partnership agreement with them then. 

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
                Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
        Supremely idiotic take.
            And you’re entitled to this nothing take lol
                You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
                    You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
            I agree. That person would prefer Remedy just shut down when AW2 doesn't sell a million units rather than they take help from epic.
They are making excuses alan wake 1 remastered came out on disc for both xbox and playstation(both ps4 and ps5 discs),but they can't make physical copies of the sequel for some reason. They couldn't put the game on Steam becasue epic want an exclusive. Epic sabotaged the games sales hard there is no way they didn't realize this.
Can I have your stuff then? They'll have a great home in my collection.
Watching Sam Lake's [IGN recap of the Alan Wake story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzocqRZzyoI) in about 15 minutes is a good suggestion. He knows his (own) stuff, and manages to make the story sound surprisingly straightforward.
    Ohh I might just watch this and then move on to AW2. Got through Chapter 2. Was fun for a little bit, but now the gameplay just seems like filler.

Thanks:)
    Well, I've been wondering about starting out with AW but half way through that Sam Lake video I was bored I'm afraid. Doesn't sound like it's a game for me.
Seriously
Yeah, preservation is going to be a big issue moving forward, especially on consoles, unless something changes and it's a shame considering sales of physical versions are still prevalent. It's not really going out of fashion as publishers are trying to convince us. 

The only glimmer of hope is that Larian will release 2 batches of physical editions of BG3, but they will not go to retail and are only available from their merch store. It ends up being more expensive than the digital, but at least it exists. 

I doubt this will happen with Alan Wake 2 though, but I hope I'll be proven wrong in the upcoming months...maybe Remedy changes its mind.
I'm glad I'm not the only one. Control was an absolute slog, which I found so surprising as the world's biggest Alan Wake fan.
    U and me and the polar opposite loved Control gameplay but hate Alan wake 1 gameplay💀
        Same. Loved control and having a rough time pushing through AW1 remastered.
        I agree, there's something off about AW1 controls.
    Playing Control last brought the whole thing together for me. After Alan Wake 2 I went back to Control (about 5 hours playtime prior, if even that lol). Going in and just taking in the world and the Oldest House as their own characters vastly improved the experience. I also learned to ignore the really boring "alerts" that would send you somewhere random to kill generic fodder. Main character still falls pretty flat though. 

There was this really cool scene I found though. You can talk to the main characters brother at a certain point and he starts talking about Mr. Door from AW 2
    I bought Alan Wake Remastered when it released and dropped it pretty early on because to me it felt like such a slog compared to Control
    I combatvwas boring and the map was confusing. The world was much cooler than the actual story.
    Control was awful. Tried to like it. Brought nothing new to the table. Guns and combat were boring and repetitive
        I thought Control was awesome and gunplay and combat of Control Ultimate Edition are in my opinion best in class. 

Regardless, playing Alan Wake Remastered and Control and the AWE expansion first really helps with enjoying and especially understanding Alan Wake 2 more.
        Probably didn't get far in the game. Once you level up enough you're pretty much Neo in the Matrix.

I'm personally waiting to replay it before I buy A W2 but been busy with other games.
            I played quite a few hours. Probably like 10? The whole lifting of objects and throwing them thing was no different than half-life 2 20 years ago. Idk I just found it very uninspiring mechanics wise. I enjoyed the story though
        I thought the same, playing first few hours. But later when abilities unlocked it clicked with me, finished main story and AWE of normal difficulty, but assisted difficulty on AWE boss (insane difficulty spike) and on other dlc.
    You’re not alone. I really really couldn’t get into it. But so far I am enjoying Allan Wake 2
    You’re me!  I loved AW 1 and 2, just couldn’t get into Control.
Yes same universe, the Bureau of Control is poking around in Alan Wake 2.
Yeah if it was a physical I wouldn't mind paying full price. I want to play the game. But for a big developer to not put it on disc because they want to line their pockets, I'll wait until they either DO drop a physical or it's $20 or less.
That makes sense, I mentioned that being a reason in my other comment.
Right. They also said they wanted to avoid additional risk with delaying the launch because with physical they have to have it ready even earlier (needs to be on the disk and packaged to distributors which adds additional weeks). It's also quite possible they had a hard deadline for releasing before the holiday and an additional risk of delay could go into the decision to not go physical.
This is for Lords of the Fallen but that game cost [$5 million to produce physical copies](https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/10/24/lords-of-the-fallen-budget-66-million-most-expensive-ci-games) 

Not a clean conparison of course since they’re a much smaller game so price per unit is likely much higher than what Remedy would have got, but it’s safe to say I think that producing physical discs costs millions to do, stands to reason an independent would want to cut those costs to create better profit margins
I mean there’s gotta be max 12 people who would deny themselves a game just because they don’t have a piece of pollution causing plastic to look at.
    Loads of people like to have a game they can then lend or sell after they’re done and have a good wad to put towards their next game. It’s extremely cost effective over buying digital which are more expensive to begin with too.
    I'm not working right now and never replay games once I'm done with them. Buying a digital game at £50 that I'll play for 20 hours, not touch again and can't be sold is a big no for me.

I'd rather pay £60 for a physical copy but then be able to sell in a month for £45. Doing this means I can afford to play way more games than just chucking out £50-60 for digital versions of games I may not like. 

And given all the recent bad press about access to digital content, I'm not comfortable getting pushed into this.
    Because there haven't been so many examples of games getting pulled or altered when licensing rights or other issues arise. Easy example is the GTA games, yes you can buy them on any digital marketplace but a bunch of the original music tracks had to be taken out due to licensing.
So you moved from "Remedy shouldn't complain about reduced sales" to "well they aren't complaining... but if they hypothetically did, it'd be bad". I don't understand getting uppity about a hypothetical situation that didn't even happen just because your minority preference in release format wasn't catered to.
Lol what is wrong with you. No one from Remedy is complaining. This post is just by a fan who is recommending the game.  The only reason the game exists is because Epic funded them, and they imposed the digital only restriction. 


Please don't buy the game, no one from the community is missing you.
    You don’t have to beg me not to buy the game, it was already decided lol
You and the 5 other people wanting a physical copy wasn't going to change the narrative seeing how most of their sales have been digital as pointed above.

If anything hurt them it probably was going Epic exclusive but I suspect that deal probably allowed them to recoup most if not all development costs.
    Epic paid for the game's development and marketing in full. Thus, Remedy took no risks in making this game - they can't make a real loss with AW2. The company is very careful and conservative with its finances. Note, though, that Remedy apparently got no additional money from Epic for making the game.

The deal with Epic means that Remedy will only get any real income from the game if it sells reasonably well, as Epic's costs need to be recouped before Remedy sees a dime of profit. This is why I am personally hoping that the game sells well. Even some tens of millions of actual income would help Remedy go a long way with their upcoming projects, and just keeping the company afloat.
I want physical media to die just because of these obnoxious comments.
If there’s been a lot of it then link some articles discussing it. You’re one of the first I’ve ever seen to demand a physical version before buying. They already reported over 90% of Control’s sales were digital so it makes sense to trend that way for them.
The games you listed are anywhere from 6 years to over a decade old. They reflect a completely different market and landscape for game development that is no longer relevant, especially post-pandemic. 

I’m not saying that the current state of things is better - in fact I would say it’s worse, and I agree that anti-consumer profit motives drive most decisions these days. But when a title like AW2 has the chance to shift the mainstream mindset about what types of games can succeed, and we choose to shun it due to capitalistic forces beyond Remedy’s control, we may be playing into those same forces’ hands and only exacerbating the problem.
get a job
    a job is how i afford a bunch of physical games lol
        people are just salty that you didn't play a game they like, it's common here

Also, which you seem to have conveniently missed out of your examples, *Quantum Break* was made because Microsoft actively refused to make *Alan Wake II*. 

Genuinely think about it for more than one second here: Its a game being made by a developer who are renowned for making weird shit and who very rarely have amazing sales records. Its a sequel to a cult-classic game but one that isn't particularly popular or all that well-known. Its releasing in the same year as *Spider-Man 2*, *Starfield*, *Baldur's Gate* and both the *Resident Evil 4* remake and the *Dead Space* remake. It will have extremely expensive live action video production as well as unique music recorded specifically for the game. Its going to have an unbelievably high level of production in terms of graphics and audio and has award-winning actors and actresses in it. Exactly how many people are taking the plunge on that?

Also, going exclusive with Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft suddenly means that it becomes exclusive to that platform, and that instantly shaves off a major percentage of your sales. 

Its very clear that the game was only ever going to get a physical release, because it allows Epic to make more money on the game through their (shitty) online game store, hence why they asked for it to remain digital only.
Wrong. They had real trouble finding one actually. Just be glad the game exists.

Microsoft is one of the companies we KNOW were offered to publish Alan but refused it.

Oh and I'm sure Remedy have the same bargaining power as HIDEO FUCKING KOJIMA.
You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how this shit even works at all.
    You’re allowed that opinion, funny I have the same of you!
