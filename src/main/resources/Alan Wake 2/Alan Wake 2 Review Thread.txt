**[Atomix](https://opencritic.com/outlet/458/atomix)** - [Alexis Patiño](https://opencritic.com/critic/9800/alexis-pati-o) - *Spanish* - [87 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-alan-wake-ii/)

>Alan Wake II is the sequel we were waiting for. Unfortunately, it took thirteen years to find out what happened next in this story. The technological advancement is impressive, the graphics, the music, and the sound are stunning, and it couldn't have been released in a better season.

**[Attack of the Fanboy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/116/attack-of-the-fanboy)** - [J.R. Waugh](https://opencritic.com/critic/9316/j-r-waugh) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-it-is-happening-again/)

>Everything, down to the puzzles, feels appropriately placed. That's before even acknowledging the gorgeous cast of actors involved in the project and the truly compelling story that unfolds for Alan as well as Saga, who each gain an interesting presence in Bright Falls and the world beyond. It doesn't feel like the most satisfying combat, and it's rather easy to beat, but this is also exactly what I wanted and more from an Alan Wake sequel. It is also the best original horror game of 2023 by a wide margin, and a damn fine video game overall.

>Alan Wake 2 proves to be worth the wait. This sequel is an upgrade in nearly every way, and while player influence on the story can feel limited at times, the engaging narrative more than compensates. From the challenging, tense combat to the excellent environmental storytelling, Alan Wake 2 will have no trouble hooking players from start to finish.

>Even though it’s been 13 years since Alan Wake, Remedy Entertainment returns to Bright Falls with a powerful force. The story is fantastic, the characters are phenomenal, and the story is frightening, comical, creepy, heartwarming, and often tragic; I couldn’t put it down and found it difficult to stop playing. The macabre nature of Alan Wake 2 is phenomenal, and I loved every second.

>It was an absolute pleasure to rejoin Alan in Alan Wake 2 and to see Saga traverse through this unreal journey. It’s one I’m going to fondly remember for a long time. Remedy gave me the best gift right before Halloween.

>Alan Wake 2 almost feels mad in its approach, with an overwhelming array of threads in the tale that threaten to collapse under pressure at any moment. Yet with clear and incisive logic, matched with a devotion to delightful absurdity, the team at Remedy has managed to craft a breathtaking story – one that plays out in clever, fascinating, and horrifying ways.

>Alan Wake 2 is a fantastic horror game with some excellent atmosphere and an incredibly interesting story. While it does make use of jump scares that feel downright unnecessary, thankfully, the other horror aspects of the game are more than up to the task of creeping you out. Just make sure that you at least read up on the plot synopsis of the original Alan Wake before jumping in.

**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [David Burdette](https://opencritic.com/critic/7590/david-burdette) - [90 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-page-worth-turning/)

>There is nothing you'll play this year like Alan Wake 2. The choice of two protagonists works wonderfully, with an interwoven plot that is Remedy at their best. I love the twists and turns it takes, with an incredible atmosphere set that boosts everything it touches, including the combat. Alan Wake 2 is breathtaking both visually and audibly, whether in Bright Falls or The Dark Place. Our departure thirteen years ago is long forgotten; Alan Wake's return is a triumph.

-------------

**[Geek Culture](https://opencritic.com/outlet/701/geek-culture)** - [Jake Su](https://opencritic.com/critic/6215/jake-su) - [7.6 / 10](https://geekculture.co/geek-review-alan-wake-2)

>The 20-odd hours we spent in Alan Wake 2 left us in a strange place. While its graphical and audio prowess are clear to see, the gameplay, and more crucially, the story, are going to have their merits hotly debated and discussed, and that’s not even including the technical shortcomings. For what it’s worth, we enjoyed this haunted journey through both darkness and light, but for hardcore fans and even newcomers, this sequel might not be an instant classic right away.

-------------

**[Glitched Africa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/687/glitched-africa)** - [Marco Cocomello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2466/marco-cocomello) - [8 / 10](https://www.glitched.africa/alan-wake-2-review/)

>Alan Wake 2 is a visual and technical showcase that brings some fresh ideas and mechanics to the series. Some evolve into fun activities while others get repetitive. The game is also marred by some awkward live-action sequences that feel out of place. But there's no doubt a captivating horror to enjoy under the surface. It is the strangest game you'll play this year in all the best ways.

>Alan Wake 2 is a spectacular sequel that was more than worth the wait, with a story that simply has to be experienced to be believed.

-------------

**[Guardian](https://opencritic.com/outlet/27/guardian)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/oct/26/alan-wake-2-review-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-remedy-entertainmentepic-games-27-october)

>Alan Wake 2 is the perfect release for Halloween as it presents a psychological horror movie into video game format.

>Alan Wake 2 is a brilliant survival horror that combines the surrealism of Twin Peaks, the investigations of True Detective and the paranormal elements of the SCP Foundation, but it is also the new graphical ceiling of the generation. And above all, it's a Remedy game; and it is glorious.

-------------

**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Tristan Ogilvie](https://opencritic.com/critic/236/tristan-ogilvie) - [9 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review)

>Alan Wake II is a superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison.

-------------

**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.8 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=289790)

>Remedy's trademark intricate narrative has evolved even further, combining with survival horror-style action to deliver a more immersive experience than ever before. In particular, the expanded lore developed over the past 13 years adds a unique appeal. However, issues with subtitles and bugs seems to be promptly addressed post-launch, and I have high hopes for improvements in this regard.

>A peculiar sequel that at times seems to be purposefully undermining the best elements of the original, but it still gets just enough right to please both existing fans and potential newcomers.

**[Multiplayer First](https://opencritic.com/outlet/826/multiplayer-first)** - [Vitor Braz](https://opencritic.com/critic/9626/vitor-braz) - [9.5 / 10](https://mp1st.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-writing-a-survival-horror-masterpiece)

>With a playtime that deserves all praise, easily clocking in at over 20 hours if you don’t rush through it, Alan Wake 2 is absolutely worth the time and money. It’s a remarkable achievement that is meant to be both devoured and enjoyed slowly, despite what this sounds like, plunging into all the details, exploring every beat of the locations without rushing through the main goals, as to appreciate the colossal work that has gone into it. This is a terrific television series gone videogame, with a sophisticated plot that grips every fan of survival horror and never lets go. The fantastic looks help, but the perfect pacing and intriguing mysteries keep you going despite some frustration that may arise from the Angel Lamp puzzles.
>
>It’s one of the greatest survival horror games ever made, this shouldn’t be skipped. A fantastic example of how different types of media can crossover and create a very special outcome, it was absolutely worth the wait for Alan Wake to come up with a plan to escape the Dark Place and write an outstanding story about it for us to read, watch, play, and above all, enjoy.

>13 years since its predecessor, Alan Wake 2 was absolutely worth the wait. Improving on the original in every way, with Remedy embracing their inspirations, and honing their craft, Alan Wake 2 is a surrealist horror masterpiece.

>While I'm sure there were countless drafts and edits throughout the journey to this point, this Alan Wake II is proof that great things come to those who wait. Like breaking through after a thirteen year stretch of writer's block, I can only imagine the sense of relief in letting this monster of a game loose.

-------------

**[Rectify Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/355/rectify-gaming)** - Henry - [9.5 / 10](https://rectifygaming.com/review-alan-wake-2)

>Game design is an art and Remedy Entertainment have created something of a masterpiece with Alan Wake 2. The four long years of development have paid off, and the passion and love from the studio truly speaks for itself. From the incredible worldbuilding and interconnected narratives to the elevated survival horror and detective case solving, Alan Wake 2 is a unique experience that you don’t want to miss.

>Alan Wake 2 is a worthy successor to the original. However, it does come with some flaws that may grate older fans. This is the horror genre we've always thought Alan Wake could be if it shed some of its more action elements. After witnessing its gripping horror firsthand, it makes me feel like Alan Wake, too.

>Alan Wake 2 takes you to the quiet locales of Washington and the streets of New York, places where darkness has taken root. Along the way, you can expect a tense and foreboding atmosphere, frantic action, and a memorable, mesmerizing romp. Sadly, there were several glaring issues that became prevalent during the course of this review.

>This feels like the game this developer has wanted to make for years, unrestrained in the best possible way as it goes hard on layered storytelling, flawed yet fascinating heroes and a series which for over a decade now has been harbouring untold potential.

>Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror. Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what's next.

>Massively confident, often groundbreaking, and full of surprises, Alan Wake 2 is Remedy at its very best. The shooting isn't stellar, but Alan Wake 2 is otherwise a horror thriller that shouldn't be missed.

>With its excellent trippy horror story, memorable characters, amazing atmosphere, and some of the best visuals in gaming to date, Alan Wake II is a game like few others and Remedy Entertainment's best. It took 13 years for the acclaimed writer to come back, but the long wait was worth it. We could have hardly wished for a better sequel, despite the derivative survival horror gameplay holding the experience back a bit.

>Remedy Entertainment crafts a suspenseful journey full of twists, examining its title character in spades. It's a messy, imperfect narrative that doesn't even try to wrap up every plot thread, but delivers a raw, emotional ride. Solid third-person survival horror-gameplay helps carry that journey outside of a handful of technical issues.

IGN's tristian oglive rated it 9/10.

For reference, he rated other survival horrors as such

Calisto Protocol: 7/10

Dead Space Remake: 9/10

RE4 Remake: 10/10

In the summary, it seems the deducted point was due a superfluous skill-upgrade system, and the story had one or two cliches too many. Not bad downsides honestly.
    Nothing is a cliché when it's happening to you. - Max Payne
        God I fucking love Max Payne
            I’d love a packaged re-release of all 3 games.
                You're in luck, at least for the first two. [Remedy is remaking both of them as one game](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-enters-agreement-with-rockstar-games-for-new-max-payne-12-project/).
                    Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
                        Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
                            Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
                                Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
                                It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                                    Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
                            On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.
                                MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
                            Its more about the availability. For people that aren't pc gamers its not very accessible for a lot of us.
                        I played through all three games on my Steam Deck a while back. Mac Payne 3 still holds up really, really well.
                        >I hope something gets done with 3

I'm hoping the stars will align and they'll somehow get the opportunity to make the third game they intended to make as they clearly had ideas to continue the story that were never realized.
                        Gunplay of Maxpayne 3 with hand to hand combat of the Warriers  for GTA6 But The Main Thing is the open World which is most important.
                    Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Shit I'm excited about this.
                    And then after Remedy makes a full remake of both games for modern consoles, Rockstar will drop a PS4 and XBOX port of Max Payne 3 without any changes (60$ of course)
            So does Remedy and Alan Wake
            What a good fucking series of fucking games. FUCK
            I still play them from time to time. Was one of the first games I got when I got my first non-crazy-outdated laptop and could actually play 3D games, played the hell out of one and two (the third hadn't been developed/released at that time). Just really solid gameplay with a lot of character IMO.
        [What a stupid fucking quote](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GD5mzJ7UrhA)
            Thats amazing lol. Fits right in with some of the meta stuff
        Also Remedy, can't wait for the Max Payne remake.
        Hell yeah pimp
    I felt like his review was somewhat spoiler heavy, at least in regards to the opening hours. It ruined some moments I might have otherwise found surprising. 

Wouldn't recommend watching it if that matters to you.
        Thanks for the heads up! Pre-ordered it just now based on reviews. 14 hours until play time. Did not need spoilers.
        IGN reviews are always spoiler heavy and without warning, honestly I completely avoid them at this point.
    Of all the ways I thought the original Alan Wake could be improved upon a skill upgrade system wasn't one of them. Odd choice to add one in.
        Yeah and honestly the worst part about Control for me was the upgrade system. It felt completely unnecessary and weird in a story-based game. Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities? It just felt like the game should have had you unlock them alongside the story, or just finding certain items gave you the ability, or gave you points to spend on an ability of your choosing. The weapon crafting was nonsense.
            I was mostly okay with the leveling system because it allowed you to do different stuff early on. Sure, by the time you were done with the game, you could unlock almost everything, but in the first half, putting points into flying vs. telekinesis vs. shields made the combat much different in repeat playthroughs.

But man, those weapon upgrades! There were what, five different Service Pistol modes, with 2 or 3 upgrade slots each? And then you'd get like a dozen upgrades for each mode, with no good way of sorting through them. Such a frustrating UI.
                And the upgrades have 6 levels and the game never stops giving you weak lvl 1 upgrades and you can only hold 24 so you have to clear them out. Control is one of my favorite games ever but this part sucks
                Yeah sorry I meant the gun upgrades. The skill upgrade system was fine. The gun upgrade/crafting system is insanely convoluted for no reason.

I kind of assumed there was DLC or a cash shop to make you pay for upgrade components but no... the system is just complicated for no reason at all.
            Here are the only useful mods - damage, headshot damage, 100% ammo refund on hit, instant sniper shot recharge. That's it, maybe damage after kill for someone really good. It's so poorly thought out. I wish the mods were also more interesting than you can make the recoil less annoying (we made it annoying by default).
                Oh yeah that was the other thing, 80% of the mods are worthless and/or boring so grinding through hundreds of them gets tiring.
            Yeah.. the skill tree is fine... the weapon/personal mod system is the only, frankly, terrible part of an amazing game. 

It goes against the pace of the game, it's mostly meaningless +X% upgrades, it takes a while for you to open more slots to put them in and the worst part is the small inventory. 

There's some good ones and they allow for flexible builds, that likely 99% of players will never use, but the implementation sucks.

I spent way too much time going through my inventory sorting through those mods deciding what to throw away so I could pick another one.

If they went to a separate stash at the hub, and or/you could combine the ones you collect to level them up it would be better. But just an infinite inventory would fix it, imo.
            > Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities?

i used a trainer to get all the abilities and realized it's not even worth it. even the highest levelled versions of most of the crafted items give you paltry single digit boosts.  
most pointless aspect of control imo
        Guessing it was a publisher note.  Some MBA who failed upwards came in and said "you know these other games have skill systems.  Our focus groups say people love those.  I want you to add one here."
        Really tired of these kind of systems. My brain always just assumes I picked the wrong thing and I'm missing out.
    Wow that's a generous 7 for Callisto. Although, granted, the game somehow managed the incredibly rare feat of being made *worse* by its DLC.
        [deleted]
            Non-spoiler version: The main game ends on a sudden cliff hanger with a bunch of plot threads left open. The DLC resolves the cliff hanger in the most unsatisfying way possible while refusing to resolve or progress anything else about the plot.

Spoiler version: >!At the end of the main game, the space base is about to explode, the main character has one last chance to escape, but he is suddenly attacked. Cut to black.!<

>!In the DLC the main character fights his way out of the base and finally escapes. Except, no, that's a lie, he was actually fatally mutilated at the end of the main game and the DLC is just his dying hallucinations. He's dead, everything blows up, the end.!<
                 They actually changed the DLC to this because the game performed so poorly. Even Glen Schofield left the studio after how bad it did. Which is a shame because I think if they added in enemy variety, tightened up the storytelling, and made the melee combat better it could have been a great franchise. The game was one of the most beautiful to come out, too bad that’s where all the money went.
                    They should've just dumped the whole melee combat system focus and focused more on a variety of ranged weapons with the melee acting as an emergency fall back. I get why they did it like this, to force proximity to the enemies to add tension, but it just didn't work out. 

In trying to not be like dead space, the game that was designed to be a spiritual successor managed to fail in both departments.
                        I don't mind the focus on melee but the game just feels bad to play in general. I genuinely like most other things about it but man it's some awkward gameplay.
                    It's a very pretty game but one big issue I have with the game that is a core aspect of it that you didn't mention is the level design. It's narrow corridor after narrow corridor. After playing the Dead Space remake, I just can't continue on with such a narrow linear level design.
                Wow. Im glad I didnt finish it despite being free on PSN.

The whole constant melee dodging is a terrible mechanic. Not sure how anyone thought that would be enjoyable the 10th or hundredth time
                    It could've been a good system if it wasn't so janky.
            Shat on the story and basically took a vague ending of the main game into a definitive "no sequel even possible with these characters" ending
        The opencritic score for Callisto Protocol is 67, so IGN is right in line with the average critic score (that’s not a good or bad thing per se). And your opinion is just one opinion. I’d say a 7/10 is pretty fair because there were things I liked about the game.
            It's funny that when I read 67 I think "oof" but I see 6.7 I think eh ok not the worst game ever.
            I really disliked it, but would also give it a 6. So a 6-7 is pretty in line of what it should be rated
        Callisto had redeeming elements to it. I personally enjoyed it until I got burnt out on the combat 70% through. 

Definitely not a perfect game though.
        Hugely disagree, Callisto was flawed but a good time nonetheless. It had an underdeveloped plot and some irritating design decisions like the limited inventory and weirdly placed checkpoints, but the visuals, sound design and atmosphere were absolutely top tier. Add in some crunchy combat and some great performances from its cast and it was a fun ride. I'd give it an 8/10. While I agree the DLC's ending is an anticlimax (though I'm not sure what else they could have done to wrap up the story given they definitely weren't going to do a sequel), I actually thought the DLC overall was a big improvement on the main game. It added more gameplay variety and better pacing with the addition of puzzles, cool enemy types and some new weapons, plus an absolutely killer final boss. I think it really proved Callisto could be great if Striking Distance were given another chance. Real shame they won't.

        Quantum Break too.
        They're even more significant in Alan Wake. Revolving around a writer, cliches are one of the tools they will often use to drive the story. The original game was also laden with them, especially in cutscenes, where Alan would reach a point of safety but then suddenly something completely random would throw him out right back into the fray. Like when he's driving a car and all of a sudden a rockslide happens and throws him off the road. There's also a bit where you get on a helicopter after defending it from shadow people, and then soon after you take off you get thrown right back out of it for no real good reason.
            People may criticize the uses of cliches in Alan Wake, but at the very least it's clever how they wrote in a loophole to let them freely use cliches.

It isn't just that he's a writer, he's a writer who isn't used to writing horror at all (and his first attempt was in a fugue state while an evil darkness did the editing)
        Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing.  They can get tiring.  And using them to great effect in one game, doesn't presuppose you'll always use them to that same great effect all the time.
            > Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing. They can get tiring. 

So far Remedy has proven to be able to handle them pretty well though.
    Really cool service you're providing here. Knowing how a reviewer ticks (and by that I do mean *reviewer* and not *platform that hosts reviews from all kinds of reviewers*) is pretty much essential to actually being able to build your own verdict based on the opinion of someone else.
Wow! I did not expect the reviews to be this good.
Just finished Remastered with both dlcs yesterday to refresh my mind and watched a summary of American nightmare and AWE as I can't remember all of both anymore.

Can't wait!
    What's AWE?
        A dlc for control which connects control with Alan wake
            Not only does it connect them, but the entire DLC is about Alan Wake and Bright Falls.  Definitely worth a quick playthrough before AW2, I think.
            Thanks
        Altered World Event
DAMN. Not that many reviews yet but the ~~93 average~~ now ~~92~~ 90 -  is way higher than I was expecting. Control landed at an 83 and I LOVED it. I wasn't planning on picking this up on launch but I may have to reprioritize now. Looks like a real hit for Remedy, I hope the sales data backs up the critical acclaim.
    Horror/horror adjacent games usually don't review super well outside of the heavy hitters so even something like an 83 is a damn solid score.
        Wow, I didn’t play Control until 2020, but I’m shocked to hear it only scored 83. I thought it was incredible, and assumed it would have scored at least 90.
            Same. It was my personal Game of the Year when it launched on PC. It is also the game that convinced me of DLSS and Raytracing because it allowed for some truly stunning visuals on my old RTX 2070S.
                I tried Control a good while after launch (thanks Epic Games) but it almost instantly grew into one of my all-time favorites. It's just pure Remedy.
            I'm actually a bit bored by it. I'm about 6 hours in I think and getting lost seems to be common for me. really wish it was a bit easier to navigate. just thinking about having to spend time to figure out where I am right now makes me not want to play it unfortunately.
                It took me a while to adjust at first but the trick to navigating in Control is to pay attention to the signs on the walls, they actually are very direct.
                Control is a 5/10. Maybe a 6.5/10 on a good day when the combat doesn't seem repetitive as all hell and you're actually fighting enemies that don't look or behave identically everywhere.
            I think Control is a divisive game - I played it for free on PS plus during Covid lockdowns when not a lot of games were being released and I couldn’t force myself to finish it.
    We are eating VERY good this year! Best year of gaming in a decade?
        2017 was pretty stacked with so many modern classics: BotW, Mario Odyssey (and the Switch launch in general), Hollow Knight, Persona 5 (international release), Nier Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn, RE7, Cuphead, Hellblade, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Metroid: Samus Returns
            This conversation is every thread now. Lol. 

It is accurate though. Lots of good games.
            This year blows 2017 out of the water, respectfully
                FR, everything from the cyberpunk expac to armored core to the deadspace remake has been fucking gold this year.
                Eh, there's been a lot of iteration this year. I enjoyed BOTW and DOS2 a lot more than TOTK and BG3 and in the latter's case I think it's just a worse game than DOS2.

Overall this year has a lot of 8/10s, not much that's blowing me away.
                I couldn't disagree more. I honestly haven't found too much I've really liked this year; RE4 Remake, Metroid Prime Remastered and the Xenoblade DLC is about it so far.
                    It may not be your personal best year in gaming based on your taste, but in terms of the sheer number of games that have released to massive sales and critical acclaim it's certainly one of the best years in the past decade, if not the best.
            Yeah, that is the next closest I can think of.
        And the variation. 

Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Street fighter 6- fighting

Mario wonder- plattforming

Tears of the kingdom- adventure

Final fantasy- Rpg

Harry potter- adventure.

Spiderman 2 - action adventure with a lighter touch


What I miss is some great fps action. Something like Halo 1, 3 or infinite that I really liked.
            You are  missing the game of the year in that list with Baulders gate 3. Plus starfield and cyberpunk phantom liberty.
                Don't forget armored core 6, also I don't think cyberpunk should be running for goty since that is just a dlc and an update to the game.
                Really gonna add starfield to a list of greatest games ever released
                    What are you talking about? The list was great games released this year, not of all time lol.
            > Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Don't forget Dead Space remake
            how could you forget Baldur's Gate, Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Armoured Core 6 and the most important of all GOTY Kong rise of skull island?
                Skull island is definitely the most innovative game of the bunch. Their inclusion of a jpeg shot in the middle of a cutscene?! That’s a game changer for the gaming industry
            Agreed, though listing FF16 as an RPG, especially when BG3 exists is questionable lmao.
                Haven't got around to BG3 yet but I thought Octopath II was better than FF16 as an RPG.
                    I’m not hating on FF16 to be clear, I just don’t think it counts as an RPG lmao, it’s an action game with some light RPG elements at best. 

I haven’t played Octopath II, maybe I should.
            Cyberpunk comeback and the new expansion for that FPS hit maybe? Cyberpunk after this redemption arc turned out to be my most favorite game of all time tbh.
            Very long time since we’ve had a 10/10 FPS and it’s hard to do, even Sony hasn’t had a crack at one in 10 years
            FF16 is not an RPG, no matter what it purports to be. It is a single player semi-open world action game with a quest structure.
            Cyberpunk & Phantom Liberty especially ould definitely cover that FPS part for you I promise
        GOTY in any other year:
RE4, TOTK,BG3, Mario, dead space, Metroid prime, phantom liberty, Jedi survivor, FF16, Spider guy 2, armored core 6 and now this thing. 

Oh yeah, we ate well this year goddamn!
    Control is probably my favorite game of all time, esp with the lore and worldbuilding, so this game is probably going to make me lose my shit.
        I love Control and I think Jesse Faden is an underrated protagonist. Without getting into too many spoilers I really enjoyed how she just dove into what was happening. Too many stories have reluctant protagonists who complain about the situation. So, it was nice seeing a character thrown into a strange situation that just rolled with and got to work.
            Not sure I'd call it a "dive".  She's pretty clearly been living a weird, odd life since childhood and has been seeking answers and expecting an escalation for years. 

Have never understood the complaints about unwilling protagonists, but I'm not the type to demand unabashed power trip fantasies and faulty logic in all of my fiction.
                I don't really see the connection between unwilling/willing protagonists and power fantasies. They are two mostly unconnected qualities for characters. You can have power fantasies with reluctant protagonists or you can have power fantasies with willing protagonists.
            I think you’re right in regard to diving in. I think her experiences in Ordinary helped make her more accepting to her new reality too.
        Ironically the lore got a bit naff for me in the end. I stopped caring after picking up the 101th note about some random and not very interesting SCP type stuff. 

I still rate the game very highly, and the gameplay and setting were very well done imho. But it was the first Remedy game where I thought that the story and characters (up until the DLCs) were the games weakest elements by some distance.
            [removed]
            They really needed those pseudo-audio logs - calls on the phone and whatever - to be able to play over gameplay, rather than accessed and listened to in a menu.
                Agreed. I will NEVER understand games that don't allow us to move as we listen to audio logs. It is punishment of the highest order.
            Yeah same. Like, I still really enjoyed the atmosphere and the worldbuilding stories, but I feel like the game kinda lost the plot and didn't answer many questions by the end. I still fucking love that game though.
            Man I fucking hate when storytelling is done nearly exclusively through fucking memos and audio logs. It annoys me to no end and really makes me feel disconnected.
            Very well put. 

Easily the weakest characters I've seen in a Remedy game but the atmosphere, graphics and to a lesser extent the combat made up for it. 

Fun game but 8/10 *max* IMO.
                I feel like if they'd made Jesse more punk like in their original vision, and had her be significantly angrier at the FBC, she would have landed a lot better.
        Control is one of my all time favorites as well so I'm really looking forward to AW2.  I'm not usually a fan of horror games at all, but I expect I will enjoy this game as it's in the same universe.  Like you said, their worlduilding is amazing.

I just hope the performance is fine.
            From all the reviews it seems the performance is pretty good everywhere. I’m excited to get nuts on PC tonight.
        Not my all-time favorite game (that's way too competitive), but the lore and notes you read along the way were the best in the business. From straight up horror to "The Office"-like bureaucratic comedy, I couldn't get enough of the lore. Read every word on every scrap I found.
    > 93 average now 92 90

now 89. Must have been some *extra* enthusiastic outlets who were ready at the embargo minute.
    > Control landed at an 83 and I LOVED it.

Control had a **lot** of technical issues and I wonder if that was a big part of why. I played it on an xbox one and it was just issue after issue after issue.

The fact that I played the whole game anyway is really a testament to how great the game was.

(I imagine everyone who played on better hardware had a better go of it, which is why there wasn't quite the same outrage for other big releases with lots of bugs)
        Ignoring technical issues my issue with Control its stupid design decisions such as having 5 guns but only being able to equip 2, having gaming's most useless map combined with gaming's most confusing level design, there being no difficulty settings while also having a fucked up difficulty curve, and no autosaves.

It's like Remedy decided the game was too good so they had to ruin it in a few places. It was so close but so far from greatness.
    I can't wait to play it, but I'm worried that sales will be lackluster since it's not being sold on the largest marketplace in the world.
    Control was one of the best surprises to come out in recent memory. I always had a lot of love for remedy’s game but often came with some glaring issues. Control just did everything it wanted to do right.
    These are so obviously paid reviews. I hope you played the game yourself. What do you think now?
AW1 is still one of my all time favorite games, that I’ve replayed more than any other game. I love the setting and atmosphere. It helps that I also really like a lot of Stephen King books and find the Pacific Northwest to be very cozy and beautiful.

I’m just waiting for information about the PS5 performance before purchasing. I don’t even need to read about the gameplay or mechanics itself. Remedy haven’t let me down in that aspect so far. You can count on them to try some wild stuff and I’m here for it. 

Fingers crossed.

EDIT:

Seems like I will be feasting good this weekend.

DF PS5 Tech review
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JawxvOF__4Q
        glad to see it hitting 60 FPS most of the time.

Gonna take a fat ass nap after work today and let it pre load then play this all night
            If you are in Europe i am afraid you cant play until the morning :( i'm in the same boat i think unlock time is somewhere 7am really annoying and i don't want to play a horror game in daylight. So i need to wait until Friday evening.
                that’s a bummer man, fortunately (for once) I’m in the Midwest US. 11PM for us.

The really lucky fucks on the west coast get it at 9
            I'd still recommend playing it at 30 on consoles
        Great username
    Should give Control a try if you haven't. Very different game but technically takes place in the same universe.
        Played through twice! On release on console and this year on Steam Deck.
    I agree. I love the first. The Pacific Northwest setting played a huge part in that for me too. Anything set there automatically gets bonus points for me. 

I get chills even thinking about it honestly
    Props to you i remember feeling incredibly tired of the gameplay by the end of it. I tried playing american nightmare and was just over it. 

The narrative was super fun but gameplay was so stale by the end of it I still have never managed to replay it since 2012.
        Just beat the first one again in anticipation of the sequel, and that's a hard agreed from me. There are five enemies in the entire game. 

Normal guy 

Fast guy 

Big guy 

Inanimate object 

Bird
            Uh, excuse you bud, you forgot Chair Guy and Bug-Looking Flashlight Head.
        I felt exactly the same. The game just stops introducing new mechanics, like, a third of the way in? You're just using the ever the same "strategy" of pointing your flashlight and then shooting your gun at enemies in every single encounter, over and over and over again, with nothing that really breaks up that pattern.

Even though the gunplay/combat definitely feels good at first (where you really feel the Max Payne roots), that feeling passes halfway into the game, and then you still have like 6 hours to go.

Luckily they managed to avoid this in Control.
            To be honest: if the core gameplay loop is actually great, you don't really need any new mechanics after a certain point.
                AW's gameplay is anything but great
                That's the problem, it isn't that great. The gameplay is pretty meh.
                    Alan please start doing cardio so you can run for more than three seconds.
            yeah i dropped it when i realized the gameplay was going to be the same atrocious slog all the way through, i did enjoy the atmosphere though

maybe will look at this on a deep sale or something
                I wouldn't go as far as calling it an atrocious slog. As I said, the gameplay fundamentals are actually pretty decent, it just doesn't carry the game for the entire duration of the story. It almost feels like this story is in the wrong medium.
        [deleted]
        Same. I tried doing this thing where I was going to go through my Steam backlog from A to Z and try to finish every game in it that looked fun that I hadn't yet played. I started with Alan Wake. By the time I'd finished Alan Wake I was so bored to tears by the repetitive, tedious gameplay that I abandoned my little project right then and there.
        Played it through when it went on PS+ for the first time. Even understanding that it's 13 years old at this point, like 2/3rds of the game is the same mechanics in the same dark woods. Not a ton of enemy variety, bosses were mostly the same too. Story was pretty good, even for 13 years old.
    I just watched through Digital Foundry’s video on the ps5 version, performance seems pretty good overall. I recommend checking it out if you’re considering that version of AW2!
    There is a digital foundry video out.

https://youtu.be/JawxvOF__4Q?feature=shared
U should buy it lol
    I only played AW once at release, and one of the few things I recall is a sequence where you and a buddy are on a rock stage with fireworks going off and you're just shotgunning monsters to a dope soundtrack.
    I got into AW1 so much that this became my favorite version of the Happy Birthday song to sing at close friends and family's birthday parties:  https://youtu.be/hzeNCCdu5Wc?t=490
    [deleted]
        Obvious choice for the current gen consoles. 

But I’ve recently also replayed parts of the original on my Steam Deck, and on that screen it still holds up pretty well.
So fucking happy for the folks at Remedy. I didn't play much of Alan Wake 1, but I thought Quantum Break was a really promising sign of things to come, and Control? Control is probably one of the most original new IPs of the last two decades that I've played, that also pushed tech, incorporated excellent third person combat, and a world that I was enthralled with. They deserve this.

So glad Alan Wake 2 is good, and yet another potential GOTY contender for 2023. What a mad year.
    Remedy is one of my all time favorite game studious. The games they have put out have hit me harder than I can even convey. And this goes back to before I even realized who they were with Max Payne 1 & 2. The way they tell a story and the way they focus on gameplay and pushing forward the tech. To the people complaining that DLSS was being used as crutch for putting out an "unoptimized" game don't know who Remedy is (and likely don't actually know what optimization really is and just use that as a buzz word for a seemingly demanding game).
wow, that might be the highest aggregate score I've ever seen for a horror game. That is extremely impressive.

Alan Wake 1 remains one of my favorite horror games, really makes me excited to play this one.

(edit: it was at a 93 when I made this comment)
    Depending on where you look the Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 Remakes are equal or higher.
        Alan Wake 2 sitting next to RE2 and RE4... I could cry :'))))
        That's amazing. Alongside Silent Hill 1 those are my favorite horror games.
            Holy shit...I've found a rare silent hill fan that doesn't go "Blah Blah Blah, silent hill 2, BLAH BLAH BLAH!"
    So far it's the same as the original Silent Hill 2, both sitting at 89.
        Silent Hill 2 deserved more than 89. It’s one the best games of all time.
    Resident Evil 2 and 4 remake might be higher I think
        Alan Wake being in the same company as these two warms my heart.
            I’ve never played a remedy game but Alan Wake 2 looks super cool. When I get a ps5 this holiday it may be one of the first games I pick up
    I originally thought you said it “wasn’t the highest” and I was like… a 90 for a horror game is still very impressive! But then I realized I misread
I hold Sam Lake as one of the few western writers I look forward to on games. Max Payne, Alan Wake and Control are masterful in world building and characters. I feel like Alan Wake 1 captured American horror so well tapping into some Stephen King stuff and everything about 2 seems like a step forward into more visceral horror. Can't wait to experience it
    What I like about Sam Lake and Remedy is that they are good storytellers who aren’t afraid of delving into total absurdity. The stories and settings in these games are so idiosyncratic but there’s human drama at the center which is authentic enough to hold it together.
        It's crazy because before even knowing Control was a remedy game I thought it was going to be a poorly executed SCP fan-fic. Not only does the world building and character design stand on its own but even their SCP's are fresh and scary to read about
    Agree. Sam Lake and co are some of the best and most creative writing force out there in the industry.
        Can’t wait for Control 2
            Imagine an Alan Wake DLC but it features Jesse Faden.
                They could call it Alan Wake 2: JFE 

Control: AWE was Altered World Event, but we all really know it stood for **A**lan **W**ake **E**xpansion
                    Or as I call it the Alan Wake Experience
                        Alan Wake Experience was one of my favorite bands from the late 60s lol
                Full circle!
        They’re basically outdoing twin peaks style David lynch writing at this point. They’re great.
    Hope Lake gets more love. Consider how much people hold Kojima on gold standard, it is strange Lake has not gotten that much love or appraise considering how long he has been in the game and constantly pushing the limits of story, story telling etc
        I've actually hosted a fireside interview with Lake once on stage and he is one of the most down to earth bigger names from gaming I've met. Absolute class, that man.  
Funny, respectful and with great insights.  

Absolutely one of my favourite memories from the time I did those gigs.
        I was just telling someone that I felt that Sam Lake is like a western Kojima, both so full of creativity and passion for storytelling even if they're not exactly the best writers in the world.
        Kojima benefits from the execution and presentation of his games. If his crazy narratives and cinematics were replaced by text (like low budget games do), no one would read that shit.
    I don’t think Lake is an extraordinary writer but he’s clearly much, much better and more widely read than your average game writer (whose main experience seems to be running DnD campaigns and maybe writing YA fanfiction, judging by their writing) and that makes Remedy’s games so much more interesting. 

Rockstar is kind of similar, I love RDR2 but the second to second dialogue isn’t masterful (most of the time, there are exceptions), it’s more that Houser, Unsworth and Humphries clearly have wide ranging tastes in fiction, especially film and literature, that range beyond the generic pop-sci-fi-fantasy schlock that most videogame writers clearly hold dear. 

You play GoW Ragnarok and it’s like someone who wrote thinly veiled Harry Potter or Hunger Games fanfic for a living spent a few hours with the Wikipedia page on Norse mythology. Remedy and Rockstar have writers who understand things beyond genre fiction, even if they’re writing genre fiction.
        I think Sam Lake has mentioned that he took time to go study screenwriting between Max Payne 1 & 2. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but I think he's put effort into actually learning writing in terms of craft.
        Finally, I'm not the only one who thinks GoW Ragnarok is weirdly written. I clearly saw how Cory Barlog's hand hadn't touched this game, everyone talks like a modern American from Watch Dogs or Spider-man. Those moments like Odin saying "my ex" or Kratos's "I don't want snacks" are so off. Odin's whole acting is like he is from Woody Allen movie
            Ragnarok felt like such a dip in quality story telling wise. I get they wanted to do a duology and I do respect the fuck out of that decision but they crammed in too much into one package. Towards the end it felt like plot beats were there to be checked off and then it was on to the next.
                This was my main complaint of the game too. The titular “ragnarok” event itself was crammed into like the last 20 minutes of the game. I really enjoyed the build up to it but damn they couldn’t deliver on their huge promises

That and you have these weird slow moments like everything with Angrboda where the game just haults. It felt like the MJ segments in spider-man

I’m fine with a slow buildup but there were so many whiplash moments where the game was both rushed and also bogged down by too many storylines
                    Right? I had that same thought about the actual Ragnarok event. We’re building to this whole event and then oh hey bye it’s over. 

The rumor is that they debated making Ragnarok 1 or 2 games (so that the whole thing would have either been a duology or a trilogy with GoW 2018) and I think that they made a real mistake by not making it a trilogy. The story in Ragnarok is told at an absolutely breakneck pace, but not in a good way - they tried to put way too much in. 

Even the big emotional plot twist death (which I’ll keep vague just in case people haven’t played) felt so rushed to me. It was just like “oh whoa welp they’re dead now anyways moving on” and I honestly didn’t even really care that they died. That should have been the emotional finale to the second game, and then the third game should have focused entirely on the Ragnarok event itself.
            I love the Voice Actor for Odin and I like his performance overall but yeah there were a few odd lines here and there. 


Really the game should have been split, but I understand why they didnt.
                I mean, it's good acting, I wrote about writing, not the performer. Good actors speak in Marvel "Illumi-what-ti" style and that was really bad.
            God the actual spoken dialogue was such a disappointment to me in Ragnarok. I remember right from the beginning when Odin refers to Freya as his “ex” that I wasn’t going to love the dialogue. And that’s not to say that the dialogue in the first game was perfect, but it definitely felt different
                The question that always comes to me when I see comments like this is one of curiosity, what would you have said instead? Genuinely it always interests me when I see topics like this come up.
                    I’m not even going to pretend that I’m skilled as a writer, so I honestly don’t know. But saying the phrase “my ex” is such a modern way of speaking and that’s what takes me out of it because that’s not how the game is framed. It we’re talking about a game like Immortal Fenix Rising, or hell even the animated Disney Hercules movie, the modern way of speaking works there because it’s in line with the overall presentation and “vibe” of the media. But God of War 2018 (and Ragnarok) play things _so_ straight, so to hear super modern dialogue/speech patterns in a game that’s trying to present a somewhat realistic/grounded take on this mythology just feels really out of place
            Odin was so disappointing in Ragnarok.

>!His boss fight was really underwhelming too, could have had him transform into Kratos, or Atreus, or Tyr, or any number of more interesting things than just having him fight you with a spear and bit of magic. Doesn't make any sense how Kratos couldn't just tear him into pieces instantly.!<

Think the game as a whole was pretty weak.
                Ragnarok really sucked compared to the previous game. Felt very “marvel”ised at a risk of sounding a bit circlejerky
                    Ragnarok didn't suck.  The boss fights were a letdown, and the story was not anywhere near as good.  But the combat was way better/smoother than the first.
                        I don't remember any boss from the first game other than the first baldur fight and the dragon 🤷‍♂️ that was always my biggest complaint from it. So idk how anyone could think Ragnarok did them worse. Like thor and the Gryla fight more than made up for that imo.
                            For me the final Baldr fight with Freya controlling the giant, and the Valkyrie Queen fight were good standouts as well.
                            Because honestly, they’re still a letdown from previous GoW games.
                                Hey kids you like quick time events???
                        “Ragnarok really sucked compared to the first game”

Important distinction if you read this back
                I thought the game was great with the exception of the ending. So much potential crammed into a rushed set of sequences and underwhelming boss fights.
                Yes, pretty mediocre game. I think, it was rushed, it felt in every storyline. New characters appear, drama around them out of nowhere, Freia (who hunted Kratos between games) becomes good in like 1 mission
            I didn't think the writing in the first GoW was that special either, but Ragnarok's was especially bad. You're definitely not alone there. I felt like I was playing a Marvel film.
                I remember it being more subtle (like BOY through the game) and smart. One liners didn't feel forced and sometimes Kratos was just silent. In Ragnarok it was too usual for Marvel writing and all the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)
                    >the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)

He doesn't say that though. He just says "i fucked up"
            Vehemently disagree, I thought this version of Odin was phenomenal. Richard Schiff is a wonderful actor and I think it was a stroke of brilliance to get the guy who played the white house comms director from West Wing to play the character. Highlighted the difference of styles between Kratos and Odin, one who mostly wins with might and the other who manipulates and deceives.
            Ex is a term dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. Snack dates back to the 1500s. Odin is well read and due to partaking in the Well of Knowledge he knows every language. Just because you aren't familiar with casual dialect in other languages doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
        The medium and the team at Remedy have a lot of credit for how well the narratives play out in my opinion. As you say, I don’t think Sam Lake is a bad writer by any means but the way the stories are told elevate them to a different level. I’m really *really* looking forward to this game because the atmosphere and writing make for a very awesome experience.
        Can you really say it's the lack of Barlog, tho? Both games had the same lead writers, it's just that Ragnarok had clearly more involved junior writers, too. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was still strong for a mass appeal game, if a bit plain in prose overall.

If anything, the only one whose influence you can taste like unsavoury candy was fucking Anthony Burch. The Joss Whedon of video game writing, without the 1 in 10 successful jokes Whedon manages, somehow.
            Both Anthony Burch and Cara Ellison wrote for Ragnarok and have mostly poor, overly-online-trope/reference type writing, sure. 

Whedon’s style was refreshing once upon a time, it’s just aged, stale and overused now. Audiences are tired of it.
                I'm not familiar with Ellison's work and Burch is yeah... well, very, very unfortunate choice for any serious story. And Whedon, man. Buffy was my jam, but he now lives rent-free in my head for the irreperable damage he caused to American writing industry with The Avengers (2012) template of quips and quirky writing.

But my point was I don't feel like it's apparent lack of Barlog in Ragnarok. His career history is of a game director from God of War II, not a primary writer. It certainly never felt like there was a point where I would compare him to, like you said, Lake or Houser. Maybe in cinematic department.
                    I can definitely argue that Anthony can do serious. His storyline in Dungeons and Daddies gets surprisingly serious, but God of War isn't the right setting for him.
                        I can agree on point that he can do serious story, he wrote Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but even then he did \*hammy\* as fuck writing. Which is what didn't make him right for a story that takes itself seriously as GoW Reboot.

If he does it better on his podcast, I'll take your word for it, but for me he's still 2012 9gag level of humour from Hey Ash!
                            This is fair. His use of language is too modern for something more period period like GoW.
            Joss Whedon of video game writing is very accurate lol, the Atreus and Sindri sections were pretty brutal for me. Felt like some cheap MCU knockoff, the dialogue was just all snarky quips. Got annoying real fast
        Yeah, you are savage but right. Control is incoherent and extremely hokey, and by no means a display of rigorous storytelling. Which is blasphemy on this sub, I know. But Remedy excels in atmosphere, and all of their games have very lived-in worlds that are interesting to explore. I think Lake is good at playing to the tropes of the genres he's working in, but more importantly he's supported by a team that does excellent art direction, music, etc. that sells the atmosphere.
            I think it's completely fine for stories to be incoherent in a traditional sense, and it makes complete sense that Remedy games are like that since they take so much inspiration from David Lynch's work.
                For real. Half of Alan Wake is like a love letter to Twin Peaks.
                I think it's fine to enjoy the pulpiness of Control's writing but I don't think it gets close to the level Lynch is capable of. He's one of the most celebrated filmmakers ever for a reason.
                    Sure, but is Lynch considered one of the most celebrated writers in the industry ever? I'd argue no, and he's my favourite filmmaker.


That's not to say that Sam Lake is as good as Lynch is, but I do think Lynch is also so much more about atmosphere and mood than he is focused on writing structured and coherent screenplays, or defined character arcs and such.
                    I think the real trick and talent with them is they can make things cheesey without undermining the game itself, like, the game can have fun and be silly while also always fully believing in its world and its characters. Like when Control has Darling do a fuckin Dynamite cover from beyond the Nth dimension to cheer Jesse on I'm giggling like an idiot, but also buying that this is something Darling the person would do, and when it throws that Computer Program Dead Letter at you in the Foundation man I genuinely started crying, just the overall presentation of stumbling onto something so sad and personal in the form of some forgotten, misplaced government paperwork. And through all that they made a game where those two things can be part of the same experience, which imo is a generally impressive bit of ability. It's not moment-to-moment screenwriting excellence, but I think it is a form of writing skill, writing and assembling a whole, cohesive, and intentional vision for a script that's not for film, or TV, or a novel, but a video game specifically. Rather than, say, trying to smuggle a B-tier Oscar bait screenplay into a medium with lower standards where the impression of prestige television can carry you.
        I agree that the dialogue in GoWR is pretty bad, but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers. The bigger problem to me seems to be the tone of the game, which is definitely a game design and marketing choice more than it is a problem with specific writers.

I'm sure the tone of Ragnarok was largely decided on as a whole, probably very shortly into development.
            > but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers.

They deserve the harshness, I don't see why we can't hold games to the same standards as film or literature.
                Comparing to films or literature is something people who have no idea how game writing works say. 

Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement. 

Films have more people involved, but are still far easier than games due to the smaller team size and the fact you can write stuff like "They take their shirt off" or "They hand over an object" and an animation team doesn't come and say "Ha, yeah, we can't do that."

Film and literature are breezes in the park comparably for writers.
                    > Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement.

These are definite differences, good writing is often an afterthought after gameplay and graphics, but I'm still going to hold games to the same standard. I will judge them for poor characterization, awkward dialogue, stilted acting, etc, though I'll place most of the blame on the directors/producers for tolerating these during production. 

Game directors like Miyazaki at From Software and Neil Druckmann at Naughty Dog have shown that good writing in AAA games is possible (though Miyazaki's better at storytale unique suited to videogames, Druckmann's just got at supervising naturalistic dialogue and acting), and there are plenty of well-writen indie games.

If gamers are happy with slop and don't raise any criticisms, they'll continue to get slop.
                Because they're working for a large corporation making games that are basically blockbuster movies. And to be honest most AAA games are written better than your average blockbuster.

Like they're not auteurs. This isn't Tarkovsky.
        Same with Spider-Man 2, it's a great game but the story is well-worn and tired and the characters all act the exact same.
            I think the thing is that at the time of Uncharted 2 when Sony games started with this kind of writing, games that were written as well as the average Marvel movie were genuinely like 95th percentile as far as game stories went. But as the industry matured they often now feel a little generic, immature, sometimes cringeworthy, and often insincere.
                I think Sony and Naughty Dog specifically should get a lot of credit for at least being progressive in trying to write a good story. I do think TLOU2 tried too hard and other Sony titles (Horizon, Spider-Man, GoW) are being overrated for their storytelling.
            That’s my main problem with the game too. Just feels like I‘m watching the Raimi movies again but with more quips, less laughs and none of the charisma. 

Also doesn’t help that I enjoy Miles as a character more than Peter, but he is really just kinda there and occasionally helps out with stuff.
    He isn't just a Sam Lake, he's a Sam Ocean.
    There's obviously a *ton* of great writing in Western indie games, but as far as AA/AAA games go, I wholeheartedly agree. Like, leaps and bounds beyond even Sony's 1st party offerings.
    Control definitely pulled me in more than AW, but goddamn you’re right about worldbuilding. Art direction in these games is also top notch.
    I honestly think Rockstar did Max Payne a lot better than Remedy - which I mean you can't really have Max Payne in 3 without the versions in 2 and 1 but still
        I've played through Max Payne 3 more times then I care to admit.
            It's the GOAT for me in terms of 3rd person shooters. Nothing has ever exceeded it, I really hope we get a port for Switch, and I also hope Remedy take inspiration from 3 for its remakes of the first two games.
        Totally disagree. It tried so hard to emulate 1 & 2's writing but just fell on its face. 

Gameplay was awesome though.
            felt like i was taking crazy pills with that take. story and presentation was far better in the previous games.
        Max Payne 3 wasn't a Max Payne game to me at all. It was a perfectly fine *something else*. It didn't feel like the same character and the change in story-telling took away one of MP's most appealing qualities.
        Max Payne 3 was amazingly well-written. 

It might be my favorite example of (in any medium) a writer taking someone else's established premise, characters, and voice, and evolving them in interesting and worthwhile ways.
            They just took Max Payne and put him in Man On Fire with some forced noir tropes and dialogue. I'd hardly call it an evolution.
One of the PS5 reviews mentioned it runs at a 4K output* in 30 FPS and ~1440p*60 in performance which actually bodes really well. Those PC specs had me scared that the consoles were going to be a bit bleh.


\* = Upscaled from... something... maybe? 


**EDIT:** Digital Foundry has published their PS5 review. Quality mode is ~1270p upscaled to 2160p, performance is ~874p upscaled to 1440p, both using FSR 2. Frame rates seem to stick mostly to 30 in quality (with some not-too-often drops in some areas to ~27ish) whereas performance sticks to 60 most of the time with a few problem areas dropping to around 50. Overall good image quality with some shimmering/artefacting in certain areas.


Full DF review here: https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-remedy-raises-the-bar-for-visual-accomplishment-once-again
    [deleted]
        Yup! Updating original post with that and a link to DF.
    The Digital Foundry video mentions that both modes use FSR2 to upscale to 4k (or 1440p in performance mode) from much lower resolutions. The main issue is that the image looks somewhat soft, but the end results generally still look good and tend to hit their target framerates outside of stress areas (where quality mode dips to ~27fps for stretches, and performance mode into the low 50s in the same areas)
    I don't know the exact details so I might be wrong, but from what I saw the pc specs were relatively high because the studio chose to use a specific technology that older cards just don't support. It's not that a GTX 1080 is too weak to handle all that processing, but that it doesn't have the physical component in it that is made to support this technology. Like how only RTX cards have the physical components that can calculate the DLSS stuff.

I think I even saw someone mention that there are some weaker cards, like 1650 I think that can handle this game since they came out after the stronger 1080 with the new component
        Yeah, the issue is that older cards don't support mesh shaders which Alan Wake 2 requires.


Honestly, I'm not too bothered on the Nvidia side. Not supporting 1000-series cards that are 7 years old is like "bummer, but okay". On the AMD side it's a bit more of an ouch, since only the 6000 and 7000 series are supported, with the unsupported 5000-cards only being ~4 years old.
            We'll have to see how the 2060 does then in testing, because the 5700 XT, the fastest of that generation on the AMD side, was in the 2060, 2060 Super, 2070 ballpark, depending on game. AW2's specs for the 2060 are for 1080p. 30 fps, and using DLSS quality, but the lowest other settings.

So, from the sounds of things, even if the 5700 XT had the hardware to run it, it probably wouldn't be a great experience. Playable? Probably. A good experience? Maybe not...
        Basically Microsoft adopted features into DX12 ultimate which the 1000 series cards didn't support because they were four years old by 2020. 

It's perfectly fine for remedy to exclude them. This is like when devs would release games as dx11 only and some older cards would miss out. The 1000 series cards are also now older than a traditional console generation
        A gtx 1080 is too weak is 2023 regardless
            Seems like some people expect that card to be good until the year 2060.
    Seems like a good sign of a well-optimized game with incredibly demanding specs then? All those old thread is about to be funny thread soon.
    It's fucking wild that my ps5 will run this game better than my more powerful pc.
        https://twitter.com/Dachsjaeger/status/1717528516739117498?t=fy_SFLSVfQn8I5GDaB46AA&s=19

According to Alex from Digital Foundry, your PC will definitely outperform PS5 if it's more powerful.
        or the PC specs were overblown.
        Okay, so Digital Foundry has uploaded their analysis, and the quality mode is ~1270p upscaled to 4K and ~874p upscaled to 1440p (both using FSR 2) which is... okay.
            While many PC specs are unoptimized bs, I think people rarely make fair comparisons between PC and console. Console specs are often treated as native when more often than not there's a heavy use of FSR. 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people yet it's completely normal in PS5.
                > 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people

Would it? That's just 1440p with DLSS quality, that's a pretty normal combo.
I really hope this game is Remedy's moment in the sun. The studio absolutely deserved all of the praise over Control, but just due to bad marketing, so many people I know never even heard of Control until years after it was out.
    Yeah. I’ve heard it’s a good game and got it for free on ps4 and pc actually due to epic games
Or ps * haven’t played it yet but after all the pride in this thread I will. 

What’s better for it, console or pc?
        Control was basically a graphics showcase for raytracing technology a few years back, so you'll want to play it somewhere you can take advantage of that. If your PC can push the graphics options, I'd probably recommend that over PS4.
        A note on PS5 RTX: it's there and it's actually quite good, but you sacrifice a lot of frames in a pretty fast paced action game, so I tended to prefer playing with it off.

On PC though, especially now after a lot of optimization, it's still one of the best Ray-Tracing implementations years later.
    I didn't really mesh with Control very well, I liked the setting but not the cast and the gameplay honestly peaks pretty early when you get Launch and kinda goes downhill for another 10+ hours of actual game. All the other powers are bland, like a Shield or Mindjacking enemies. You are limited to two weapon forms at once, which is beyond stupid considering both forms share the regenerating ammo pool so its not like 2 vs 6 weapons avaliable via radial wheel would change anything. It just means I find 2 things I sorta liked and never swap off.

Also as a pure shooter, it doesn't even feel as good as Quantum Break.
Jesus, 3 GOTY nominees in the span of a week? This year just doesn't stop.
    4, mate. You forgot Skull Island: Rise of Kong
        That isn't even being nominated, the GOTY award is already in the mail to their offices.
            Needed that laugh. Thanks mate.
        That's not a nominee because it would be too obvious a winner
            All hail the king!
                Don't say King! King Kong is copywritten. This is just Kong. All hail the Kong.
    It’s apparent at this point this is definitely one of the best years in gaming in a long time, we’ve been so fed the last few months with so many games living up to the hype.
        October is always crazy for games but this is on another level.
        But don’t you know? Everyone on Reddit says “wahhhhhh gaming is so bad now, I miss the SNES”. And not that there’s anything wrong with loving SNES games, but this whole narrative of “gaming is so bad now” are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new
            Oh yeah, the boomers of gamers :D
            >are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new

to be fair the new COD MW3 remakes looks terrific
    Lies of P was recent too

Actually that was a month ago... jeez with so many games coming out time is also flying by
        New Forza was good. We got a new Street Fighter and new Mortal Kombat this year. Fuck, even the 20-year old EVE Online is seeing a resurgence with its fall expansion content. CRAZY year for gaming.
            Momentum carrying over to next year as well. Tekken 8 and FF7 Rebirth baby
                Alone in the Dark in February too
    Spider Man, this game and what's the third?
        Mario Wonder
        Gollum
        Mario Wonder
        King Kong
    Ghostrunner 2?
    In what world are any of these GotY worthy in a year that we had Zelda and BG3?
    [deleted]
        It's one of the highest rated of the year so yeah, I think it definitely counts as one.
            Not disagreeing, but this year was so stacked it might just miss out on a nomination.

Dead Space remake
RE4 remake
Tears of the Kingdom
Spiderman 2 
Mario Wonders
Maybe Hi-Fi Rush
Streefighter 6
+maybe others I can't remember suddenly

Iirc there are only 6 nominees, so it's gonna be though to even get nominated. Other games like Lies of P and Jedi Survivor that'd've probably made it in other years have no chance this year.
                Yeah I think it will miss out too - BG3 is missing from your list and I think that and Starfield have more chance of being nominated than RE4 remake or Dead Space remake, remakes feel like waste of slots in such a stacked year

I think the shortlists will be something like BG3, Spiderman 2, Starfield, TOTK, Super Mario Wonder, Street Fighter 6/Alan Wake 2/Hifi Rush for the last slot
The first Alan Wake was one the very first games I religiously followed through the alpha versions back on YouTube when they were showing off their tech tests, way back when the game was supposed to be this strange open world thing. 

Just really cool to see this all come around.
Reviews are great, just waiting to see some PC benchmarks/performance guides. DF just put out their tech review for the PS5 so hopefully the PC Optimal Settings video comes out sooner than later.
    John from DF said PC version is "perfect":

And Alex said it scales very well (PC video tomorrow):

Seems like a really good PC release for once.
        It's ironic that We got one good PC port for once and half the playerbase on PC can't play it lmao

Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.
            > Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.

I wouldn't go that far. The minimum requirement for this game is a 5 year old GPU. When Crysis came out, a 5 year old GPU would be lucky to run *any* AAA release that year.
            Crysis's issue is that they targeted single core performance just as the market shifted to focusing on multithreading. That means in practice it ends up acting unoptimized to a real world usecase.

Alan Wake 2, just like Control, appears to be extremely fine tuned in terms of optimization for real-world device expectations and runs well on low end cards (released after the shift to the mesh shader support).
                i finally caught onto the control train a week or two ago, and was shocked how well the game ran. i have a 3060ti and was able to run it at ultra and ray tracing everything and it never even stuttered, perfect 60 fps basically all game.
            The only thing consoles do better than PC is that nobody expects the PS4 to run PS5 games well, if at all, and yet people with hardware from last generation are salty they can’t play today’s titles.
    Before DF releases a more in-depth analysis, take a look at this guy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMHxkrABRNs&t=1369s). He tests various graphics settings of the game across different GPUs. Worth a watch.
    It's good remedy are getting the console version in the limelight after controls rocky launch.
    I expected a 75-80, especially with all the  doomsaying about the PC performance. A 93is absolutely insane, and could land this among the already insane list of GOTY candidates for 2023.

Will wait for a PC focused outlet's review like PC Gamer before I fully make up my mind about it tho.
        Maybe don’t listen to the doomsayers…
    I believe Alex tweeted that his video will be out tomorrow, and remarked that the concern was overblown, so I expect overall good news.
Can't wait to listen to **Old Gods of Asgard** again. Gonna be great! ,\\m/
    Preordered vinyl cause it’s gonna be something!
Why is this year so good for gaming?. My theory is this is the rebound from covid. Thres was a time when no one was making much and devs had time to stew on their ideas.
    Video games take several years to make, and many (if not all) of these games were already in development when the pandemic started. Three years is basically the absolute minimum for a AAA title. So I doubt this really had anything to do with it. Some years are just good years for gaming. If anything, delays from COVID affecting development teams might have just made release dates all align for this year.
        Agreed. Covid had an indirect effect if anything to align releases.
    That might be it, also games releasing in 2020-2021 were really hampered *late into development* by the pandemic, so they were often unfinished or buggy.

These 2023 games I think at best *started* development in that time, and conceptualization, drawing concept art and storyboarding can "easily" be done working from home.

Also we're finally fully into PS5/Series X as current gen, so graphics are finally seeing proper leaps forward.
    You're half right it's just the development cycles that got extended due to disruptions with WFH kinda coincided in this one year with this embarrassment of riches we're getting.
    This year has been a year of absolute bangers (DS remake, RE4 remake, Armored core, TotK, BG3, Lies of P, Hifi rush, and so on), but at the same time though we have gotten some absolute bottom of the bottom stinkers this year too.

I fully expect gollum and the kong game to both show up in various "worst games ever" videos even years from now.
        Forspoken and Redfall were some real stinkers as well.
        DS remake? Hopefully you didn't mean Demon's Souls.
            Dead space remake. Sorry, should have specified more.
                Oh right!! I forgot about that one. Thank you!

    I think we are seeing the fruits of being in the current console generation for a few years now. I imagine PS5 and Xbox Series dev kits went out no earlier than a year or so before launch to most developers. Next year should prove to be lighter but still have some amazing games nobody is expecting.
    COVID delays are a part of it, but I think the big deal is developers finally embracing the new hardware and leaving the 10 year old consoles behind. There is always a rush of creativity in the industry when the performance floor gets lifted by a new console generation. 2007 was a similar year in this regard.
    The "rebound" from covid is also a bunch of layoffs
    Great theory
    Pretty sure anything worse releasing than Redfall or Gollum would be a straight up scam. So only up from rock bottom?
        [I see you haven't gotten to experience the raptor.jpg cutscene from skull island yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfkHj_aPuTk)

Yes, that is the actual cutscene. Yes, the game is worse than both the things you listed.
            NO WAY LOLOL
I hope there's a physical version some day. I'm in the shrinking minority that still only buys the big releases on disc (PS5).
    I have dozens of friends across the world who collect physical still. Most are not buying because of no physical. One of them is the biggest Alan Wake fan I know, has been waiting for the game since the launch of the original, and he is flat out refusing to give Remedy cash until a physical version is released.  


I'm sure it will come, and it'll be after launch. Or through some physical company like Limited Run Games. But it's disappointing that I can't play it because of a weird line in the sand that I understand, but don't necessarily agree with.
        >I have dozens of friends across the world...

Damn, I think I have like... 5 total.
    Same. I’ll wait for a nice 75% discount if it really is digital only. Plenty of games to play in the meantime.
    There are dozens of us! 

(Tbh there are still quite a few people buying physical releases nowadays, it's still a sizeable chunk of the market, this was probably more on Epic publishing it. I wouldn't be surprised to see a physical release in the future)
    yea same, i only buy physical releases. easy to share with friends and also to sell after i’m done with the game
    Yup sorry not buying a $70 digital non-multiplayer game.
        lmao ok
This year keeps on giving. 

I think nobody can deny that this has been the best year in gaming history since 2007, possibly even beyond that.
    Bg3, ac6, Re4, lies of p

Some of my favorite games EVER and it was all this year. It's kind of ridiculous.
        I would add Cyberpunk 2077 in there too, because it just got released this year as far as I know lmao
    I’d say 2023 and 2018 are the best years of gaming in the past 10 years
        For me it’s 2023 and 2017
Looking very very good. I liked AW1, it wasn’t my type of game at my age when it came out but after being sucked into Control, I gave the remaster a go and loved it. Been extremely keen on this one and seeing how Remedy go with building their universe.
Any word on performance for PC?
    https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1717532308402565274

Digital Foundry says it's "perfect", and will run very well on a 3070.
    Really hope my measly RTX 2060 can handle it on low specs, this has been my most anticipated game since RE4 Remake.
    https://www.computerbase.de/2023-10/alan-wake-2-dlss-3-5-erlaubt-pathtracing-mit-134-fps-in-uhd/

No bechmarks yet, but 1st impressions:

The title looks impressively good in places using pathtracing, but cannot maintain this level throughout. Nevertheless, Alan Wake II announces another game with a graphical presentation on the highest level. However, this costs an extremely high amount of performance - even more than was recently speculated.


The benchmark results published by Nvidia a day ago seem to be absolute best-case scenarios. The 103.9 FPS mentioned for a GeForce RTX 4080 in the "Raytracing High" setting (maximum pathtracing) in UHD including DLSS 3.5 performance, frame generation and ray reconstruction was almost never reached by the editors in the first two hours of the story. Usually, the title runs at 70 to 80 FPS when played with these settings, but there are also scenes where the FPS is only around 60.


Frame generation is a must for pathtracing (and often also for "normal" ray tracing). The artificial intermediate frames can be graphically convincing, but have a clear impact on the input lag. Because frame generation as a means to an end for using ray tracing in Alan Wake - depending on the resolution and GPU - may well have to be used at a render frame rate (already including upscaling) of only 30 FPS, this is also noticeable. Despite displayed 60 FPS, the game hangs. However, ray- and pathtracing obviously can't be done any other way.


DLSS/FSR are always active, which explains their consistent naming in the official system requirements. With Nvidia DLAA and AMD FSR Native, there is also the option to use both algorithms on the native resolution (i.e. without upscaling) and thus for edge smoothing. Both technologies cannot be switched off.


Not only the use of "pathtracing", i.e. the complete implementation of the lighting by ray tracing, but also the activation of ray tracing in general is currently not recommended on AMD Radeon RX, the FPS drops drastically. Or to put it even more drastically: RT is currently virtually impossible on a Radeon - even on a Radeon RX 7900 XTX. The 60 FPS mark is often not reached with AMD's flagship even in Full HD with FSR Balanced.

*Game Rant - Dalton Cooper - 2.5 / 5*

right lets see what other reviews this guy has 

*Starfield 5/5 - "Starfield delivers on everything it promised and then some."*

oh okay guess I can ignore this one then
    I don't like writing off a reviewer wholesale because I disagree with their past work, but also this did make me laugh a lot.
    haha everything promised and then some. That is nuts.
    I normally hate when people do this kind of dissection in these threads but holy hell!
    that one rly stuck out to me, like i get its shouldnt be all the same scores but if there is something which sticks out that much there has to be a reason
Is there a sense that one needs to have played AW1 and American Nightmare to play 2? How about Control?

I’m playing through 1 now, but I’ve had some difficulty with Control, for some reason. Just never feels like it’s playing or controlling right, and always feels like it looks fuzzy on both my Steam Deck and desktop (the desktop is no slouch, either).
    This is a very story heavy series so I feel like if you just watched a recap you won’t have the full picture of Alan Wake 1. 

Control is tough to gauge. Essentially it’s easter eggs in that game that kind of cast the events of AW in a new light but it’s such a minor part of Control that you might be okay just youtubing the relevant scenes.
    Control is the connective tissue between AW1 and its sequel. It provides context for altered world events (AWE) and their ability to translate shared subconscious archetypes into new or... altered realities. So far, it seems like all of AW2 is set within an immense, or oceanic, AWE.

Control established the Remedy expanded universe, reintroduced Alan Wake and Bright Falls and connected all of it through the Federal Bureau of Control. It's also loads of fun to absolutely wreck those destructible environments with telekinetic combat abilities.
Since I play on console and no one seems to have Xbox codes i'll definitely wait until it's out and people have played it on Xbox.
    Even Windows Central only received a PS5 code.
        I don't see how a website called XboxEra can in good conscience recommend the game if they didn't even review the Xbox version. Crazy that this had a big showing at the recent Xbox Partner Preview yet no one can play it on Xbox.
            They just added their Xbox Series X|S comments to the review up on Windows Central. Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush.
                > Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush

Yeah that's how it seems. I think personally if you are a console specific site and you don't get your version you should put that up.  Say we wanted to have something available for you but we cannot as they only provided codes for these platforms.  As such our recommendation is wait and see.


Edit: Thanks for the update on  Windows Central, I just checked it out. I wonder what you lose graphically by going to performance mode. I'll probably play in Quality mode but I always like to know what's different.  Time to see if anyone lays this out.
    >Playing the game on Xbox Series X, the game runs at a flawless 30 frames-per-second even in intense moments in Quality mode, and a stable 60 FPS in Performance mode. There are many techniques and aspects of Alan Wake 2's technical design that feel utterly fresh in this kind of game.

https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/alan-wake-2-review#:~:text=Playing%20the%20game%20on%20Xbox,in%20this%20kind%20of%20game.
No one seems to be mentioning performance issues on console so that seems positive. Can’t see anything specific about Series S though so not sure what to expect. Hoping for a stable 30 at 1440p maybe but we’ll see.
[deleted]
    The nominees for GOTY are kind of arbitrary and don't always match up to whatever the highest scoring metacritic games are of that year, so there's always a lot more games in contention to be nominated than actually do, but I agree the overall quality of games this year is higher than normal.

E.g. last year Stray was nominated even though its OpenCritic score was 84%, whereas a lot of games with higher scores didn't get nominated. Kind of another reason the GOTY awards are just arbitrary and a bit nonsensical really - they're a bit like the Oscars, where the best picture nominees are always good movies but not necessarily the actual best that released that year
“Awkward live action scenes that feel out of place” sounds just like what Alan wake 2 should have in it lol also why did game rant score so low when everyone else is scoring high—reading it they say the story and game play are a negative aspect but most other reviews state the opposite. The other lower reviews (5 < x < 8) seem to mention bugs and performance issues as the main gripes. 
I’m so hyped y’all. Tomorrow I took the day off to play AWE. Oh I meant AW2. :) stupid control joke sry
/r/pcgaming in shambles… Glad that the game turned out great. There’s been a lot of hate around Reddit since they released the PC hardware requirements. I’m glad that a lot of the concerns were overblown based on what I am hearing. Really excited to play.
    Crazy hardware specs and Epic exclusive... Basically /r/pcgaming 's nightmare
    Am I missing something? Went to check and the top threads about the game seem mostly positive/relieved, as well as the discussion within.

Granted, I never bother sorting by controversial.
        It was a shitshow of negativity this week before reviews came out lol
    That sub is trash. Absolute trash. I need to do some searching for a good pc focused sub.
    Those guys over there are literally seething right now. It's hilarious to watch them
        We need a new word to describe people whose lives are so wonderful that they have to turn the most trivial things into moronic hills to die on.
    That sub is run by steam bots. Like many other subs
    Yeah, it always amuses me how different the threads are. This thread is mostly people excited about the game. That thread is a mix of people finding any excuse they can to be negative about it. It being EGS exclusive basically means they're going to hate it no matter how good it is.
        They are truly the console gamers they claim to be better than.
Love seeing the scores and I am so hoping this translates to sales for them. I love Alan Wake as a character and the whole verse itself. I would just love to not wait 13 damned years for a sequel again.
Is it sad that I kinda teared up when I saw that 10 from Gamespot? I've been waiting 13 fucking years man.
    Not at all friend. I feel the same. 

It's funny, the release date totally snuck up on me, but I've been waiting so long for this.
    Me too! I hope the soundtrack is as good as the original's.
    Im so happy man, tears of joy
    Man I'm right there with you. I can't believe all this time geeking over alan wake, control and remedy in general are paying off. I was so scared of this game not reaching the public's expectation but I'm blown away seeing these reviews.
Better reviews than I was expecting so far, very nice.

I‘ll definitely get this after I’m done with Spider-Man.
I have to admit, since I haven't played the first game(yet), my main interest in seeing this title succeed comes from my deeply held desire to see Control 2 happen. But given the high marks for AW2, I'm definitely going to pick it up once I upgrade my graphics card around christmas.
    *Control 2* was announced last year. :)
The game runs great on my system (5800X3D, 7900XTX) and the graphics are superb. I also like the overall atmosphere. However, the game is very boring and there's way too much solving and dialogue going on, and not nearly enough combat.

I never played AW1, so didn't know what to expect, but probably expected something more like Resident Evil. What I actually got is like 70% LA Noire and 30% Silent Hill.

The game is incredible visually and the atmosphere is good in many parts, but it just feels a slog to play, and I'm not invested in any of the characters at all.
    I agree. Played it for 6-7 hours but got bored in the subway section since you are just running around trying to reveal the BS story. Basic game mechanic is to find batteries and bullets while trying to switch between 'scenes' to open up closed off areas.
I liked it alot but I do feel like a bit of the overall almost mystical feel of the game is gone. However its still a fun game but I do wish they would have improved animations a bit more as it can feel rough to play. Such is life. Small quibbles.
    How scary would you say the game is in comparison to the original? Loved the first one and will be getting this but I'm a huge wimp - SIGNALIS is about the upper limit on spooky for me normally. This is looking like a 'play in broad daylight with my flatmates watching' experience.
        There are some scary parts for sure but there is also a lot of Twin Peaks style stuff and a good deal of police procedural. It is very hard to average it all out but I would say I found Alan Wake to be low on the scary scale(not sure it was aiming for that) and this is a bit higher due to some of the brutality that happens.
But I tend to skew very very low on horror impacting me during a game.
            Police procedural? That peaks my attention
    How is the difficulty compared to other survival horror games? Say Re4 remake?

 I'm hoping for something a bit more difficult than we usually expect from the genre.
        I played mostly on normal and it was...about as expected. Somewhat challenging at times. The others are more or less and require more or less accuracy and not wasting ammo and scavaging a bit more.

New diff is coming in a patch in a month I think
            How scary is it for someone who really doesnt like jumpscares? Want to play it but im a scaredy cat in general
                There are for sure jump scares. There is also the overlay of FMV I talked about a bit in the review which can be startling.
    Would you recommend playing through the AWE DLC for Control first?
        I love them so its not really at all impartial if I say yes. Its not exactly needed
    Dang, the stiffness of dodge animation really got to you, huh? I can totally get that, and it's a bummer when a seemingly small but actually pretty fundamental part of gameplay lacks polish in games like these. If only every game could be animated to the quality of the TLOU2; there were some fantastically animated and dynamic dodge animations 👌
        > Dang, the stiffness of dodge animation really got to you, huh? I can totally get that, and it's a bummer when a seemingly small but actually pretty fundamental part of gameplay lacks polish in games like these.

You're reminding me of how I just could not get over the dodge animations watching people play Calisto Protocol. They straight up looked like genre satire.
        100%. I would love Spider-man even more if not for that weird hunched combat stance.
I am expecting to play the game for the story. Let's be honest, literally any change on the gameplay is already a massive improvement from the first game so now I'm even more excited
Based on the reception I’m seeing so far it looks like this is shaping up to be the best-received non-remake horror game since Silent Hill 2. That’s absolutely insane. I know Remedy is a talented studio but I was NOT expecting that.
Amnesia the Bunker, RE4 + dlc, Dead Space remake and now Alan Wake 2 all releasing w/ good reviews. This has to be the best year for horror gaming by far.
    Don't forget *Sons of the Forest* too.
i love the First one and the dlc but this is ..i think is boring and not something that we haven't see before the game play with Alan is ok but overall is just a walking thriller sorry i don't like it

barely something happen at least for me
How does everyone feel about it? Right now I’m NOT loving it. I loved the 1st. 

I can say there’s nothing else like it, but it feels like a lot of wasted time. It’s very difficult to make progress and the progressing sequences are talking a lot without saying much. About 5 hours in. Just slowly kind of rewatching repeating sequences and circling around.

I’m needing it to go somewhere and it being very cringe and repetitive for a long time.
    I'm having the same experience as you. I feel like I'm playing a different game than everyone else apparently.   
The game is a slog to get through and I suspect the visuals are getting everyone swept up in the hype.   
It's a very pretty backtrack sim and I solved some cases by just throwing random evidence on the board lmao
Alan wake 2? Nah, this is case board 1.
Holy cripes! I was expecting good reviews but was expecting more in line with Control, low 80's, wasn't expecting it to break 90%! This year keeps getting better and better.
96 on PC Jesus Christ. I want to play the first one and I have the remaster on Switch but heard it's extremely broken.
    > 96 on PC Jesus Christ.

Where are you seeing that? The highest I can find is 93 for PC on Metacritic.
        Aw shucks it's 92 now. Was 96 when I wrote that.
    > extremely broken.

its playable.
        That's good enough then.
The first score I saw on social media was a 2.5/5 from Game Rant so I'm curious to see if that's an outlier or not.
    Isn't that just a click bait site?
        It sure ain't what I would consider a premier site.

But its a wonderful reminder that some people just don't like some types of games.
            Yeah I don't want to imply that all outlier reviews are clickbait, I just see a lot of clickbait articles from gamerant whenever I open up Google Chrome lol. Almost every time.
can't wait to play it when it releases on steam. i might even have enough time to replay the first one and the control DLC!
God bless this year.
I've played Control and the Alan Wake DLC but not Alan Wake 1. Will I be able to understand what the hell is going on?
    Yes, because you are playing from POW of a character who didn't play Control and has no idea what's going on, and she finds her explanation as you play
    Although this being a sequal I think they have designed it this for also those people in mind who haven't played the first one. Actually I think jumping in to the shoes of the FBI agent would in this sense be even more immersive. First game was also a bit of a weird-fest (in a good way!) so even knowing what happened to Alan Wake in the first place may not explain everything.
Oh man. I was on the fence about this since I loved Control and really want to see what happens here and if it ties into that stuff at all. Now I might play it just cause it's an amazing game, apparently
Never played the original, should I start there? Game looks great
I can’t watch IGN reviews since their Amnesia The Bunker reviews spoil most of the game and it’s only a short one
Nice to see the high ratings! Personally I have zero interest in the game but for some reason I'm really rooting for it.
Thank god this game is doing well, it’s remedy’s dream game so they’ve reached developer nirvana right now, deservedly so!
With the graphics and gore and the fact the game isn’t rated by the very strict Australian classification board makes me think the all digital release may have more to it than meets the eye. 

I haven’t seen any news of this being censored in Germany either which seems surprising.
Hows the combat?
So does anyone know how good the replayability is on this game? I know crazy question but I really like replaying resident evil 2 remake lol
    They are adding new game+ and nightmare difficulty soon. As for now I'd imagine the replayability you'll get with it will come from your enjoyment of the world and characters until that update coming.
The gameplay is somehow way worse than the first alan wake. Dodging seems to not be the least bit helpful, and the critical zones on enemies is too small and often on their back? everything else is pretty fire minus the lack of a GPS or way to figure out where the hell to go.
I bet in 10 years we'll look back at 2023 as one of the best years in gaming. Especially for the horror genre.
    This year STARTED with Dead Space remake and we ate good ever since. 

This was the year of games getting me into genres I don't normally invest time intro. BG3 got me into crpgs. Dead Space got me into horrors. Street Fighter got me playing fighters every chance I get. Definitely one of my top 3 gaming years ever.
I get suspicious of sleeper titles getting hit reviews like this outta nowhere. It’s certainly atypical, you would think something with so much quality would receive more press and attention. And I’m not saying Alan Wake is a small IP, but compared to everything else that came out this year it just doesn’t have the same amount of steam. I just think of Deathloop now whenever something like this happens. That game certainly didn’t match the insane reviews it got.
How anyone still gives a damn about video game review magazines is beyond me. Especially after the Starfield disaster.
This is good news.  I loved the first one.  I look forward to playing this after the performance patch.
2023 continues to deliver. I’m kinda looking forward to November and December being mostly empty (except for Mario RPG) so I can actually have time to finish some of these games before the year is over lmao
No one said anything about the performance of the game just like they did with cyberpunk 2077. I'm not trusting any of these reviews
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JawxvOF__4Q
I'm confused by these reviews.

I finally finished the first this year, and the gameplay has aged very badly. The shine light/shoot mechanic just felt like a chore.

It does look fantastic, but if the gameplay is the same I can't imagine enjoying it.
    It has much less combat than the first, the second is more investigation/dialogues/walks. And the combat still uses the flashlight, but it is punchy and blunt, although you are fragile. It is a good game for the story and graphics, but it has little combat, and the investigation is not really puzzles. I prefer action games like Control but I'm also liking this one.
    It isn't the exact same at all.
        From the reviews above and the videos I've seen it still looks like you point a torch at enemies before shooting them?
Another incredible game to look forward to

In 2024

When I have time to play it 

I haven’t even gotten to Spiderman 2 Yet!
Has anyone found a review that mentions, if I need to play the first Alan Wake game to understand the story?
    They had said the new character is sort of designed to help new players understand the story. Remedy has also put out videos summarizing the story so far. I haven't personally watched it but probably a good idea before jumping in: https://youtu.be/uzocqRZzyoI?si=HmiOrZUV2KqQAFHp
    There's a video of Sam Lake recapping the story of Alan Wake this far, I recommend you give that a watch as it will help tremendously. 

Link here:

https://youtu.be/uzocqRZzyoI?si=LqLeyMKp2CaoKu7Y
    Sam lake himself said during the game awards trailer reveal that playing the original is not required as one of the two playable characters is new to the universe and learns the backstory along with the player.
    You probably won't understand it anyway
        Played through AW twice, Control twice, Quantum break has sadly been ignored still.... But end result is that I don't understand anything.
            [deleted]
                Yeah it's been on the todo list for ages.... it's just... so many releases atm that I barely have time to jump from one to the next without sacrificing other hobbies.
        What a bizarre thing to say...



Alan wake and control both make sense.
        To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Alan Wake. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Alan's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Alan Wake truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Alan's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Sam Lake's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have an Alan Wake tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
    You don't need to this is designed for people who didn't play a game that out 13 years ago. But obviously if you have then some emotional beats and fanservice will hit harder.
    You should, no question.
> the game serves as a riveting odyssey that pushes the boundaries of what a survival horror game can be

So hyped! I'm ecstatic and relieved that the reviews are looking really solid so far. Absolutely can't wait to jump in after such a long time since the first game.
I’m clutching my Alan Wake novelization and Collectors edition right now feeling so seen. I never thought we would get a true sequel, let alone one that’s garnering this much acclaim. Congrats, Remedy! You deserve it!
I am gonna buy and play it regardless of the reviews, because I played AW1 on release and I ADORED it, and then Control was awesome with DLCs, so I just need to know what happens next and how they are connected. But I am glad the reviews are positive. This is good. And I still need to finish BG3 first... And Elden Ring...
Most of the blurbs from the reviews gush about the graphics and story presentation, but very few mention gameplay and those that do lean towards the neutral to negative in what they have to say about it. I might give it a shot because I liked *Control* well-enough, but still hesitant.
Never played AW1 or Control, but saw a review headline that it was a really good game, saw it was fairly cheap.. so I said fuck it and bought it... and holy shit am I floored so far. I know Remedy from Max Payne, so I knew they were good, but holy damn. Just got to the morgue scene and had to nope the fuck out of the game. Gonna have to wait until its light out again before continuing.

But so far... wow, incredbily atmosphere, sound and visuals so far.
Waited so long for this man... feel like I'm gonna cry seeing all these great reviews. I never thought we'd actually get this game, let alone that it would be received this well... can't believe I finally get to play more Alan Wake.
I rarely buy games anymore but I feel like this one is worth the money. AW1 was incredible, cannot wait for this.
    There’s been about 20 games this year worth their money.
        I don't have money for 20 games.
Was going to buy this, but there is no physical copy release. Digital only. So screw that. I will come back to it in autumn 2024 when hopefully its reduced to £20. Would have paid full price for a physical copy. Wont do that for digital.
    It'll probably get a physical edition later down the road.
I keep slamming the pre-order button harder and it won't unlock any faster. :(

The DF tech review seems pretty glowing too, it's almost surprising that Remedy doesn't sell Northlight engine though maybe it just comes down to Remedy is really good at what they do.
If you don’t mind digital-only I encourage everyone to buy this game who wants to, that way Remedy might be inspired to release a physical edition which I wouldn’t mind paying full price for
    Lol, if there is any dev you don’t support with extra money up front it’s Remedy; still raw what they did to those of us that bought Control full priced edition day one
        I would not blame Remedy since that was publishers choice
        What did they do?
Why OpenCritic instead of Meta?
Well, the game looks great, runs smoothly on my system (i7 14700KF, RTX4070Ti), but it's no fun - totally lifeless, dead world, absolutely boring, cheap shit - that's a 3 out of 10, the graphics are an 11 out of 10

the “story” is total nonsense like a Stephen King film adaptation, it couldn’t be worse
    Yes but pretty games sell well for casual gamers
Fuck. Yes. Ordering this on PC right now.
I think the entire Saga portion was contrived. There is a major plothole to which I can point that proves this. Tor Anderson is supposed to be Saga's grandfather and Odin her great uncle or something. Their relationship is supposed to be one of the "real" parts of the story. Now Tor and Odin are also supposed to have some kind of psychic resistance to the dark force. Which means they can't be fooled by the story. Saga is also supposed to have this power. But the very first time they meet, one of them, Tor or Odin, I can't remember, says to Saga, so good to have you back here. This implies that Saga had a life in Watery, but Saga herself plain denies that. Now given how she has the "shining", her take that she never lived in Watery must be true. But then, Tor and Odin are also supposed to have the shining, then why do THEY wrongly remember Saga staying there? It's a paradox and I believe forced entry is to blame. It's really disappointing too because of how much Remedy prides themselves on narrative integrity. 


Side note: Alan runs like a b!tch in this game. Seriously, what's up with that animation and those swaying hips?
I haven’t played the first but I was surprised that this game seems heavily inspired by true detective. 

was the first the same?
    The first was all twin peaks
        Add a lot of Stephen King into that blender and you have the series. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully we don't have to wait 13 years for a sequel.
    No. It was based heavily on Twin Peaks and Stephen King. Where do you see the True Detective influence?
        https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/alan-wake-2-interview-true-detective-was-definitely-on-our-mind/
            Oh, I see, interesting. Well, the first game predates the show.
2023 has been a year of spectacular weal and woe, so I was kind of worried Akan Wake 2 would come out as a surprise dumpster fire. Instead it looks like 2023 just got even more stacked. Spectacular.
2023 is the Bad Dragon of GOTY contenders.

Just when you think there's no more

Just when you think they can't fit anymore in a tight space 

You keep gasping there's more
    This is a rather bizarre analogy.
    You don’t have to be edgy and make dildo analogies with everything you see
It’s interesting the high scores come from reviewed talking about Remdmey as some sort of lofty prestige dev and the ones that are critical treat them like a regular developer releasing a product.

I think there is a lot of outside the game context coloring these reviews.
    Remedy is kind of a cult developer like From Software used to be with certain people really gravitate to their strange style of making games. You're probably seeing the reviewers who are already big fans referring to them that way. Some people don't really click with them and they would probably just treat them like anyone else.
Seems quite similar to what everyone was saying about Control and look how much of a disappointing chore that turned out to be. 

I loved Alan Wake, aaaand I'm sure 2 mostly lives up to it. But I'm not buying this until it's half off. Nowadays everything looks great before release but only once You're balls deep you find out it's not that good and you got robbed. 

Pass lol not buying the hype
    Control is a masterpiece especially for combat. Alan Wake 2 is very different because it doesn't have as much focus on combat.
        There is not a single part of Control that's remotely close to masterpiece lol

Combat has fun moments. Nothing revolutionary.
Alright, I haven’t seen this anywhere - how long is it? If it’s just an 8-hour romp then there’s no way I’m paying full price for this.
    20 hours
this game is awful, I played for a hour and 55 minutes before refunding and only fought about 2 enemies and the combat boiled down to "press MMB, shoot them 10 times" The rest was just senseless puzzles that don't make sense to have in the middle of the woods and walking around.

I signed up for a survival horror game, not The Vanishing of Ethan Carter
Nothing is a cliché when it's happening to you. - Max Payne
    God I fucking love Max Payne
        I’d love a packaged re-release of all 3 games.
            You're in luck, at least for the first two. [Remedy is remaking both of them as one game](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-enters-agreement-with-rockstar-games-for-new-max-payne-12-project/).
                Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
                    Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
                        Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
                            Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
                            It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                                Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
                        On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.
                            MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
                        Its more about the availability. For people that aren't pc gamers its not very accessible for a lot of us.
                    I played through all three games on my Steam Deck a while back. Mac Payne 3 still holds up really, really well.
                    >I hope something gets done with 3

I'm hoping the stars will align and they'll somehow get the opportunity to make the third game they intended to make as they clearly had ideas to continue the story that were never realized.
                    Gunplay of Maxpayne 3 with hand to hand combat of the Warriers  for GTA6 But The Main Thing is the open World which is most important.
                Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Shit I'm excited about this.
                And then after Remedy makes a full remake of both games for modern consoles, Rockstar will drop a PS4 and XBOX port of Max Payne 3 without any changes (60$ of course)
        So does Remedy and Alan Wake
        What a good fucking series of fucking games. FUCK
        I still play them from time to time. Was one of the first games I got when I got my first non-crazy-outdated laptop and could actually play 3D games, played the hell out of one and two (the third hadn't been developed/released at that time). Just really solid gameplay with a lot of character IMO.
    [What a stupid fucking quote](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GD5mzJ7UrhA)
        Thats amazing lol. Fits right in with some of the meta stuff
    Also Remedy, can't wait for the Max Payne remake.
    Hell yeah pimp
I felt like his review was somewhat spoiler heavy, at least in regards to the opening hours. It ruined some moments I might have otherwise found surprising. 

Wouldn't recommend watching it if that matters to you.
    Thanks for the heads up! Pre-ordered it just now based on reviews. 14 hours until play time. Did not need spoilers.
    IGN reviews are always spoiler heavy and without warning, honestly I completely avoid them at this point.
Of all the ways I thought the original Alan Wake could be improved upon a skill upgrade system wasn't one of them. Odd choice to add one in.
    Yeah and honestly the worst part about Control for me was the upgrade system. It felt completely unnecessary and weird in a story-based game. Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities? It just felt like the game should have had you unlock them alongside the story, or just finding certain items gave you the ability, or gave you points to spend on an ability of your choosing. The weapon crafting was nonsense.
        I was mostly okay with the leveling system because it allowed you to do different stuff early on. Sure, by the time you were done with the game, you could unlock almost everything, but in the first half, putting points into flying vs. telekinesis vs. shields made the combat much different in repeat playthroughs.

But man, those weapon upgrades! There were what, five different Service Pistol modes, with 2 or 3 upgrade slots each? And then you'd get like a dozen upgrades for each mode, with no good way of sorting through them. Such a frustrating UI.
            And the upgrades have 6 levels and the game never stops giving you weak lvl 1 upgrades and you can only hold 24 so you have to clear them out. Control is one of my favorite games ever but this part sucks
            Yeah sorry I meant the gun upgrades. The skill upgrade system was fine. The gun upgrade/crafting system is insanely convoluted for no reason.

I kind of assumed there was DLC or a cash shop to make you pay for upgrade components but no... the system is just complicated for no reason at all.
        Here are the only useful mods - damage, headshot damage, 100% ammo refund on hit, instant sniper shot recharge. That's it, maybe damage after kill for someone really good. It's so poorly thought out. I wish the mods were also more interesting than you can make the recoil less annoying (we made it annoying by default).
            Oh yeah that was the other thing, 80% of the mods are worthless and/or boring so grinding through hundreds of them gets tiring.
        Yeah.. the skill tree is fine... the weapon/personal mod system is the only, frankly, terrible part of an amazing game. 

It goes against the pace of the game, it's mostly meaningless +X% upgrades, it takes a while for you to open more slots to put them in and the worst part is the small inventory. 

There's some good ones and they allow for flexible builds, that likely 99% of players will never use, but the implementation sucks.

I spent way too much time going through my inventory sorting through those mods deciding what to throw away so I could pick another one.

If they went to a separate stash at the hub, and or/you could combine the ones you collect to level them up it would be better. But just an infinite inventory would fix it, imo.
        > Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities?

i used a trainer to get all the abilities and realized it's not even worth it. even the highest levelled versions of most of the crafted items give you paltry single digit boosts.  
most pointless aspect of control imo
    Guessing it was a publisher note.  Some MBA who failed upwards came in and said "you know these other games have skill systems.  Our focus groups say people love those.  I want you to add one here."
    Really tired of these kind of systems. My brain always just assumes I picked the wrong thing and I'm missing out.
Wow that's a generous 7 for Callisto. Although, granted, the game somehow managed the incredibly rare feat of being made *worse* by its DLC.
    [deleted]
        Non-spoiler version: The main game ends on a sudden cliff hanger with a bunch of plot threads left open. The DLC resolves the cliff hanger in the most unsatisfying way possible while refusing to resolve or progress anything else about the plot.

Spoiler version: >!At the end of the main game, the space base is about to explode, the main character has one last chance to escape, but he is suddenly attacked. Cut to black.!<

>!In the DLC the main character fights his way out of the base and finally escapes. Except, no, that's a lie, he was actually fatally mutilated at the end of the main game and the DLC is just his dying hallucinations. He's dead, everything blows up, the end.!<
             They actually changed the DLC to this because the game performed so poorly. Even Glen Schofield left the studio after how bad it did. Which is a shame because I think if they added in enemy variety, tightened up the storytelling, and made the melee combat better it could have been a great franchise. The game was one of the most beautiful to come out, too bad that’s where all the money went.
                They should've just dumped the whole melee combat system focus and focused more on a variety of ranged weapons with the melee acting as an emergency fall back. I get why they did it like this, to force proximity to the enemies to add tension, but it just didn't work out. 

In trying to not be like dead space, the game that was designed to be a spiritual successor managed to fail in both departments.
                    I don't mind the focus on melee but the game just feels bad to play in general. I genuinely like most other things about it but man it's some awkward gameplay.
                It's a very pretty game but one big issue I have with the game that is a core aspect of it that you didn't mention is the level design. It's narrow corridor after narrow corridor. After playing the Dead Space remake, I just can't continue on with such a narrow linear level design.
            Wow. Im glad I didnt finish it despite being free on PSN.

The whole constant melee dodging is a terrible mechanic. Not sure how anyone thought that would be enjoyable the 10th or hundredth time
                It could've been a good system if it wasn't so janky.
        Shat on the story and basically took a vague ending of the main game into a definitive "no sequel even possible with these characters" ending
    The opencritic score for Callisto Protocol is 67, so IGN is right in line with the average critic score (that’s not a good or bad thing per se). And your opinion is just one opinion. I’d say a 7/10 is pretty fair because there were things I liked about the game.
        It's funny that when I read 67 I think "oof" but I see 6.7 I think eh ok not the worst game ever.
        I really disliked it, but would also give it a 6. So a 6-7 is pretty in line of what it should be rated
    Callisto had redeeming elements to it. I personally enjoyed it until I got burnt out on the combat 70% through. 

Definitely not a perfect game though.
    Hugely disagree, Callisto was flawed but a good time nonetheless. It had an underdeveloped plot and some irritating design decisions like the limited inventory and weirdly placed checkpoints, but the visuals, sound design and atmosphere were absolutely top tier. Add in some crunchy combat and some great performances from its cast and it was a fun ride. I'd give it an 8/10. While I agree the DLC's ending is an anticlimax (though I'm not sure what else they could have done to wrap up the story given they definitely weren't going to do a sequel), I actually thought the DLC overall was a big improvement on the main game. It added more gameplay variety and better pacing with the addition of puzzles, cool enemy types and some new weapons, plus an absolutely killer final boss. I think it really proved Callisto could be great if Striking Distance were given another chance. Real shame they won't.

    Quantum Break too.
    They're even more significant in Alan Wake. Revolving around a writer, cliches are one of the tools they will often use to drive the story. The original game was also laden with them, especially in cutscenes, where Alan would reach a point of safety but then suddenly something completely random would throw him out right back into the fray. Like when he's driving a car and all of a sudden a rockslide happens and throws him off the road. There's also a bit where you get on a helicopter after defending it from shadow people, and then soon after you take off you get thrown right back out of it for no real good reason.
        People may criticize the uses of cliches in Alan Wake, but at the very least it's clever how they wrote in a loophole to let them freely use cliches.

It isn't just that he's a writer, he's a writer who isn't used to writing horror at all (and his first attempt was in a fugue state while an evil darkness did the editing)
    Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing.  They can get tiring.  And using them to great effect in one game, doesn't presuppose you'll always use them to that same great effect all the time.
        > Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing. They can get tiring. 

So far Remedy has proven to be able to handle them pretty well though.
Really cool service you're providing here. Knowing how a reviewer ticks (and by that I do mean *reviewer* and not *platform that hosts reviews from all kinds of reviewers*) is pretty much essential to actually being able to build your own verdict based on the opinion of someone else.
What's AWE?
    A dlc for control which connects control with Alan wake
        Not only does it connect them, but the entire DLC is about Alan Wake and Bright Falls.  Definitely worth a quick playthrough before AW2, I think.
        Thanks
    Altered World Event
Horror/horror adjacent games usually don't review super well outside of the heavy hitters so even something like an 83 is a damn solid score.
    Wow, I didn’t play Control until 2020, but I’m shocked to hear it only scored 83. I thought it was incredible, and assumed it would have scored at least 90.
        Same. It was my personal Game of the Year when it launched on PC. It is also the game that convinced me of DLSS and Raytracing because it allowed for some truly stunning visuals on my old RTX 2070S.
            I tried Control a good while after launch (thanks Epic Games) but it almost instantly grew into one of my all-time favorites. It's just pure Remedy.
        I'm actually a bit bored by it. I'm about 6 hours in I think and getting lost seems to be common for me. really wish it was a bit easier to navigate. just thinking about having to spend time to figure out where I am right now makes me not want to play it unfortunately.
            It took me a while to adjust at first but the trick to navigating in Control is to pay attention to the signs on the walls, they actually are very direct.
            Control is a 5/10. Maybe a 6.5/10 on a good day when the combat doesn't seem repetitive as all hell and you're actually fighting enemies that don't look or behave identically everywhere.
        I think Control is a divisive game - I played it for free on PS plus during Covid lockdowns when not a lot of games were being released and I couldn’t force myself to finish it.
We are eating VERY good this year! Best year of gaming in a decade?
    2017 was pretty stacked with so many modern classics: BotW, Mario Odyssey (and the Switch launch in general), Hollow Knight, Persona 5 (international release), Nier Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn, RE7, Cuphead, Hellblade, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Metroid: Samus Returns
        This conversation is every thread now. Lol. 

It is accurate though. Lots of good games.
        This year blows 2017 out of the water, respectfully
            FR, everything from the cyberpunk expac to armored core to the deadspace remake has been fucking gold this year.
            Eh, there's been a lot of iteration this year. I enjoyed BOTW and DOS2 a lot more than TOTK and BG3 and in the latter's case I think it's just a worse game than DOS2.

Overall this year has a lot of 8/10s, not much that's blowing me away.
            I couldn't disagree more. I honestly haven't found too much I've really liked this year; RE4 Remake, Metroid Prime Remastered and the Xenoblade DLC is about it so far.
                It may not be your personal best year in gaming based on your taste, but in terms of the sheer number of games that have released to massive sales and critical acclaim it's certainly one of the best years in the past decade, if not the best.
        Yeah, that is the next closest I can think of.
    And the variation. 

Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Street fighter 6- fighting

Mario wonder- plattforming

Tears of the kingdom- adventure

Final fantasy- Rpg

Harry potter- adventure.

Spiderman 2 - action adventure with a lighter touch


What I miss is some great fps action. Something like Halo 1, 3 or infinite that I really liked.
        You are  missing the game of the year in that list with Baulders gate 3. Plus starfield and cyberpunk phantom liberty.
            Don't forget armored core 6, also I don't think cyberpunk should be running for goty since that is just a dlc and an update to the game.
            Really gonna add starfield to a list of greatest games ever released
                What are you talking about? The list was great games released this year, not of all time lol.
        > Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Don't forget Dead Space remake
        how could you forget Baldur's Gate, Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Armoured Core 6 and the most important of all GOTY Kong rise of skull island?
            Skull island is definitely the most innovative game of the bunch. Their inclusion of a jpeg shot in the middle of a cutscene?! That’s a game changer for the gaming industry
        Agreed, though listing FF16 as an RPG, especially when BG3 exists is questionable lmao.
            Haven't got around to BG3 yet but I thought Octopath II was better than FF16 as an RPG.
                I’m not hating on FF16 to be clear, I just don’t think it counts as an RPG lmao, it’s an action game with some light RPG elements at best. 

I haven’t played Octopath II, maybe I should.
        Cyberpunk comeback and the new expansion for that FPS hit maybe? Cyberpunk after this redemption arc turned out to be my most favorite game of all time tbh.
        Very long time since we’ve had a 10/10 FPS and it’s hard to do, even Sony hasn’t had a crack at one in 10 years
        FF16 is not an RPG, no matter what it purports to be. It is a single player semi-open world action game with a quest structure.
        Cyberpunk & Phantom Liberty especially ould definitely cover that FPS part for you I promise
    GOTY in any other year:
RE4, TOTK,BG3, Mario, dead space, Metroid prime, phantom liberty, Jedi survivor, FF16, Spider guy 2, armored core 6 and now this thing. 

Oh yeah, we ate well this year goddamn!
Control is probably my favorite game of all time, esp with the lore and worldbuilding, so this game is probably going to make me lose my shit.
    I love Control and I think Jesse Faden is an underrated protagonist. Without getting into too many spoilers I really enjoyed how she just dove into what was happening. Too many stories have reluctant protagonists who complain about the situation. So, it was nice seeing a character thrown into a strange situation that just rolled with and got to work.
        Not sure I'd call it a "dive".  She's pretty clearly been living a weird, odd life since childhood and has been seeking answers and expecting an escalation for years. 

Have never understood the complaints about unwilling protagonists, but I'm not the type to demand unabashed power trip fantasies and faulty logic in all of my fiction.
            I don't really see the connection between unwilling/willing protagonists and power fantasies. They are two mostly unconnected qualities for characters. You can have power fantasies with reluctant protagonists or you can have power fantasies with willing protagonists.
        I think you’re right in regard to diving in. I think her experiences in Ordinary helped make her more accepting to her new reality too.
    Ironically the lore got a bit naff for me in the end. I stopped caring after picking up the 101th note about some random and not very interesting SCP type stuff. 

I still rate the game very highly, and the gameplay and setting were very well done imho. But it was the first Remedy game where I thought that the story and characters (up until the DLCs) were the games weakest elements by some distance.
        [removed]
        They really needed those pseudo-audio logs - calls on the phone and whatever - to be able to play over gameplay, rather than accessed and listened to in a menu.
            Agreed. I will NEVER understand games that don't allow us to move as we listen to audio logs. It is punishment of the highest order.
        Yeah same. Like, I still really enjoyed the atmosphere and the worldbuilding stories, but I feel like the game kinda lost the plot and didn't answer many questions by the end. I still fucking love that game though.
        Man I fucking hate when storytelling is done nearly exclusively through fucking memos and audio logs. It annoys me to no end and really makes me feel disconnected.
        Very well put. 

Easily the weakest characters I've seen in a Remedy game but the atmosphere, graphics and to a lesser extent the combat made up for it. 

Fun game but 8/10 *max* IMO.
            I feel like if they'd made Jesse more punk like in their original vision, and had her be significantly angrier at the FBC, she would have landed a lot better.
    Control is one of my all time favorites as well so I'm really looking forward to AW2.  I'm not usually a fan of horror games at all, but I expect I will enjoy this game as it's in the same universe.  Like you said, their worlduilding is amazing.

I just hope the performance is fine.
        From all the reviews it seems the performance is pretty good everywhere. I’m excited to get nuts on PC tonight.
    Not my all-time favorite game (that's way too competitive), but the lore and notes you read along the way were the best in the business. From straight up horror to "The Office"-like bureaucratic comedy, I couldn't get enough of the lore. Read every word on every scrap I found.
> 93 average now 92 90

now 89. Must have been some *extra* enthusiastic outlets who were ready at the embargo minute.
> Control landed at an 83 and I LOVED it.

Control had a **lot** of technical issues and I wonder if that was a big part of why. I played it on an xbox one and it was just issue after issue after issue.

The fact that I played the whole game anyway is really a testament to how great the game was.

(I imagine everyone who played on better hardware had a better go of it, which is why there wasn't quite the same outrage for other big releases with lots of bugs)
    Ignoring technical issues my issue with Control its stupid design decisions such as having 5 guns but only being able to equip 2, having gaming's most useless map combined with gaming's most confusing level design, there being no difficulty settings while also having a fucked up difficulty curve, and no autosaves.

It's like Remedy decided the game was too good so they had to ruin it in a few places. It was so close but so far from greatness.
I can't wait to play it, but I'm worried that sales will be lackluster since it's not being sold on the largest marketplace in the world.
Control was one of the best surprises to come out in recent memory. I always had a lot of love for remedy’s game but often came with some glaring issues. Control just did everything it wanted to do right.
These are so obviously paid reviews. I hope you played the game yourself. What do you think now?
> I’m just waiting for information about the PS5 performance before purchasing. 

DF PS5 Tech review
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JawxvOF__4Q
    glad to see it hitting 60 FPS most of the time.

Gonna take a fat ass nap after work today and let it pre load then play this all night
        If you are in Europe i am afraid you cant play until the morning :( i'm in the same boat i think unlock time is somewhere 7am really annoying and i don't want to play a horror game in daylight. So i need to wait until Friday evening.
            that’s a bummer man, fortunately (for once) I’m in the Midwest US. 11PM for us.

The really lucky fucks on the west coast get it at 9
        I'd still recommend playing it at 30 on consoles
    Great username
Should give Control a try if you haven't. Very different game but technically takes place in the same universe.
    Played through twice! On release on console and this year on Steam Deck.
I agree. I love the first. The Pacific Northwest setting played a huge part in that for me too. Anything set there automatically gets bonus points for me. 

I get chills even thinking about it honestly
Props to you i remember feeling incredibly tired of the gameplay by the end of it. I tried playing american nightmare and was just over it. 

The narrative was super fun but gameplay was so stale by the end of it I still have never managed to replay it since 2012.
    Just beat the first one again in anticipation of the sequel, and that's a hard agreed from me. There are five enemies in the entire game. 

Normal guy 

Fast guy 

Big guy 

Inanimate object 

Bird
        Uh, excuse you bud, you forgot Chair Guy and Bug-Looking Flashlight Head.
    I felt exactly the same. The game just stops introducing new mechanics, like, a third of the way in? You're just using the ever the same "strategy" of pointing your flashlight and then shooting your gun at enemies in every single encounter, over and over and over again, with nothing that really breaks up that pattern.

Even though the gunplay/combat definitely feels good at first (where you really feel the Max Payne roots), that feeling passes halfway into the game, and then you still have like 6 hours to go.

Luckily they managed to avoid this in Control.
        To be honest: if the core gameplay loop is actually great, you don't really need any new mechanics after a certain point.
            AW's gameplay is anything but great
            That's the problem, it isn't that great. The gameplay is pretty meh.
                Alan please start doing cardio so you can run for more than three seconds.
        yeah i dropped it when i realized the gameplay was going to be the same atrocious slog all the way through, i did enjoy the atmosphere though

maybe will look at this on a deep sale or something
            I wouldn't go as far as calling it an atrocious slog. As I said, the gameplay fundamentals are actually pretty decent, it just doesn't carry the game for the entire duration of the story. It almost feels like this story is in the wrong medium.
    [deleted]
    Same. I tried doing this thing where I was going to go through my Steam backlog from A to Z and try to finish every game in it that looked fun that I hadn't yet played. I started with Alan Wake. By the time I'd finished Alan Wake I was so bored to tears by the repetitive, tedious gameplay that I abandoned my little project right then and there.
    Played it through when it went on PS+ for the first time. Even understanding that it's 13 years old at this point, like 2/3rds of the game is the same mechanics in the same dark woods. Not a ton of enemy variety, bosses were mostly the same too. Story was pretty good, even for 13 years old.
I just watched through Digital Foundry’s video on the ps5 version, performance seems pretty good overall. I recommend checking it out if you’re considering that version of AW2!
There is a digital foundry video out.

https://youtu.be/JawxvOF__4Q?feature=shared
U should buy it lol
I only played AW once at release, and one of the few things I recall is a sequence where you and a buddy are on a rock stage with fireworks going off and you're just shotgunning monsters to a dope soundtrack.
I got into AW1 so much that this became my favorite version of the Happy Birthday song to sing at close friends and family's birthday parties:  https://youtu.be/hzeNCCdu5Wc?t=490

    Obvious choice for the current gen consoles. 

But I’ve recently also replayed parts of the original on my Steam Deck, and on that screen it still holds up pretty well.
Remedy is one of my all time favorite game studious. The games they have put out have hit me harder than I can even convey. And this goes back to before I even realized who they were with Max Payne 1 & 2. The way they tell a story and the way they focus on gameplay and pushing forward the tech. To the people complaining that DLSS was being used as crutch for putting out an "unoptimized" game don't know who Remedy is (and likely don't actually know what optimization really is and just use that as a buzz word for a seemingly demanding game).
Depending on where you look the Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 Remakes are equal or higher.
    Alan Wake 2 sitting next to RE2 and RE4... I could cry :'))))
    That's amazing. Alongside Silent Hill 1 those are my favorite horror games.
        Holy shit...I've found a rare silent hill fan that doesn't go "Blah Blah Blah, silent hill 2, BLAH BLAH BLAH!"
So far it's the same as the original Silent Hill 2, both sitting at 89.
    Silent Hill 2 deserved more than 89. It’s one the best games of all time.
Resident Evil 2 and 4 remake might be higher I think
    Alan Wake being in the same company as these two warms my heart.
        I’ve never played a remedy game but Alan Wake 2 looks super cool. When I get a ps5 this holiday it may be one of the first games I pick up
I originally thought you said it “wasn’t the highest” and I was like… a 90 for a horror game is still very impressive! But then I realized I misread
What I like about Sam Lake and Remedy is that they are good storytellers who aren’t afraid of delving into total absurdity. The stories and settings in these games are so idiosyncratic but there’s human drama at the center which is authentic enough to hold it together.
    It's crazy because before even knowing Control was a remedy game I thought it was going to be a poorly executed SCP fan-fic. Not only does the world building and character design stand on its own but even their SCP's are fresh and scary to read about
Agree. Sam Lake and co are some of the best and most creative writing force out there in the industry.
    Can’t wait for Control 2
        Imagine an Alan Wake DLC but it features Jesse Faden.
            They could call it Alan Wake 2: JFE 

Control: AWE was Altered World Event, but we all really know it stood for **A**lan **W**ake **E**xpansion
                Or as I call it the Alan Wake Experience
                    Alan Wake Experience was one of my favorite bands from the late 60s lol
            Full circle!
    They’re basically outdoing twin peaks style David lynch writing at this point. They’re great.
Hope Lake gets more love. Consider how much people hold Kojima on gold standard, it is strange Lake has not gotten that much love or appraise considering how long he has been in the game and constantly pushing the limits of story, story telling etc
    I've actually hosted a fireside interview with Lake once on stage and he is one of the most down to earth bigger names from gaming I've met. Absolute class, that man.  
Funny, respectful and with great insights.  

Absolutely one of my favourite memories from the time I did those gigs.
    I was just telling someone that I felt that Sam Lake is like a western Kojima, both so full of creativity and passion for storytelling even if they're not exactly the best writers in the world.
    Kojima benefits from the execution and presentation of his games. If his crazy narratives and cinematics were replaced by text (like low budget games do), no one would read that shit.
I don’t think Lake is an extraordinary writer but he’s clearly much, much better and more widely read than your average game writer (whose main experience seems to be running DnD campaigns and maybe writing YA fanfiction, judging by their writing) and that makes Remedy’s games so much more interesting. 

Rockstar is kind of similar, I love RDR2 but the second to second dialogue isn’t masterful (most of the time, there are exceptions), it’s more that Houser, Unsworth and Humphries clearly have wide ranging tastes in fiction, especially film and literature, that range beyond the generic pop-sci-fi-fantasy schlock that most videogame writers clearly hold dear. 

You play GoW Ragnarok and it’s like someone who wrote thinly veiled Harry Potter or Hunger Games fanfic for a living spent a few hours with the Wikipedia page on Norse mythology. Remedy and Rockstar have writers who understand things beyond genre fiction, even if they’re writing genre fiction.
    I think Sam Lake has mentioned that he took time to go study screenwriting between Max Payne 1 & 2. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but I think he's put effort into actually learning writing in terms of craft.
    Finally, I'm not the only one who thinks GoW Ragnarok is weirdly written. I clearly saw how Cory Barlog's hand hadn't touched this game, everyone talks like a modern American from Watch Dogs or Spider-man. Those moments like Odin saying "my ex" or Kratos's "I don't want snacks" are so off. Odin's whole acting is like he is from Woody Allen movie
        Ragnarok felt like such a dip in quality story telling wise. I get they wanted to do a duology and I do respect the fuck out of that decision but they crammed in too much into one package. Towards the end it felt like plot beats were there to be checked off and then it was on to the next.
            This was my main complaint of the game too. The titular “ragnarok” event itself was crammed into like the last 20 minutes of the game. I really enjoyed the build up to it but damn they couldn’t deliver on their huge promises

That and you have these weird slow moments like everything with Angrboda where the game just haults. It felt like the MJ segments in spider-man

I’m fine with a slow buildup but there were so many whiplash moments where the game was both rushed and also bogged down by too many storylines
                Right? I had that same thought about the actual Ragnarok event. We’re building to this whole event and then oh hey bye it’s over. 

The rumor is that they debated making Ragnarok 1 or 2 games (so that the whole thing would have either been a duology or a trilogy with GoW 2018) and I think that they made a real mistake by not making it a trilogy. The story in Ragnarok is told at an absolutely breakneck pace, but not in a good way - they tried to put way too much in. 

Even the big emotional plot twist death (which I’ll keep vague just in case people haven’t played) felt so rushed to me. It was just like “oh whoa welp they’re dead now anyways moving on” and I honestly didn’t even really care that they died. That should have been the emotional finale to the second game, and then the third game should have focused entirely on the Ragnarok event itself.
        I love the Voice Actor for Odin and I like his performance overall but yeah there were a few odd lines here and there. 


Really the game should have been split, but I understand why they didnt.
            I mean, it's good acting, I wrote about writing, not the performer. Good actors speak in Marvel "Illumi-what-ti" style and that was really bad.
        God the actual spoken dialogue was such a disappointment to me in Ragnarok. I remember right from the beginning when Odin refers to Freya as his “ex” that I wasn’t going to love the dialogue. And that’s not to say that the dialogue in the first game was perfect, but it definitely felt different
            The question that always comes to me when I see comments like this is one of curiosity, what would you have said instead? Genuinely it always interests me when I see topics like this come up.
                I’m not even going to pretend that I’m skilled as a writer, so I honestly don’t know. But saying the phrase “my ex” is such a modern way of speaking and that’s what takes me out of it because that’s not how the game is framed. It we’re talking about a game like Immortal Fenix Rising, or hell even the animated Disney Hercules movie, the modern way of speaking works there because it’s in line with the overall presentation and “vibe” of the media. But God of War 2018 (and Ragnarok) play things _so_ straight, so to hear super modern dialogue/speech patterns in a game that’s trying to present a somewhat realistic/grounded take on this mythology just feels really out of place
        Odin was so disappointing in Ragnarok.

>!His boss fight was really underwhelming too, could have had him transform into Kratos, or Atreus, or Tyr, or any number of more interesting things than just having him fight you with a spear and bit of magic. Doesn't make any sense how Kratos couldn't just tear him into pieces instantly.!<

Think the game as a whole was pretty weak.
            Ragnarok really sucked compared to the previous game. Felt very “marvel”ised at a risk of sounding a bit circlejerky
                Ragnarok didn't suck.  The boss fights were a letdown, and the story was not anywhere near as good.  But the combat was way better/smoother than the first.
                    I don't remember any boss from the first game other than the first baldur fight and the dragon 🤷‍♂️ that was always my biggest complaint from it. So idk how anyone could think Ragnarok did them worse. Like thor and the Gryla fight more than made up for that imo.
                        For me the final Baldr fight with Freya controlling the giant, and the Valkyrie Queen fight were good standouts as well.
                        Because honestly, they’re still a letdown from previous GoW games.
                            Hey kids you like quick time events???
                    “Ragnarok really sucked compared to the first game”

Important distinction if you read this back
            I thought the game was great with the exception of the ending. So much potential crammed into a rushed set of sequences and underwhelming boss fights.
            Yes, pretty mediocre game. I think, it was rushed, it felt in every storyline. New characters appear, drama around them out of nowhere, Freia (who hunted Kratos between games) becomes good in like 1 mission
        I didn't think the writing in the first GoW was that special either, but Ragnarok's was especially bad. You're definitely not alone there. I felt like I was playing a Marvel film.
            I remember it being more subtle (like BOY through the game) and smart. One liners didn't feel forced and sometimes Kratos was just silent. In Ragnarok it was too usual for Marvel writing and all the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)
                >the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)

He doesn't say that though. He just says "i fucked up"
        Vehemently disagree, I thought this version of Odin was phenomenal. Richard Schiff is a wonderful actor and I think it was a stroke of brilliance to get the guy who played the white house comms director from West Wing to play the character. Highlighted the difference of styles between Kratos and Odin, one who mostly wins with might and the other who manipulates and deceives.
        Ex is a term dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. Snack dates back to the 1500s. Odin is well read and due to partaking in the Well of Knowledge he knows every language. Just because you aren't familiar with casual dialect in other languages doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
    The medium and the team at Remedy have a lot of credit for how well the narratives play out in my opinion. As you say, I don’t think Sam Lake is a bad writer by any means but the way the stories are told elevate them to a different level. I’m really *really* looking forward to this game because the atmosphere and writing make for a very awesome experience.
    Can you really say it's the lack of Barlog, tho? Both games had the same lead writers, it's just that Ragnarok had clearly more involved junior writers, too. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was still strong for a mass appeal game, if a bit plain in prose overall.

If anything, the only one whose influence you can taste like unsavoury candy was fucking Anthony Burch. The Joss Whedon of video game writing, without the 1 in 10 successful jokes Whedon manages, somehow.
        Both Anthony Burch and Cara Ellison wrote for Ragnarok and have mostly poor, overly-online-trope/reference type writing, sure. 

Whedon’s style was refreshing once upon a time, it’s just aged, stale and overused now. Audiences are tired of it.
            I'm not familiar with Ellison's work and Burch is yeah... well, very, very unfortunate choice for any serious story. And Whedon, man. Buffy was my jam, but he now lives rent-free in my head for the irreperable damage he caused to American writing industry with The Avengers (2012) template of quips and quirky writing.

But my point was I don't feel like it's apparent lack of Barlog in Ragnarok. His career history is of a game director from God of War II, not a primary writer. It certainly never felt like there was a point where I would compare him to, like you said, Lake or Houser. Maybe in cinematic department.
                I can definitely argue that Anthony can do serious. His storyline in Dungeons and Daddies gets surprisingly serious, but God of War isn't the right setting for him.
                    I can agree on point that he can do serious story, he wrote Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but even then he did \*hammy\* as fuck writing. Which is what didn't make him right for a story that takes itself seriously as GoW Reboot.

If he does it better on his podcast, I'll take your word for it, but for me he's still 2012 9gag level of humour from Hey Ash!
                        This is fair. His use of language is too modern for something more period period like GoW.
        Joss Whedon of video game writing is very accurate lol, the Atreus and Sindri sections were pretty brutal for me. Felt like some cheap MCU knockoff, the dialogue was just all snarky quips. Got annoying real fast
    Yeah, you are savage but right. Control is incoherent and extremely hokey, and by no means a display of rigorous storytelling. Which is blasphemy on this sub, I know. But Remedy excels in atmosphere, and all of their games have very lived-in worlds that are interesting to explore. I think Lake is good at playing to the tropes of the genres he's working in, but more importantly he's supported by a team that does excellent art direction, music, etc. that sells the atmosphere.
        I think it's completely fine for stories to be incoherent in a traditional sense, and it makes complete sense that Remedy games are like that since they take so much inspiration from David Lynch's work.
            For real. Half of Alan Wake is like a love letter to Twin Peaks.
            I think it's fine to enjoy the pulpiness of Control's writing but I don't think it gets close to the level Lynch is capable of. He's one of the most celebrated filmmakers ever for a reason.
                Sure, but is Lynch considered one of the most celebrated writers in the industry ever? I'd argue no, and he's my favourite filmmaker.


That's not to say that Sam Lake is as good as Lynch is, but I do think Lynch is also so much more about atmosphere and mood than he is focused on writing structured and coherent screenplays, or defined character arcs and such.
                I think the real trick and talent with them is they can make things cheesey without undermining the game itself, like, the game can have fun and be silly while also always fully believing in its world and its characters. Like when Control has Darling do a fuckin Dynamite cover from beyond the Nth dimension to cheer Jesse on I'm giggling like an idiot, but also buying that this is something Darling the person would do, and when it throws that Computer Program Dead Letter at you in the Foundation man I genuinely started crying, just the overall presentation of stumbling onto something so sad and personal in the form of some forgotten, misplaced government paperwork. And through all that they made a game where those two things can be part of the same experience, which imo is a generally impressive bit of ability. It's not moment-to-moment screenwriting excellence, but I think it is a form of writing skill, writing and assembling a whole, cohesive, and intentional vision for a script that's not for film, or TV, or a novel, but a video game specifically. Rather than, say, trying to smuggle a B-tier Oscar bait screenplay into a medium with lower standards where the impression of prestige television can carry you.
    I agree that the dialogue in GoWR is pretty bad, but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers. The bigger problem to me seems to be the tone of the game, which is definitely a game design and marketing choice more than it is a problem with specific writers.

I'm sure the tone of Ragnarok was largely decided on as a whole, probably very shortly into development.
        > but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers.

They deserve the harshness, I don't see why we can't hold games to the same standards as film or literature.
            Comparing to films or literature is something people who have no idea how game writing works say. 

Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement. 

Films have more people involved, but are still far easier than games due to the smaller team size and the fact you can write stuff like "They take their shirt off" or "They hand over an object" and an animation team doesn't come and say "Ha, yeah, we can't do that."

Film and literature are breezes in the park comparably for writers.
                > Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement.

These are definite differences, good writing is often an afterthought after gameplay and graphics, but I'm still going to hold games to the same standard. I will judge them for poor characterization, awkward dialogue, stilted acting, etc, though I'll place most of the blame on the directors/producers for tolerating these during production. 

Game directors like Miyazaki at From Software and Neil Druckmann at Naughty Dog have shown that good writing in AAA games is possible (though Miyazaki's better at storytale unique suited to videogames, Druckmann's just got at supervising naturalistic dialogue and acting), and there are plenty of well-writen indie games.

If gamers are happy with slop and don't raise any criticisms, they'll continue to get slop.
            Because they're working for a large corporation making games that are basically blockbuster movies. And to be honest most AAA games are written better than your average blockbuster.

Like they're not auteurs. This isn't Tarkovsky.
    Same with Spider-Man 2, it's a great game but the story is well-worn and tired and the characters all act the exact same.
        I think the thing is that at the time of Uncharted 2 when Sony games started with this kind of writing, games that were written as well as the average Marvel movie were genuinely like 95th percentile as far as game stories went. But as the industry matured they often now feel a little generic, immature, sometimes cringeworthy, and often insincere.
            I think Sony and Naughty Dog specifically should get a lot of credit for at least being progressive in trying to write a good story. I do think TLOU2 tried too hard and other Sony titles (Horizon, Spider-Man, GoW) are being overrated for their storytelling.
        That’s my main problem with the game too. Just feels like I‘m watching the Raimi movies again but with more quips, less laughs and none of the charisma. 

Also doesn’t help that I enjoy Miles as a character more than Peter, but he is really just kinda there and occasionally helps out with stuff.
He isn't just a Sam Lake, he's a Sam Ocean.
There's obviously a *ton* of great writing in Western indie games, but as far as AA/AAA games go, I wholeheartedly agree. Like, leaps and bounds beyond even Sony's 1st party offerings.
Control definitely pulled me in more than AW, but goddamn you’re right about worldbuilding. Art direction in these games is also top notch.
I honestly think Rockstar did Max Payne a lot better than Remedy - which I mean you can't really have Max Payne in 3 without the versions in 2 and 1 but still
    I've played through Max Payne 3 more times then I care to admit.
        It's the GOAT for me in terms of 3rd person shooters. Nothing has ever exceeded it, I really hope we get a port for Switch, and I also hope Remedy take inspiration from 3 for its remakes of the first two games.
    Totally disagree. It tried so hard to emulate 1 & 2's writing but just fell on its face. 

Gameplay was awesome though.
        felt like i was taking crazy pills with that take. story and presentation was far better in the previous games.
    Max Payne 3 wasn't a Max Payne game to me at all. It was a perfectly fine *something else*. It didn't feel like the same character and the change in story-telling took away one of MP's most appealing qualities.
    Max Payne 3 was amazingly well-written. 

It might be my favorite example of (in any medium) a writer taking someone else's established premise, characters, and voice, and evolving them in interesting and worthwhile ways.
        They just took Max Payne and put him in Man On Fire with some forced noir tropes and dialogue. I'd hardly call it an evolution.

    Yup! Updating original post with that and a link to DF.
The Digital Foundry video mentions that both modes use FSR2 to upscale to 4k (or 1440p in performance mode) from much lower resolutions. The main issue is that the image looks somewhat soft, but the end results generally still look good and tend to hit their target framerates outside of stress areas (where quality mode dips to ~27fps for stretches, and performance mode into the low 50s in the same areas)
I don't know the exact details so I might be wrong, but from what I saw the pc specs were relatively high because the studio chose to use a specific technology that older cards just don't support. It's not that a GTX 1080 is too weak to handle all that processing, but that it doesn't have the physical component in it that is made to support this technology. Like how only RTX cards have the physical components that can calculate the DLSS stuff.

I think I even saw someone mention that there are some weaker cards, like 1650 I think that can handle this game since they came out after the stronger 1080 with the new component
    Yeah, the issue is that older cards don't support mesh shaders which Alan Wake 2 requires.


Honestly, I'm not too bothered on the Nvidia side. Not supporting 1000-series cards that are 7 years old is like "bummer, but okay". On the AMD side it's a bit more of an ouch, since only the 6000 and 7000 series are supported, with the unsupported 5000-cards only being ~4 years old.
        We'll have to see how the 2060 does then in testing, because the 5700 XT, the fastest of that generation on the AMD side, was in the 2060, 2060 Super, 2070 ballpark, depending on game. AW2's specs for the 2060 are for 1080p. 30 fps, and using DLSS quality, but the lowest other settings.

So, from the sounds of things, even if the 5700 XT had the hardware to run it, it probably wouldn't be a great experience. Playable? Probably. A good experience? Maybe not...
    Basically Microsoft adopted features into DX12 ultimate which the 1000 series cards didn't support because they were four years old by 2020. 

It's perfectly fine for remedy to exclude them. This is like when devs would release games as dx11 only and some older cards would miss out. The 1000 series cards are also now older than a traditional console generation
    A gtx 1080 is too weak is 2023 regardless
        Seems like some people expect that card to be good until the year 2060.
Seems like a good sign of a well-optimized game with incredibly demanding specs then? All those old thread is about to be funny thread soon.
It's fucking wild that my ps5 will run this game better than my more powerful pc.
    https://twitter.com/Dachsjaeger/status/1717528516739117498?t=fy_SFLSVfQn8I5GDaB46AA&s=19

According to Alex from Digital Foundry, your PC will definitely outperform PS5 if it's more powerful.
    or the PC specs were overblown.
    Okay, so Digital Foundry has uploaded their analysis, and the quality mode is ~1270p upscaled to 4K and ~874p upscaled to 1440p (both using FSR 2) which is... okay.
        While many PC specs are unoptimized bs, I think people rarely make fair comparisons between PC and console. Console specs are often treated as native when more often than not there's a heavy use of FSR. 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people yet it's completely normal in PS5.
            > 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people

Would it? That's just 1440p with DLSS quality, that's a pretty normal combo.
Yeah. I’ve heard it’s a good game and got it for free on ps4 and pc actually due to epic games
Or ps * haven’t played it yet but after all the pride in this thread I will. 

What’s better for it, console or pc?
    Control was basically a graphics showcase for raytracing technology a few years back, so you'll want to play it somewhere you can take advantage of that. If your PC can push the graphics options, I'd probably recommend that over PS4.
    A note on PS5 RTX: it's there and it's actually quite good, but you sacrifice a lot of frames in a pretty fast paced action game, so I tended to prefer playing with it off.

On PC though, especially now after a lot of optimization, it's still one of the best Ray-Tracing implementations years later.
I didn't really mesh with Control very well, I liked the setting but not the cast and the gameplay honestly peaks pretty early when you get Launch and kinda goes downhill for another 10+ hours of actual game. All the other powers are bland, like a Shield or Mindjacking enemies. You are limited to two weapon forms at once, which is beyond stupid considering both forms share the regenerating ammo pool so its not like 2 vs 6 weapons avaliable via radial wheel would change anything. It just means I find 2 things I sorta liked and never swap off.

Also as a pure shooter, it doesn't even feel as good as Quantum Break.
4, mate. You forgot Skull Island: Rise of Kong
    That isn't even being nominated, the GOTY award is already in the mail to their offices.
        Needed that laugh. Thanks mate.
    That's not a nominee because it would be too obvious a winner
        All hail the king!
            Don't say King! King Kong is copywritten. This is just Kong. All hail the Kong.
It’s apparent at this point this is definitely one of the best years in gaming in a long time, we’ve been so fed the last few months with so many games living up to the hype.
    October is always crazy for games but this is on another level.
    But don’t you know? Everyone on Reddit says “wahhhhhh gaming is so bad now, I miss the SNES”. And not that there’s anything wrong with loving SNES games, but this whole narrative of “gaming is so bad now” are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new
        Oh yeah, the boomers of gamers :D
        >are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new

to be fair the new COD MW3 remakes looks terrific
Lies of P was recent too

Actually that was a month ago... jeez with so many games coming out time is also flying by
    New Forza was good. We got a new Street Fighter and new Mortal Kombat this year. Fuck, even the 20-year old EVE Online is seeing a resurgence with its fall expansion content. CRAZY year for gaming.
        Momentum carrying over to next year as well. Tekken 8 and FF7 Rebirth baby
            Alone in the Dark in February too
Spider Man, this game and what's the third?
    Mario Wonder
    Gollum
    Mario Wonder
    King Kong
Ghostrunner 2?
In what world are any of these GotY worthy in a year that we had Zelda and BG3?
[deleted]
    It's one of the highest rated of the year so yeah, I think it definitely counts as one.
        Not disagreeing, but this year was so stacked it might just miss out on a nomination.

Dead Space remake
RE4 remake
Tears of the Kingdom
Spiderman 2 
Mario Wonders
Maybe Hi-Fi Rush
Streefighter 6
+maybe others I can't remember suddenly

Iirc there are only 6 nominees, so it's gonna be though to even get nominated. Other games like Lies of P and Jedi Survivor that'd've probably made it in other years have no chance this year.
            Yeah I think it will miss out too - BG3 is missing from your list and I think that and Starfield have more chance of being nominated than RE4 remake or Dead Space remake, remakes feel like waste of slots in such a stacked year

I think the shortlists will be something like BG3, Spiderman 2, Starfield, TOTK, Super Mario Wonder, Street Fighter 6/Alan Wake 2/Hifi Rush for the last slot
John from DF said PC version is "perfect":
https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1717532308402565274

And Alex said it scales very well (PC video tomorrow):
https://twitter.com/Dachsjaeger/status/1717528516739117498

Seems like a really good PC release for once.
    It's ironic that We got one good PC port for once and half the playerbase on PC can't play it lmao

Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.
        > Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.

I wouldn't go that far. The minimum requirement for this game is a 5 year old GPU. When Crysis came out, a 5 year old GPU would be lucky to run *any* AAA release that year.
        Crysis's issue is that they targeted single core performance just as the market shifted to focusing on multithreading. That means in practice it ends up acting unoptimized to a real world usecase.

Alan Wake 2, just like Control, appears to be extremely fine tuned in terms of optimization for real-world device expectations and runs well on low end cards (released after the shift to the mesh shader support).
            i finally caught onto the control train a week or two ago, and was shocked how well the game ran. i have a 3060ti and was able to run it at ultra and ray tracing everything and it never even stuttered, perfect 60 fps basically all game.
        The only thing consoles do better than PC is that nobody expects the PS4 to run PS5 games well, if at all, and yet people with hardware from last generation are salty they can’t play today’s titles.
Before DF releases a more in-depth analysis, take a look at this guy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMHxkrABRNs&t=1369s). He tests various graphics settings of the game across different GPUs. Worth a watch.
It's good remedy are getting the console version in the limelight after controls rocky launch.
I expected a 75-80, especially with all the  doomsaying about the PC performance. A 93is absolutely insane, and could land this among the already insane list of GOTY candidates for 2023.

Will wait for a PC focused outlet's review like PC Gamer before I fully make up my mind about it tho.
    Maybe don’t listen to the doomsayers…
I believe Alex tweeted that his video will be out tomorrow, and remarked that the concern was overblown, so I expect overall good news.
Preordered vinyl cause it’s gonna be something!
Video games take several years to make, and many (if not all) of these games were already in development when the pandemic started. Three years is basically the absolute minimum for a AAA title. So I doubt this really had anything to do with it. Some years are just good years for gaming. If anything, delays from COVID affecting development teams might have just made release dates all align for this year.
    Agreed. Covid had an indirect effect if anything to align releases.
That might be it, also games releasing in 2020-2021 were really hampered *late into development* by the pandemic, so they were often unfinished or buggy.

These 2023 games I think at best *started* development in that time, and conceptualization, drawing concept art and storyboarding can "easily" be done working from home.

Also we're finally fully into PS5/Series X as current gen, so graphics are finally seeing proper leaps forward.
You're half right it's just the development cycles that got extended due to disruptions with WFH kinda coincided in this one year with this embarrassment of riches we're getting.
This year has been a year of absolute bangers (DS remake, RE4 remake, Armored core, TotK, BG3, Lies of P, Hifi rush, and so on), but at the same time though we have gotten some absolute bottom of the bottom stinkers this year too.

I fully expect gollum and the kong game to both show up in various "worst games ever" videos even years from now.
    Forspoken and Redfall were some real stinkers as well.
    DS remake? Hopefully you didn't mean Demon's Souls.
        Dead space remake. Sorry, should have specified more.
            Oh right!! I forgot about that one. Thank you!
[removed]
I think we are seeing the fruits of being in the current console generation for a few years now. I imagine PS5 and Xbox Series dev kits went out no earlier than a year or so before launch to most developers. Next year should prove to be lighter but still have some amazing games nobody is expecting.
COVID delays are a part of it, but I think the big deal is developers finally embracing the new hardware and leaving the 10 year old consoles behind. There is always a rush of creativity in the industry when the performance floor gets lifted by a new console generation. 2007 was a similar year in this regard.
The "rebound" from covid is also a bunch of layoffs
Great theory
Pretty sure anything worse releasing than Redfall or Gollum would be a straight up scam. So only up from rock bottom?
    [I see you haven't gotten to experience the raptor.jpg cutscene from skull island yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfkHj_aPuTk)

Yes, that is the actual cutscene. Yes, the game is worse than both the things you listed.
        NO WAY LOLOL
I have dozens of friends across the world who collect physical still. Most are not buying because of no physical. One of them is the biggest Alan Wake fan I know, has been waiting for the game since the launch of the original, and he is flat out refusing to give Remedy cash until a physical version is released.  


I'm sure it will come, and it'll be after launch. Or through some physical company like Limited Run Games. But it's disappointing that I can't play it because of a weird line in the sand that I understand, but don't necessarily agree with.
    >I have dozens of friends across the world...

Damn, I think I have like... 5 total.
Same. I’ll wait for a nice 75% discount if it really is digital only. Plenty of games to play in the meantime.
There are dozens of us! 

(Tbh there are still quite a few people buying physical releases nowadays, it's still a sizeable chunk of the market, this was probably more on Epic publishing it. I wouldn't be surprised to see a physical release in the future)
yea same, i only buy physical releases. easy to share with friends and also to sell after i’m done with the game
Yup sorry not buying a $70 digital non-multiplayer game.
    lmao ok
Bg3, ac6, Re4, lies of p

Some of my favorite games EVER and it was all this year. It's kind of ridiculous.
    I would add Cyberpunk 2077 in there too, because it just got released this year as far as I know lmao
I’d say 2023 and 2018 are the best years of gaming in the past 10 years
    For me it’s 2023 and 2017
https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1717532308402565274

Digital Foundry says it's "perfect", and will run very well on a 3070.
Really hope my measly RTX 2060 can handle it on low specs, this has been my most anticipated game since RE4 Remake.
https://www.computerbase.de/2023-10/alan-wake-2-dlss-3-5-erlaubt-pathtracing-mit-134-fps-in-uhd/

No bechmarks yet, but 1st impressions:

The title looks impressively good in places using pathtracing, but cannot maintain this level throughout. Nevertheless, Alan Wake II announces another game with a graphical presentation on the highest level. However, this costs an extremely high amount of performance - even more than was recently speculated.


The benchmark results published by Nvidia a day ago seem to be absolute best-case scenarios. The 103.9 FPS mentioned for a GeForce RTX 4080 in the "Raytracing High" setting (maximum pathtracing) in UHD including DLSS 3.5 performance, frame generation and ray reconstruction was almost never reached by the editors in the first two hours of the story. Usually, the title runs at 70 to 80 FPS when played with these settings, but there are also scenes where the FPS is only around 60.


Frame generation is a must for pathtracing (and often also for "normal" ray tracing). The artificial intermediate frames can be graphically convincing, but have a clear impact on the input lag. Because frame generation as a means to an end for using ray tracing in Alan Wake - depending on the resolution and GPU - may well have to be used at a render frame rate (already including upscaling) of only 30 FPS, this is also noticeable. Despite displayed 60 FPS, the game hangs. However, ray- and pathtracing obviously can't be done any other way.


DLSS/FSR are always active, which explains their consistent naming in the official system requirements. With Nvidia DLAA and AMD FSR Native, there is also the option to use both algorithms on the native resolution (i.e. without upscaling) and thus for edge smoothing. Both technologies cannot be switched off.


Not only the use of "pathtracing", i.e. the complete implementation of the lighting by ray tracing, but also the activation of ray tracing in general is currently not recommended on AMD Radeon RX, the FPS drops drastically. Or to put it even more drastically: RT is currently virtually impossible on a Radeon - even on a Radeon RX 7900 XTX. The 60 FPS mark is often not reached with AMD's flagship even in Full HD with FSR Balanced.

I don't like writing off a reviewer wholesale because I disagree with their past work, but also this did make me laugh a lot.
haha everything promised and then some. That is nuts.
I normally hate when people do this kind of dissection in these threads but holy hell!
that one rly stuck out to me, like i get its shouldnt be all the same scores but if there is something which sticks out that much there has to be a reason
This is a very story heavy series so I feel like if you just watched a recap you won’t have the full picture of Alan Wake 1. 

Control is tough to gauge. Essentially it’s easter eggs in that game that kind of cast the events of AW in a new light but it’s such a minor part of Control that you might be okay just youtubing the relevant scenes.
Control is the connective tissue between AW1 and its sequel. It provides context for altered world events (AWE) and their ability to translate shared subconscious archetypes into new or... altered realities. So far, it seems like all of AW2 is set within an immense, or oceanic, AWE.

Control established the Remedy expanded universe, reintroduced Alan Wake and Bright Falls and connected all of it through the Federal Bureau of Control. It's also loads of fun to absolutely wreck those destructible environments with telekinetic combat abilities.
Even Windows Central only received a PS5 code.
    I don't see how a website called XboxEra can in good conscience recommend the game if they didn't even review the Xbox version. Crazy that this had a big showing at the recent Xbox Partner Preview yet no one can play it on Xbox.
        They just added their Xbox Series X|S comments to the review up on Windows Central. Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush.
            > Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush

Yeah that's how it seems. I think personally if you are a console specific site and you don't get your version you should put that up.  Say we wanted to have something available for you but we cannot as they only provided codes for these platforms.  As such our recommendation is wait and see.


Edit: Thanks for the update on  Windows Central, I just checked it out. I wonder what you lose graphically by going to performance mode. I'll probably play in Quality mode but I always like to know what's different.  Time to see if anyone lays this out.
>Playing the game on Xbox Series X, the game runs at a flawless 30 frames-per-second even in intense moments in Quality mode, and a stable 60 FPS in Performance mode. There are many techniques and aspects of Alan Wake 2's technical design that feel utterly fresh in this kind of game.

https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/alan-wake-2-review#:~:text=Playing%20the%20game%20on%20Xbox,in%20this%20kind%20of%20game.
The nominees for GOTY are kind of arbitrary and don't always match up to whatever the highest scoring metacritic games are of that year, so there's always a lot more games in contention to be nominated than actually do, but I agree the overall quality of games this year is higher than normal.

E.g. last year Stray was nominated even though its OpenCritic score was 84%, whereas a lot of games with higher scores didn't get nominated. Kind of another reason the GOTY awards are just arbitrary and a bit nonsensical really - they're a bit like the Oscars, where the best picture nominees are always good movies but not necessarily the actual best that released that year
Crazy hardware specs and Epic exclusive... Basically /r/pcgaming 's nightmare
Am I missing something? Went to check and the top threads about the game seem mostly positive/relieved, as well as the discussion within.

Granted, I never bother sorting by controversial.
    It was a shitshow of negativity this week before reviews came out lol
That sub is trash. Absolute trash. I need to do some searching for a good pc focused sub.
Those guys over there are literally seething right now. It's hilarious to watch them
    We need a new word to describe people whose lives are so wonderful that they have to turn the most trivial things into moronic hills to die on.
That sub is run by steam bots. Like many other subs
Yeah, it always amuses me how different the threads are. This thread is mostly people excited about the game. That thread is a mix of people finding any excuse they can to be negative about it. It being EGS exclusive basically means they're going to hate it no matter how good it is.
    They are truly the console gamers they claim to be better than.
Not at all friend. I feel the same. 

It's funny, the release date totally snuck up on me, but I've been waiting so long for this.
Me too! I hope the soundtrack is as good as the original's.
Im so happy man, tears of joy
Man I'm right there with you. I can't believe all this time geeking over alan wake, control and remedy in general are paying off. I was so scared of this game not reaching the public's expectation but I'm blown away seeing these reviews.
*Control 2* was announced last year. :)
I agree. Played it for 6-7 hours but got bored in the subway section since you are just running around trying to reveal the BS story. Basic game mechanic is to find batteries and bullets while trying to switch between 'scenes' to open up closed off areas.
How scary would you say the game is in comparison to the original? Loved the first one and will be getting this but I'm a huge wimp - SIGNALIS is about the upper limit on spooky for me normally. This is looking like a 'play in broad daylight with my flatmates watching' experience.
    There are some scary parts for sure but there is also a lot of Twin Peaks style stuff and a good deal of police procedural. It is very hard to average it all out but I would say I found Alan Wake to be low on the scary scale(not sure it was aiming for that) and this is a bit higher due to some of the brutality that happens.
But I tend to skew very very low on horror impacting me during a game.
        Police procedural? That peaks my attention
How is the difficulty compared to other survival horror games? Say Re4 remake?

 I'm hoping for something a bit more difficult than we usually expect from the genre.
    I played mostly on normal and it was...about as expected. Somewhat challenging at times. The others are more or less and require more or less accuracy and not wasting ammo and scavaging a bit more.

New diff is coming in a patch in a month I think
        How scary is it for someone who really doesnt like jumpscares? Want to play it but im a scaredy cat in general
            There are for sure jump scares. There is also the overlay of FMV I talked about a bit in the review which can be startling.
Would you recommend playing through the AWE DLC for Control first?
    I love them so its not really at all impartial if I say yes. Its not exactly needed
Dang, the stiffness of dodge animation really got to you, huh? I can totally get that, and it's a bummer when a seemingly small but actually pretty fundamental part of gameplay lacks polish in games like these. If only every game could be animated to the quality of the TLOU2; there were some fantastically animated and dynamic dodge animations 👌
    > Dang, the stiffness of dodge animation really got to you, huh? I can totally get that, and it's a bummer when a seemingly small but actually pretty fundamental part of gameplay lacks polish in games like these.

You're reminding me of how I just could not get over the dodge animations watching people play Calisto Protocol. They straight up looked like genre satire.
    100%. I would love Spider-man even more if not for that weird hunched combat stance.
Don't forget *Sons of the Forest* too.
I'm having the same experience as you. I feel like I'm playing a different game than everyone else apparently.   
The game is a slog to get through and I suspect the visuals are getting everyone swept up in the hype.   
It's a very pretty backtrack sim and I solved some cases by just throwing random evidence on the board lmao
> 96 on PC Jesus Christ.

Where are you seeing that? The highest I can find is 93 for PC on Metacritic.
    Aw shucks it's 92 now. Was 96 when I wrote that.
> extremely broken.

its playable.
    That's good enough then.
Isn't that just a click bait site?
    It sure ain't what I would consider a premier site.

But its a wonderful reminder that some people just don't like some types of games.
        Yeah I don't want to imply that all outlier reviews are clickbait, I just see a lot of clickbait articles from gamerant whenever I open up Google Chrome lol. Almost every time.
Yes, because you are playing from POW of a character who didn't play Control and has no idea what's going on, and she finds her explanation as you play
Although this being a sequal I think they have designed it this for also those people in mind who haven't played the first one. Actually I think jumping in to the shoes of the FBI agent would in this sense be even more immersive. First game was also a bit of a weird-fest (in a good way!) so even knowing what happened to Alan Wake in the first place may not explain everything.
They are adding new game+ and nightmare difficulty soon. As for now I'd imagine the replayability you'll get with it will come from your enjoyment of the world and characters until that update coming.
This year STARTED with Dead Space remake and we ate good ever since. 

This was the year of games getting me into genres I don't normally invest time intro. BG3 got me into crpgs. Dead Space got me into horrors. Street Fighter got me playing fighters every chance I get. Definitely one of my top 3 gaming years ever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JawxvOF__4Q
It has much less combat than the first, the second is more investigation/dialogues/walks. And the combat still uses the flashlight, but it is punchy and blunt, although you are fragile. It is a good game for the story and graphics, but it has little combat, and the investigation is not really puzzles. I prefer action games like Control but I'm also liking this one.
It isn't the exact same at all.
    From the reviews above and the videos I've seen it still looks like you point a torch at enemies before shooting them?
They had said the new character is sort of designed to help new players understand the story. Remedy has also put out videos summarizing the story so far. I haven't personally watched it but probably a good idea before jumping in: https://youtu.be/uzocqRZzyoI?si=HmiOrZUV2KqQAFHp
There's a video of Sam Lake recapping the story of Alan Wake this far, I recommend you give that a watch as it will help tremendously. 

Link here:

https://youtu.be/uzocqRZzyoI?si=LqLeyMKp2CaoKu7Y
Sam lake himself said during the game awards trailer reveal that playing the original is not required as one of the two playable characters is new to the universe and learns the backstory along with the player.
You probably won't understand it anyway
    Played through AW twice, Control twice, Quantum break has sadly been ignored still.... But end result is that I don't understand anything.
        [deleted]
            Yeah it's been on the todo list for ages.... it's just... so many releases atm that I barely have time to jump from one to the next without sacrificing other hobbies.
    What a bizarre thing to say...



Alan wake and control both make sense.
    To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Alan Wake. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Alan's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Alan Wake truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Alan's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Sam Lake's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have an Alan Wake tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
You don't need to this is designed for people who didn't play a game that out 13 years ago. But obviously if you have then some emotional beats and fanservice will hit harder.
You should, no question.
There’s been about 20 games this year worth their money.
    I don't have money for 20 games.
It'll probably get a physical edition later down the road.
Lol, if there is any dev you don’t support with extra money up front it’s Remedy; still raw what they did to those of us that bought Control full priced edition day one
    I would not blame Remedy since that was publishers choice
    What did they do?
Yes but pretty games sell well for casual gamers
The first was all twin peaks
    Add a lot of Stephen King into that blender and you have the series. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully we don't have to wait 13 years for a sequel.
No. It was based heavily on Twin Peaks and Stephen King. Where do you see the True Detective influence?
    https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/alan-wake-2-interview-true-detective-was-definitely-on-our-mind/
        Oh, I see, interesting. Well, the first game predates the show.
This is a rather bizarre analogy.
You don’t have to be edgy and make dildo analogies with everything you see
Remedy is kind of a cult developer like From Software used to be with certain people really gravitate to their strange style of making games. You're probably seeing the reviewers who are already big fans referring to them that way. Some people don't really click with them and they would probably just treat them like anyone else.
Control is a masterpiece especially for combat. Alan Wake 2 is very different because it doesn't have as much focus on combat.
    There is not a single part of Control that's remotely close to masterpiece lol

Combat has fun moments. Nothing revolutionary.
20 hours
God I fucking love Max Payne
    I’d love a packaged re-release of all 3 games.
        You're in luck, at least for the first two. [Remedy is remaking both of them as one game](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-enters-agreement-with-rockstar-games-for-new-max-payne-12-project/).
            Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
                Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
                    Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
                        Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
                        It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                            Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
                    On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.
                        MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
                    Its more about the availability. For people that aren't pc gamers its not very accessible for a lot of us.
                I played through all three games on my Steam Deck a while back. Mac Payne 3 still holds up really, really well.
                >I hope something gets done with 3

I'm hoping the stars will align and they'll somehow get the opportunity to make the third game they intended to make as they clearly had ideas to continue the story that were never realized.
                Gunplay of Maxpayne 3 with hand to hand combat of the Warriers  for GTA6 But The Main Thing is the open World which is most important.
            Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Shit I'm excited about this.
            And then after Remedy makes a full remake of both games for modern consoles, Rockstar will drop a PS4 and XBOX port of Max Payne 3 without any changes (60$ of course)
    So does Remedy and Alan Wake
    What a good fucking series of fucking games. FUCK
    I still play them from time to time. Was one of the first games I got when I got my first non-crazy-outdated laptop and could actually play 3D games, played the hell out of one and two (the third hadn't been developed/released at that time). Just really solid gameplay with a lot of character IMO.
[What a stupid fucking quote](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GD5mzJ7UrhA)
    Thats amazing lol. Fits right in with some of the meta stuff
Also Remedy, can't wait for the Max Payne remake.
Hell yeah pimp
Thanks for the heads up! Pre-ordered it just now based on reviews. 14 hours until play time. Did not need spoilers.
IGN reviews are always spoiler heavy and without warning, honestly I completely avoid them at this point.
Yeah and honestly the worst part about Control for me was the upgrade system. It felt completely unnecessary and weird in a story-based game. Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities? It just felt like the game should have had you unlock them alongside the story, or just finding certain items gave you the ability, or gave you points to spend on an ability of your choosing. The weapon crafting was nonsense.
    I was mostly okay with the leveling system because it allowed you to do different stuff early on. Sure, by the time you were done with the game, you could unlock almost everything, but in the first half, putting points into flying vs. telekinesis vs. shields made the combat much different in repeat playthroughs.

But man, those weapon upgrades! There were what, five different Service Pistol modes, with 2 or 3 upgrade slots each? And then you'd get like a dozen upgrades for each mode, with no good way of sorting through them. Such a frustrating UI.
        And the upgrades have 6 levels and the game never stops giving you weak lvl 1 upgrades and you can only hold 24 so you have to clear them out. Control is one of my favorite games ever but this part sucks
        Yeah sorry I meant the gun upgrades. The skill upgrade system was fine. The gun upgrade/crafting system is insanely convoluted for no reason.

I kind of assumed there was DLC or a cash shop to make you pay for upgrade components but no... the system is just complicated for no reason at all.
    Here are the only useful mods - damage, headshot damage, 100% ammo refund on hit, instant sniper shot recharge. That's it, maybe damage after kill for someone really good. It's so poorly thought out. I wish the mods were also more interesting than you can make the recoil less annoying (we made it annoying by default).
        Oh yeah that was the other thing, 80% of the mods are worthless and/or boring so grinding through hundreds of them gets tiring.
    Yeah.. the skill tree is fine... the weapon/personal mod system is the only, frankly, terrible part of an amazing game. 

It goes against the pace of the game, it's mostly meaningless +X% upgrades, it takes a while for you to open more slots to put them in and the worst part is the small inventory. 

There's some good ones and they allow for flexible builds, that likely 99% of players will never use, but the implementation sucks.

I spent way too much time going through my inventory sorting through those mods deciding what to throw away so I could pick another one.

If they went to a separate stash at the hub, and or/you could combine the ones you collect to level them up it would be better. But just an infinite inventory would fix it, imo.
    > Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities?

i used a trainer to get all the abilities and realized it's not even worth it. even the highest levelled versions of most of the crafted items give you paltry single digit boosts.  
most pointless aspect of control imo
Guessing it was a publisher note.  Some MBA who failed upwards came in and said "you know these other games have skill systems.  Our focus groups say people love those.  I want you to add one here."
Really tired of these kind of systems. My brain always just assumes I picked the wrong thing and I'm missing out.

    Non-spoiler version: The main game ends on a sudden cliff hanger with a bunch of plot threads left open. The DLC resolves the cliff hanger in the most unsatisfying way possible while refusing to resolve or progress anything else about the plot.

Spoiler version: >!At the end of the main game, the space base is about to explode, the main character has one last chance to escape, but he is suddenly attacked. Cut to black.!<

>!In the DLC the main character fights his way out of the base and finally escapes. Except, no, that's a lie, he was actually fatally mutilated at the end of the main game and the DLC is just his dying hallucinations. He's dead, everything blows up, the end.!<
         They actually changed the DLC to this because the game performed so poorly. Even Glen Schofield left the studio after how bad it did. Which is a shame because I think if they added in enemy variety, tightened up the storytelling, and made the melee combat better it could have been a great franchise. The game was one of the most beautiful to come out, too bad that’s where all the money went.
            They should've just dumped the whole melee combat system focus and focused more on a variety of ranged weapons with the melee acting as an emergency fall back. I get why they did it like this, to force proximity to the enemies to add tension, but it just didn't work out. 

In trying to not be like dead space, the game that was designed to be a spiritual successor managed to fail in both departments.
                I don't mind the focus on melee but the game just feels bad to play in general. I genuinely like most other things about it but man it's some awkward gameplay.
            It's a very pretty game but one big issue I have with the game that is a core aspect of it that you didn't mention is the level design. It's narrow corridor after narrow corridor. After playing the Dead Space remake, I just can't continue on with such a narrow linear level design.
        Wow. Im glad I didnt finish it despite being free on PSN.

The whole constant melee dodging is a terrible mechanic. Not sure how anyone thought that would be enjoyable the 10th or hundredth time
            It could've been a good system if it wasn't so janky.
    Shat on the story and basically took a vague ending of the main game into a definitive "no sequel even possible with these characters" ending
The opencritic score for Callisto Protocol is 67, so IGN is right in line with the average critic score (that’s not a good or bad thing per se). And your opinion is just one opinion. I’d say a 7/10 is pretty fair because there were things I liked about the game.
    It's funny that when I read 67 I think "oof" but I see 6.7 I think eh ok not the worst game ever.
    I really disliked it, but would also give it a 6. So a 6-7 is pretty in line of what it should be rated
Callisto had redeeming elements to it. I personally enjoyed it until I got burnt out on the combat 70% through. 

Definitely not a perfect game though.
Hugely disagree, Callisto was flawed but a good time nonetheless. It had an underdeveloped plot and some irritating design decisions like the limited inventory and weirdly placed checkpoints, but the visuals, sound design and atmosphere were absolutely top tier. Add in some crunchy combat and some great performances from its cast and it was a fun ride. I'd give it an 8/10. While I agree the DLC's ending is an anticlimax (though I'm not sure what else they could have done to wrap up the story given they definitely weren't going to do a sequel), I actually thought the DLC overall was a big improvement on the main game. It added more gameplay variety and better pacing with the addition of puzzles, cool enemy types and some new weapons, plus an absolutely killer final boss. I think it really proved Callisto could be great if Striking Distance were given another chance. Real shame they won't.
Quantum Break too.
They're even more significant in Alan Wake. Revolving around a writer, cliches are one of the tools they will often use to drive the story. The original game was also laden with them, especially in cutscenes, where Alan would reach a point of safety but then suddenly something completely random would throw him out right back into the fray. Like when he's driving a car and all of a sudden a rockslide happens and throws him off the road. There's also a bit where you get on a helicopter after defending it from shadow people, and then soon after you take off you get thrown right back out of it for no real good reason.
    People may criticize the uses of cliches in Alan Wake, but at the very least it's clever how they wrote in a loophole to let them freely use cliches.

It isn't just that he's a writer, he's a writer who isn't used to writing horror at all (and his first attempt was in a fugue state while an evil darkness did the editing)
Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing.  They can get tiring.  And using them to great effect in one game, doesn't presuppose you'll always use them to that same great effect all the time.
    > Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing. They can get tiring. 

So far Remedy has proven to be able to handle them pretty well though.
A dlc for control which connects control with Alan wake
    Not only does it connect them, but the entire DLC is about Alan Wake and Bright Falls.  Definitely worth a quick playthrough before AW2, I think.
    Thanks
Altered World Event
Wow, I didn’t play Control until 2020, but I’m shocked to hear it only scored 83. I thought it was incredible, and assumed it would have scored at least 90.
    Same. It was my personal Game of the Year when it launched on PC. It is also the game that convinced me of DLSS and Raytracing because it allowed for some truly stunning visuals on my old RTX 2070S.
        I tried Control a good while after launch (thanks Epic Games) but it almost instantly grew into one of my all-time favorites. It's just pure Remedy.
    I'm actually a bit bored by it. I'm about 6 hours in I think and getting lost seems to be common for me. really wish it was a bit easier to navigate. just thinking about having to spend time to figure out where I am right now makes me not want to play it unfortunately.
        It took me a while to adjust at first but the trick to navigating in Control is to pay attention to the signs on the walls, they actually are very direct.
        Control is a 5/10. Maybe a 6.5/10 on a good day when the combat doesn't seem repetitive as all hell and you're actually fighting enemies that don't look or behave identically everywhere.
    I think Control is a divisive game - I played it for free on PS plus during Covid lockdowns when not a lot of games were being released and I couldn’t force myself to finish it.
2017 was pretty stacked with so many modern classics: BotW, Mario Odyssey (and the Switch launch in general), Hollow Knight, Persona 5 (international release), Nier Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn, RE7, Cuphead, Hellblade, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Metroid: Samus Returns
    This conversation is every thread now. Lol. 

It is accurate though. Lots of good games.
    This year blows 2017 out of the water, respectfully
        FR, everything from the cyberpunk expac to armored core to the deadspace remake has been fucking gold this year.
        Eh, there's been a lot of iteration this year. I enjoyed BOTW and DOS2 a lot more than TOTK and BG3 and in the latter's case I think it's just a worse game than DOS2.

Overall this year has a lot of 8/10s, not much that's blowing me away.
        I couldn't disagree more. I honestly haven't found too much I've really liked this year; RE4 Remake, Metroid Prime Remastered and the Xenoblade DLC is about it so far.
            It may not be your personal best year in gaming based on your taste, but in terms of the sheer number of games that have released to massive sales and critical acclaim it's certainly one of the best years in the past decade, if not the best.
    Yeah, that is the next closest I can think of.
And the variation. 

Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Street fighter 6- fighting

Mario wonder- plattforming

Tears of the kingdom- adventure

Final fantasy- Rpg

Harry potter- adventure.

Spiderman 2 - action adventure with a lighter touch


What I miss is some great fps action. Something like Halo 1, 3 or infinite that I really liked.
    You are  missing the game of the year in that list with Baulders gate 3. Plus starfield and cyberpunk phantom liberty.
        Don't forget armored core 6, also I don't think cyberpunk should be running for goty since that is just a dlc and an update to the game.
        Really gonna add starfield to a list of greatest games ever released
            What are you talking about? The list was great games released this year, not of all time lol.
    > Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Don't forget Dead Space remake
    how could you forget Baldur's Gate, Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Armoured Core 6 and the most important of all GOTY Kong rise of skull island?
        Skull island is definitely the most innovative game of the bunch. Their inclusion of a jpeg shot in the middle of a cutscene?! That’s a game changer for the gaming industry
    Agreed, though listing FF16 as an RPG, especially when BG3 exists is questionable lmao.
        Haven't got around to BG3 yet but I thought Octopath II was better than FF16 as an RPG.
            I’m not hating on FF16 to be clear, I just don’t think it counts as an RPG lmao, it’s an action game with some light RPG elements at best. 

I haven’t played Octopath II, maybe I should.
    Cyberpunk comeback and the new expansion for that FPS hit maybe? Cyberpunk after this redemption arc turned out to be my most favorite game of all time tbh.
    Very long time since we’ve had a 10/10 FPS and it’s hard to do, even Sony hasn’t had a crack at one in 10 years
    FF16 is not an RPG, no matter what it purports to be. It is a single player semi-open world action game with a quest structure.
    Cyberpunk & Phantom Liberty especially ould definitely cover that FPS part for you I promise
GOTY in any other year:
RE4, TOTK,BG3, Mario, dead space, Metroid prime, phantom liberty, Jedi survivor, FF16, Spider guy 2, armored core 6 and now this thing. 

Oh yeah, we ate well this year goddamn!
I love Control and I think Jesse Faden is an underrated protagonist. Without getting into too many spoilers I really enjoyed how she just dove into what was happening. Too many stories have reluctant protagonists who complain about the situation. So, it was nice seeing a character thrown into a strange situation that just rolled with and got to work.
    Not sure I'd call it a "dive".  She's pretty clearly been living a weird, odd life since childhood and has been seeking answers and expecting an escalation for years. 

Have never understood the complaints about unwilling protagonists, but I'm not the type to demand unabashed power trip fantasies and faulty logic in all of my fiction.
        I don't really see the connection between unwilling/willing protagonists and power fantasies. They are two mostly unconnected qualities for characters. You can have power fantasies with reluctant protagonists or you can have power fantasies with willing protagonists.
    I think you’re right in regard to diving in. I think her experiences in Ordinary helped make her more accepting to her new reality too.
Ironically the lore got a bit naff for me in the end. I stopped caring after picking up the 101th note about some random and not very interesting SCP type stuff. 

I still rate the game very highly, and the gameplay and setting were very well done imho. But it was the first Remedy game where I thought that the story and characters (up until the DLCs) were the games weakest elements by some distance.
    [removed]
    They really needed those pseudo-audio logs - calls on the phone and whatever - to be able to play over gameplay, rather than accessed and listened to in a menu.
        Agreed. I will NEVER understand games that don't allow us to move as we listen to audio logs. It is punishment of the highest order.
    Yeah same. Like, I still really enjoyed the atmosphere and the worldbuilding stories, but I feel like the game kinda lost the plot and didn't answer many questions by the end. I still fucking love that game though.
    Man I fucking hate when storytelling is done nearly exclusively through fucking memos and audio logs. It annoys me to no end and really makes me feel disconnected.
    Very well put. 

Easily the weakest characters I've seen in a Remedy game but the atmosphere, graphics and to a lesser extent the combat made up for it. 

Fun game but 8/10 *max* IMO.
        I feel like if they'd made Jesse more punk like in their original vision, and had her be significantly angrier at the FBC, she would have landed a lot better.
Control is one of my all time favorites as well so I'm really looking forward to AW2.  I'm not usually a fan of horror games at all, but I expect I will enjoy this game as it's in the same universe.  Like you said, their worlduilding is amazing.

I just hope the performance is fine.
    From all the reviews it seems the performance is pretty good everywhere. I’m excited to get nuts on PC tonight.
Not my all-time favorite game (that's way too competitive), but the lore and notes you read along the way were the best in the business. From straight up horror to "The Office"-like bureaucratic comedy, I couldn't get enough of the lore. Read every word on every scrap I found.
Ignoring technical issues my issue with Control its stupid design decisions such as having 5 guns but only being able to equip 2, having gaming's most useless map combined with gaming's most confusing level design, there being no difficulty settings while also having a fucked up difficulty curve, and no autosaves.

It's like Remedy decided the game was too good so they had to ruin it in a few places. It was so close but so far from greatness.
glad to see it hitting 60 FPS most of the time.

Gonna take a fat ass nap after work today and let it pre load then play this all night
    If you are in Europe i am afraid you cant play until the morning :( i'm in the same boat i think unlock time is somewhere 7am really annoying and i don't want to play a horror game in daylight. So i need to wait until Friday evening.
        that’s a bummer man, fortunately (for once) I’m in the Midwest US. 11PM for us.

The really lucky fucks on the west coast get it at 9
    I'd still recommend playing it at 30 on consoles
Great username
Played through twice! On release on console and this year on Steam Deck.
Just beat the first one again in anticipation of the sequel, and that's a hard agreed from me. There are five enemies in the entire game. 

Normal guy 

Fast guy 

Big guy 

Inanimate object 

Bird
    Uh, excuse you bud, you forgot Chair Guy and Bug-Looking Flashlight Head.
I felt exactly the same. The game just stops introducing new mechanics, like, a third of the way in? You're just using the ever the same "strategy" of pointing your flashlight and then shooting your gun at enemies in every single encounter, over and over and over again, with nothing that really breaks up that pattern.

Even though the gunplay/combat definitely feels good at first (where you really feel the Max Payne roots), that feeling passes halfway into the game, and then you still have like 6 hours to go.

Luckily they managed to avoid this in Control.
    To be honest: if the core gameplay loop is actually great, you don't really need any new mechanics after a certain point.
        AW's gameplay is anything but great
        That's the problem, it isn't that great. The gameplay is pretty meh.
            Alan please start doing cardio so you can run for more than three seconds.
    yeah i dropped it when i realized the gameplay was going to be the same atrocious slog all the way through, i did enjoy the atmosphere though

maybe will look at this on a deep sale or something
        I wouldn't go as far as calling it an atrocious slog. As I said, the gameplay fundamentals are actually pretty decent, it just doesn't carry the game for the entire duration of the story. It almost feels like this story is in the wrong medium.
[deleted]
Same. I tried doing this thing where I was going to go through my Steam backlog from A to Z and try to finish every game in it that looked fun that I hadn't yet played. I started with Alan Wake. By the time I'd finished Alan Wake I was so bored to tears by the repetitive, tedious gameplay that I abandoned my little project right then and there.
Played it through when it went on PS+ for the first time. Even understanding that it's 13 years old at this point, like 2/3rds of the game is the same mechanics in the same dark woods. Not a ton of enemy variety, bosses were mostly the same too. Story was pretty good, even for 13 years old.
Obvious choice for the current gen consoles. 

But I’ve recently also replayed parts of the original on my Steam Deck, and on that screen it still holds up pretty well.
Alan Wake 2 sitting next to RE2 and RE4... I could cry :'))))
That's amazing. Alongside Silent Hill 1 those are my favorite horror games.
    Holy shit...I've found a rare silent hill fan that doesn't go "Blah Blah Blah, silent hill 2, BLAH BLAH BLAH!"
Silent Hill 2 deserved more than 89. It’s one the best games of all time.
Alan Wake being in the same company as these two warms my heart.
    I’ve never played a remedy game but Alan Wake 2 looks super cool. When I get a ps5 this holiday it may be one of the first games I pick up
It's crazy because before even knowing Control was a remedy game I thought it was going to be a poorly executed SCP fan-fic. Not only does the world building and character design stand on its own but even their SCP's are fresh and scary to read about
Can’t wait for Control 2
    Imagine an Alan Wake DLC but it features Jesse Faden.
        They could call it Alan Wake 2: JFE 

Control: AWE was Altered World Event, but we all really know it stood for **A**lan **W**ake **E**xpansion
            Or as I call it the Alan Wake Experience
                Alan Wake Experience was one of my favorite bands from the late 60s lol
        Full circle!
They’re basically outdoing twin peaks style David lynch writing at this point. They’re great.
I've actually hosted a fireside interview with Lake once on stage and he is one of the most down to earth bigger names from gaming I've met. Absolute class, that man.  
Funny, respectful and with great insights.  

Absolutely one of my favourite memories from the time I did those gigs.
I was just telling someone that I felt that Sam Lake is like a western Kojima, both so full of creativity and passion for storytelling even if they're not exactly the best writers in the world.
Kojima benefits from the execution and presentation of his games. If his crazy narratives and cinematics were replaced by text (like low budget games do), no one would read that shit.
I think Sam Lake has mentioned that he took time to go study screenwriting between Max Payne 1 & 2. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but I think he's put effort into actually learning writing in terms of craft.
Finally, I'm not the only one who thinks GoW Ragnarok is weirdly written. I clearly saw how Cory Barlog's hand hadn't touched this game, everyone talks like a modern American from Watch Dogs or Spider-man. Those moments like Odin saying "my ex" or Kratos's "I don't want snacks" are so off. Odin's whole acting is like he is from Woody Allen movie
    Ragnarok felt like such a dip in quality story telling wise. I get they wanted to do a duology and I do respect the fuck out of that decision but they crammed in too much into one package. Towards the end it felt like plot beats were there to be checked off and then it was on to the next.
        This was my main complaint of the game too. The titular “ragnarok” event itself was crammed into like the last 20 minutes of the game. I really enjoyed the build up to it but damn they couldn’t deliver on their huge promises

That and you have these weird slow moments like everything with Angrboda where the game just haults. It felt like the MJ segments in spider-man

I’m fine with a slow buildup but there were so many whiplash moments where the game was both rushed and also bogged down by too many storylines
            Right? I had that same thought about the actual Ragnarok event. We’re building to this whole event and then oh hey bye it’s over. 

The rumor is that they debated making Ragnarok 1 or 2 games (so that the whole thing would have either been a duology or a trilogy with GoW 2018) and I think that they made a real mistake by not making it a trilogy. The story in Ragnarok is told at an absolutely breakneck pace, but not in a good way - they tried to put way too much in. 

Even the big emotional plot twist death (which I’ll keep vague just in case people haven’t played) felt so rushed to me. It was just like “oh whoa welp they’re dead now anyways moving on” and I honestly didn’t even really care that they died. That should have been the emotional finale to the second game, and then the third game should have focused entirely on the Ragnarok event itself.
    I love the Voice Actor for Odin and I like his performance overall but yeah there were a few odd lines here and there. 


Really the game should have been split, but I understand why they didnt.
        I mean, it's good acting, I wrote about writing, not the performer. Good actors speak in Marvel "Illumi-what-ti" style and that was really bad.
    God the actual spoken dialogue was such a disappointment to me in Ragnarok. I remember right from the beginning when Odin refers to Freya as his “ex” that I wasn’t going to love the dialogue. And that’s not to say that the dialogue in the first game was perfect, but it definitely felt different
        The question that always comes to me when I see comments like this is one of curiosity, what would you have said instead? Genuinely it always interests me when I see topics like this come up.
            I’m not even going to pretend that I’m skilled as a writer, so I honestly don’t know. But saying the phrase “my ex” is such a modern way of speaking and that’s what takes me out of it because that’s not how the game is framed. It we’re talking about a game like Immortal Fenix Rising, or hell even the animated Disney Hercules movie, the modern way of speaking works there because it’s in line with the overall presentation and “vibe” of the media. But God of War 2018 (and Ragnarok) play things _so_ straight, so to hear super modern dialogue/speech patterns in a game that’s trying to present a somewhat realistic/grounded take on this mythology just feels really out of place
    Odin was so disappointing in Ragnarok.

>!His boss fight was really underwhelming too, could have had him transform into Kratos, or Atreus, or Tyr, or any number of more interesting things than just having him fight you with a spear and bit of magic. Doesn't make any sense how Kratos couldn't just tear him into pieces instantly.!<

Think the game as a whole was pretty weak.
        Ragnarok really sucked compared to the previous game. Felt very “marvel”ised at a risk of sounding a bit circlejerky
            Ragnarok didn't suck.  The boss fights were a letdown, and the story was not anywhere near as good.  But the combat was way better/smoother than the first.
                I don't remember any boss from the first game other than the first baldur fight and the dragon 🤷‍♂️ that was always my biggest complaint from it. So idk how anyone could think Ragnarok did them worse. Like thor and the Gryla fight more than made up for that imo.
                    For me the final Baldr fight with Freya controlling the giant, and the Valkyrie Queen fight were good standouts as well.
                    Because honestly, they’re still a letdown from previous GoW games.
                        Hey kids you like quick time events???
                “Ragnarok really sucked compared to the first game”

Important distinction if you read this back
        I thought the game was great with the exception of the ending. So much potential crammed into a rushed set of sequences and underwhelming boss fights.
        Yes, pretty mediocre game. I think, it was rushed, it felt in every storyline. New characters appear, drama around them out of nowhere, Freia (who hunted Kratos between games) becomes good in like 1 mission
    I didn't think the writing in the first GoW was that special either, but Ragnarok's was especially bad. You're definitely not alone there. I felt like I was playing a Marvel film.
        I remember it being more subtle (like BOY through the game) and smart. One liners didn't feel forced and sometimes Kratos was just silent. In Ragnarok it was too usual for Marvel writing and all the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)
            >the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)

He doesn't say that though. He just says "i fucked up"
    Vehemently disagree, I thought this version of Odin was phenomenal. Richard Schiff is a wonderful actor and I think it was a stroke of brilliance to get the guy who played the white house comms director from West Wing to play the character. Highlighted the difference of styles between Kratos and Odin, one who mostly wins with might and the other who manipulates and deceives.
    Ex is a term dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. Snack dates back to the 1500s. Odin is well read and due to partaking in the Well of Knowledge he knows every language. Just because you aren't familiar with casual dialect in other languages doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
The medium and the team at Remedy have a lot of credit for how well the narratives play out in my opinion. As you say, I don’t think Sam Lake is a bad writer by any means but the way the stories are told elevate them to a different level. I’m really *really* looking forward to this game because the atmosphere and writing make for a very awesome experience.
Can you really say it's the lack of Barlog, tho? Both games had the same lead writers, it's just that Ragnarok had clearly more involved junior writers, too. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was still strong for a mass appeal game, if a bit plain in prose overall.

If anything, the only one whose influence you can taste like unsavoury candy was fucking Anthony Burch. The Joss Whedon of video game writing, without the 1 in 10 successful jokes Whedon manages, somehow.
    Both Anthony Burch and Cara Ellison wrote for Ragnarok and have mostly poor, overly-online-trope/reference type writing, sure. 

Whedon’s style was refreshing once upon a time, it’s just aged, stale and overused now. Audiences are tired of it.
        I'm not familiar with Ellison's work and Burch is yeah... well, very, very unfortunate choice for any serious story. And Whedon, man. Buffy was my jam, but he now lives rent-free in my head for the irreperable damage he caused to American writing industry with The Avengers (2012) template of quips and quirky writing.

But my point was I don't feel like it's apparent lack of Barlog in Ragnarok. His career history is of a game director from God of War II, not a primary writer. It certainly never felt like there was a point where I would compare him to, like you said, Lake or Houser. Maybe in cinematic department.
            I can definitely argue that Anthony can do serious. His storyline in Dungeons and Daddies gets surprisingly serious, but God of War isn't the right setting for him.
                I can agree on point that he can do serious story, he wrote Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but even then he did \*hammy\* as fuck writing. Which is what didn't make him right for a story that takes itself seriously as GoW Reboot.

If he does it better on his podcast, I'll take your word for it, but for me he's still 2012 9gag level of humour from Hey Ash!
                    This is fair. His use of language is too modern for something more period period like GoW.
    Joss Whedon of video game writing is very accurate lol, the Atreus and Sindri sections were pretty brutal for me. Felt like some cheap MCU knockoff, the dialogue was just all snarky quips. Got annoying real fast
Yeah, you are savage but right. Control is incoherent and extremely hokey, and by no means a display of rigorous storytelling. Which is blasphemy on this sub, I know. But Remedy excels in atmosphere, and all of their games have very lived-in worlds that are interesting to explore. I think Lake is good at playing to the tropes of the genres he's working in, but more importantly he's supported by a team that does excellent art direction, music, etc. that sells the atmosphere.
    I think it's completely fine for stories to be incoherent in a traditional sense, and it makes complete sense that Remedy games are like that since they take so much inspiration from David Lynch's work.
        For real. Half of Alan Wake is like a love letter to Twin Peaks.
        I think it's fine to enjoy the pulpiness of Control's writing but I don't think it gets close to the level Lynch is capable of. He's one of the most celebrated filmmakers ever for a reason.
            Sure, but is Lynch considered one of the most celebrated writers in the industry ever? I'd argue no, and he's my favourite filmmaker.


That's not to say that Sam Lake is as good as Lynch is, but I do think Lynch is also so much more about atmosphere and mood than he is focused on writing structured and coherent screenplays, or defined character arcs and such.
            I think the real trick and talent with them is they can make things cheesey without undermining the game itself, like, the game can have fun and be silly while also always fully believing in its world and its characters. Like when Control has Darling do a fuckin Dynamite cover from beyond the Nth dimension to cheer Jesse on I'm giggling like an idiot, but also buying that this is something Darling the person would do, and when it throws that Computer Program Dead Letter at you in the Foundation man I genuinely started crying, just the overall presentation of stumbling onto something so sad and personal in the form of some forgotten, misplaced government paperwork. And through all that they made a game where those two things can be part of the same experience, which imo is a generally impressive bit of ability. It's not moment-to-moment screenwriting excellence, but I think it is a form of writing skill, writing and assembling a whole, cohesive, and intentional vision for a script that's not for film, or TV, or a novel, but a video game specifically. Rather than, say, trying to smuggle a B-tier Oscar bait screenplay into a medium with lower standards where the impression of prestige television can carry you.
I agree that the dialogue in GoWR is pretty bad, but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers. The bigger problem to me seems to be the tone of the game, which is definitely a game design and marketing choice more than it is a problem with specific writers.

I'm sure the tone of Ragnarok was largely decided on as a whole, probably very shortly into development.
    > but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers.

They deserve the harshness, I don't see why we can't hold games to the same standards as film or literature.
        Comparing to films or literature is something people who have no idea how game writing works say. 

Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement. 

Films have more people involved, but are still far easier than games due to the smaller team size and the fact you can write stuff like "They take their shirt off" or "They hand over an object" and an animation team doesn't come and say "Ha, yeah, we can't do that."

Film and literature are breezes in the park comparably for writers.
            > Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement.

These are definite differences, good writing is often an afterthought after gameplay and graphics, but I'm still going to hold games to the same standard. I will judge them for poor characterization, awkward dialogue, stilted acting, etc, though I'll place most of the blame on the directors/producers for tolerating these during production. 

Game directors like Miyazaki at From Software and Neil Druckmann at Naughty Dog have shown that good writing in AAA games is possible (though Miyazaki's better at storytale unique suited to videogames, Druckmann's just got at supervising naturalistic dialogue and acting), and there are plenty of well-writen indie games.

If gamers are happy with slop and don't raise any criticisms, they'll continue to get slop.
        Because they're working for a large corporation making games that are basically blockbuster movies. And to be honest most AAA games are written better than your average blockbuster.

Like they're not auteurs. This isn't Tarkovsky.
Same with Spider-Man 2, it's a great game but the story is well-worn and tired and the characters all act the exact same.
    I think the thing is that at the time of Uncharted 2 when Sony games started with this kind of writing, games that were written as well as the average Marvel movie were genuinely like 95th percentile as far as game stories went. But as the industry matured they often now feel a little generic, immature, sometimes cringeworthy, and often insincere.
        I think Sony and Naughty Dog specifically should get a lot of credit for at least being progressive in trying to write a good story. I do think TLOU2 tried too hard and other Sony titles (Horizon, Spider-Man, GoW) are being overrated for their storytelling.
    That’s my main problem with the game too. Just feels like I‘m watching the Raimi movies again but with more quips, less laughs and none of the charisma. 

Also doesn’t help that I enjoy Miles as a character more than Peter, but he is really just kinda there and occasionally helps out with stuff.
I've played through Max Payne 3 more times then I care to admit.
    It's the GOAT for me in terms of 3rd person shooters. Nothing has ever exceeded it, I really hope we get a port for Switch, and I also hope Remedy take inspiration from 3 for its remakes of the first two games.
Totally disagree. It tried so hard to emulate 1 & 2's writing but just fell on its face. 

Gameplay was awesome though.
    felt like i was taking crazy pills with that take. story and presentation was far better in the previous games.
Max Payne 3 wasn't a Max Payne game to me at all. It was a perfectly fine *something else*. It didn't feel like the same character and the change in story-telling took away one of MP's most appealing qualities.
Max Payne 3 was amazingly well-written. 

It might be my favorite example of (in any medium) a writer taking someone else's established premise, characters, and voice, and evolving them in interesting and worthwhile ways.
    They just took Max Payne and put him in Man On Fire with some forced noir tropes and dialogue. I'd hardly call it an evolution.
Yup! Updating original post with that and a link to DF.
Yeah, the issue is that older cards don't support mesh shaders which Alan Wake 2 requires.


Honestly, I'm not too bothered on the Nvidia side. Not supporting 1000-series cards that are 7 years old is like "bummer, but okay". On the AMD side it's a bit more of an ouch, since only the 6000 and 7000 series are supported, with the unsupported 5000-cards only being ~4 years old.
    We'll have to see how the 2060 does then in testing, because the 5700 XT, the fastest of that generation on the AMD side, was in the 2060, 2060 Super, 2070 ballpark, depending on game. AW2's specs for the 2060 are for 1080p. 30 fps, and using DLSS quality, but the lowest other settings.

So, from the sounds of things, even if the 5700 XT had the hardware to run it, it probably wouldn't be a great experience. Playable? Probably. A good experience? Maybe not...
Basically Microsoft adopted features into DX12 ultimate which the 1000 series cards didn't support because they were four years old by 2020. 

It's perfectly fine for remedy to exclude them. This is like when devs would release games as dx11 only and some older cards would miss out. The 1000 series cards are also now older than a traditional console generation
A gtx 1080 is too weak is 2023 regardless
    Seems like some people expect that card to be good until the year 2060.

According to Alex from Digital Foundry, your PC will definitely outperform PS5 if it's more powerful.
or the PC specs were overblown.
Okay, so Digital Foundry has uploaded their analysis, and the quality mode is ~1270p upscaled to 4K and ~874p upscaled to 1440p (both using FSR 2) which is... okay.
    While many PC specs are unoptimized bs, I think people rarely make fair comparisons between PC and console. Console specs are often treated as native when more often than not there's a heavy use of FSR. 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people yet it's completely normal in PS5.
        > 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people

Would it? That's just 1440p with DLSS quality, that's a pretty normal combo.
Control was basically a graphics showcase for raytracing technology a few years back, so you'll want to play it somewhere you can take advantage of that. If your PC can push the graphics options, I'd probably recommend that over PS4.
A note on PS5 RTX: it's there and it's actually quite good, but you sacrifice a lot of frames in a pretty fast paced action game, so I tended to prefer playing with it off.

On PC though, especially now after a lot of optimization, it's still one of the best Ray-Tracing implementations years later.
That isn't even being nominated, the GOTY award is already in the mail to their offices.
    Needed that laugh. Thanks mate.
That's not a nominee because it would be too obvious a winner
    All hail the king!
        Don't say King! King Kong is copywritten. This is just Kong. All hail the Kong.
October is always crazy for games but this is on another level.
But don’t you know? Everyone on Reddit says “wahhhhhh gaming is so bad now, I miss the SNES”. And not that there’s anything wrong with loving SNES games, but this whole narrative of “gaming is so bad now” are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new
    Oh yeah, the boomers of gamers :D
    >are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new

to be fair the new COD MW3 remakes looks terrific
New Forza was good. We got a new Street Fighter and new Mortal Kombat this year. Fuck, even the 20-year old EVE Online is seeing a resurgence with its fall expansion content. CRAZY year for gaming.
    Momentum carrying over to next year as well. Tekken 8 and FF7 Rebirth baby
        Alone in the Dark in February too
Mario Wonder
Gollum
Mario Wonder
King Kong
It's one of the highest rated of the year so yeah, I think it definitely counts as one.
    Not disagreeing, but this year was so stacked it might just miss out on a nomination.

Dead Space remake
RE4 remake
Tears of the Kingdom
Spiderman 2 
Mario Wonders
Maybe Hi-Fi Rush
Streefighter 6
+maybe others I can't remember suddenly

Iirc there are only 6 nominees, so it's gonna be though to even get nominated. Other games like Lies of P and Jedi Survivor that'd've probably made it in other years have no chance this year.
        Yeah I think it will miss out too - BG3 is missing from your list and I think that and Starfield have more chance of being nominated than RE4 remake or Dead Space remake, remakes feel like waste of slots in such a stacked year

I think the shortlists will be something like BG3, Spiderman 2, Starfield, TOTK, Super Mario Wonder, Street Fighter 6/Alan Wake 2/Hifi Rush for the last slot
It's ironic that We got one good PC port for once and half the playerbase on PC can't play it lmao

Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.
    > Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.

I wouldn't go that far. The minimum requirement for this game is a 5 year old GPU. When Crysis came out, a 5 year old GPU would be lucky to run *any* AAA release that year.
    Crysis's issue is that they targeted single core performance just as the market shifted to focusing on multithreading. That means in practice it ends up acting unoptimized to a real world usecase.

Alan Wake 2, just like Control, appears to be extremely fine tuned in terms of optimization for real-world device expectations and runs well on low end cards (released after the shift to the mesh shader support).
        i finally caught onto the control train a week or two ago, and was shocked how well the game ran. i have a 3060ti and was able to run it at ultra and ray tracing everything and it never even stuttered, perfect 60 fps basically all game.
    The only thing consoles do better than PC is that nobody expects the PS4 to run PS5 games well, if at all, and yet people with hardware from last generation are salty they can’t play today’s titles.
Maybe don’t listen to the doomsayers…
Agreed. Covid had an indirect effect if anything to align releases.
Forspoken and Redfall were some real stinkers as well.
DS remake? Hopefully you didn't mean Demon's Souls.
    Dead space remake. Sorry, should have specified more.
        Oh right!! I forgot about that one. Thank you!
[I see you haven't gotten to experience the raptor.jpg cutscene from skull island yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfkHj_aPuTk)

Yes, that is the actual cutscene. Yes, the game is worse than both the things you listed.
    NO WAY LOLOL
>I have dozens of friends across the world...

Damn, I think I have like... 5 total.
lmao ok
I would add Cyberpunk 2077 in there too, because it just got released this year as far as I know lmao
For me it’s 2023 and 2017
I don't see how a website called XboxEra can in good conscience recommend the game if they didn't even review the Xbox version. Crazy that this had a big showing at the recent Xbox Partner Preview yet no one can play it on Xbox.
    They just added their Xbox Series X|S comments to the review up on Windows Central. Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush.
        > Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush

Yeah that's how it seems. I think personally if you are a console specific site and you don't get your version you should put that up.  Say we wanted to have something available for you but we cannot as they only provided codes for these platforms.  As such our recommendation is wait and see.


Edit: Thanks for the update on  Windows Central, I just checked it out. I wonder what you lose graphically by going to performance mode. I'll probably play in Quality mode but I always like to know what's different.  Time to see if anyone lays this out.
It was a shitshow of negativity this week before reviews came out lol
We need a new word to describe people whose lives are so wonderful that they have to turn the most trivial things into moronic hills to die on.
They are truly the console gamers they claim to be better than.
There are some scary parts for sure but there is also a lot of Twin Peaks style stuff and a good deal of police procedural. It is very hard to average it all out but I would say I found Alan Wake to be low on the scary scale(not sure it was aiming for that) and this is a bit higher due to some of the brutality that happens.
But I tend to skew very very low on horror impacting me during a game.
    Police procedural? That peaks my attention
I played mostly on normal and it was...about as expected. Somewhat challenging at times. The others are more or less and require more or less accuracy and not wasting ammo and scavaging a bit more.

New diff is coming in a patch in a month I think
    How scary is it for someone who really doesnt like jumpscares? Want to play it but im a scaredy cat in general
        There are for sure jump scares. There is also the overlay of FMV I talked about a bit in the review which can be startling.
I love them so its not really at all impartial if I say yes. Its not exactly needed
> Dang, the stiffness of dodge animation really got to you, huh? I can totally get that, and it's a bummer when a seemingly small but actually pretty fundamental part of gameplay lacks polish in games like these.

You're reminding me of how I just could not get over the dodge animations watching people play Calisto Protocol. They straight up looked like genre satire.
100%. I would love Spider-man even more if not for that weird hunched combat stance.
Aw shucks it's 92 now. Was 96 when I wrote that.
That's good enough then.
It sure ain't what I would consider a premier site.

But its a wonderful reminder that some people just don't like some types of games.
    Yeah I don't want to imply that all outlier reviews are clickbait, I just see a lot of clickbait articles from gamerant whenever I open up Google Chrome lol. Almost every time.
From the reviews above and the videos I've seen it still looks like you point a torch at enemies before shooting them?
Played through AW twice, Control twice, Quantum break has sadly been ignored still.... But end result is that I don't understand anything.
    [deleted]
        Yeah it's been on the todo list for ages.... it's just... so many releases atm that I barely have time to jump from one to the next without sacrificing other hobbies.
What a bizarre thing to say...



Alan wake and control both make sense.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Alan Wake. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Alan's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Alan Wake truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Alan's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Sam Lake's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have an Alan Wake tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
I don't have money for 20 games.
I would not blame Remedy since that was publishers choice
What did they do?
Add a lot of Stephen King into that blender and you have the series. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully we don't have to wait 13 years for a sequel.
https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/alan-wake-2-interview-true-detective-was-definitely-on-our-mind/
    Oh, I see, interesting. Well, the first game predates the show.
There is not a single part of Control that's remotely close to masterpiece lol

Combat has fun moments. Nothing revolutionary.
I’d love a packaged re-release of all 3 games.
    You're in luck, at least for the first two. [Remedy is remaking both of them as one game](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-enters-agreement-with-rockstar-games-for-new-max-payne-12-project/).
        Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
            Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
                Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
                    Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
                    It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                        Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
                On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.
                    MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
                Its more about the availability. For people that aren't pc gamers its not very accessible for a lot of us.
            I played through all three games on my Steam Deck a while back. Mac Payne 3 still holds up really, really well.
            >I hope something gets done with 3

I'm hoping the stars will align and they'll somehow get the opportunity to make the third game they intended to make as they clearly had ideas to continue the story that were never realized.
            Gunplay of Maxpayne 3 with hand to hand combat of the Warriers  for GTA6 But The Main Thing is the open World which is most important.
        Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Shit I'm excited about this.
        And then after Remedy makes a full remake of both games for modern consoles, Rockstar will drop a PS4 and XBOX port of Max Payne 3 without any changes (60$ of course)
So does Remedy and Alan Wake
What a good fucking series of fucking games. FUCK
I still play them from time to time. Was one of the first games I got when I got my first non-crazy-outdated laptop and could actually play 3D games, played the hell out of one and two (the third hadn't been developed/released at that time). Just really solid gameplay with a lot of character IMO.
Thats amazing lol. Fits right in with some of the meta stuff
I was mostly okay with the leveling system because it allowed you to do different stuff early on. Sure, by the time you were done with the game, you could unlock almost everything, but in the first half, putting points into flying vs. telekinesis vs. shields made the combat much different in repeat playthroughs.

But man, those weapon upgrades! There were what, five different Service Pistol modes, with 2 or 3 upgrade slots each? And then you'd get like a dozen upgrades for each mode, with no good way of sorting through them. Such a frustrating UI.
    And the upgrades have 6 levels and the game never stops giving you weak lvl 1 upgrades and you can only hold 24 so you have to clear them out. Control is one of my favorite games ever but this part sucks
    Yeah sorry I meant the gun upgrades. The skill upgrade system was fine. The gun upgrade/crafting system is insanely convoluted for no reason.

I kind of assumed there was DLC or a cash shop to make you pay for upgrade components but no... the system is just complicated for no reason at all.
Here are the only useful mods - damage, headshot damage, 100% ammo refund on hit, instant sniper shot recharge. That's it, maybe damage after kill for someone really good. It's so poorly thought out. I wish the mods were also more interesting than you can make the recoil less annoying (we made it annoying by default).
    Oh yeah that was the other thing, 80% of the mods are worthless and/or boring so grinding through hundreds of them gets tiring.
Yeah.. the skill tree is fine... the weapon/personal mod system is the only, frankly, terrible part of an amazing game. 

It goes against the pace of the game, it's mostly meaningless +X% upgrades, it takes a while for you to open more slots to put them in and the worst part is the small inventory. 

There's some good ones and they allow for flexible builds, that likely 99% of players will never use, but the implementation sucks.

I spent way too much time going through my inventory sorting through those mods deciding what to throw away so I could pick another one.

If they went to a separate stash at the hub, and or/you could combine the ones you collect to level them up it would be better. But just an infinite inventory would fix it, imo.
> Why do I have to collect random... uh... things... to craft weapon abilities?

i used a trainer to get all the abilities and realized it's not even worth it. even the highest levelled versions of most of the crafted items give you paltry single digit boosts.  
most pointless aspect of control imo
Non-spoiler version: The main game ends on a sudden cliff hanger with a bunch of plot threads left open. The DLC resolves the cliff hanger in the most unsatisfying way possible while refusing to resolve or progress anything else about the plot.

Spoiler version: >!At the end of the main game, the space base is about to explode, the main character has one last chance to escape, but he is suddenly attacked. Cut to black.!<

>!In the DLC the main character fights his way out of the base and finally escapes. Except, no, that's a lie, he was actually fatally mutilated at the end of the main game and the DLC is just his dying hallucinations. He's dead, everything blows up, the end.!<
     They actually changed the DLC to this because the game performed so poorly. Even Glen Schofield left the studio after how bad it did. Which is a shame because I think if they added in enemy variety, tightened up the storytelling, and made the melee combat better it could have been a great franchise. The game was one of the most beautiful to come out, too bad that’s where all the money went.
        They should've just dumped the whole melee combat system focus and focused more on a variety of ranged weapons with the melee acting as an emergency fall back. I get why they did it like this, to force proximity to the enemies to add tension, but it just didn't work out. 

In trying to not be like dead space, the game that was designed to be a spiritual successor managed to fail in both departments.
            I don't mind the focus on melee but the game just feels bad to play in general. I genuinely like most other things about it but man it's some awkward gameplay.
        It's a very pretty game but one big issue I have with the game that is a core aspect of it that you didn't mention is the level design. It's narrow corridor after narrow corridor. After playing the Dead Space remake, I just can't continue on with such a narrow linear level design.
    Wow. Im glad I didnt finish it despite being free on PSN.

The whole constant melee dodging is a terrible mechanic. Not sure how anyone thought that would be enjoyable the 10th or hundredth time
        It could've been a good system if it wasn't so janky.
Shat on the story and basically took a vague ending of the main game into a definitive "no sequel even possible with these characters" ending
It's funny that when I read 67 I think "oof" but I see 6.7 I think eh ok not the worst game ever.
I really disliked it, but would also give it a 6. So a 6-7 is pretty in line of what it should be rated
People may criticize the uses of cliches in Alan Wake, but at the very least it's clever how they wrote in a loophole to let them freely use cliches.

It isn't just that he's a writer, he's a writer who isn't used to writing horror at all (and his first attempt was in a fugue state while an evil darkness did the editing)
> Having cliches as a 'staple' doesn't mean that's necessarily a good thing. They can get tiring. 

So far Remedy has proven to be able to handle them pretty well though.
Not only does it connect them, but the entire DLC is about Alan Wake and Bright Falls.  Definitely worth a quick playthrough before AW2, I think.
Thanks
Same. It was my personal Game of the Year when it launched on PC. It is also the game that convinced me of DLSS and Raytracing because it allowed for some truly stunning visuals on my old RTX 2070S.
    I tried Control a good while after launch (thanks Epic Games) but it almost instantly grew into one of my all-time favorites. It's just pure Remedy.
I'm actually a bit bored by it. I'm about 6 hours in I think and getting lost seems to be common for me. really wish it was a bit easier to navigate. just thinking about having to spend time to figure out where I am right now makes me not want to play it unfortunately.
    It took me a while to adjust at first but the trick to navigating in Control is to pay attention to the signs on the walls, they actually are very direct.
    Control is a 5/10. Maybe a 6.5/10 on a good day when the combat doesn't seem repetitive as all hell and you're actually fighting enemies that don't look or behave identically everywhere.
I think Control is a divisive game - I played it for free on PS plus during Covid lockdowns when not a lot of games were being released and I couldn’t force myself to finish it.
This conversation is every thread now. Lol. 

It is accurate though. Lots of good games.
This year blows 2017 out of the water, respectfully
    FR, everything from the cyberpunk expac to armored core to the deadspace remake has been fucking gold this year.
    Eh, there's been a lot of iteration this year. I enjoyed BOTW and DOS2 a lot more than TOTK and BG3 and in the latter's case I think it's just a worse game than DOS2.

Overall this year has a lot of 8/10s, not much that's blowing me away.
    I couldn't disagree more. I honestly haven't found too much I've really liked this year; RE4 Remake, Metroid Prime Remastered and the Xenoblade DLC is about it so far.
        It may not be your personal best year in gaming based on your taste, but in terms of the sheer number of games that have released to massive sales and critical acclaim it's certainly one of the best years in the past decade, if not the best.
Yeah, that is the next closest I can think of.
You are  missing the game of the year in that list with Baulders gate 3. Plus starfield and cyberpunk phantom liberty.
    Don't forget armored core 6, also I don't think cyberpunk should be running for goty since that is just a dlc and an update to the game.
    Really gonna add starfield to a list of greatest games ever released
        What are you talking about? The list was great games released this year, not of all time lol.
> Re 4 and Alan wake 2 -horror craziness

Don't forget Dead Space remake
how could you forget Baldur's Gate, Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Armoured Core 6 and the most important of all GOTY Kong rise of skull island?
    Skull island is definitely the most innovative game of the bunch. Their inclusion of a jpeg shot in the middle of a cutscene?! That’s a game changer for the gaming industry
Agreed, though listing FF16 as an RPG, especially when BG3 exists is questionable lmao.
    Haven't got around to BG3 yet but I thought Octopath II was better than FF16 as an RPG.
        I’m not hating on FF16 to be clear, I just don’t think it counts as an RPG lmao, it’s an action game with some light RPG elements at best. 

I haven’t played Octopath II, maybe I should.
Cyberpunk comeback and the new expansion for that FPS hit maybe? Cyberpunk after this redemption arc turned out to be my most favorite game of all time tbh.
Very long time since we’ve had a 10/10 FPS and it’s hard to do, even Sony hasn’t had a crack at one in 10 years
FF16 is not an RPG, no matter what it purports to be. It is a single player semi-open world action game with a quest structure.
Cyberpunk & Phantom Liberty especially ould definitely cover that FPS part for you I promise
Not sure I'd call it a "dive".  She's pretty clearly been living a weird, odd life since childhood and has been seeking answers and expecting an escalation for years. 

Have never understood the complaints about unwilling protagonists, but I'm not the type to demand unabashed power trip fantasies and faulty logic in all of my fiction.
    I don't really see the connection between unwilling/willing protagonists and power fantasies. They are two mostly unconnected qualities for characters. You can have power fantasies with reluctant protagonists or you can have power fantasies with willing protagonists.
I think you’re right in regard to diving in. I think her experiences in Ordinary helped make her more accepting to her new reality too.
[removed]
They really needed those pseudo-audio logs - calls on the phone and whatever - to be able to play over gameplay, rather than accessed and listened to in a menu.
    Agreed. I will NEVER understand games that don't allow us to move as we listen to audio logs. It is punishment of the highest order.
Yeah same. Like, I still really enjoyed the atmosphere and the worldbuilding stories, but I feel like the game kinda lost the plot and didn't answer many questions by the end. I still fucking love that game though.
Man I fucking hate when storytelling is done nearly exclusively through fucking memos and audio logs. It annoys me to no end and really makes me feel disconnected.
Very well put. 

Easily the weakest characters I've seen in a Remedy game but the atmosphere, graphics and to a lesser extent the combat made up for it. 

Fun game but 8/10 *max* IMO.
    I feel like if they'd made Jesse more punk like in their original vision, and had her be significantly angrier at the FBC, she would have landed a lot better.
From all the reviews it seems the performance is pretty good everywhere. I’m excited to get nuts on PC tonight.
If you are in Europe i am afraid you cant play until the morning :( i'm in the same boat i think unlock time is somewhere 7am really annoying and i don't want to play a horror game in daylight. So i need to wait until Friday evening.
    that’s a bummer man, fortunately (for once) I’m in the Midwest US. 11PM for us.

The really lucky fucks on the west coast get it at 9
I'd still recommend playing it at 30 on consoles
Uh, excuse you bud, you forgot Chair Guy and Bug-Looking Flashlight Head.
To be honest: if the core gameplay loop is actually great, you don't really need any new mechanics after a certain point.
    AW's gameplay is anything but great
    That's the problem, it isn't that great. The gameplay is pretty meh.
        Alan please start doing cardio so you can run for more than three seconds.
yeah i dropped it when i realized the gameplay was going to be the same atrocious slog all the way through, i did enjoy the atmosphere though

maybe will look at this on a deep sale or something
    I wouldn't go as far as calling it an atrocious slog. As I said, the gameplay fundamentals are actually pretty decent, it just doesn't carry the game for the entire duration of the story. It almost feels like this story is in the wrong medium.
Holy shit...I've found a rare silent hill fan that doesn't go "Blah Blah Blah, silent hill 2, BLAH BLAH BLAH!"
I’ve never played a remedy game but Alan Wake 2 looks super cool. When I get a ps5 this holiday it may be one of the first games I pick up
Imagine an Alan Wake DLC but it features Jesse Faden.
    They could call it Alan Wake 2: JFE 

Control: AWE was Altered World Event, but we all really know it stood for **A**lan **W**ake **E**xpansion
        Or as I call it the Alan Wake Experience
            Alan Wake Experience was one of my favorite bands from the late 60s lol
    Full circle!
Ragnarok felt like such a dip in quality story telling wise. I get they wanted to do a duology and I do respect the fuck out of that decision but they crammed in too much into one package. Towards the end it felt like plot beats were there to be checked off and then it was on to the next.
    This was my main complaint of the game too. The titular “ragnarok” event itself was crammed into like the last 20 minutes of the game. I really enjoyed the build up to it but damn they couldn’t deliver on their huge promises

That and you have these weird slow moments like everything with Angrboda where the game just haults. It felt like the MJ segments in spider-man

I’m fine with a slow buildup but there were so many whiplash moments where the game was both rushed and also bogged down by too many storylines
        Right? I had that same thought about the actual Ragnarok event. We’re building to this whole event and then oh hey bye it’s over. 

The rumor is that they debated making Ragnarok 1 or 2 games (so that the whole thing would have either been a duology or a trilogy with GoW 2018) and I think that they made a real mistake by not making it a trilogy. The story in Ragnarok is told at an absolutely breakneck pace, but not in a good way - they tried to put way too much in. 

Even the big emotional plot twist death (which I’ll keep vague just in case people haven’t played) felt so rushed to me. It was just like “oh whoa welp they’re dead now anyways moving on” and I honestly didn’t even really care that they died. That should have been the emotional finale to the second game, and then the third game should have focused entirely on the Ragnarok event itself.
I love the Voice Actor for Odin and I like his performance overall but yeah there were a few odd lines here and there. 


Really the game should have been split, but I understand why they didnt.
    I mean, it's good acting, I wrote about writing, not the performer. Good actors speak in Marvel "Illumi-what-ti" style and that was really bad.
God the actual spoken dialogue was such a disappointment to me in Ragnarok. I remember right from the beginning when Odin refers to Freya as his “ex” that I wasn’t going to love the dialogue. And that’s not to say that the dialogue in the first game was perfect, but it definitely felt different
    The question that always comes to me when I see comments like this is one of curiosity, what would you have said instead? Genuinely it always interests me when I see topics like this come up.
        I’m not even going to pretend that I’m skilled as a writer, so I honestly don’t know. But saying the phrase “my ex” is such a modern way of speaking and that’s what takes me out of it because that’s not how the game is framed. It we’re talking about a game like Immortal Fenix Rising, or hell even the animated Disney Hercules movie, the modern way of speaking works there because it’s in line with the overall presentation and “vibe” of the media. But God of War 2018 (and Ragnarok) play things _so_ straight, so to hear super modern dialogue/speech patterns in a game that’s trying to present a somewhat realistic/grounded take on this mythology just feels really out of place
Odin was so disappointing in Ragnarok.

>!His boss fight was really underwhelming too, could have had him transform into Kratos, or Atreus, or Tyr, or any number of more interesting things than just having him fight you with a spear and bit of magic. Doesn't make any sense how Kratos couldn't just tear him into pieces instantly.!<

Think the game as a whole was pretty weak.
    Ragnarok really sucked compared to the previous game. Felt very “marvel”ised at a risk of sounding a bit circlejerky
        Ragnarok didn't suck.  The boss fights were a letdown, and the story was not anywhere near as good.  But the combat was way better/smoother than the first.
            I don't remember any boss from the first game other than the first baldur fight and the dragon 🤷‍♂️ that was always my biggest complaint from it. So idk how anyone could think Ragnarok did them worse. Like thor and the Gryla fight more than made up for that imo.
                For me the final Baldr fight with Freya controlling the giant, and the Valkyrie Queen fight were good standouts as well.
                Because honestly, they’re still a letdown from previous GoW games.
                    Hey kids you like quick time events???
            “Ragnarok really sucked compared to the first game”

Important distinction if you read this back
    I thought the game was great with the exception of the ending. So much potential crammed into a rushed set of sequences and underwhelming boss fights.
    Yes, pretty mediocre game. I think, it was rushed, it felt in every storyline. New characters appear, drama around them out of nowhere, Freia (who hunted Kratos between games) becomes good in like 1 mission
I didn't think the writing in the first GoW was that special either, but Ragnarok's was especially bad. You're definitely not alone there. I felt like I was playing a Marvel film.
    I remember it being more subtle (like BOY through the game) and smart. One liners didn't feel forced and sometimes Kratos was just silent. In Ragnarok it was too usual for Marvel writing and all the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)
        >the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)

He doesn't say that though. He just says "i fucked up"
Vehemently disagree, I thought this version of Odin was phenomenal. Richard Schiff is a wonderful actor and I think it was a stroke of brilliance to get the guy who played the white house comms director from West Wing to play the character. Highlighted the difference of styles between Kratos and Odin, one who mostly wins with might and the other who manipulates and deceives.
Ex is a term dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. Snack dates back to the 1500s. Odin is well read and due to partaking in the Well of Knowledge he knows every language. Just because you aren't familiar with casual dialect in other languages doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Both Anthony Burch and Cara Ellison wrote for Ragnarok and have mostly poor, overly-online-trope/reference type writing, sure. 

Whedon’s style was refreshing once upon a time, it’s just aged, stale and overused now. Audiences are tired of it.
    I'm not familiar with Ellison's work and Burch is yeah... well, very, very unfortunate choice for any serious story. And Whedon, man. Buffy was my jam, but he now lives rent-free in my head for the irreperable damage he caused to American writing industry with The Avengers (2012) template of quips and quirky writing.

But my point was I don't feel like it's apparent lack of Barlog in Ragnarok. His career history is of a game director from God of War II, not a primary writer. It certainly never felt like there was a point where I would compare him to, like you said, Lake or Houser. Maybe in cinematic department.
        I can definitely argue that Anthony can do serious. His storyline in Dungeons and Daddies gets surprisingly serious, but God of War isn't the right setting for him.
            I can agree on point that he can do serious story, he wrote Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but even then he did \*hammy\* as fuck writing. Which is what didn't make him right for a story that takes itself seriously as GoW Reboot.

If he does it better on his podcast, I'll take your word for it, but for me he's still 2012 9gag level of humour from Hey Ash!
                This is fair. His use of language is too modern for something more period period like GoW.
Joss Whedon of video game writing is very accurate lol, the Atreus and Sindri sections were pretty brutal for me. Felt like some cheap MCU knockoff, the dialogue was just all snarky quips. Got annoying real fast
I think it's completely fine for stories to be incoherent in a traditional sense, and it makes complete sense that Remedy games are like that since they take so much inspiration from David Lynch's work.
    For real. Half of Alan Wake is like a love letter to Twin Peaks.
    I think it's fine to enjoy the pulpiness of Control's writing but I don't think it gets close to the level Lynch is capable of. He's one of the most celebrated filmmakers ever for a reason.
        Sure, but is Lynch considered one of the most celebrated writers in the industry ever? I'd argue no, and he's my favourite filmmaker.


That's not to say that Sam Lake is as good as Lynch is, but I do think Lynch is also so much more about atmosphere and mood than he is focused on writing structured and coherent screenplays, or defined character arcs and such.
        I think the real trick and talent with them is they can make things cheesey without undermining the game itself, like, the game can have fun and be silly while also always fully believing in its world and its characters. Like when Control has Darling do a fuckin Dynamite cover from beyond the Nth dimension to cheer Jesse on I'm giggling like an idiot, but also buying that this is something Darling the person would do, and when it throws that Computer Program Dead Letter at you in the Foundation man I genuinely started crying, just the overall presentation of stumbling onto something so sad and personal in the form of some forgotten, misplaced government paperwork. And through all that they made a game where those two things can be part of the same experience, which imo is a generally impressive bit of ability. It's not moment-to-moment screenwriting excellence, but I think it is a form of writing skill, writing and assembling a whole, cohesive, and intentional vision for a script that's not for film, or TV, or a novel, but a video game specifically. Rather than, say, trying to smuggle a B-tier Oscar bait screenplay into a medium with lower standards where the impression of prestige television can carry you.
> but I think this is unnecessarily harsh toward most games writers.

They deserve the harshness, I don't see why we can't hold games to the same standards as film or literature.
    Comparing to films or literature is something people who have no idea how game writing works say. 

Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement. 

Films have more people involved, but are still far easier than games due to the smaller team size and the fact you can write stuff like "They take their shirt off" or "They hand over an object" and an animation team doesn't come and say "Ha, yeah, we can't do that."

Film and literature are breezes in the park comparably for writers.
        > Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement.

These are definite differences, good writing is often an afterthought after gameplay and graphics, but I'm still going to hold games to the same standard. I will judge them for poor characterization, awkward dialogue, stilted acting, etc, though I'll place most of the blame on the directors/producers for tolerating these during production. 

Game directors like Miyazaki at From Software and Neil Druckmann at Naughty Dog have shown that good writing in AAA games is possible (though Miyazaki's better at storytale unique suited to videogames, Druckmann's just got at supervising naturalistic dialogue and acting), and there are plenty of well-writen indie games.

If gamers are happy with slop and don't raise any criticisms, they'll continue to get slop.
    Because they're working for a large corporation making games that are basically blockbuster movies. And to be honest most AAA games are written better than your average blockbuster.

Like they're not auteurs. This isn't Tarkovsky.
I think the thing is that at the time of Uncharted 2 when Sony games started with this kind of writing, games that were written as well as the average Marvel movie were genuinely like 95th percentile as far as game stories went. But as the industry matured they often now feel a little generic, immature, sometimes cringeworthy, and often insincere.
    I think Sony and Naughty Dog specifically should get a lot of credit for at least being progressive in trying to write a good story. I do think TLOU2 tried too hard and other Sony titles (Horizon, Spider-Man, GoW) are being overrated for their storytelling.
That’s my main problem with the game too. Just feels like I‘m watching the Raimi movies again but with more quips, less laughs and none of the charisma. 

Also doesn’t help that I enjoy Miles as a character more than Peter, but he is really just kinda there and occasionally helps out with stuff.
It's the GOAT for me in terms of 3rd person shooters. Nothing has ever exceeded it, I really hope we get a port for Switch, and I also hope Remedy take inspiration from 3 for its remakes of the first two games.
felt like i was taking crazy pills with that take. story and presentation was far better in the previous games.
They just took Max Payne and put him in Man On Fire with some forced noir tropes and dialogue. I'd hardly call it an evolution.
We'll have to see how the 2060 does then in testing, because the 5700 XT, the fastest of that generation on the AMD side, was in the 2060, 2060 Super, 2070 ballpark, depending on game. AW2's specs for the 2060 are for 1080p. 30 fps, and using DLSS quality, but the lowest other settings.

So, from the sounds of things, even if the 5700 XT had the hardware to run it, it probably wouldn't be a great experience. Playable? Probably. A good experience? Maybe not...
Seems like some people expect that card to be good until the year 2060.
While many PC specs are unoptimized bs, I think people rarely make fair comparisons between PC and console. Console specs are often treated as native when more often than not there's a heavy use of FSR. 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people yet it's completely normal in PS5.
    > 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people

Would it? That's just 1440p with DLSS quality, that's a pretty normal combo.
Needed that laugh. Thanks mate.
All hail the king!
    Don't say King! King Kong is copywritten. This is just Kong. All hail the Kong.
Oh yeah, the boomers of gamers :D
>are people that either only play Call of Duty or refuse to try anything new

to be fair the new COD MW3 remakes looks terrific
Momentum carrying over to next year as well. Tekken 8 and FF7 Rebirth baby
    Alone in the Dark in February too
Not disagreeing, but this year was so stacked it might just miss out on a nomination.

Dead Space remake
RE4 remake
Tears of the Kingdom
Spiderman 2 
Mario Wonders
Maybe Hi-Fi Rush
Streefighter 6
+maybe others I can't remember suddenly

Iirc there are only 6 nominees, so it's gonna be though to even get nominated. Other games like Lies of P and Jedi Survivor that'd've probably made it in other years have no chance this year.
    Yeah I think it will miss out too - BG3 is missing from your list and I think that and Starfield have more chance of being nominated than RE4 remake or Dead Space remake, remakes feel like waste of slots in such a stacked year

I think the shortlists will be something like BG3, Spiderman 2, Starfield, TOTK, Super Mario Wonder, Street Fighter 6/Alan Wake 2/Hifi Rush for the last slot
> Alan Wake 2 is officially Crysis of this generation.

I wouldn't go that far. The minimum requirement for this game is a 5 year old GPU. When Crysis came out, a 5 year old GPU would be lucky to run *any* AAA release that year.
Crysis's issue is that they targeted single core performance just as the market shifted to focusing on multithreading. That means in practice it ends up acting unoptimized to a real world usecase.

Alan Wake 2, just like Control, appears to be extremely fine tuned in terms of optimization for real-world device expectations and runs well on low end cards (released after the shift to the mesh shader support).
    i finally caught onto the control train a week or two ago, and was shocked how well the game ran. i have a 3060ti and was able to run it at ultra and ray tracing everything and it never even stuttered, perfect 60 fps basically all game.
The only thing consoles do better than PC is that nobody expects the PS4 to run PS5 games well, if at all, and yet people with hardware from last generation are salty they can’t play today’s titles.
Dead space remake. Sorry, should have specified more.
    Oh right!! I forgot about that one. Thank you!
NO WAY LOLOL
They just added their Xbox Series X|S comments to the review up on Windows Central. Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush.
    > Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush

Yeah that's how it seems. I think personally if you are a console specific site and you don't get your version you should put that up.  Say we wanted to have something available for you but we cannot as they only provided codes for these platforms.  As such our recommendation is wait and see.


Edit: Thanks for the update on  Windows Central, I just checked it out. I wonder what you lose graphically by going to performance mode. I'll probably play in Quality mode but I always like to know what's different.  Time to see if anyone lays this out.
Police procedural? That peaks my attention
How scary is it for someone who really doesnt like jumpscares? Want to play it but im a scaredy cat in general
    There are for sure jump scares. There is also the overlay of FMV I talked about a bit in the review which can be startling.
Yeah I don't want to imply that all outlier reviews are clickbait, I just see a lot of clickbait articles from gamerant whenever I open up Google Chrome lol. Almost every time.
[deleted]
    Yeah it's been on the todo list for ages.... it's just... so many releases atm that I barely have time to jump from one to the next without sacrificing other hobbies.
Oh, I see, interesting. Well, the first game predates the show.
You're in luck, at least for the first two. [Remedy is remaking both of them as one game](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-enters-agreement-with-rockstar-games-for-new-max-payne-12-project/).
    Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
        Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
            Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
                Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
                It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                    Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
            On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.
                MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
            Its more about the availability. For people that aren't pc gamers its not very accessible for a lot of us.
        I played through all three games on my Steam Deck a while back. Mac Payne 3 still holds up really, really well.
        >I hope something gets done with 3

I'm hoping the stars will align and they'll somehow get the opportunity to make the third game they intended to make as they clearly had ideas to continue the story that were never realized.
        Gunplay of Maxpayne 3 with hand to hand combat of the Warriers  for GTA6 But The Main Thing is the open World which is most important.
    Are you freaking kidding me?! 

Shit I'm excited about this.
    And then after Remedy makes a full remake of both games for modern consoles, Rockstar will drop a PS4 and XBOX port of Max Payne 3 without any changes (60$ of course)
And the upgrades have 6 levels and the game never stops giving you weak lvl 1 upgrades and you can only hold 24 so you have to clear them out. Control is one of my favorite games ever but this part sucks
Yeah sorry I meant the gun upgrades. The skill upgrade system was fine. The gun upgrade/crafting system is insanely convoluted for no reason.

I kind of assumed there was DLC or a cash shop to make you pay for upgrade components but no... the system is just complicated for no reason at all.
Oh yeah that was the other thing, 80% of the mods are worthless and/or boring so grinding through hundreds of them gets tiring.
 They actually changed the DLC to this because the game performed so poorly. Even Glen Schofield left the studio after how bad it did. Which is a shame because I think if they added in enemy variety, tightened up the storytelling, and made the melee combat better it could have been a great franchise. The game was one of the most beautiful to come out, too bad that’s where all the money went.
    They should've just dumped the whole melee combat system focus and focused more on a variety of ranged weapons with the melee acting as an emergency fall back. I get why they did it like this, to force proximity to the enemies to add tension, but it just didn't work out. 

In trying to not be like dead space, the game that was designed to be a spiritual successor managed to fail in both departments.
        I don't mind the focus on melee but the game just feels bad to play in general. I genuinely like most other things about it but man it's some awkward gameplay.
    It's a very pretty game but one big issue I have with the game that is a core aspect of it that you didn't mention is the level design. It's narrow corridor after narrow corridor. After playing the Dead Space remake, I just can't continue on with such a narrow linear level design.
Wow. Im glad I didnt finish it despite being free on PSN.

The whole constant melee dodging is a terrible mechanic. Not sure how anyone thought that would be enjoyable the 10th or hundredth time
    It could've been a good system if it wasn't so janky.
I tried Control a good while after launch (thanks Epic Games) but it almost instantly grew into one of my all-time favorites. It's just pure Remedy.
It took me a while to adjust at first but the trick to navigating in Control is to pay attention to the signs on the walls, they actually are very direct.
Control is a 5/10. Maybe a 6.5/10 on a good day when the combat doesn't seem repetitive as all hell and you're actually fighting enemies that don't look or behave identically everywhere.
FR, everything from the cyberpunk expac to armored core to the deadspace remake has been fucking gold this year.
Eh, there's been a lot of iteration this year. I enjoyed BOTW and DOS2 a lot more than TOTK and BG3 and in the latter's case I think it's just a worse game than DOS2.

Overall this year has a lot of 8/10s, not much that's blowing me away.
I couldn't disagree more. I honestly haven't found too much I've really liked this year; RE4 Remake, Metroid Prime Remastered and the Xenoblade DLC is about it so far.
    It may not be your personal best year in gaming based on your taste, but in terms of the sheer number of games that have released to massive sales and critical acclaim it's certainly one of the best years in the past decade, if not the best.
Don't forget armored core 6, also I don't think cyberpunk should be running for goty since that is just a dlc and an update to the game.
Really gonna add starfield to a list of greatest games ever released
    What are you talking about? The list was great games released this year, not of all time lol.
Skull island is definitely the most innovative game of the bunch. Their inclusion of a jpeg shot in the middle of a cutscene?! That’s a game changer for the gaming industry
Haven't got around to BG3 yet but I thought Octopath II was better than FF16 as an RPG.
    I’m not hating on FF16 to be clear, I just don’t think it counts as an RPG lmao, it’s an action game with some light RPG elements at best. 

I haven’t played Octopath II, maybe I should.
I don't really see the connection between unwilling/willing protagonists and power fantasies. They are two mostly unconnected qualities for characters. You can have power fantasies with reluctant protagonists or you can have power fantasies with willing protagonists.
Agreed. I will NEVER understand games that don't allow us to move as we listen to audio logs. It is punishment of the highest order.
I feel like if they'd made Jesse more punk like in their original vision, and had her be significantly angrier at the FBC, she would have landed a lot better.
that’s a bummer man, fortunately (for once) I’m in the Midwest US. 11PM for us.

The really lucky fucks on the west coast get it at 9
AW's gameplay is anything but great
That's the problem, it isn't that great. The gameplay is pretty meh.
    Alan please start doing cardio so you can run for more than three seconds.
I wouldn't go as far as calling it an atrocious slog. As I said, the gameplay fundamentals are actually pretty decent, it just doesn't carry the game for the entire duration of the story. It almost feels like this story is in the wrong medium.
They could call it Alan Wake 2: JFE 

Control: AWE was Altered World Event, but we all really know it stood for **A**lan **W**ake **E**xpansion
    Or as I call it the Alan Wake Experience
        Alan Wake Experience was one of my favorite bands from the late 60s lol
Full circle!
This was my main complaint of the game too. The titular “ragnarok” event itself was crammed into like the last 20 minutes of the game. I really enjoyed the build up to it but damn they couldn’t deliver on their huge promises

That and you have these weird slow moments like everything with Angrboda where the game just haults. It felt like the MJ segments in spider-man

I’m fine with a slow buildup but there were so many whiplash moments where the game was both rushed and also bogged down by too many storylines
    Right? I had that same thought about the actual Ragnarok event. We’re building to this whole event and then oh hey bye it’s over. 

The rumor is that they debated making Ragnarok 1 or 2 games (so that the whole thing would have either been a duology or a trilogy with GoW 2018) and I think that they made a real mistake by not making it a trilogy. The story in Ragnarok is told at an absolutely breakneck pace, but not in a good way - they tried to put way too much in. 

Even the big emotional plot twist death (which I’ll keep vague just in case people haven’t played) felt so rushed to me. It was just like “oh whoa welp they’re dead now anyways moving on” and I honestly didn’t even really care that they died. That should have been the emotional finale to the second game, and then the third game should have focused entirely on the Ragnarok event itself.
I mean, it's good acting, I wrote about writing, not the performer. Good actors speak in Marvel "Illumi-what-ti" style and that was really bad.
The question that always comes to me when I see comments like this is one of curiosity, what would you have said instead? Genuinely it always interests me when I see topics like this come up.
    I’m not even going to pretend that I’m skilled as a writer, so I honestly don’t know. But saying the phrase “my ex” is such a modern way of speaking and that’s what takes me out of it because that’s not how the game is framed. It we’re talking about a game like Immortal Fenix Rising, or hell even the animated Disney Hercules movie, the modern way of speaking works there because it’s in line with the overall presentation and “vibe” of the media. But God of War 2018 (and Ragnarok) play things _so_ straight, so to hear super modern dialogue/speech patterns in a game that’s trying to present a somewhat realistic/grounded take on this mythology just feels really out of place
Ragnarok really sucked compared to the previous game. Felt very “marvel”ised at a risk of sounding a bit circlejerky
    Ragnarok didn't suck.  The boss fights were a letdown, and the story was not anywhere near as good.  But the combat was way better/smoother than the first.
        I don't remember any boss from the first game other than the first baldur fight and the dragon 🤷‍♂️ that was always my biggest complaint from it. So idk how anyone could think Ragnarok did them worse. Like thor and the Gryla fight more than made up for that imo.
            For me the final Baldr fight with Freya controlling the giant, and the Valkyrie Queen fight were good standouts as well.
            Because honestly, they’re still a letdown from previous GoW games.
                Hey kids you like quick time events???
        “Ragnarok really sucked compared to the first game”

Important distinction if you read this back
I thought the game was great with the exception of the ending. So much potential crammed into a rushed set of sequences and underwhelming boss fights.
Yes, pretty mediocre game. I think, it was rushed, it felt in every storyline. New characters appear, drama around them out of nowhere, Freia (who hunted Kratos between games) becomes good in like 1 mission
I remember it being more subtle (like BOY through the game) and smart. One liners didn't feel forced and sometimes Kratos was just silent. In Ragnarok it was too usual for Marvel writing and all the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)
    >the characters always talk about what should be shown ("Yes, I was a bad father, I am drunk and stupid" Thor's monologue after the bar fight)

He doesn't say that though. He just says "i fucked up"
I'm not familiar with Ellison's work and Burch is yeah... well, very, very unfortunate choice for any serious story. And Whedon, man. Buffy was my jam, but he now lives rent-free in my head for the irreperable damage he caused to American writing industry with The Avengers (2012) template of quips and quirky writing.

But my point was I don't feel like it's apparent lack of Barlog in Ragnarok. His career history is of a game director from God of War II, not a primary writer. It certainly never felt like there was a point where I would compare him to, like you said, Lake or Houser. Maybe in cinematic department.
    I can definitely argue that Anthony can do serious. His storyline in Dungeons and Daddies gets surprisingly serious, but God of War isn't the right setting for him.
        I can agree on point that he can do serious story, he wrote Handsome Jack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, but even then he did \*hammy\* as fuck writing. Which is what didn't make him right for a story that takes itself seriously as GoW Reboot.

If he does it better on his podcast, I'll take your word for it, but for me he's still 2012 9gag level of humour from Hey Ash!
            This is fair. His use of language is too modern for something more period period like GoW.
For real. Half of Alan Wake is like a love letter to Twin Peaks.
I think it's fine to enjoy the pulpiness of Control's writing but I don't think it gets close to the level Lynch is capable of. He's one of the most celebrated filmmakers ever for a reason.
    Sure, but is Lynch considered one of the most celebrated writers in the industry ever? I'd argue no, and he's my favourite filmmaker.


That's not to say that Sam Lake is as good as Lynch is, but I do think Lynch is also so much more about atmosphere and mood than he is focused on writing structured and coherent screenplays, or defined character arcs and such.
    I think the real trick and talent with them is they can make things cheesey without undermining the game itself, like, the game can have fun and be silly while also always fully believing in its world and its characters. Like when Control has Darling do a fuckin Dynamite cover from beyond the Nth dimension to cheer Jesse on I'm giggling like an idiot, but also buying that this is something Darling the person would do, and when it throws that Computer Program Dead Letter at you in the Foundation man I genuinely started crying, just the overall presentation of stumbling onto something so sad and personal in the form of some forgotten, misplaced government paperwork. And through all that they made a game where those two things can be part of the same experience, which imo is a generally impressive bit of ability. It's not moment-to-moment screenwriting excellence, but I think it is a form of writing skill, writing and assembling a whole, cohesive, and intentional vision for a script that's not for film, or TV, or a novel, but a video game specifically. Rather than, say, trying to smuggle a B-tier Oscar bait screenplay into a medium with lower standards where the impression of prestige television can carry you.
Comparing to films or literature is something people who have no idea how game writing works say. 

Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement. 

Films have more people involved, but are still far easier than games due to the smaller team size and the fact you can write stuff like "They take their shirt off" or "They hand over an object" and an animation team doesn't come and say "Ha, yeah, we can't do that."

Film and literature are breezes in the park comparably for writers.
    > Games have waaaaaaaay more things the writers are forced to deal with like all the gameplay stuff, being told X has to happen at Y no matter what, that there has to be Z gameplay here because we say so, "No you can't do that there, because the world team already made something there" etc. In literature, the writer is controlling literally every aspect of it from start to finish with small changes due to editor feedbacks/involvement.

These are definite differences, good writing is often an afterthought after gameplay and graphics, but I'm still going to hold games to the same standard. I will judge them for poor characterization, awkward dialogue, stilted acting, etc, though I'll place most of the blame on the directors/producers for tolerating these during production. 

Game directors like Miyazaki at From Software and Neil Druckmann at Naughty Dog have shown that good writing in AAA games is possible (though Miyazaki's better at storytale unique suited to videogames, Druckmann's just got at supervising naturalistic dialogue and acting), and there are plenty of well-writen indie games.

If gamers are happy with slop and don't raise any criticisms, they'll continue to get slop.
Because they're working for a large corporation making games that are basically blockbuster movies. And to be honest most AAA games are written better than your average blockbuster.

Like they're not auteurs. This isn't Tarkovsky.
I think Sony and Naughty Dog specifically should get a lot of credit for at least being progressive in trying to write a good story. I do think TLOU2 tried too hard and other Sony titles (Horizon, Spider-Man, GoW) are being overrated for their storytelling.
> 900p upscaled to 1440 would be unacceptable on PC for many people

Would it? That's just 1440p with DLSS quality, that's a pretty normal combo.
Don't say King! King Kong is copywritten. This is just Kong. All hail the Kong.
Alone in the Dark in February too
Yeah I think it will miss out too - BG3 is missing from your list and I think that and Starfield have more chance of being nominated than RE4 remake or Dead Space remake, remakes feel like waste of slots in such a stacked year

I think the shortlists will be something like BG3, Spiderman 2, Starfield, TOTK, Super Mario Wonder, Street Fighter 6/Alan Wake 2/Hifi Rush for the last slot
i finally caught onto the control train a week or two ago, and was shocked how well the game ran. i have a 3060ti and was able to run it at ultra and ray tracing everything and it never even stuttered, perfect 60 fps basically all game.
Oh right!! I forgot about that one. Thank you!
> Also, seems a lot of these outlets don’t care as long as they get something out in time to be included in the review rush

Yeah that's how it seems. I think personally if you are a console specific site and you don't get your version you should put that up.  Say we wanted to have something available for you but we cannot as they only provided codes for these platforms.  As such our recommendation is wait and see.


Edit: Thanks for the update on  Windows Central, I just checked it out. I wonder what you lose graphically by going to performance mode. I'll probably play in Quality mode but I always like to know what's different.  Time to see if anyone lays this out.
There are for sure jump scares. There is also the overlay of FMV I talked about a bit in the review which can be startling.
Yeah it's been on the todo list for ages.... it's just... so many releases atm that I barely have time to jump from one to the next without sacrificing other hobbies.
Oh I know, I am giddy whenever I remember haha. I hope something gets done with 3, I know there are issues with some of the pacing and cutscenes etc but I don’t think I’ve ever played a third person shooter that made it so satisfying to shoot motherfuckers. 

Still no idea why GTAV and onwards didn’t take more from the controls of that game, it felt fantastic.
    Does 3 really need a re-release though? It holds up graphically and the stuff you mentioned (pacing) would need a full remake to fix.
        Seriously It blows my mind how much better max Payne looked than GTA V. There are parts of it that stand next to red dead 2! Would love to see the detail rockstar could squeeze out of a modern linear game
            Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
            It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
                Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
        On PC it's fine. But console players are stuck digging out an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to play it.

Whenever I wanna indulge my video game psycho tendencies, I make sure my Arthur is suited up, get him a couple of semi-auto pistols, and just go nuts in Saint Denis. Get a nice haircut, put some pomade on, and from the right angle - especially in those cinematic kill cams - it looks like you're playing Max Payne 3.
It probably helps that instead of a sprawling open world with a million moving parts, MP3 is a series of much more narrow, tightly handcrafted set pieces with fewer parts because everything outside the set pieces are facades
    Yes for sure. Thats why I said I'd like to see the detail they could squeeze out of a modern linear game.
MP3 is backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series consoles.
