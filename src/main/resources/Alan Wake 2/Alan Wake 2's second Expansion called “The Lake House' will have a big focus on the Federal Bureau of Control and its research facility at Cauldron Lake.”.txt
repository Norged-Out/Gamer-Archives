[[Alan Wake 2's second Expansion called “The Lake House' will have a big focus on the Federal Bureau of Control and its research facility at Cauldron Lake.”]]



Sam Lake talks about Alan Wake 2, Control 2 and more

“We were happy with what we achieved with Control’s AWE expansion regarding setting up Alan Wake 2,”

“there will be hints about things to come in the Control sequel,”


Sam writing his character to be naked in the short film and decide to reverse course on set is pretty hilarious
    🤣I just read it rofl
Reminded me of monsters vs aliens with the red button.
    “Alan found himself naked on a short film set. He was like, totally hung and had a six-pack.” - me, if I was writing myself in the dark place as Alan Wake.
        It has to be earned my friend
            Being totally hung?
                Well if you're adding it to the story at least. Some of us are just lucky
    Isn't Sam still naked in the Sauna scene with Ahti?


Although, granted, the interview specifically talks about being naked during the sacrifice scene, to parallel Nightingale in the opening, and. In the sacrifice scene in Yötön Yö, there's a bunch of nameless cultists, and Ilmari Huotari, and Alèn Veikko/Thomas Seine/Zane/Ilkka Villi, and also Baba Jakala/Barbara Jagger. 


There's probably a difference between being naked in a Sauna, a Finnish tradition, with one other naked person, and being naked in the middle of the woods with a bunch of other people that are fully clothed, including a lady. It could be embarrassing for him, there could be some sexual harassment accusations to get him canceled.


...What I wonder is if he added the sauna scene after deciding not to be naked at the sacrifice, because he still wanted to be naked somewhere in the film.
        I’d argue there’s probably a difference being murdered while naked and chilling in the sauna with the boys. Sam is a bit new to acting as he’s admitted, being uncomfortable with the former is nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just kind of silly
    Holy hell you're telling me Casey actually directed the game? That's amazing!
        The visual actor for Casey/the face and voice of the Finnish actor character, not the voice - of Casey - that was a separate dude :)
But yes, Sam Lake aka the face of Max Payne and writer and director of all of Remedy's games :)
            I just finished the full Alan Wake Remastered game Sunday (I played the main game on XBox years ago but not the DLC). The Talk Show bit where Lake does the face is pretty funny.
I'm so ready for this DLC.
    Same here. I’ve not got as many games I’m looking forward to this year as last year. Just Alone in the Dark, Wolf Among Us season 2, and Star Wars Outlaws. Most of what I’ve been looking forward to this year are the DLCs for Spider-Man and Alan Wake, and I am desperately waiting for any news about the release of either.
        Gooooooooooood I really, really hope Wolf Among Us 2 actually releases this year. I need it so bad.
Wasn’t there a post earlier today saying it wouldn’t set up Control 2?
    It was taken a bit out of context. From what I understand, it won’t be the same level as it was with AWE, but will help connect the 2 more with some hints to the sequel, but may not lead directly to the sequel.
        We’ll likely learn why The Oldest House has gone dark, but I’m not expecting much more beyond that
            With it going dark again only a few years after The Hiss invasion (assuming these are unconnected events) I have to wonder why the hell anyone works at the FBC. 

The dude who turned down the department head position is the smartest guy in the franchise.
                I still think the Hiss invasion is still ongoing. The end of AWE hints that the Oldest House may be outside of time since they received Estevez’s request for help from 2023 though it was (or they thought it was) 2019.
                    I’m surprised isn’t more established amongst the community. I always see people wondering why it’s gone dark but I thought AWE was pretty clear there’s some time fuckery going on
                    I was hoping for a new threat/villain but it makes sense there’s some leftovers too. Maybe it can be a blend of threats in the game. Hiss and new threat.
                        I think we’ll see something like that. They’ve been hinting at a whole thing with Chester Blessed since Control, and he gets name dropped in an email from Barry to Alice in AW2. I would bet money that they come into play soon.
                            Not so sure they are as bad of an org as Control made it out to be when Barry’s joined them though.
                                Their whole thing is creating and dealing in altered items. Also, it’s Barry. He’s clueless. Lol
                                    Yeah but I just think there’s more to them than we think. Just like how FBC thought at first the Cult of the Tree might be more of a threat but turned out they were good.
                >I have to wonder why the hell anyone works at the FBC

Jesse wonders this herself in one of her inner-monologues during the game
                I’m pretty confident Alice is a parautilitarian, which is why she’s able to do things others can’t, but I think generally once you enter The Oldest House you don’t leave. And I’d guess most of the people who work there are either following in their parents footsteps, or ended up in The Oldest House at some point by happenstance and just weren’t allowed to leave.
                    >but I think generally once you enter The Oldest House you don’t leave

This makes no sense - they have field teams and the Rangers that leave The Oldest House all the time.
                        And, you know, Ahti
                    That's explicitly contradicted by the rubber duck altered item which was created when a researcher brought altered materials to his house. And the guy that complains he's gonna miss the new Alex Casey movie premier due to the lockdown.
                it seemed pretty clear to me that Control and AW 2 were concurrent
            Wait what? I missed that part

But if it’s final draft spoilers, don’t tell me
                There’s either an FBC report or Estevez says that The Oldest House “is still dark”, what exactly that means remains unclear
                At one point Estevez mentions that the oldest house went dark, basically saying that no backup was coming.
The title and the link are giving 2 different vibes.
    Yeah, it's quite selective quoting.
Oh is this the locked gate with the intercom near the parking lot?
    That's what I'm thinking too. Kept trying to get in there at different parts of the game. Gotta be setup for the DLC.
    Most definitely will be!
    Interesting...
    Isn’t that a shortcut you can open from the other side? Or am I thinking of something else
        Nope, that door never opens yet. You're probably thinking of a different door.
        No, you can find a locked gate with a sign saying it's to the Lake House.
Color me shocked.
    I am shocked!
Shocked!
Well, not that shocked.
I think that the dlc will have the FBC involved but it won’t necessarily be setting up the actual events of Control 2.
Pretty psyched for this.  It felt like they left a huge plot hook dangling with the >!research facility being overrun!<, so excited to see what they do with it.
I, for one, am very shocked by this reveal, who would have known?
This is info we've had for quite a long time, but it doesn't make me any less hyped!
Is there a first DLC I missed?
    Nothing released yet, but the first one will be called "Night Springs" and the second "The Lake House"
        Ok cool. Can't wait to play them
    nah, no dlc released yet
We might get a hint to what’s happening at the oldest house maybe? Maybe some more Dr darling videos? I’d be happy with that.
Man I thought I missed the first for a second lol
I have a sneaking suspicion that we're going to be playing as Estevez for the Lake House. I just don't see when Saga or Alan could do anything with it.
    That's interesting. It would make sense for the actress (Janina) they chose and how little she was utilized in the main game.
"The Lake House will have a big focus on The Lake House"
Wow. What a shock.
    Never guessed that /s
I think there are going to be sequel hints, but they are going to be so obscure and out of its actual context that I think a lot of us are not going to notice until we actually play control 2.
Kinda wish it would be Alan focused, like the Signal And Writer DLCs. Night Springs will have like 6 other characters being focused on, and this will probably set up Control. Oh well
Looking forward to this. 😀
Well, I sure hope they bring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock once again.
Honestly I expected some like that in the base game already. Good to see we‘ll at least have it in a DLC
I just love these games and the story building. I can’t wait for this.
Oh my! 100% Day 1 buy
Aren't we getting a different dlc first thou? I thought Lake House was the second dlc in the expansion pass
    "Alan wake's second expansion"
I forgot to play the control DLC's after I beat the game... I literally bought it ages ago and just... forgot.
Second expansion? Wait there’s already a first???
    No.
Thanks for putting the spoiler in the title. thanks bud
    I can't believe the Lake House dlc is set in the lake house.
        Stop the bullshit
    What spoilers? If you played Alan Wake 2 and bought a DLC called "the lake house" are you incredibly shocked when it turns out to be set in the lake house explicitly mentioned to be an FBC outpost in the game?
        How tf was u supposed to know that alarm building was “the Lakehouse” fuck outta here with that brotha
            "the lake house" is literally mentioned multiple times in the game as being an FBC outpost dude. You might just be an idiot.
                Na you just might be an idiot
            Dude did you just skip through all of Saga's dialogue with Estevez and ignore all the bits of lore sitting around that talk about the lake house?  Guess you can't be too careful in avoiding spoilers.
                Nope I 100% the game twice
                    And still somehow managed to miss every mention of the lake house as an FBC outpost.
                        I know that’s the fucking FBC outpost, I didn’t know the dlc lake house walk talking about that specific building. I might as well of been the witch’s hut idk.
                            Ah so you didn't know the lake house dlc was about the lake house - totally understandable.  OP should be ashamed for spoiling that the lake house dlc is about the lake house.
                                Yes let’s not post spoilers as titles
                            Your right it is much more reasonable to assume that the lakehouse dlc is located entirely inside the witches hut, and it is about playing strip poker with nightingale. 
                                *You’re
            There's a freaking locked gate at Cauldron Lake that literally says "FBC Lake House" on it. It's not a spoiler dude.
    Wait what spoiler?
        For anyone wanting to go into another of the expansions completely surprised, then the title kinda spoils it for those people.
            I wouldn't really consider them spoilers since the description for the dlcs were released by remedy since day 1 but fair enough I guess.
    No problem buddy😀
        I’m not your buddy, buddy
            Yes you are, buddy.
                No buddy
    You’re tripping. There are no spoilers. The Lake House is first mentioned like 1/4 way thought the game.
Do we have a release date for this yet?
    nope
        Awww
What’s the first expansion?
    Night Springs
Do we know how the dlc will work? Like do we have to be at a certain point in the story to activate them?
    No idea but the last game the DLCs followed up after the ending of aw1
        True but aw1 was linear
            Is aw2 open world or something?
                Kinda. One of the characters has limited free roam and can return to past areas. There are a few optional things in each area you can’t unlock right away. 
I need this!
My body couldn’t be more ready
I figured this would be the case.  With Control, the Alan Wake DLC was a transition nicely to AWII so makes sense that there is DLC here transitioning to Control II.
Oh this is going to be awesome. I was really itching to find out more about the FBC’s operation in night falls. Just completed the game a few days ago and it was interesting reading through the different FBC documents lying around
C O N T R O L   2   😀
Could you imagine a level you're running away from this unknown threat that's chucking shit left and right only to find out that it's Jesse?!?! Because you don't know who she is! Like a damn monster movie.
Ooooo we might get it sooon
What about Night Springs?
Love it. After beating Alan Wake 2..I went back to control and see the signs.lol shit crazy. And this will be my first time beating control
🤣I just read it rofl
Reminded me of monsters vs aliens with the red button.
“Alan found himself naked on a short film set. He was like, totally hung and had a six-pack.” - me, if I was writing myself in the dark place as Alan Wake.

                        *You’re
    There's a freaking locked gate at Cauldron Lake that literally says "FBC Lake House" on it. It's not a spoiler dude.
For anyone wanting to go into another of the expansions completely surprised, then the title kinda spoils it for those people.
    I wouldn't really consider them spoilers since the description for the dlcs were released by remedy since day 1 but fair enough I guess.
I’m not your buddy, buddy
    Yes you are, buddy.
        No buddy
Awww
True but aw1 was linear
    Is aw2 open world or something?
        Kinda. One of the characters has limited free roam and can return to past areas. There are a few optional things in each area you can’t unlock right away. 
Being totally hung?
    Well if you're adding it to the story at least. Some of us are just lucky
I just finished the full Alan Wake Remastered game Sunday (I played the main game on XBox years ago but not the DLC). The Talk Show bit where Lake does the face is pretty funny.
With it going dark again only a few years after The Hiss invasion (assuming these are unconnected events) I have to wonder why the hell anyone works at the FBC. 

The dude who turned down the department head position is the smartest guy in the franchise.
    I still think the Hiss invasion is still ongoing. The end of AWE hints that the Oldest House may be outside of time since they received Estevez’s request for help from 2023 though it was (or they thought it was) 2019.
        I’m surprised isn’t more established amongst the community. I always see people wondering why it’s gone dark but I thought AWE was pretty clear there’s some time fuckery going on
        I was hoping for a new threat/villain but it makes sense there’s some leftovers too. Maybe it can be a blend of threats in the game. Hiss and new threat.
            I think we’ll see something like that. They’ve been hinting at a whole thing with Chester Blessed since Control, and he gets name dropped in an email from Barry to Alice in AW2. I would bet money that they come into play soon.
                Not so sure they are as bad of an org as Control made it out to be when Barry’s joined them though.
                    Their whole thing is creating and dealing in altered items. Also, it’s Barry. He’s clueless. Lol
                        Yeah but I just think there’s more to them than we think. Just like how FBC thought at first the Cult of the Tree might be more of a threat but turned out they were good.
    >I have to wonder why the hell anyone works at the FBC

Jesse wonders this herself in one of her inner-monologues during the game
    I’m pretty confident Alice is a parautilitarian, which is why she’s able to do things others can’t, but I think generally once you enter The Oldest House you don’t leave. And I’d guess most of the people who work there are either following in their parents footsteps, or ended up in The Oldest House at some point by happenstance and just weren’t allowed to leave.
        >but I think generally once you enter The Oldest House you don’t leave

This makes no sense - they have field teams and the Rangers that leave The Oldest House all the time.
            And, you know, Ahti
        That's explicitly contradicted by the rubber duck altered item which was created when a researcher brought altered materials to his house. And the guy that complains he's gonna miss the new Alex Casey movie premier due to the lockdown.
    it seemed pretty clear to me that Control and AW 2 were concurrent
Wait what? I missed that part

But if it’s final draft spoilers, don’t tell me
    There’s either an FBC report or Estevez says that The Oldest House “is still dark”, what exactly that means remains unclear
    At one point Estevez mentions that the oldest house went dark, basically saying that no backup was coming.
"the lake house" is literally mentioned multiple times in the game as being an FBC outpost dude. You might just be an idiot.
    Na you just might be an idiot
Dude did you just skip through all of Saga's dialogue with Estevez and ignore all the bits of lore sitting around that talk about the lake house?  Guess you can't be too careful in avoiding spoilers.
    Nope I 100% the game twice
        And still somehow managed to miss every mention of the lake house as an FBC outpost.
            I know that’s the fucking FBC outpost, I didn’t know the dlc lake house walk talking about that specific building. I might as well of been the witch’s hut idk.
                Ah so you didn't know the lake house dlc was about the lake house - totally understandable.  OP should be ashamed for spoiling that the lake house dlc is about the lake house.
