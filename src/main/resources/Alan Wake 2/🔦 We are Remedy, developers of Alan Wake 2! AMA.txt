Is Barry coming back!?
    Barry! Where's Barry?
        Stop! Don't open that door!
        He's our old partner, yanno
        I'd love to see an interaction between Barry and Ahti.
            Barry: ‘Ok Al, who the hell is this guy? he just keeps showing up out of nowhere and-‘
Alan:Barry Barry, calm down, he’s uhh, a friend.
Ahti: Right you are Tom, Never burn bridges, cause who knows when you’ll need to cross again.
        Well, i'm sorry but he's probably....
        it was me Barry!
    This needs answering above all others for real. The world needs to know.
    We want Barry! We want him fat! We want him wearing red! and we want him covered in Christmas lights!
        Well tbh seems he's gonna be skinny, which imo is goof. If he's skinny that means they can use his original actor still instead of needing to recast to account for live action scenes (which is why others like Nightingale, Mulligan and Thornton were recast)
            Well, I wouldn't want him to be recast. But Alan's voice and live action are different actors, so maybe they would do the same thing for Barry? I remember he said he lost weight, but that was also in the email where he was talking about being in the cult thing, so idk how honest he was being with either Alice or himself.
                Yea they do it with Alan and Casey but that's a whole hassle and not the easiest. Having to hire two separate actors to play one character and then having their movements and lip-syncing all match isn't that easy, they do it for Alan cause he's the main character, and it works for Casey cause Sam Lake is already working on the game and James McCaffrey was his friend, but for others it's more difficult. I like to believe Barry was telling the truth, he did lose weight and he genuinely doesn't realize it's an actual cult. As long as we keep Fred Berman I'm happy
            I am getting the feeling that him losing weight is part of him potentially being indoctrinated by blessed and setting him up for either needing saving or some dramatic tension, I’m HERE for that. Barry saved us, let’s go save him back <3 bestfriend hours
    THIS! The people have spoken! 🙌
    Im sure hell be back. Is baited on the deerfests, by pat maine. If u stay there for a bit he talks about barry. Also we still need to see the meaning of the christmas lights, the return of the savior. Its on the quantum break board.
        Recently played Quantum Break for the first time directly after finishing Alan Wake 2. I took so many screenshots and studied the hell out of that board and still im noticing new things when I go back to it
    THIS MUST BE ANSWERED
    We need Barry !
    This!!
    Exactly ! Where is Barry ? 🥹
    Barry will come back as part of a paracriminal organization
        It was so satisfying to read Barry's emails to Alice after having just played Control and read every collectible so I could see the name Blessed and go, "Oh no"
        I think you're right, considering the emails. This will either be really funny or really sad or both.
    I remember that in American Nightmare we learn that Barry is in charge of producing the new Old Gods songs and he's the one adding the synths that we hear in the tracks, we learn that from a radio show where he and the Old Gods are interviewed (although it may all just be part of his dream at the motel, so canon status is unknown). I actually wished for Barry to get credited in the booklet of the CD of Rebirth - Greatest Hits that I got, the same way the message from the Old Gods was "in universe" and talking of what happened inside the lore of the games (finding old tapes from the 70s, etc). But nope, no mention of Barry. Well, American Nightmare might be too obscure. But we do know that he became the manager of the Old Gods and the tour manager during their (apparently cancelled) comeback/"goodbye" tour (confirmed in Alan Wake 2).
How will James McCaffrey passing (R.I.P) affect future DLC for Alan Wake 2 & the Max Payne remake?
    Seconding this. With all the excitement around AW2 in December, getting that news was such a shock 😢
        I legit was playing the game for a second run and had just met Casey for the first time as Alan when I got the news. Being a long time fan of Max Payne I was devastated, had to quit the game for a while.
            I was replaying control the day he passed. Looked up the subreddit for a guide cuz I git stuck on a part and saw the news
                He did trench’s voice too right?
                    Yes plus he was The Bright Presence (Thomas Zane/The Diver) in AW1
    I'm sad this wasn't replied to 😭
    Exactly what I wanted to ask
    I’m assuming they’ll just reuse his audio from the first two games and maybe use some AI shit to make it better quality. I doubt it’ll affect the remakes too much. But it’s terribly sad.
        I would be disappointed beyond words if Remedy of all companies uses AI. They're better than that.
            Might get downvoted for this but I'm genuinely interested why?
                Because Remedy have been all about the art for 30ish years. I'd hope if they wanted to bring the character back, they'd recast rather than engage the Plagiarism Engine.
Are there plans for the classic outfit from AW1 to be added to AW2?
    Would absolutely love the Kalevala Knights jacket from towards the end of the game as a permanent unlock
        I would love more cosmetic options for sure
    And the American Nightmare one too!!
    I don't have many complaints about the game.  One of them is the lack of customization.  If there's a menu, I'd hope to see more than one option lol
        This
    YESSS PLEASE DO THIS
    PLEASE
    This is one of my biggest wants for the game. If you’re not planning on adding the skin, then please consider it.
    I know people are nostalgic for it but that outfit had to go. He had like 4 layers on. No wonder he couldn't run.
        Alan spends most of his time at the bottom of a lake, that's gotta be hella cold

And it's not like he runs much faster in AW2, at most it's just a light jog
Is there anything interesting that got cut from AW2?

Also, please add the AW1 costume to the game!
    hoenstly this, I always wondered where Alan's OG Jacket went. I assume its pretty cold in the Dark Place considering its a lake and all.
        It’s not a lake, it’s an ocean.
            He set em up, and you knocked em down
            A lake that's not a lake
    Absolutely. Was so disappointed to see it gone and Alan wearing some suit.
Thank you so much for giving me such a great game to chew on, absolutely worth the weight.  Out of curiousity, who designed Saga's sweater?  And is there any special meanings in it?
    **JOHN**: For Saga's Sweater, I worked along side the directors to create the initial concept which had the sweaters overall look with her outfits, colour and feel. Then Minttu Wikberg from Pawlymade collaborated to create the knit design along side the directors and myself. The deer is Saga’s spirit animal we wanted that to be part of her sweater. It's also a major theme for her in the Mind Place, for Alan it is the owl. We also took inspiration from the Nordics with the trees and wildlife flowing and wrapping around the sweater. You can noticed the sprunce trees which create a wrapping depth/perspective in the sweater design. It also creates a link to Saga's family and Sweden.[ I will also be at GDC doing a deep dive into the sweater](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-art-of-characters-in-alan-wake-2-character-outfit-creation-process/900049) ;)
    dang inability to correctly parse homophones.  WAIT.  I am so sorry.
        Nah… some of those plot elements *are* pretty heavy, so I’d argue it’s a perfect choice of words :)
Is Thornton's sandwich really that shitty? Also, whose idea was it to make the creepy laughing coffee pot?
    I love how you added a trophy for shooting that creepy coffee cutout, as pretty much everyone was going to.
        Me, without the achievement because I verify my target before shooting.
            It was the last one I needed and actually had to look it up because I don’t waste ammo in a survival horror game.
        That was my last achievement.... I had to actively try to figure out what I missed...
        I didn't think about doing that now I gotta go back to coffee world thanks for the unintentional heads up.
        That is the only trophy I missed in the game lol. I was hoarding bullets like my life depended on it. I did scream at that moment though.
        First time I saw it I said to myself “there is going to be a trophy if I shoot this.”  Then I did and DING.
    **MARKO**: Yeah it is! That very sandwich happens to be one of those premade gas station delicacies that are inherently rather bad or even shitty some may say.

**NATHALIE**: You can thank fellow mission designer Admir Burnić for any discomfort caused by the creepy laughing coffee pot. As soon as he saw Mr. Drippy and his creepy smile, he got the idea to make it say something to the player as they'd approach. He notes his inspiration was the Holle Bolle Gijs character in the Efteling, a Dutch amusement park. He felt it would fit the atmosphere of the park, and I think he was right on the money! The final result is an interplay of multiple crafts coming together, and creating something memorable!
    Lol I can't with that one. A coffee-themed amusement park is probably the most Finnish invention ever.
    We started using this whenever things go wrong “shitty pastrami sandwich “ 😂
Not a question just a big big thank you for giving us such an enjoyable game. Was a long time since i was so excited for a sequel like this. You guys did a top notch job 💯
    I don’t have a question either (the ones asked thus far surpass anything I could come up with!) but I’ll latch on to this comment to say: I didn’t play AW1 prior. I enjoyed Control and that intro to the universe but had zero expectations for this other than, “hey AW2 looks like it’s getting good reviews and I like survival horror.” 

It’s since become one of my favorite games of all time (and I go back to the Atari/NES/etc. era.) The style, story, actual horror elements, clever interplay (and technology) linking live action to gameplay, seamless transition to the mind place(s), etc etc etc. Just an absolutely wonderful job. And of course We Sing! was a complete home run.

I can’t think of a game I’ve tried spreading word about more than this, or a game soundtrack that has latched on to my brain to this extent. Congratulations on this excellent work of art.
Is there any chance that in the future we will see one long documentary about Remedy and your projects.  
I've seen all the short episodes about the development of Alan Wake 2, but I wonder if something like that is possible (Rising Kratos, Grounded, etc.)?
    In the short term, unfortunately no. We have been approached by several groups wanting to make either an Alan Wake 2 documentary or one about Remedy, we’ve just ended up saying no. 

The reasons are rather mundane. We simply don’t have enough people to look after a production like this, and then there are always some fears about how a documentary would make us look. 

Do we want to show off the very normal chaos that is making games at Remedy? (lol) Is it actually a good use of our very limited time? So it just ends up that we think about it a lot, want to do a documentary and then end up saying no for the aforementioned reasons.
    would love to see this, tho they did release a small doc of 7 minutes behind the scene a few days ago
    I would absolutely die of happiness if they were able to make something like Double Fine's "Psych Odyssey"
        Psychodyssey was so good, it was really interesting to see the good and bad of developing a game. I'd love to see Remedy do something like that.
    I've said this ad nauseum as well.

Those documentaries really shed light on game development, how the industry admires the games that are put forth, the pressure of making a AAA game that can make or break a studio, seeing the devs/directors/actors in their groove fine tuning details that no one will notice, etc.
    I could see them being like : “yes but it will be through a 40 minute long interpretative dance and gong bath”
    wow i would looove this!
Show me the champion of light?
    Will they show us the herald of darkness?
        Is Remedy lost in a never ending night?
            I think they're diving deep to the surface.
                🎶And all your stories of crime and chilling thrillers
of hardboiled killers became bestsellers🎶
                    Does the award go to... Alan Wake?
                        Yes, but it was all too much, he had to get away.
            Are they diving deep to the surface?
                Did their mamas give them a magic clicker?
        Are you lost in a neverending niiiiiight?
            Nah, I'm just taking a dive intk the surface!
How could you do this to us? How could you just up the standard of gaming byt *this much* and then leave? You've ruined us. In the best possible way.

Seriously though, no question, just a heartfelt thanks for one of the best sequels and one of the best games ever made. I've been a fan of Alan Wake since release and you guys' work in general since I was a kid with Max Payne. Your work is unparallelled and I hope you keep it up for many years to come.

RIP my spotify algorhytim too, it's just *all* Old Gods of Asgard since last October.
    Thank you so much. That honestly means such a lot to the team. Alan Wake 2 was such a labour of love, and it's been truly humbling and just incredible to see how well it's been received. <3
How big are the chances of Jesse Faden and Alan meeting each other?
    Well I think that FBC have some plans for Alan...
        I could only imagine what they would do to him.
            Yeah...look at what happened to Hartman.
                That was also because the hiss to I think. Hopefully by time AW2 happens I hope Jessie cleared out the hiss so they are at least contained somewhere or just completely eradicated. So hopefully estevez in Wake aren't in for a wild surprise that they can't enter the building with it on lockdown.
    Have you played CONTROL's AWE DLC?
        I did, I meant interacting with each other face to face, in the awe dlc she doesnt physically interacts with him
    Also, can we have the meeting present in both their games? Like in the DLC Alan meets Jesse and they talk or whatever, and in Control 2 as Jesse while we play we have to meet Alan and then we connect the dots on things we missed as Alan.
When designing the Dark Presence chase sequences, what design language did you all think was important to help push the player in the correct direction?
    **NATHALIE**: The Dark Presence chase sequences usually build on level knowledge that we've given players earlier in a mission. For example, in Initiation 2 the chase was designed in such a way that the player would end up in front of a Break Room, knowing they'd be safe there. This gives the player a clear goal and plan of escape. Furthermore, at the start of a chase, we try to clearly frame where the player should run to, and which areas are unavailable. You could use multiple avenues for this, from a collapsed roof and environmental destruction in Initiation 5 and Return 8, to a blocked path in Initiation 2. The use of destruction was a wonderful tool. It helped sell the power of the Dark Presence thematically, while allowing designers a creative avenue to herd the player.

One thing that was crucial in these Chase sequences was giving the player the feeling that they could only barely outrun the Dark Presence. Its speed was always adjusted to be slower when players were impacted by environmental changes (such as blocked paths) to give them more time to form new strategies, and afterward the speed would be ramped up again. This process of the player readjusting and finding a new way through would go faster if the player had all necessary visual cues in view at the start of the chase (Initiation 2), and slower when these traversal clues appeared mid-chase (such as in Initiation 5 when the Dark Presence appeared in front of the player). 

There were also important audio components to this. During the chase sequences, we wanted to maintain forward momentum and not have the player turn around to check if the Dark Presence was still following. So having this insistent, dreadful sound bombarding the player's senses was crucial to selling the experience. This was another reason to adjust the speed and maintain a tight distance when we knew the player could probably handle it.

As for the layout, most chase locations could be set up in a quite linear way. Initiation 2 was framed around the corridor-like subway car, Initiation 5 benefited greatly from the hotel layout which was made up of multiple corridors, and Return 8 was set in the Wellness Center, a place that players knew from Return 5 and which was adjusted through environmental changes to become more linear. Speaking of linearity, the initial design for the Dark Presence chases actually started out less linear. However, user testing showed that players had trouble navigating these, so in every iteration they were made to be more focused and scripted. It turns out that having more available routes wasn't more interesting or engaging, they instead led to more confusion.

I've been fortunate to work on a few iterations on the Dark Presence chase in Return 8 but not the others, so my thanks to fellow mission designers Dimitri Giacoletto and Admir Burnić for sharing some of their experiences with me!
    this is a fun question!
With regards to previous versions of Alan Wake 2, were there any concepts or ideas cut from the final product that you would've liked to keep?
Hii, my question was mostly around Saga, what took the creative decision to turn her into one of the two protagonists? I absolutely love saga I just am curious how early on she was in the planning process?
    it was already planned at least as early as the short film they did in quantum break
        Elaborate? I played QB but don’t recall this, thx
            there's A LOT of element in this short film from 7 years ago that is in the game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDNGoVKfDw
                How IN THE HELL am I only seeing this now? Thanks for this dude!
                    Because it plays at the start of the game as you’re making your way through the walking sim section at the entrance to the campus. 

It’s on a TV in game and you have to be close to hear it. My first playthrough I caught by complete accident cause I heard the “it’s not a lake, it’s an ocean” comment and got caught off guard. 
    In the original Alan Wake, it was planned to have you play half the game as an FBI agent (most likely nightingale).
I think they just got around to using that idea now.
What was the process like when designing the gameplay section of We Sing? I'm sure it must have taken forever to end up as perfectly paced as it is. P.S. thanks for all your hard work!! massive fan <3
    **MARKO**: Getting the combat work in We Sing took a lot of time. We knew that we wanted to introduce Alan's iconic Flare Gun to players at this stage, it was a conscious choice further feeding into the power fantasy moment, it was important to give player a breather from the survival horror loop and allow them to just enjoy the ride and blast away.
        It definitely worked! The moment you pick up the flare gun in the middle of all the awesome chaos it's like yeahhh baby flare gun time come on Alan this is your time to shine. SO MUCH FUN!! Thanks for answering <3
        This was one of the greatest levels/sequences in video game history imo. Kudos to the team, AW2 is now one of my all time favorite games
    That sequence literally dropped my jaw. It was so fun, engaging, and interesting. Loved it so much.
    I hope this gets answered as I’m also super interested! There’s some info about their process in this video https://youtu.be/0F2Vf8P6bXM?si=Gzx9nLaS-VijSVpe
What was the most fun part of the game to do?
Thank you all for helping create such an amazing game! Got questions for all three of you!

* Nathalie: What is your favourite mission?
* Marko: What is your favourite gameplay mechanic?
* John: Who is your favourite character to work on?

Thanks!
    **JOHN**: Definitely Saga I enjoyed designing her outfit and modelling her entire character.

**MARKO**: Plot Board. Giving players access to Alan's most powerful ability: developing and rewriting stories that will alter the very reality. 

**NATHALIE**: The Cauldron Lake missions hold a special place in my heart (notably Return 2: The Heart), having mostly worked in that hub throughout my time on the project. I did also really enjoy Return 5: Old Gods for its characters, mission pacing, and story reveals. Though I have to say Initiation 4: We Sing takes the cake. It's such a triumph of bold, creative decision-making, and a testament to what Remedy as a studio stands for. It's incredible that resources were allocated to developing a musical level that so many people worldwide can connect to. I know of many colleagues who similarly haven't worked on it that spent hours watching streamers playing it, and cheering the players and developers involved in making it on.
        Thanks for replying! I really enjoyed Saga as a character, and loved learning about how the sweater came to be in another reply. The Plot Board was fun and now I want my office to look like that... Best I can do is use scrivener I guess. We Sing was so unexpected and a ton of fun, and I can't wait to play through it very soon in my latest replay! Thanks again for your work on the game and hope to see the DLCs soon!
        The Heart was one of the most memorable missions I've played in video games ever, tied with We Sing. Thanks for helping make them!
Hi John, what was the thought process on making Alan the hottest man I’ve ever seen in my life? Did you want me to question things about myself?
    **JOHN**: Ilkka Villi is the most handsome man in Finland, with such a strong foundation he made my job easy :D And to be honest, he's got amazing hair. And he can grow a fantastic, luscious beard. That combination of beard and hair? Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
Hey guys!

Curious about the process of cooperating with the narrative team in deciding the direction of gameplay/mission design. There's such a great fusion in AW2 and I would love to hear what some of the communication behind the scenes looked like, and the places where you guys really landed your mark in the game!
    **NATHALIE**: Throughout development we've had frequent check-ins between narrative and mission design to ensure we were working along a shared vision. The writing/narrative department would provide an outline highlighting the key story/character beats we'd need to hit. Mission designers would pitch a proposal to weave these into a mission, and iterations would be made on either side if needed. This process would go back-and-forth until we were all happy with the direction. Both departments truly wanted to make this whole experience shine and were flexible in making it work, so while design challenges could be tricky, there was confidence and trust in knowing we'd tackle them together. 

I think one of my favorite moments where gameplay and narrative came together was in Return 9: Come Home's Mind Place sequence.

If you have a chance to check it out, our lead mission designer on the project, Anne-Marie Grönroos, will give an in-depth talk on [developing Alan Wake 2's mission structures at GDC 2024](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-the-player-vs-dream-logic-developing-the-mission-structures-for-alan-wake-2/902362).
        Thank you so much for the response! I'll be checking that talk out!
So I was hoping you guys might be able to clear something up. Why does Alan and Alice's apartment look vastly different in Alan Wake 2 to Alan Wake 1? Is it just the Dark Place expanding and skewering it up or is there another reason? 🤔
    Every time you reach the Parliament Tower, the apartment is different in AW2 iirc. Dream logic and all...
    I think it must just be being changed by the dark place. Every time you visit, the vague layout is the same but the location of the lift and the locked spiral door are different in all 3 versions. If I had to guess why, I'd say that it's probably because the apartment we see isn't actually based off the real apartment, just Alan's memory of it. He hasn't been there in 13 years, and the dark place has caused him drastic memory problems, which is why the apartment seems slightly off and the layout keeps changing. If you think of a place you frequently visited 10 years ago, you'll probably get some details right but it won't be an exact replication
    I’m no dev but I would guess it’s technical advancement and gameplay driven
        Doesn’t the apartment change in different points of the game?
        But the apartment in AW1 was much more visually appealing. A graphically updated version of that would have been far better looking, so the technical argument wouldn't really make sense.
        this
    Because is not the same apartment, it is a manifestation of that in the dark place.
        Turns out that rent is much cheaper in The Dark Place than the real NYC. Rates aren't what they were 13 years ago. /s
    I thought it was her new place, after Alan disappeared
        When Alan walks in, he sees the spiral door and says "this was where I wrote my books"
    Please, let's not insist on canon explanations for meta shit that doesn't need it.  This is how we got Thomas Zane calling Darling "swole" and mentioning his voice similarity multiple times.   It's cringe, it's immersion breaking, it's unnecessary.   IMHO.
Is there any chance of having an in-universe Alex Casey novel/short story written and published? Preferably not one that takes over the world.
    Speak for yourself man, I'm ready to join the Cult of the Word
Hi guys! Is there any chance for you to recover the rights to Quantum Break? 

Also, please! Let us play with Alan's outfits from the original and American Nightmare
Why did Saga do on autopsy on Nightingale with no gloves on? 🤔
    **JOHN**: She's so well trained she doesn't need them... but we wanted to do that but for scope reasons we didn't.
    THIS
        EXCACTLY !
Hello Remedy team!! Big fan of Alan Wake and the franchise of all your games, 10/10 on Alan Wake 2 BTW.

My question I have for Alan Wake 2 is what was the creative decision to make it “semi-open world” instead of continuing with a linear path like the first game and American Nightmare? 

Also and if you cannot answer this no worries… Night Springs DLC when? 😉
Are there any talks happening about Alan Wake 3?
    we dont even know about dlc, i doubt we know anything about AW3, they are working on control 2 and multiplayer and new ip before
        Oh yeah forsure im not expecting any kind of details I just wanna know if its even on their radar or part of their future plans
        And Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes!

Remedy are BUSY
            Max Wake 4: Take Control
        What do you mean we don’t know about DLC? Remedy already confirmed 2 and even named them already.
    This is an AMA with gameplay lead, mission designer, and character artist, I doubt any of them would be allowed to say anything about about this no matter the answer lol.
What was the inspiration behind Alan’s new main outfit? Also, will we ever see Barry again?
    **JOHN**: For Alan: We wanted to make him cool, but also we wanted to bring in "bookish" aspects to show that he is not an action hero. A "college professor" reference. Because of the 3rd person view, we wanted something that is visible in the camera. We explored something in the back, but it all felt forced. Elbow patches felt like a perfect, unique idea, part of his uniform.
Any chance of more merch? There’s that “chapter” screen that shows the different parts of Herald of Darkness that’d make a good tee.
 
Or Coffee World merch. Or Tor’s battlevest patches on a tee… or Ilmo and Jakko on a tee.

Oh, also, I’m dying to get my hands on that Oh Deer thermos, so please keep restocking those in the merch shop 😅
    I would love merch. What about movie posters? A Tom the Poet poster would be cool.
        Yöton yö and ahti & the janitors merch would be cool too 😁
Hello!!! For the three of you: What were the biggest challenges you faced in each of your areas while working on the game? And how does it feel to see it all coming together in the end?

&#x200B;

Thank you so much <333
    **JOHN**: One of the biggest challenges during the production was handling how manage the production remotely with actors during the pandemic. We had to develop new tech and production strategies to navigate around the remote setup. Seeing the game come together has been an awesome experience and seeing the fans really dig into the meta.

**MARKO**: To have the team to change their mindset from action to survival horror gameplay. Cinematic fast-paced action is deeply rooted in the Remedy DNA and to bring and adapt this know-how into survival horror was a huge undertaking. The previous title I shipped was an action RPG, so it took some time for me to re-orientate myself towards the core game pillars of Alan Wake 2 but being an survival horror game enthusiast definitely helped with the transition. The feeling of seeing it all click into place is simply fantastic - a feeling that never gets old and something not to be taken for granted.

**NATHALIE**: This project came with many exciting challenges! There is so much depth to Alan Wake's narrative and themes, and desperately wanting to do those justice when working on the mission design (for example, Overlaps and dream logic). When pitching any kind of mission design, feelings or intentions can be difficult to put into words, and what one person understands to be "tense" or "hopeful" could mean something else to another. Working on a shared terminology when designing a mission and the player's journey was a challenge, but one we got better and better at. Playable sections and reference material can help establish this terminology.

Another one is horror design, which can be tricky to plan for. There is a high-level, theoretical part to it, where we try to manage the player's intended tension levels throughout the various mission beats. However, it's different having those playable in a rough state and deciding whether they actually worked out, especially when so much of selling horror is through audio and lighting which usually come in slightly later in the development process. Having enough time to iterate and adjust is crucial here, so you can finetune these beats until it feels right."
I have a question that's been driving me crazy. There are currently three doors in the game that are locked and can not be opened, one in the Oh Deer Diner (not the room with Rose's diary) and two in the dark place (one on the corner of the plaza, and one under the train tracks on the same level). Are these doors something for a DLC, am I missing something, or is it just there for no reason? 😅
Hi, thank you for doing this! Will we get more Koskela Brothers commercials (please)?
Hi Remedy! As a huge fan of the game (and world-record-holding speedrunner) I just have one question I've been dying to ask: why does Saga have to drive to the lake for the summoning instead of getting a ride in the helicopter?? Love your work! Thanks!
    or hitching a ride with her relatives as they literally drive past her lol
    I enjoyed that solo journey to the lake. Chopper overhead, truck rampaging down the woods and then all the gear set up as I approached.

I guess it wouldn’t have had quite the same impact for me personally if I arrived to an empty lake and the scene cut to everything in place.
        I'm just saying they could have at least offered her a ride!
    I thought about that too lmao
    I feel like it really echoed AW1 with the whole "meet me there" sequence to the power plant and then the dam - at least the helicopter didn't crash this time
For the launch of Alan Wake 1, there were a lot of physical and extra content (Bright Falls tv show, Alan Wake Files, Novelization, etc.). Is there any plans to make similar types of media that correspond with AW2?
    Exactly. I really miss those things.
Hey team thanks for the experience of Alan Wake and all your other games! My question is how fun was it to add the Finnish references throughout the game and in the Koskela brother commercials and how do you feel about the positive reception of those references?
    **MARKO** (as the Finnish spokesperson of this AMA): Coming from such a miniscule country as Finland and getting positive recognition always makes me smile a bit. But just a bit, never too much. The game draws from Finnish culture and folklore with confidence, our habits and customs that some may consider quirky and exotic is just business as usual to us. Going all in regarding our cultural identity and seamlessly having it as an integral part of the experience has been met with such a positive response out in the world. Koskela adds being oftentimes highlighted as a comedic relif in the midst of all horror. Bringing out such specialities like the concept of "kalsarikänni" in one of the adds is rather humorous but also a bit sad if you ask from anybody else than a Finn.

Koskela adds are absolutely my favorite ones. However as humorous as they are, the "Return" review hits pretty hard - Finnish melancholy at its finest.
        Thanks for the response! You are so right about the Koskela ads hilarious and one of the more serious moments, they add so much to the game through their limited inclusion.
    I wanted to add, while I don't know much about Finnish culture, I loved the decision to instill so much Finnishness into the game because of how it helps Alan Wake II stand out among other games. Can you talk about the decision to give Alan Wake II such strong Finnish vibes? Of course, I know Remedy is based in Finland, but I am nevertheless curious because it feels like such a deliberate decision.
Hello you beautiful people!! What was it like picking Saga’s overall look, specifically her hairstyle? I’ve seen a few iterations of different hair in some of the behind the scenes videos, and I absolutely love the final result. It looks incredible in game, and you guys have seemed to casually break the “uncanny black character” curse that is so prevalent in gaming.  Saga is just such a really really really well done character model, her hair style and the physics of it are some of my faves in gaming. Even down to her outfit— she just feels like a cousin of mine haha 

Her, Jesse, Alan— these past few games your hair physics and texturing have been so on point lol. The refraction of the strands in say, jesse’s red hair or even alan’s beard, you can really see the hard work up close. My fave alan scenes are the ones in the phone booth, holy hell does the hair detail look good in that lighting
    **JOHN**: For her hair we spent a lot of time working on different styles that would fit her character and feel grounded for the impression on screen but also for her role. I also worked with hair stylists to style Melanie's hair, we used a hair double to test out styles to see how the hair reacts and how the hair flows and moves. We wanted to create a style that had some secondary movement on screen so as you play as Saga the hair would have some movement creating some interesting gameplay visuals. When creating the in game hair, we spent a lot of time iterating on the hair strands themselves to get them as close to Melanie's hair as possible and then the styling process to manipulate those strands into the hair style you see.
        SUPER appreciated this! I kept marveling about her hair to anyone who would listen lol
    White male here and I ❤️ Saga so so much as a playable character, just stunningly beautiful, loved Melanie Liburd’s voice work, love those sweaters, love her mysterious backstory and lineage. A Jesse / Saga teamup someday would be so incredibly lit. 🔥
What was the toughest part of working in Alan Wake 2?
Have we seen the last of Barry and his Flaming Eye of Mordor? Thanks for all you've done for us!
    I hope Alan gets to use his third eye like a new Flaming Eye of Mordor.
Who even is Tom Zane?
    A poet. or uhhh a filmmaker i think. one of the two
    What is Tom Zane?
        When is Tom Zane?
            Why is Tom Zane?
                How is Tom Zane?
One of my absolute favorite things in the game is the unconventional way space works in The Dark Place—where doors can take you from one side of a building to the other or from a rooftop to ground level in ways that contradict Euclidean geometry. What challenges were there, technically and design-wise, in creating these levels? And how fun was it? A genius concept
Not a question but i just want to say THANK YOU. The Alan Wake franchise became one of my fav games of all time. You guys are so talented and I just wish you the best for the future: )
Can we please learn more about the Alan Wake 2 concept from 2011? I need to know more about it please!!!!

Hello, team! I wanna start by saying thanks for all your hard work and dedication! You and the crew put a lot of love into this game and it shows. I got a question for all of you:

Q: what is your favorite blend of coffee? How much cream and sugar do you use, if any?
    **JOHN**: I'm a Starbucks Macchiato kinda guy. It might not be the greatest but I love it.. Also still miss Tim Hortons (facepalm)

**MARKO**: Italian Roast. Only low-fat milk (yes, one cannot enjoy life too much) when doing dairy-topped drinks. No sugar, life itself is sweet enough.

**NATHALIE**: I usually opt for light roast coffee, no sugar or milk (though I enjoy the signature dark roast "Bright Falls Blend" too!) or a cappuccino. In the weekends I like to treat myself. A large seasonally-flavored latte with all the extras. "How much sugar?" Yes. "How much whipped cream?" Also yes.
What is the ”Remedy Pipeline” what softwares do you use for your work and do you follow a strict guideline in what is used?
How did the development of Alan Wake 2 start out? Was most of the direction already written and thought out or were many gameplay and or writing aspects improvised on the go? 

Big fan of the game, thank you for the amazing experience.
Have you felt and noticed that the number of fans of Alan Wake and RCU have grown after the release? Is this good for future Remedy projects?
thomas zane was deliberately a thirst trap right?
    Ilkka is a handsome man. Looks better with the beard though.
        i wasnt complaining and yes
Will you make a Mocha The Moose plush? He's so cute 🫎
I want to thank you guys so much for what you’ve created. You should be super proud of your work - all of you. My question will have to be - who is YOUR favourite side-character from the AW universe? Thanks to your storytelling, there are so many memorable ones to choose from! 

Mine would have to be Cynthia Weaver. The lady of the light herself
    **JOHN**: I love Barry...

**MARKO**: Absolutely Cynthia. A truly tragical character arc. Forcing Saga to confront her just sealed the deal for me. To me she'll always be The Lady of the Light.

**NATHALIE**: I think it has to be Rose. Because she's bright and positive and a little bit unhinged (in the most relatable way). I think we would be friends and discuss fanfiction all day, every day.
        Great choices all round 😁
any idea when expansions coming out?
    I think end of spring then in October
Are there any updates on the missing notes from Saga’s case board?
Is Alan Wake 2 the end of a story. Or are there plans to continue the story and the RCU with more Alan Wake titles? Many game series are at their best in their 3-5 versions.
Hi Remedy!! Huge fan since original Alan Wake and a fellow Finn as well! Thank you for all your amazing games ❤️

My question is, was it a conscious choice for Saga to have "shadow horns" in the Mind Place, when she's profiling? Casting from the deer head behind her on the wall. Hope you know what I mean!
Hello Remedy! Other than Twin Peaks, were there any other movies or tv shows you took inspiration from when making AW2?

PS: looking forward to the dlc!
    I'm not from Remedy (sadly, lol), but they've said they were also inspired by True Detective season 1.
What was the inspiration behind the Cult of the Tree and the Cult of the Word?
* Nathalie - which locations did you really enjoy designing missions around the most?

* Marko - which ideas for Alan Wake 2 were completely tossed out, with no hopes to have them brought in? Like, that just didn't fit the game / what you guys wanted, and decided not to take that direction.

* John - What was your inspirations for some of the side characters in Bright-falls, like the two people talking about their float? Or for the two civilians in the beginning that saga interrogates?
    **NATHALIE**: I've enjoyed locations that were character-driven, or had good opportunities for horror sequences. Cauldron Lake and its Overlap fortunately provided plenty of that!

**MARKO**: Originally in the paper design phase the Flashlight had a concept of Components and Mods, essentially the building blocks forming the Flashlight. Player was able to tailor the Flashlight's properties to complement their playstyle, even drastically change its behavior - both in combat and in exploration. As tempting as this concept was in terms of an gameplay ingredient, we simply could not see our characters finding these components and believably tinkering modifying the Flashlight. It just did not make any sense narratively and the idea was scrapped. Furthermore as the overall combat choreography evolved, it became apparent that there was no room to modify the Flashlight with such granularity - it would have pulled players away from the experience, rather than adding anything substantial to it.

**JOHN**: Visually Definitely Fargo was a big inspiration try to create quirky characters.
        If I can have some Follow up questions answered?

* Nathalie - What was the hardest part of making Alan's Initiation part in the Oceanview? 

 * Additionally; Which part of the game, when being made where you unsure of, but when completed really reinforced "this was a good idea!"?

* Marko: Thanks! It's cool to know there might have been a mechanic - but I agree that it probably would've taken from the game. I have a new question now:

 * When was the decision to make the save locations, a physical thermos in a safe zone? Additionally; When the game was being play-tested, what were some of the funniest game-breaking bugs you heard of / saw?

* John: What about Agent Nightingale? Secondly, which character do you think had the most work done on them - who changed the most from conception to final product?
Hi Remedy team, thanks for creating something so great! 

Which was the hardest part of the game to implement and design? Also do you think we'll see any more merchandise, like statues, in the future? Thanks!
Any other cool systems like Chapter Select and Photo Mode on the horizon? Stuff like a game-wide collectible tracker, outfit options, or more QoL-style settings?

Sam also mentioned pretty significant free DLCs before launch, is that also coming?
    The Final Draft was what they were talking about. Night Springs and Lake House DLC are paid DLCs.
        What he said was in addition to Night Springs and Lake House. Final Draft can be one, but he still said the statement as plural, and “pretty significant” at that. I wouldn’t count updates like Chapter Select, and unless Photo Mode has a story tie in, I wouldn’t consider that either.
Could you please let us know how much or if at all our beloved James will make it into the remake. ? My heart is so broken to think I won’t hear those lines in his voice.
How did it feel making a sequel to a game that came out over ten years ago?

I can imagine that the pressure was palpable.
    **JOHN**: It's a honor and a privilege. I feel lucky.

**MARKO**: Working in game industry in general is a high pressure environment as your work is often exposed to both internal and external scrutiny throughout the course of development. This is just something you need to be comfortable with, as long as people are respectful and interact with you in a civilised manner. Our community is just like that: respectful and rather mature. Having said that, the pressure was high and tangible as first Alan Wake enjoys cult status, the sequel had to bring everything to a higher standard and leave people flabbergasted - easy right... but a privilege. There were few times when the pressure to deliver was through the roof and we were not "there" yet, that did challenge my stoicism but during those moments I had my better half there beside me, helping correcting the course.

**NATHALIE**: It felt incredibly special and also hard to grasp. Alan Wake was very important to me, and I have treasured memories about sharing that game with the people I care for and theorizing on what it all meant together! To work on a sequel is a dream come true, but also put some pressure on it because you want to do it justice for all the other fans out there.
        Thank you all for responding. And thank you all for making my game of the year. Really think you all did a great job living up to the legacy and were able to expand and grow the Alan Wake universe. Can’t wait to see where it goes from here.
Are there any plans to acquire Quantum Break IP from Microsoft?
First things first. What the Remedy team have achieved artistically and narratively with Alan Wake 2 is nothing short of amazing. Thank you for one of the best and memorable gaming experiences me and a lot of other people had this decade! 

I would really love to know how you integrated various live action shots into gameplay. Specifically in the overlaps with Saga and the crime scenes with Alan! The flashes of the New York Subway while Saga followed Nightingale were so surreal. And the section where Alan walks down the film section with flashes of Watery. It felt like an actual overlap of realities in a way I can’t describe.

I would love to know how you integrated that seamlessly without any visual misalignments/ awkwardness.

What is the secret behind the Oh Deer Diner coffee? And a hint on Rose’s fan fiction account?😅.

Any update on when the Night Springs DLC will come out? Really looking forward to see more of the Alan Wake characters!
    **NATHALIE**: Thank you for your kind words!

The Pacific Northwest mirrored similar themes as the Dark Place through the shared murder sites and matching boss encounters. For example, in Return 2's Overlap, the final "blended" live-action video depicted a Subway tunnel, and was laid on top of the rock tunnel towards Nightingale. Both of these shots (Overlap and Subway) had a similarly central corridor focal point. Similarly, when you would find Nightingale in Initiation 2, a video depicting Cauldron Lake's tall trees was brought in to match the tall concrete pillars around the site. In this way, both the Pacific Northwest and the Dark Place mirrored each other.

We discussed between various crafts where we could create nicely framed locations to serve as a canvas for these videos, to emphasize the mirroring as much as we could. Usually we were fortunate to have enough available material to choose from, and could iterate on its contents through the video content, VFX, level design and environment art, to facilitate a good match.
How full of a picture of the story do all the members of the different teams have during development?
How much of Alan Wake (1 and 2) was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, because I'm picking up a lot of Lovecraftian Horror vibes from the Dark Place?
Hello guys,Will Remedy cooperate with Epic Games in the future? ( New projects )
Thank you for such an awesome year.

My question: Can you share some useful infomation on how you guys made a smooth and responsive character controller along with the animation of the locomotion?
Hey remedy! Love the game, where did you guys come up with the idea for the we sing level in AW2? Love the level, curious about the process.
Remedy is just the best in the biz, from revolutionizing what a narrative game could be in my eyes with MP, to reigniting that spark in me all those years later with AW2 (I fell in love with the first one, but come on, the sequel is groundbreaking). I’ll leave a couple of questions:





Did James (McCaffrey) record any lines for the expansions? 




and:






How could you guys do that to Cynthia? ;,(





I’ve gotta throw in a bonus Max Payne question, I’m sorry to offtrack: is Timothy Gibbs involved in the development of the Max Payne remake-mashup-miracle-extravaganza?






All the best, guys (and gals), remember to enjoy the process of creation, looking past the enormous pressure involved in following up perfection :)
Is there any chances for connect Quantum Break with Control (1,2),AW (2,3)? It's even possible in theory, in case of getting the rights for QB back?
Thank you for doing this AMA! This game is truly phenomenal, an all time favorite for me.

It was great seeing Sam Lake as a prominent character in the game. Are any other members of the dev team in the game? Was this ever considered? Who would you like to play if you got to choose a role?
    **JOHN**: Yeah, my mum is in the game \\o/ also other dev members were scanned and put in game. I try my hardest to get as many in as possible within the range of scope.

**NATHALIE**: We have quite a few people in the game! Some of us are immortalized in Suomi Hall with very Nordic names, others are Coffee World employees, and some are featured in various narrative items!

We cast people to do the handwriting for specific characters internally, and my handwriting was selected to represent Rose. I adore Rose, so being able to convey her personality through handwritten notes was an absolute joy. Her positivity was infectious, especially when having a rough day. Some of these handwritten notes were put up around the office by her writer Clay Murphy, as we could all use her friendly support after all. <3
        Wow! Rose's positive handwritten notes are one of my favourite parts of the game, adding a touch of coziness to an otherwise scary experience! You have beautiful handwriting!
        I thought Rose was such an excellent addition in AW2 as well. I played the original AW before jumping into 2, it was great to see her appear in most chapters here.
One of the greatest strengths to AW2 is that ammo/flares are always in short supply, but not to the point that it runs out. I feel like you guys hit the sweet spot where you knew you could use it because you know you will find more around the corner, but at the same time you were scared to use too much because you were not 100% sure you will have enough for the next encounter.

This balance really raised the stakes on the game and emphasized the survival horror part of it.

My quetion is: What process did you guys use to perfectly hit that sweet spot? Was it mostly QA testing or did it take something else to get there?

Also want to say thank you to the team for providing the most cinematic and immersive survival horror game I've ever played. My GOTY 2023 and one of my favorites of all time. Looking forward to the DLC!
    **MARKO**: The key decision allowing us to have satisfactory control over resourcing was to go with a fully dynamic resource dispensing system, providing players the opportunities to acquire resources based on a set of rules like the player's inventory status, story progression, game difficulty etc. The hardest part indeed was to get the balancing to represent the intended survival horror experience: to have players minding their resources at all times, never getting too comfortable with what they had in their inventory. Due to game production realities a proper resource balancing effort may happen rather late in the project, as doing a holistic balancing pass requires long uninterrupted playthrough sessions simulating different styles of play in order to get a solid sampling of how well the system holds in the grand scheme of things. All this took numerous hours of both internal and external playtesting and yours truly playing the game and tuning the resourcing based on those findings. Naturally the high-level goals for the item distribution rules has to be oftentimes locked way before even all gameplay systems and mission beats are in place but the real balancing effort happens when you are playing the experience - you always need to define the baseline rules well in advance but to know if it feels good/right, there's really no other way than to play the experience over and over again.
What’s the bathroom situation in the Dark Place?
Are there any plans for more cosmetic items to be added into the game?  
and, what were some of the areas you enjoyed creating the most?
    Please give us the option to change Saga's jacket back to the FBI one in NG+ 😭
Imagine being able to ask the devs anything but instead some guy in here asks if Thomas Zane was deliberately a thirst trap
Are there any plans to do another bulky mega art book once the DLCs wrap up? The control one is one of my favourite things on my shelf 🔻
First of all I would like to thank you all for making a game which is undoubtably one of the best ever made, not made to make money or to appease shareholders, but made for the players, and the creatives who had a vision to make this game.

I would also like to congratulate you on the success the game has achieved in sales, artistic vision and reception by the players and reviewers.

I only have one question, What are Remedy's plans about the future of Alex Casey's voice, and how Remedy plans to tackle the issue of the Max Payne Remakes.

Can Remedy confirm that we will get to hear James McCaffrey once more on the Alan Wake 2 DLC, and if Remedy was aware of his illness and thus preemptively recorded lines for his role as Alex Casey and Max Payne.

Thank you for all the hard work, regardless of whether you can answer this question.
What kind of shoes is Alan wearing? We are looking for them all over the place.
Has any James McCaffrey dialogue been recorded for future Remedy releases? (Whether it be Night Springs, The Lake House, MP1+2 Remake, Control 2, or beyond?)
Hi Natalie and Marko I really enjoy your game layouts and construction of levels.
-Is there a personal philosophy you use when designing? 

With the pacing of control you had oldest house feel always oppressive and engaging with the quick changing sets. And it's feels very different from Alan Wake 2 Level design. Things are larger, drawn out and a bit of of hike to get through.  

-What was the balance between having to give a Washington state park personality and having gameplay progress the narrative. 

And John I have to know with the character design, how was blending twin peaks, the shining and alan wake character designs, there is a bit of a dream logic to their outfits yet very grounded in the genre.
    **JOHN**: Great question Pgull753, Sam Lake and all the directors gave critical feedback and direction to create strong tie to these inspirations. Having worked with Janne, Sam and Kyle in the past I already had an expectation of the production and how things would flow, this made the production process really enjoyable.
Quantum Break 2 when???
    I also need to know this
    They don't have the IP
Favourite films?
    If you haven't seen Twin Peaks it is a massive inspiration.
Y’all created one of the best horror games ever, fantastic job.

My question is what was the most fun and what was the most challenging part of making this game for each of you?
    **JOHN**: The most challenging thing is trying to fit as much quality across all the characters as possible. Likely you always have to make some quality choices especially for NPC's but I try my hardest to make the quality as even across all assets as possible.

**MARKO**: As mundane as this may sound the most challenging part to me as a gameplay lead was not the creative process itself but to manage the constant context switching and finding time to do implementation level work. On the other hand I got to experience this game production through a completely different lens and to have the possibility to work with hundreds of people from various crafts is always fun and ensuring there was never a dull moment.

**NATHALIE**: I've answered this one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1ay2b2o/comment/kseelau/)!
Hello Remedy team! Just created a reddit account for this. Alan Wake 2 is a masterpiece, in my top 5 games of all time.

I know Control 2 will be it's own game, but my question is, will it also play as a bridge between Alan Wake 2 and a possible sequel, if that question can't be answered, will Control 2 at least acknowledge the events of Alan Wake 2? 

Thank you.
Hi guys! Amazing game, my questions revolve around the awesome musical segments - what came first, the songs or the level design for Chapter 4: We Sing? Was it a choice you made to try and expand on the musical fight at the farm in the first game? Any insight into the writing process of the songs would also be wonderful. The music is incredible. Love the crunch of the guitars, a real Ozzy vibe. Thanks for a blast!
    **NATHALIE**: Lead mission designer Anne-Marie Grönroos worked on the design of We Sing so I asked her what her process was like.

There was an early version of the Herald of Darkness song and lyrics available, which she used as a foundation to build the gameplay beats onto. The song summarizes Alan's life, starting with his childhood, rise to fame, Bright Falls, and being trapped in the Dark Place. The song was divided into these four sections already in that early draft of the lyrics, but they didn't always suggest relevant gameplay beats. So in those cases the gameplay beats were designed first and the lyrics got adjusted to match that.

The point of We Sing was to recap the first game, which it does, but it's also a mini mirror of Wake trying to escape the Dark Place. So, on top of the narrative theme, she dedicated each section to a different gameplay concept (fake enemies in the first part, shadow enemies in the second part, Bright Falls style combat in the third part, Plot Board in the fourth part; more or less in the same order they're introduced in the actual Dark Place), which provided a clear focus for each section.
Is there anyone on the team that cannot handle horror games at all? If so did you ever use them as a guinea pig to test any scary parts of the game? 

Thank you all so much for making such a great game!
    **NATHALIE**: We do have people on the team who can't handle scares and indeed, they were nice to test with! However, the ultimate challenge was in scaring the usually unfazed too. The early versions of horror sequences were playtested internally, but their effectiveness was sometimes hard to judge without final audio, lighting, VFX, etc. When they were a bit more developed we playtested more and more with people outside of the team and external playtesters as well. 

Our User Research team was crucial in this process. We kept a close eye on how players reacted to our horror sequences, in case something wasn't hitting the tone correctly. We were pretty happy if most people got some thrill out of it, as horror is so subjective and it might never resonate with everyone.

While I love horror and worked on multiple horror sequences, I have to admit they sometimes scared me too. I've yelped multiple times while testing something and it having slipped my mind there would be a scare somewhere. I took that as a good sign!
What is something important you feel you have learned on the development of this game that you believe will be crucial to take with you moving forward with future games?
    **JOHN**: I enjoyed the process of designing characters with Cosplay in mind for the fans, so for any future characters I want to focus on how we can build more iconic and colorful characters.

**MARKO**: To always strive to the parity between gameplay and narrative. One of the biggest high-level achievements for us was to succesfully glue the narrative and gameplay together into a cohesive packgage. This was one of the core game pillars but following it through across the development was not an easy feat.

**NATHALIE**: This project really drove home the fact that there is a magic in having everyone's expertise in their craft come together, and the outcome of that being so much better than you could imagine by yourself. A great team with mutual trust will provide a solid backbone for development. It inspires confidence that things will end up alright, and that we'll tackle challenges one way or another. Facilitating each other to thrive is something I'd love to take forward in any future project.
How fateful will Max Payne remakes gameplay be to the originals? Is it gonna keep the old charm with the quick save and load style classic gameplay? Almost "puzzlelike" rooms with baddies to clear or be more modern movie like experience with only checkpoints? Absolutely Loved how cool some rooms were. Just had to quick load instantly after clearing them just to clear and experience them again with different weapon set.
were there any things that were planned or that you guys wanted to put in the game,  
but couldn't due too it being too big or time consuming or just not worth it?
Whats the merch situation?we want more little things to show our love, that goes double for a real version of all the in universe books like the Alex Casey and Departure/Initiation etc
Hi guys! I do understand that margins on physical media for the studio are razor thin but are there any plans on releasing Alan Wake 2 on disc later maybe after both expansions are released? It just feels wrong to have Control and Alan Wake on disc on PS5 and lack the sequel to the latter.
There are a few townsfolk in Watery and Bright Falls that seem to have interesting plot lines of their own going on — the visiting paranormal investigators, Charlie & Charline, the bird lady in the park, the woman endlessly knocking on the door in the lodge. Were there ever any plans to have characters like this give Saga side quests?
What was the funniest bug you encountered during production?
    **MARKO**: The wolf being our first ever quadruped character with an AI did have some growing pains. My favorite one was a situation where the wolf frantically paced back and forth at the trailer park, occasionally barging through doors entering the trailers - just ignoring the player.

**NATHALIE**: We had a bug where dead bodies would spin around in place. It took you out of the mood, especially during horror design.
Don't you get confused?
Hi Remedy team! Love all your work.



Given the gap between AW1 and AW2, what was it like hearing the news that you got the rights back for Alan Wake?
don’t really have a question to ask, probably all of them i could think of were already said, but i just wanted to say you guys did one hell of a job with this. this artistically, technically, creatively, every -ly was inspirational and amazing! i look at the herald of darkness performance at the game awards, sam dancing with what he and his team created, the smile on his face without a lick of regret. i look at that as my greatest source of inspiration to create something as good and artistic as Alan Wake 2. a culmination of all the great work you guys have done, congrats on all the success and i’m excited for the dlc/control 2/whatever you guys have planned!
First off congrats on the success of the game.

My question is for Nathalie!

What was something you knew you had to do to separate Alan and sagas segments? They are obviously pretty different in enemy layout and progression.
    **NATHALIE**: In the Dark Place the danger is lingering and ever-present, whereas in the Pacific Northwest there is more of an ebb and flow. Playing the Dark Place for long sections of time can be a bit draining as it's interesting and engaging but also quite intense. In the Pacific Northwest playing as Saga we incentivize players more to go off the beaten path. The Dark Place is dangerous in comparison, and it's a high stakes decision to step off the main path there because you never know what's around the corner. Saga's sections act as a bit of a breather, done through slightly lower stakes exploration, various points of interest, and comedic relief. Also, the lighting, audio, and overall mood help!
Will there be any further Dead by Daylight collaborations?
The music in the game is all next level. What artist/ media give the most influence/inspiration to such a great soundtrack in all the games?
Do any of you have your own Dark Place? Your own Mr Scratch?
Do y'all take fan mail?
What was one challenge during development that you thought was totally worth the effort of working through and paid off for you personally?
    **MARKO**: There were plenty of challenges we surpassed but I do need to highlight the unsung hero of the player experience: character controller.

Our approach to have more realistic and claustrophobic combat spaces created the need to rethink how player character would control in our game - to have a character controller that enables smooth navigation in cramped, complex and dynamic environments. A significant effort was put to ensure fluent player movement at all times and this was definitely not an easy task to convey to the team and get to the finishing line. In the end it was worth the effort and in grand scheme of things the solutions the team created may benefit the future Remedy games as well.

[Here you can get a glimpse of the character controller in action.](https://vimeo.com/880838821)
Who decided to give Nightingale Y Fronts for the nudity off setting? 
    **JOHN**: I created the concept for the Y-Fronts but I remember having a sync with Kyle Rowley (Game Director), Sam Lake (Creative Director) and Janne Pulkinnen (Art Director) on ideas and what we could. I just did a visual to get an idea of how it might look. So it was mostly a joint Y Fronts Adventure.
How hard was it to transition from the usual remedy "third person action shooter" gameplay to the survival-horror one?   
AW2 really stands out from other Remedy games because movement and camera feel completely different. Was it hard for the dev/gamedesign teams to switch to the new genre?   
And did you enjoy working on a new genre, or you would prefer sticking to more action oriented gameplay?
    **MARKO**: One of our gameplay animation pillars regarding feel was physicality. Physicality comes with a premise which suit the game we were making: player actions are more deliberate, take more time to perform and at all times reflect the avatar you are controlling. Finding the sweet spot between grounded and believable movement/actions and the responsiveness was one of the toughest challenges for us. In addition to that introducing new camera aesthetics to further create the sense of uneasiness and vulnerability is the polar opposite of how you approach designing third person action game cameras. These are a tough sell to people who have spent most of their career working in action games.

I've been a fan of survival horror games since the original Alone in the Dark and I've always wanted to work on a horror game so it did not take too much of convincing for me to say yes to this opportunity. It was all about switching the design mindset from action to more methodical survival horror game loop but the motivation and desire to work on this genre was there right from the beginning. I believe you need to enjoy playing the games you are making to stay motivated as a designer and I gravitate towards projects that resonate with me both as a player and as a professional.
From a gameplay perspective, what are the challenges one faces when making a slower, more deliberate game like AW2, as opposed to something super vertical and fast-paced like Control? Does restricting the movement of the player allow for more strategically interesting combat scenarios, or just make it harder to keep the variety up?
    **MARKO**: Restricting player abilities and removing verticality definitely introduced a new set challenges for us. Control's confrontational always forward combat loop was switched with methodical cautiousness. Desperate combat being one of our key pillars, it meant player being able to barely survive with the given tools and push back in the last moment. It was about these moments of just barely making it and second-to-second decisions leading to that success. Enemy variety and encounter setups were crucial to keep things fresh and surprising to player - we strived to keep players at their toes, never fully allowing them getting too comfortable with the situations they were thrown in.
Hi y'all!  Thank you so much for contributing to such an amazing game. I'm on a serious gaming hangover since I've finished AW2 - nothing that I play seems quite as good as that. 

This is a question for John - how do you come up with some of the appearance quirks/personality quirks of the characters that you design? Do you pull from real life experience? Think "wow, that would be weird"? 

Thanks!
    **JOHN**: Most of the quirky characters come from film or T.V. shows. I love Fargo and Twin Peaks these were a huge inspiration for me, and I know for many on the team. I try to get as much inspiration as possible from other great shows/film and apply that. I remember going through a library of new casted heads we wanted to put in the game which had more variety in terms of the personality types of the pacific northwest, it was a fun part of the process.
        Thank you so much for such a great response!
I need more Director Jesse Faden.  When is she back?
What was it like working with Behaviour on the Alan Wake Dead by Daylight chapter?
    **JOHN**: So I'm a big fan of DBD.. I really enjoyed seeing them come to life in their universe and I've been playing a lot. The process is pretty much the same in terms of modelling the assets. We worked closely to maintain the likeness of the outfits and quality as much as possible. I'm really happy with how it all looks and plays.
Is there any talk with DBD for more Alan Wake content to possibly enter the game? Would love to see Alice:)
What do you have to say about the allegations of feline abuse leveled against Mayor Setter? Can we really let Bright Falls be run by such a *bad* boy?
Will you ever in the distance future release Alan wake 2 physically?
    I also want to know!
Hey, John! Absolutely LOVED all the artwork I've seen from you. You did excellent work designing the characters and costume.


I'm currently working on my character design portfolio myself and was wondering if you had any tips or helpful advice for me? I am working on more stylized characters, but would appreciate some help.


What's the number one thing I should keep in mind when working on a character?



Thanking you in anticipation :)
    **JOHN**: Great question: for me the number one thing personally is I like to keep colours to a minimum of three so keep the colour scheme nice and simple that usually helps to create a nice identity for the character. Adobe color charts are great for calibrating colours. And a great silhouette always helps.
        Thank you for the reply!!


Silhouette and smartly-used, limited colours that help to create a strong identity. Got it :)
What will be happening to Alex Casey character, with the tragic passing of James McCaffery
    Seconding this.
LOVE YOU ALL!
What kind of scanning/locations went into the photo-real backgrounds of the game?  It really has some of the most stunning views and lighting effects I’ve seen in a game since I can remember.
HII I want ask about upcoming dlc for Alan Wake 2, what will we get from those dlc? (Just on the surface if you don't mind :D)


And second, who's pov we will play in the DLCs? I think that's all! Thank you and wish all the best to all Remedy's members ❤️
What are some of the biggest influences on Alan Wake 2? And as creators, was there anything that inspired you while making it?

Thank you for this great game!
How do you keep track of all the story connections from previous Remedy games? I didn't realise how much the story fits together so well until I went back and replayed for example the Control AWE DLC. 
What's one thing that you are personally proud of that made it into the game? Either something you were responsible for, or something that means a lot to you personally.
    **JOHN**: Designing Alan and Saga, it means alot to work with directors who are friends and I respect. And also that they trust me to deliver their vision.

**NATHALIE**: I'm proud of getting a chance to work on various horror sequences across the game, and my part of the work done on various Cauldron Lake missions. It's been such a great journey overall, and I'm glad I got to tackle so many different challenges.
What is the writing process like for developing the great stories remedy is known for?
What were the major themes y'all were going for when writing? I know many people have drawn parallels to the Dark Place and alcoholism/depression -- when constructing the Dark Place, were there any metaphors in mind?
No question, but this was honestly one of the best games I've ever played. I'm so sad we lost James McCaffrey. He was one of the Greats. 

Thank you for making this masterpiece.
Thank you for making such an incredible game! Really love it **<3**

* How many cups of coffee did you guys drink each day while developing the game?
* Who invented the nursery rhyme puzzles? It's very creative!
    **JOHN**: I have a full coffee press every morning so about 3 cups, then maybe 2 more before 2pm.. it might be too much

**MARKO**: Average six cups of fine coffee per day for me. Sunlight is not that much of a thing in Finland during winter, so my personal ray of light is usually a double espresso shot that jump starts my day.

The concept of Nursery Rhymes was created by our Game Director Kyle Rowley and Lead Mission Designer Anne-Marie Grönroos as one of the key exploration rewards for our players with strong narrative tie-ins to Control.
When will we get photomode and could we get a complete one ( dof, distance, manual lightning...)?
Hello Nathalie, Marko and John!  
  
First of all, congratulations to you and to your colleagues for this amazing game. I love Remedy games and Alan Wake 2 deserves every award it gets.

I can't help to feel that embarking on a challenge like this must come with a lot of hardships. I mean, you were probably working on this for over 4 years! How did you end up in game development?
    **JOHN**: Long story but in short I was a fine artist and somehow got into games through graphic design. I spent many years doing UI art before slowly learning 3d in my spare time and finally ending up as a character artist and never left.

**MARKO**: Before games industry I worked in telecommunications for quite some time. The people I worked with were fantastic but the job itself was "just" a job to me - I was not satisfied and wanted something more. I took a conscious risk, left it all behind and went back to school to study digital media, my goal was to combine the technical knowledge I already had and tap into the creative side if things. Gaming has been a passion to me since the late 80s and already in young age I found myself analysing games in desire to understand how they were made - retrospectively the notes are rather hilarious to read but you need to start from somewhere. During my studies I got a chance to apply to a design internship in a then well-known Helsinki based mobile studio and the rest is history. This is my sixteenth year in the industry and no regrets!

**NATHALIE**: I was torn between game development and psychology when choosing a degree to study. I knew there existed a beautiful marriage between both, but where to start? I ended up going to university to study psychology, and enjoyed human-computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics so much I specialized in a MSc in Applied Cognitive Psychology. To conclude my studies I started an internship at a serious games company as a cognitive psychologist. During that time I absolutely fell in love with the development process. I worked directly with developers consulting them on design decisions using my research findings, but I learned then I wanted to be even more thoroughly involved. I wanted to help build the games directly. So I enrolled in a BSc in International Game Architecture and Design which taught me the tools and gave me the experience I needed to apply at Remedy Entertainment! I fell in love with the company since the first Max Payne, so being able to work here is a dream come true.
With the death of McCaffery how are you going to handle the Max Payne remakes?
Why Zane Finnish name is Thomas Seine instead of Tuomas Seine?
When was it decided to bring Peter Franzen in and did it take any convincing? Was happily delighted to see him in the game and he did an awesome job even amidst all the veterans.

Also thank you for an amazing game, excited about that super secret work you are doing!
Who was your inspiration for Saga as a character?
    **JOHN**: The main inspiration for Saga came from the directors for capturing her unique character.  For the outfit design when concepting Saga I took inspiration for the raincoat from shows like Dark. For her character and attitude characters like Stana Katic from Absentia and Miireille Enos rom The Killing were a good reference point. I was able alongside the directors to iterate many times to land on something special.
        Oh man being from the northwest Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman’s portrayal of their character felt exactly like everyone I ever grew up with in Washington state.
Hi!! Is there any chance of Yötön Yö (the song) being uploaded to streaming services? Love all your work 🇨🇱🇨🇱
    Yes. Yoton Yo on Spotify plz
Question for the Mission Designer.

How do you think the level design has evolved throughout the development? In terms of pacing, flow and encounter design, how do you compare it from pre-production with the design you finally settled on in the final?
First off, THANK YOU for Alan Wake 2 🤩 There are so many intricate moving parts in the game and I find it very impressive that it runs and plays as well as it does. I wanted to know what gameplay element or specific design of a mission caused the most problems in development?
Does storytelling work differently in a video game compared to other media? How do you approach crafting a story for a game? (And I guess with the gameplay in mind?)
Does it come after or alongside the creation of the game? Do you go from an idea to a fleshed out story over many drafts and then start to create the game or...?
How do you know that the plot points decided on are a great fit for the story of a game?

Thank you for offering us amazing games and storytelling over the decades at Remedy! <3
Was there anything from the scrapped Alan Wake 2 that ended up finding its way into this iteration of the game? Alternatively, were there any mechanics you guys wanted to implement, but couldn't whether it be from budget, far too complex for current gen, or it just didn't work for what the game is?
AW2 is my favourite game of all so thank you so much for creating it! How much fun did you guys have working on Coffee world?
Hi Nathalie, How did you end up at Remedy Games?
Its cool to see multi culture at Remedy and as a fellow Dutchie myself its super cool to see how one could end up working for this finnish giant.
Is there actually an hidden fish somewhere in the Percolator ?
I've read that a LOT of different scrapped ideas happening along the journey to the actual Alan Wake 2 that we received. Some might have been incorporated into Control, and I'm sure some did eventually make it into the actual Alan Wake 2. Is there a possibility of any of these old ideas cropping up in future games or media? Say, DLC or even Control 2/Alan Wake 3? And if you can, what is the scope for the future of the 'Remedyverse'? 

Long time Remedy fan since Max Payne. Thanks for doing an AMA!
Why did you guys decided to use Scratch and Mr. Scratch as different entities?


One thing I didn't get is why, if Alan is tainted by the dark presence(while Zane the Diver wasn't), then it means something dark is inside Alan. Why didn't they write a story, in the dark place, in which Alan manifested his tainted persona and effectively defeated it in a story? Why must Mr. Scratch be something else?
Is there any chance in the future we could buy the  oh deer sweater saga wears?
Don't have a question but I just want to say I love your work. Alan wake, control, quantum break, max Payne. You guys are just true craftsmen. Thank you
Hey Remedy, I just had two questions. How long did it take to shoot Herald of Darkness? And why does Remedy like to mess with time?
Hey guys, long time fan of Remedy over here (since the Max Payne days). I have one question, which is, is Ilkka Villi as much of a delight as he seems like? He seems like a real pleasant fellow.

Otherwise, I just wanted to say, cheers, and thanks for making Alan Wake II. I had pretty much given up any hope of it ever happening until the teaser trailer came out! Thought I was one of very few people who played and LOVED Alan Wake back in 2010, so you and your team made at least one person literally shout and jump for joy when the teaser came out! Keep up the amazing work, I look forward to all future Remedy endeavors!
Hey Nathalie, was there any parts of the game that you had to cut out and wished were still in it?
Which Wendy Davis Beef Jerky is your favourite? 🤔
Did Sam find it necessary to give the "whole picture" to many staff members? What is it like working without a full explanation?
Who is your favorite character that didn't make an appearance in Alan Wake 2?
Who wrote who?
How lovely is Shawn Ashmore? (Pls tell him he's the best)
Will the audio ever be 100% fixed?
Favorite moment of Alan wake 2 that you contributed or not !
How do you survive Finnish winter ?
Can you tell us at least one of Sam Lake's most serious flaws? Nobody can be that perfect, right? Help the rest of us mere mortals feel better about ourselves 😭
Why did Scratch turn from being my psychotic gay roommate into the dictionary definition of rage?
Were there any experimental game mechanics/ ideas or concepts that was scrapped during development and what were they?
What was the funniest glitch you encountered when making the game?
Thanks for saving my life. Alan Wake 2 is quite literally the only reason I didn’t unalive myself last year. I made a post about this. Meant every word.

Goats.
Not a question but since you’re gonna read the comment, just thank you for that wonderful game. I’ve never experienced something like this in my entire gaming life and I loved every part of it. 

In a gaming world where everything is about money and bland game, you have made a prowess. The fitting quality is another point that you mastered and congrats for this. 

I’m really eager to play the next dlc and your next game. Only one thing to say is, keep making game with passion and make us feel it. Thank you Remedy
We’re the scenes in Alice’s apartment directly inspired (visually or otherwise) by the book House of Leaves?

I know it’s been said the book was an inspiration for the games, but those parts replicated the books vibes perfectly for me.
What's it like being cool as fuck?
Thank you so much, Remedy, for the chance to ask questions and such wonder games! AW2 pulled me from a bad writer/art block that plagued me for years. So appreciative of the game and the amazing work everyone put in.

General question: I am curious will AW2 get extras like AW1? The AW Files was so cool and really enjoyed the extra BTS content and reading the pdf screenplays of AW and AWAN. Would love to read the screenplays for AW2.

John Crossland: What are your favorite concepts that didn't make it into the game? What are your favorite ones that did? Will there be an AW2 art book in the future?

Nathalie Janki: What is the process of designing missions while incorporating the story? Was it difficult with two protagonist routes to consider?

Marko Muikku: How did the gameplay evolve with the progression of the narrative? Did the story influence the gameplay or the choice of survival horror gameplay influence the story?
Please convince my mum to let me get the game
I have nothing to ask. Thank you for making one of the best horror game franchises of all time
Is there anything you can share about how the plans for Max Payne changed after the tragic news of James McCaffrey's death?
Will we ever meet or get a flashback of alan wake mom?
How did Alan Wake 2 sell? Over or below expectations? Do You think having it Epic exclusive for the Pc has impacted it in any way, and if so, how?
I'm so sorry for the amount of questions, can't be helped 

**Working at Remedy**

1. How did you three end up at Remedy?
2. You all have different job titles but are there a lot of things in common as well? Like love for games, pop culture, stories..
3. If one would like to apply to job like this, what kind of skills and studies and experience is needed to succeed at AAA-studio? 

**Nat & John**

1. What are some things you have liked in Finland while working at Remedy? In addition to weather.
2. Was there a big culture shock when you arrived? What things you miss the most from home (excluding friends, lovers and family)?

**John**

1. How do you develop a character from scratch? Not Scratch, scratch. How did we end up having such an amazing new character as Saga? Is there first a need or idea or both, depending on case?

**Nat & Marko** 

1. RE4 was kind of AW1 (focus on action) and RE7 was kind of AW2 (focus on horror). Needless to say RE7 and AW2 are my favorite, but what do you usually say to those people who say there was too little "gameplay"? Like... action does not equal gameplay, especially in non-action game.
2. I can see the inventory mgmt took some influences from RE4, mind place from Sherlock, case board from any detective story, profiling from Hannibal.. what other inspirational sources you had?

**Small critique section**

1. It was mentioned even in the game, "why no love to Barry?", I believe his character was perfect for AW1 but not for AW2.. might fit better to Control 2 (New Weird) than AW2 (survival horror). I wouldn't perhaps like to see Leo Getz in The Silence of the Lambs either, but I do love him in Lethal Weapon 2. BUT... why no love to other animals? Only wolves, dead moose and dead deers on the wall. 
2. I kind of missed >!a couple of big or even small bosses, could have been taken moose or clown in Coffee World, and the ultimate crucendo e.g. weakening Alex Scratch double the time vs Alan Scratch before scratch is transfered to Alan. At the end of the game IMO action does not interfere the story that much (especially after Summoning chapter) because there is not much suspense buildup left. !<
3. Are you guys going to fix Saga not wearing gloves or will there be a big story reveal later on.. :))

**End game**

1. I've understood video games do not look like video games like 80% of the dev lifecycle. At what point you began to understand AW2 will actually be a masterpiece?
2. I know there are no public plans, but... after all DLCs have been released (in 2025?), could you please  tell Remedy Executives we really need a physical Ultimate Collector's Edition, even via some crowdfunding platform to minimize risks.  
3. Not a question, but... Thank you so much for your effort and hard work put into AW2, for the amazing end result and for the memories you have given for the whole gaming generation, which will be talked about years or decades to come.
Hei Remedy ! First of all, Thank you for making such a beautiful and mind-blowing game. I cannot state enough how unique and excellent this experience was, and I hope you can continue to make many more in the future :). 

As for questions :

Besides the musical, what part/segment was the hardest to make? Be it from a technical standpoint to just player reception ? 

Also, would you be interested in making more games with multiple protagonists like this one ? I feel like it's been handled greatly in AW2.

Next thing is now that the Remedy universe is finally taking its first steps, are you more interested in making more subtile connections between the titles like with the FBC appearing in AW2 (which I love), or would you like to sometimes organize a full on crossover with the protagonists of the RCU in the future, something akin to the marvel movies (taking the most popular exemple), where it will build up to a certain climax ?

 .
God, this game fucks. Thank you so much for such a wild ride! Can't wait for the lakehouse dlc!
What video games or books inspired Alan Wake specifically, I love survival horror and see a ton of inspiration and innovation in your guys work, thanks a ton for making a master piece of a series!
I love you.
When will you release Alan Wake 3?

Also, I preferred the Saga gameplay over the Alan Dark Place puzzling.
How are you?
Will Alan Wake 2 be coming to Steam in the near future?
Will there be a physical copy?
Why game so scary?
No real question, just wanted to know you make awesome games that stick with me for long time after finishing them.

Thank you for everything you've been doing for the gaming community.
Am I correct in assuming that you intentionally embed esoteric and hermetic philosophy into your games or is it just an emergent side effect of supernatural storytelling?
-Nathalie and Marko, what was the biggest challenge you encountered while designing the back-and-forth storytelling dynamic for the game? And was it something you were able to workout or did you have to go back to the drawing board? 

-John was there something you were thrilled to add but was impossible to carry-out and it had to be scratched? 

I'm still in awe with what you guys (and the entire team) created with this game. It's an absolute masterpiece of modern entertainment that has the greatest potential to change how story telling is done today. 

-Was there any moment where you didn't know exactly where things were headed but you trusted the process and went along with things? 

-How did you manage to simplify the complexity of the story while working on the game and keeping it mysterious for the player? 

Thank you guys for this life-changing piece of art!
When will we get x-axis inversion (from a desperate fan who has sadly been unable to play the game without it)?
Since Alan wake was once an Xbox exclusive and it got a sequel, are there any plans that you can share about a potential quantum break 2, or a return of jack Joyce?
why did Rose have so many images of Alan Wake that were clearly a different person? Was she just delusional (as you might think) or is it a deeper part of the ’who is Alan/who is Tom Zane’ mystery?
Hello Remedy, Thank you for giving us an amazing horror experience. Alan Wake 2 has become my favourite horror game of all time. The story, the gameplay, and the graphics are the best i have ever seen in a game so far. 
I have only 3 questions.
- Were there any bosses originally planned for Alans part that were cut?
- Will Sarah Breaker or Barry return?
-  Is there any chance of Alan returning to Fortnite this year?
Are we going to see Alice again?
Who is Mr Door? Or, what is Mr door?
    I’ll do you one better… WHY is Mr. Door?
The coffee question: We know, you are big fans of coffee at Remedy. Is there a favorite way to brew coffee? Something like the Remedy-way to the best coffee?
Will any other team members besides Sam be made into NPCs?
Thank you for your work.
Does the success and acclaim for Alan Wake 2 change anything in terms of additional content or future development?
Please explain who is tom zane😭😭😭my mind is spiralling down on complexity
Congrats with AW2! My question has to do with the shadow enemies. How does shining the flashlight on one make them dissapear and the other reveal itself? Another question: are we getting more outfits?
    **MARKO**: Hostile Shadows hide amongst groups of Shadows. Shining the Flashlight on the enemy will reveal which one of them are hostile - pay close attention how the light interacts with the ones that are Hostile versus the ones that are mere Shadows.
Will Alan Wake 2 ever receive a physical release?
Can you add an invert x axis option in the camera settings?
Why seek out the help of Sweet Baby Inc.? What ideas did they contribute?
    Touch some grass
        Because if you disagree with inserting propaganda into video games, you haven’t been outside enough. Makes sense
            "Inserting propaganda"

Lmao
            Don't be shy. Do elaborate
        Have you ever gone out for a jog?
            Yep
                Do it again but just keep going
                    Rough couple of days eh?
                        How do you figure? I’ve been busy lifting heavy, eating good with my lovely wife, and spreading democracy
                            Sure thing bub
Will there be ever be a physical copy? is THQNordic working with you guys on that. Love to see a collectors edition.
Is there any physical release planned for AWII in the future? Ultimate edition like Control.
Is the photo mode you are going to add the good kind like in Spider-Man, Horizon, RDR2 etc., or the awful kind that just spins around the character? Also, could I get a copy of the live action Ahti poster seen in Nightless Night on his janitors door?
Is there anything about the game you guys wish was different? I love the game by the way!
Favorite video game?
I was wondering, knowing that there were other attempts of getting the game made that failed to take off, how much of the these earlier versions made it to the Final Cut of AW2 and which concepts have been carried over.

Congratulations for the amazing game, as someone who pre-purchased the original game and have been waiting for a conclusion to this story for 13 years, I couldn’t be happier with what you guys made.
Do you have any funny bugs and glitches you experienced during development? Could you share them with us?
Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA! I love this game. I’m left wanting more of the narrative. 

Will we get back story on Ahti and Mr. Door via the DLC’s or is that to be left to the imagination? 

Thanks :)
❤️ your games Remedy! 

Why oh why don’t you guys make more merch for Alan Wake 2?!?!? 

I feel you would make a killing with your multitudinous cultish fan base for a hugely beloved game. I admittedly know next to nothing about the economics of merch sales. But there’s nothing on the store now! Don’t make us scour alternate markets for merch whose profits should 100% go to Remedy!
Hi Remedy!

I would like to know if you guys have plans on putting an arcade game mode like in American Nightmare.
Is there any hope of fixing the peformance degradation over time when playing the game for over 20 minutes? Watery area in particular.
Why is Ahti mopping the carpet?
Are you ever going to fix the constants crashes for Alan Wake 2 on Xbox series S?
I think the entire Saga portion was contrived. There is a major plothole to which I can point that proves this. Tor Anderson is supposed to be Saga's grandfather and Odin her great uncle or something. Their relationship is supposed to be one of the "real" parts of the story. Now Tor and Odin are also supposed to have some kind of psychic resistance to the dark force. Which means they can't be fooled by the story. Saga is also supposed to have this power. But the very first time they meet, one of them, Tor or Odin, I can't remember, says to Saga, so good to have you back here. This implies that Saga had a life in Watery, but Saga herself plain denies that. Now given how she has the "shining", her take that she never lived in Watery must be true. But then, Tor and Odin are also supposed to have the shining, then why do THEY wrongly remember Saga staying there? It's a paradox. It's really disappointing too because of how much Remedy prides themselves on narrative integrity. 


Side note: Alan runs like a b!tch in this game. Seriously, what's up with that animation and those swaying hips?
Hi guys! 

There is a problem with the trophy “hidden by the trees” on PS5. I have already collect the stash and launch box and the 2 case are closed, but the count of the trophy it’s broken :( (37\\43)

Can fix this in the next update please? 

  
Thanks
Hey Remedy, I don't usually complain about specific parts of games, but holy shit, what was going on with the Cynthia boss fight in the water? 

Are you ok?

Like, did anyone playtest that? I just died 8 times in a row.
thanks for great games over so many years. I wish you could make more money and not have to make live service games with Tencent.  I wish there was enough  money for a physical disc aw2 as I would buy it.
There's a minor bug in without-hud mode, when saga trying to kill Nightingale in overlap in Cauldron Lake, during combat Nightingale would grap Saga(the time when need to press certain button consecutively to escapes the grapping), the time the Nightingale graps Saga the hud would appear. I think this is bug, hope you can fix that
Do you have a rough ETA for the DLCs? Thanks!
Ask Sam Lake to pop by during this
What happened to the missing cat Tibbles? Was he found? Is he still missing? Will we be able to find him in the DLC? #JusticeForTibbles
Will you guys plan for a complete physical edition for Alan Wake 2 when the game has enough DLC? Something similar to Baldur Gates 3 with custom artwork in the box will be awesome
AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation implementation please!!!!!!
You should make a co-op game similar to a resident evil in the future
Plans for steam release?
When is fsr 3 coming?
Will there be a disc version!?
I am mexican and many of us want to know if there is even the slightest possibility of adding dubbing like in the first game, many of us liked the dubbing that it had in AW1
How early in development was a decision made to use sweetbabyinc, and specifically why did the team feel AW2 needed their input when previous Remedy titles found success without them? Now that AW2 has released, does the team feel SBI drove any difference in reception of the game?
    Great question that will be purposefully ignored
        Garbage bad-faith question that is rightfully ignored
Did you know that if you rerelease AW2 on physical, I will gladly buy the game again, and if you put out a vinyl with all the chapter songs, I will also spend money on that?
Will this game ever be getting a steam release? How about a physical release, at least for consoles?
 Is there DLC coming to the game?
Gracias
    Two expansions: Night Springs and the Lake House.
When are we getting the physical version?
Are there any plans to release physical copies of this game? I really want to play it but I only buy physical games.
Control 2 coming along nicely?
Max Payne Remastered, when? 
Also, how are you dealing with James' passing? I just can't imagine someone else voicing Max as of now. Hoping for some sort of homage to him.
It's a shot in the dark but there's this thing that has been bothering me since launch: when playing as Alan, torch in hand, and walking slowly (like slightly tilting the stick) the walking animation looks kinda scuffed, every step he kinda twitches to the left and if you look down he's walking sideways In an unnatural manner.

Absolutely not a priority I know this is super nitpicky but fixing this would be fantastic 🙏
Are you working on a fix for the bug where points of interest showing up on the map when there is nothing there?
When is the game coming to steam?
Please remove avx instruction
After playing Alan Wake 1, I have wanted to see ***bears*** in these games. There was some old consept art for them. (I have not yeat finish AW2, so if there are any bears please ignore)

Was there any game mechanics that you wanted to put in the game but could not. 

Do you play Death Rally in the office?
Add Alan wakes first game design to fort plz
When you say “busy working on DLC”…what do—-WHENS IT COMING OUT?
Are Jesse and Dr. Darling in the DLCs?
Will the game release on Steam ?

No other questions because answers in gamedevs ama veiled in best case  90% of time and not much interesting happening. Just beating around the bush, teasing the fans.
When will Alan Wake 2 be available for purchase on Steam? ^(:))
Game optimization on lower vram PCs(~4GB)?
Please release a physical copy of the game and list it on the Steam store.
This is for Sam Lake;
What is it that makes it so enjoyable to hear you speak?
Will you give me the game for free because I’m cool and broke?
What you have to say the criticism that Alan Wake 2 have a boring gameplay? Do you understand that there is a reason behind this common criticism or is it just a hater thing? Love AW2, thanks!
When you're near the end of Saga's story, you learn that the >!Cult of the Tree are good guys and they kill Taken that appears in the area. !<But during the intro when you play as >!Nightingale, the cultists appear as Taken. !<What's up with that?
    That's easy. But also end? Lol. More like middle. Anyway, Taken see regular humans as Taken. That's why they attack. Note Nightingale was speaking (relatively) well, asking for help, the Bookers thought he was ranting incoherently and screaming.
        Wow! I didn't realize the AMA had already started and I got a reply from a Remedy rep! Thank you so much!
            That literally is the answer. Lol. Good luck though, I guess? Sorry for ruining your experience by responding with an answer.
Can you make the case board automatic? It's very boring and tedious. 
Is Alan Wake 3 in the making? 🥺
Is there anything you can tell us about the Control sequel you guys have been working on?
How much did Sam love performing at the video game awards?
Hi team, is there a reason behind Alan's awkward walking animation? There's massive foot sliding and his legs almost crossing each other. This is not the case with Saga animation at all. Is this a work around to avoid clipping?  Any plan for a fix? Your insights into this would be great. -From a huge fan of the game-
Is Sam Lake going to be the face of Max Payne in the remakes? Plz say yes😡
Can we have Max payne 2 ported on either switch or smartphones?
Will we ever know in a future game what Ahti really is?
Do you plan on releasing the Art of Alan Wake 2, similar to the Control one? Also, a limited run physical edition?
GREAT WORK GUYS, KEEP IT UP!
Will the original non-final draft version of the game be preserved in later releases like a complete edition with all the DLC or a physical release? I have a soft spot for the original ending and I fear it may be lost in the future. Final draft being the only version on the complete or physical release is my worry. The original version has a magic to it.... a wonder. I just replayed through that version again to get my platinum trophy on PS5 and I may be in the minority liking the first draft as much as I do. The finality of the final draft feels weird to me. I like the everybody comes to a story seeking answers vibe of that first draft. Hoping it'll still play like finshing first draft unlocks Final draft and DLC has a menu. 

I may think too much.
Is there any chance we get a special edition physical copy similar to how larian did for Baldurs gate 3? I’m a massive fan of AW1 and haven’t played AW2 yet because I prefer physical games and would love to add a special edition of AW2 to my collection to go with my special edition of the original.
Will alan wake 2 ever be on steam
Are you considering realease a physical version? Please say you will think about it!
Can we get Physical Release?
You guys can downvote my other comment as much as you want, but I have been a fan of Alan Wake, and Max Payne before that, for two decades. This question deserves an answer:

&#x200B;

When is Alan Wake 2 coming to Steam?
    That answer is not going to come from three devs that have no input on the business dealings between Epic and Remedy. It’s really amazing how difficult this concept is for some people. Epic paid to have this game developed and released on their platform. They are the reason AW2 exists. If you don’t want to play it on the Epic launcher, that’s too bad. Remedy is not looking at your comment and thinking “Nah, he doesn’t deserve an answer,” because they have already given one. Right now, there are no plans to release AW2 on Steam. They’ve reiterated this time and again. If that ever changes, believe there will be an announcement.
Is this game ever coming to steam
Why was your game so boring?
[removed]
    [removed]
    Exactly what I thought.
        What did they say?
    you have pronouns too honey <3
        Yeah, they're fuck/you
            "ohhhh I'm so edgy I hate a standard grammatical practice that has been around forever"
I used to like you guys, but then you didn't do a physical release of AW2. Why?
Why is the game so poorly optimized on PC?
I mean, it stutters even on 4090s!
    It's gotten better with more recent updates. The game isn't badly optimized, it just really is that demanding.
When are y’all restocking the thermos?
Barry! Where's Barry?
    Stop! Don't open that door!
    He's our old partner, yanno
    I'd love to see an interaction between Barry and Ahti.
        Barry: ‘Ok Al, who the hell is this guy? he just keeps showing up out of nowhere and-‘
Alan:Barry Barry, calm down, he’s uhh, a friend.
Ahti: Right you are Tom, Never burn bridges, cause who knows when you’ll need to cross again.
    Well, i'm sorry but he's probably....
    it was me Barry!
This needs answering above all others for real. The world needs to know.
We want Barry! We want him fat! We want him wearing red! and we want him covered in Christmas lights!
    Well tbh seems he's gonna be skinny, which imo is goof. If he's skinny that means they can use his original actor still instead of needing to recast to account for live action scenes (which is why others like Nightingale, Mulligan and Thornton were recast)
        Well, I wouldn't want him to be recast. But Alan's voice and live action are different actors, so maybe they would do the same thing for Barry? I remember he said he lost weight, but that was also in the email where he was talking about being in the cult thing, so idk how honest he was being with either Alice or himself.
            Yea they do it with Alan and Casey but that's a whole hassle and not the easiest. Having to hire two separate actors to play one character and then having their movements and lip-syncing all match isn't that easy, they do it for Alan cause he's the main character, and it works for Casey cause Sam Lake is already working on the game and James McCaffrey was his friend, but for others it's more difficult. I like to believe Barry was telling the truth, he did lose weight and he genuinely doesn't realize it's an actual cult. As long as we keep Fred Berman I'm happy
        I am getting the feeling that him losing weight is part of him potentially being indoctrinated by blessed and setting him up for either needing saving or some dramatic tension, I’m HERE for that. Barry saved us, let’s go save him back <3 bestfriend hours
THIS! The people have spoken! 🙌
Im sure hell be back. Is baited on the deerfests, by pat maine. If u stay there for a bit he talks about barry. Also we still need to see the meaning of the christmas lights, the return of the savior. Its on the quantum break board.
    Recently played Quantum Break for the first time directly after finishing Alan Wake 2. I took so many screenshots and studied the hell out of that board and still im noticing new things when I go back to it
THIS MUST BE ANSWERED
We need Barry !
This!!
Exactly ! Where is Barry ? 🥹
Barry will come back as part of a paracriminal organization
    It was so satisfying to read Barry's emails to Alice after having just played Control and read every collectible so I could see the name Blessed and go, "Oh no"
    I think you're right, considering the emails. This will either be really funny or really sad or both.
I remember that in American Nightmare we learn that Barry is in charge of producing the new Old Gods songs and he's the one adding the synths that we hear in the tracks, we learn that from a radio show where he and the Old Gods are interviewed (although it may all just be part of his dream at the motel, so canon status is unknown). I actually wished for Barry to get credited in the booklet of the CD of Rebirth - Greatest Hits that I got, the same way the message from the Old Gods was "in universe" and talking of what happened inside the lore of the games (finding old tapes from the 70s, etc). But nope, no mention of Barry. Well, American Nightmare might be too obscure. But we do know that he became the manager of the Old Gods and the tour manager during their (apparently cancelled) comeback/"goodbye" tour (confirmed in Alan Wake 2).
Seconding this. With all the excitement around AW2 in December, getting that news was such a shock 😢
    I legit was playing the game for a second run and had just met Casey for the first time as Alan when I got the news. Being a long time fan of Max Payne I was devastated, had to quit the game for a while.
        I was replaying control the day he passed. Looked up the subreddit for a guide cuz I git stuck on a part and saw the news
            He did trench’s voice too right?
                Yes plus he was The Bright Presence (Thomas Zane/The Diver) in AW1
I'm sad this wasn't replied to 😭
Exactly what I wanted to ask
I’m assuming they’ll just reuse his audio from the first two games and maybe use some AI shit to make it better quality. I doubt it’ll affect the remakes too much. But it’s terribly sad.
    I would be disappointed beyond words if Remedy of all companies uses AI. They're better than that.
        Might get downvoted for this but I'm genuinely interested why?
            Because Remedy have been all about the art for 30ish years. I'd hope if they wanted to bring the character back, they'd recast rather than engage the Plagiarism Engine.
Would absolutely love the Kalevala Knights jacket from towards the end of the game as a permanent unlock
    I would love more cosmetic options for sure
And the American Nightmare one too!!
I don't have many complaints about the game.  One of them is the lack of customization.  If there's a menu, I'd hope to see more than one option lol
    This
YESSS PLEASE DO THIS
PLEASE
This is one of my biggest wants for the game. If you’re not planning on adding the skin, then please consider it.
I know people are nostalgic for it but that outfit had to go. He had like 4 layers on. No wonder he couldn't run.
    Alan spends most of his time at the bottom of a lake, that's gotta be hella cold

And it's not like he runs much faster in AW2, at most it's just a light jog
hoenstly this, I always wondered where Alan's OG Jacket went. I assume its pretty cold in the Dark Place considering its a lake and all.
    It’s not a lake, it’s an ocean.
        He set em up, and you knocked em down
        A lake that's not a lake
Absolutely. Was so disappointed to see it gone and Alan wearing some suit.
**JOHN**: For Saga's Sweater, I worked along side the directors to create the initial concept which had the sweaters overall look with her outfits, colour and feel. Then Minttu Wikberg from Pawlymade collaborated to create the knit design along side the directors and myself. The deer is Saga’s spirit animal we wanted that to be part of her sweater. It's also a major theme for her in the Mind Place, for Alan it is the owl. We also took inspiration from the Nordics with the trees and wildlife flowing and wrapping around the sweater. You can noticed the sprunce trees which create a wrapping depth/perspective in the sweater design. It also creates a link to Saga's family and Sweden.[ I will also be at GDC doing a deep dive into the sweater](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-art-of-characters-in-alan-wake-2-character-outfit-creation-process/900049) ;)
dang inability to correctly parse homophones.  WAIT.  I am so sorry.
    Nah… some of those plot elements *are* pretty heavy, so I’d argue it’s a perfect choice of words :)
I love how you added a trophy for shooting that creepy coffee cutout, as pretty much everyone was going to.
    Me, without the achievement because I verify my target before shooting.
        It was the last one I needed and actually had to look it up because I don’t waste ammo in a survival horror game.
    That was my last achievement.... I had to actively try to figure out what I missed...
    I didn't think about doing that now I gotta go back to coffee world thanks for the unintentional heads up.
    That is the only trophy I missed in the game lol. I was hoarding bullets like my life depended on it. I did scream at that moment though.
    First time I saw it I said to myself “there is going to be a trophy if I shoot this.”  Then I did and DING.
**MARKO**: Yeah it is! That very sandwich happens to be one of those premade gas station delicacies that are inherently rather bad or even shitty some may say.

**NATHALIE**: You can thank fellow mission designer Admir Burnić for any discomfort caused by the creepy laughing coffee pot. As soon as he saw Mr. Drippy and his creepy smile, he got the idea to make it say something to the player as they'd approach. He notes his inspiration was the Holle Bolle Gijs character in the Efteling, a Dutch amusement park. He felt it would fit the atmosphere of the park, and I think he was right on the money! The final result is an interplay of multiple crafts coming together, and creating something memorable!
Lol I can't with that one. A coffee-themed amusement park is probably the most Finnish invention ever.
We started using this whenever things go wrong “shitty pastrami sandwich “ 😂
I don’t have a question either (the ones asked thus far surpass anything I could come up with!) but I’ll latch on to this comment to say: I didn’t play AW1 prior. I enjoyed Control and that intro to the universe but had zero expectations for this other than, “hey AW2 looks like it’s getting good reviews and I like survival horror.” 

It’s since become one of my favorite games of all time (and I go back to the Atari/NES/etc. era.) The style, story, actual horror elements, clever interplay (and technology) linking live action to gameplay, seamless transition to the mind place(s), etc etc etc. Just an absolutely wonderful job. And of course We Sing! was a complete home run.

I can’t think of a game I’ve tried spreading word about more than this, or a game soundtrack that has latched on to my brain to this extent. Congratulations on this excellent work of art.
In the short term, unfortunately no. We have been approached by several groups wanting to make either an Alan Wake 2 documentary or one about Remedy, we’ve just ended up saying no. 

The reasons are rather mundane. We simply don’t have enough people to look after a production like this, and then there are always some fears about how a documentary would make us look. 

Do we want to show off the very normal chaos that is making games at Remedy? (lol) Is it actually a good use of our very limited time? So it just ends up that we think about it a lot, want to do a documentary and then end up saying no for the aforementioned reasons.
would love to see this, tho they did release a small doc of 7 minutes behind the scene a few days ago
I would absolutely die of happiness if they were able to make something like Double Fine's "Psych Odyssey"
    Psychodyssey was so good, it was really interesting to see the good and bad of developing a game. I'd love to see Remedy do something like that.
I've said this ad nauseum as well.

Those documentaries really shed light on game development, how the industry admires the games that are put forth, the pressure of making a AAA game that can make or break a studio, seeing the devs/directors/actors in their groove fine tuning details that no one will notice, etc.
I could see them being like : “yes but it will be through a 40 minute long interpretative dance and gong bath”
wow i would looove this!
Will they show us the herald of darkness?
    Is Remedy lost in a never ending night?
        I think they're diving deep to the surface.
            🎶And all your stories of crime and chilling thrillers
of hardboiled killers became bestsellers🎶
                Does the award go to... Alan Wake?
                    Yes, but it was all too much, he had to get away.
        Are they diving deep to the surface?
            Did their mamas give them a magic clicker?
    Are you lost in a neverending niiiiiight?
        Nah, I'm just taking a dive intk the surface!
Thank you so much. That honestly means such a lot to the team. Alan Wake 2 was such a labour of love, and it's been truly humbling and just incredible to see how well it's been received. <3
Well I think that FBC have some plans for Alan...
    I could only imagine what they would do to him.
        Yeah...look at what happened to Hartman.
            That was also because the hiss to I think. Hopefully by time AW2 happens I hope Jessie cleared out the hiss so they are at least contained somewhere or just completely eradicated. So hopefully estevez in Wake aren't in for a wild surprise that they can't enter the building with it on lockdown.
Have you played CONTROL's AWE DLC?
    I did, I meant interacting with each other face to face, in the awe dlc she doesnt physically interacts with him
Also, can we have the meeting present in both their games? Like in the DLC Alan meets Jesse and they talk or whatever, and in Control 2 as Jesse while we play we have to meet Alan and then we connect the dots on things we missed as Alan.
**NATHALIE**: The Dark Presence chase sequences usually build on level knowledge that we've given players earlier in a mission. For example, in Initiation 2 the chase was designed in such a way that the player would end up in front of a Break Room, knowing they'd be safe there. This gives the player a clear goal and plan of escape. Furthermore, at the start of a chase, we try to clearly frame where the player should run to, and which areas are unavailable. You could use multiple avenues for this, from a collapsed roof and environmental destruction in Initiation 5 and Return 8, to a blocked path in Initiation 2. The use of destruction was a wonderful tool. It helped sell the power of the Dark Presence thematically, while allowing designers a creative avenue to herd the player.

One thing that was crucial in these Chase sequences was giving the player the feeling that they could only barely outrun the Dark Presence. Its speed was always adjusted to be slower when players were impacted by environmental changes (such as blocked paths) to give them more time to form new strategies, and afterward the speed would be ramped up again. This process of the player readjusting and finding a new way through would go faster if the player had all necessary visual cues in view at the start of the chase (Initiation 2), and slower when these traversal clues appeared mid-chase (such as in Initiation 5 when the Dark Presence appeared in front of the player). 

There were also important audio components to this. During the chase sequences, we wanted to maintain forward momentum and not have the player turn around to check if the Dark Presence was still following. So having this insistent, dreadful sound bombarding the player's senses was crucial to selling the experience. This was another reason to adjust the speed and maintain a tight distance when we knew the player could probably handle it.

As for the layout, most chase locations could be set up in a quite linear way. Initiation 2 was framed around the corridor-like subway car, Initiation 5 benefited greatly from the hotel layout which was made up of multiple corridors, and Return 8 was set in the Wellness Center, a place that players knew from Return 5 and which was adjusted through environmental changes to become more linear. Speaking of linearity, the initial design for the Dark Presence chases actually started out less linear. However, user testing showed that players had trouble navigating these, so in every iteration they were made to be more focused and scripted. It turns out that having more available routes wasn't more interesting or engaging, they instead led to more confusion.

I've been fortunate to work on a few iterations on the Dark Presence chase in Return 8 but not the others, so my thanks to fellow mission designers Dimitri Giacoletto and Admir Burnić for sharing some of their experiences with me!
this is a fun question!
it was already planned at least as early as the short film they did in quantum break
    Elaborate? I played QB but don’t recall this, thx
        there's A LOT of element in this short film from 7 years ago that is in the game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDNGoVKfDw
            How IN THE HELL am I only seeing this now? Thanks for this dude!
                Because it plays at the start of the game as you’re making your way through the walking sim section at the entrance to the campus. 

It’s on a TV in game and you have to be close to hear it. My first playthrough I caught by complete accident cause I heard the “it’s not a lake, it’s an ocean” comment and got caught off guard. 
In the original Alan Wake, it was planned to have you play half the game as an FBI agent (most likely nightingale).
I think they just got around to using that idea now.
**MARKO**: Getting the combat work in We Sing took a lot of time. We knew that we wanted to introduce Alan's iconic Flare Gun to players at this stage, it was a conscious choice further feeding into the power fantasy moment, it was important to give player a breather from the survival horror loop and allow them to just enjoy the ride and blast away.
    It definitely worked! The moment you pick up the flare gun in the middle of all the awesome chaos it's like yeahhh baby flare gun time come on Alan this is your time to shine. SO MUCH FUN!! Thanks for answering <3
    This was one of the greatest levels/sequences in video game history imo. Kudos to the team, AW2 is now one of my all time favorite games
That sequence literally dropped my jaw. It was so fun, engaging, and interesting. Loved it so much.
I hope this gets answered as I’m also super interested! There’s some info about their process in this video https://youtu.be/0F2Vf8P6bXM?si=Gzx9nLaS-VijSVpe
**JOHN**: Definitely Saga I enjoyed designing her outfit and modelling her entire character.

**MARKO**: Plot Board. Giving players access to Alan's most powerful ability: developing and rewriting stories that will alter the very reality. 

**NATHALIE**: The Cauldron Lake missions hold a special place in my heart (notably Return 2: The Heart), having mostly worked in that hub throughout my time on the project. I did also really enjoy Return 5: Old Gods for its characters, mission pacing, and story reveals. Though I have to say Initiation 4: We Sing takes the cake. It's such a triumph of bold, creative decision-making, and a testament to what Remedy as a studio stands for. It's incredible that resources were allocated to developing a musical level that so many people worldwide can connect to. I know of many colleagues who similarly haven't worked on it that spent hours watching streamers playing it, and cheering the players and developers involved in making it on.
    Thanks for replying! I really enjoyed Saga as a character, and loved learning about how the sweater came to be in another reply. The Plot Board was fun and now I want my office to look like that... Best I can do is use scrivener I guess. We Sing was so unexpected and a ton of fun, and I can't wait to play through it very soon in my latest replay! Thanks again for your work on the game and hope to see the DLCs soon!
    The Heart was one of the most memorable missions I've played in video games ever, tied with We Sing. Thanks for helping make them!
**JOHN**: Ilkka Villi is the most handsome man in Finland, with such a strong foundation he made my job easy :D And to be honest, he's got amazing hair. And he can grow a fantastic, luscious beard. That combination of beard and hair? Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
**NATHALIE**: Throughout development we've had frequent check-ins between narrative and mission design to ensure we were working along a shared vision. The writing/narrative department would provide an outline highlighting the key story/character beats we'd need to hit. Mission designers would pitch a proposal to weave these into a mission, and iterations would be made on either side if needed. This process would go back-and-forth until we were all happy with the direction. Both departments truly wanted to make this whole experience shine and were flexible in making it work, so while design challenges could be tricky, there was confidence and trust in knowing we'd tackle them together. 

I think one of my favorite moments where gameplay and narrative came together was in Return 9: Come Home's Mind Place sequence.

If you have a chance to check it out, our lead mission designer on the project, Anne-Marie Grönroos, will give an in-depth talk on [developing Alan Wake 2's mission structures at GDC 2024](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/level-design-summit-the-player-vs-dream-logic-developing-the-mission-structures-for-alan-wake-2/902362).
    Thank you so much for the response! I'll be checking that talk out!
Every time you reach the Parliament Tower, the apartment is different in AW2 iirc. Dream logic and all...
I think it must just be being changed by the dark place. Every time you visit, the vague layout is the same but the location of the lift and the locked spiral door are different in all 3 versions. If I had to guess why, I'd say that it's probably because the apartment we see isn't actually based off the real apartment, just Alan's memory of it. He hasn't been there in 13 years, and the dark place has caused him drastic memory problems, which is why the apartment seems slightly off and the layout keeps changing. If you think of a place you frequently visited 10 years ago, you'll probably get some details right but it won't be an exact replication
I’m no dev but I would guess it’s technical advancement and gameplay driven
    Doesn’t the apartment change in different points of the game?
    But the apartment in AW1 was much more visually appealing. A graphically updated version of that would have been far better looking, so the technical argument wouldn't really make sense.
    this
Because is not the same apartment, it is a manifestation of that in the dark place.
    Turns out that rent is much cheaper in The Dark Place than the real NYC. Rates aren't what they were 13 years ago. /s
I thought it was her new place, after Alan disappeared
    When Alan walks in, he sees the spiral door and says "this was where I wrote my books"
Please, let's not insist on canon explanations for meta shit that doesn't need it.  This is how we got Thomas Zane calling Darling "swole" and mentioning his voice similarity multiple times.   It's cringe, it's immersion breaking, it's unnecessary.   IMHO.
Speak for yourself man, I'm ready to join the Cult of the Word
**JOHN**: She's so well trained she doesn't need them... but we wanted to do that but for scope reasons we didn't.
THIS
    EXCACTLY !
we dont even know about dlc, i doubt we know anything about AW3, they are working on control 2 and multiplayer and new ip before
    Oh yeah forsure im not expecting any kind of details I just wanna know if its even on their radar or part of their future plans
    And Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes!

Remedy are BUSY
        Max Wake 4: Take Control
    What do you mean we don’t know about DLC? Remedy already confirmed 2 and even named them already.
This is an AMA with gameplay lead, mission designer, and character artist, I doubt any of them would be allowed to say anything about about this no matter the answer lol.
**JOHN**: For Alan: We wanted to make him cool, but also we wanted to bring in "bookish" aspects to show that he is not an action hero. A "college professor" reference. Because of the 3rd person view, we wanted something that is visible in the camera. We explored something in the back, but it all felt forced. Elbow patches felt like a perfect, unique idea, part of his uniform.
I would love merch. What about movie posters? A Tom the Poet poster would be cool.
    Yöton yö and ahti & the janitors merch would be cool too 😁
**JOHN**: One of the biggest challenges during the production was handling how manage the production remotely with actors during the pandemic. We had to develop new tech and production strategies to navigate around the remote setup. Seeing the game come together has been an awesome experience and seeing the fans really dig into the meta.

**MARKO**: To have the team to change their mindset from action to survival horror gameplay. Cinematic fast-paced action is deeply rooted in the Remedy DNA and to bring and adapt this know-how into survival horror was a huge undertaking. The previous title I shipped was an action RPG, so it took some time for me to re-orientate myself towards the core game pillars of Alan Wake 2 but being an survival horror game enthusiast definitely helped with the transition. The feeling of seeing it all click into place is simply fantastic - a feeling that never gets old and something not to be taken for granted.

**NATHALIE**: This project came with many exciting challenges! There is so much depth to Alan Wake's narrative and themes, and desperately wanting to do those justice when working on the mission design (for example, Overlaps and dream logic). When pitching any kind of mission design, feelings or intentions can be difficult to put into words, and what one person understands to be "tense" or "hopeful" could mean something else to another. Working on a shared terminology when designing a mission and the player's journey was a challenge, but one we got better and better at. Playable sections and reference material can help establish this terminology.

Another one is horror design, which can be tricky to plan for. There is a high-level, theoretical part to it, where we try to manage the player's intended tension levels throughout the various mission beats. However, it's different having those playable in a rough state and deciding whether they actually worked out, especially when so much of selling horror is through audio and lighting which usually come in slightly later in the development process. Having enough time to iterate and adjust is crucial here, so you can finetune these beats until it feels right."
or hitching a ride with her relatives as they literally drive past her lol
I enjoyed that solo journey to the lake. Chopper overhead, truck rampaging down the woods and then all the gear set up as I approached.

I guess it wouldn’t have had quite the same impact for me personally if I arrived to an empty lake and the scene cut to everything in place.
    I'm just saying they could have at least offered her a ride!
I thought about that too lmao
I feel like it really echoed AW1 with the whole "meet me there" sequence to the power plant and then the dam - at least the helicopter didn't crash this time
Exactly. I really miss those things.
**MARKO** (as the Finnish spokesperson of this AMA): Coming from such a miniscule country as Finland and getting positive recognition always makes me smile a bit. But just a bit, never too much. The game draws from Finnish culture and folklore with confidence, our habits and customs that some may consider quirky and exotic is just business as usual to us. Going all in regarding our cultural identity and seamlessly having it as an integral part of the experience has been met with such a positive response out in the world. Koskela adds being oftentimes highlighted as a comedic relif in the midst of all horror. Bringing out such specialities like the concept of "kalsarikänni" in one of the adds is rather humorous but also a bit sad if you ask from anybody else than a Finn.

Koskela adds are absolutely my favorite ones. However as humorous as they are, the "Return" review hits pretty hard - Finnish melancholy at its finest.
    Thanks for the response! You are so right about the Koskela ads hilarious and one of the more serious moments, they add so much to the game through their limited inclusion.
I wanted to add, while I don't know much about Finnish culture, I loved the decision to instill so much Finnishness into the game because of how it helps Alan Wake II stand out among other games. Can you talk about the decision to give Alan Wake II such strong Finnish vibes? Of course, I know Remedy is based in Finland, but I am nevertheless curious because it feels like such a deliberate decision.
**JOHN**: For her hair we spent a lot of time working on different styles that would fit her character and feel grounded for the impression on screen but also for her role. I also worked with hair stylists to style Melanie's hair, we used a hair double to test out styles to see how the hair reacts and how the hair flows and moves. We wanted to create a style that had some secondary movement on screen so as you play as Saga the hair would have some movement creating some interesting gameplay visuals. When creating the in game hair, we spent a lot of time iterating on the hair strands themselves to get them as close to Melanie's hair as possible and then the styling process to manipulate those strands into the hair style you see.
    SUPER appreciated this! I kept marveling about her hair to anyone who would listen lol
White male here and I ❤️ Saga so so much as a playable character, just stunningly beautiful, loved Melanie Liburd’s voice work, love those sweaters, love her mysterious backstory and lineage. A Jesse / Saga teamup someday would be so incredibly lit. 🔥
I hope Alan gets to use his third eye like a new Flaming Eye of Mordor.
A poet. or uhhh a filmmaker i think. one of the two
What is Tom Zane?
    When is Tom Zane?
        Why is Tom Zane?
            How is Tom Zane?
**JOHN**: I'm a Starbucks Macchiato kinda guy. It might not be the greatest but I love it.. Also still miss Tim Hortons (facepalm)

**MARKO**: Italian Roast. Only low-fat milk (yes, one cannot enjoy life too much) when doing dairy-topped drinks. No sugar, life itself is sweet enough.

**NATHALIE**: I usually opt for light roast coffee, no sugar or milk (though I enjoy the signature dark roast "Bright Falls Blend" too!) or a cappuccino. In the weekends I like to treat myself. A large seasonally-flavored latte with all the extras. "How much sugar?" Yes. "How much whipped cream?" Also yes.
Ilkka is a handsome man. Looks better with the beard though.
    i wasnt complaining and yes
**JOHN**: I love Barry...

**MARKO**: Absolutely Cynthia. A truly tragical character arc. Forcing Saga to confront her just sealed the deal for me. To me she'll always be The Lady of the Light.

**NATHALIE**: I think it has to be Rose. Because she's bright and positive and a little bit unhinged (in the most relatable way). I think we would be friends and discuss fanfiction all day, every day.
    Great choices all round 😁
I think end of spring then in October
I'm not from Remedy (sadly, lol), but they've said they were also inspired by True Detective season 1.
**NATHALIE**: I've enjoyed locations that were character-driven, or had good opportunities for horror sequences. Cauldron Lake and its Overlap fortunately provided plenty of that!

**MARKO**: Originally in the paper design phase the Flashlight had a concept of Components and Mods, essentially the building blocks forming the Flashlight. Player was able to tailor the Flashlight's properties to complement their playstyle, even drastically change its behavior - both in combat and in exploration. As tempting as this concept was in terms of an gameplay ingredient, we simply could not see our characters finding these components and believably tinkering modifying the Flashlight. It just did not make any sense narratively and the idea was scrapped. Furthermore as the overall combat choreography evolved, it became apparent that there was no room to modify the Flashlight with such granularity - it would have pulled players away from the experience, rather than adding anything substantial to it.

**JOHN**: Visually Definitely Fargo was a big inspiration try to create quirky characters.
    If I can have some Follow up questions answered?

* Nathalie - What was the hardest part of making Alan's Initiation part in the Oceanview? 

 * Additionally; Which part of the game, when being made where you unsure of, but when completed really reinforced "this was a good idea!"?

* Marko: Thanks! It's cool to know there might have been a mechanic - but I agree that it probably would've taken from the game. I have a new question now:

 * When was the decision to make the save locations, a physical thermos in a safe zone? Additionally; When the game was being play-tested, what were some of the funniest game-breaking bugs you heard of / saw?

* John: What about Agent Nightingale? Secondly, which character do you think had the most work done on them - who changed the most from conception to final product?
The Final Draft was what they were talking about. Night Springs and Lake House DLC are paid DLCs.
    What he said was in addition to Night Springs and Lake House. Final Draft can be one, but he still said the statement as plural, and “pretty significant” at that. I wouldn’t count updates like Chapter Select, and unless Photo Mode has a story tie in, I wouldn’t consider that either.
**JOHN**: It's a honor and a privilege. I feel lucky.

**MARKO**: Working in game industry in general is a high pressure environment as your work is often exposed to both internal and external scrutiny throughout the course of development. This is just something you need to be comfortable with, as long as people are respectful and interact with you in a civilised manner. Our community is just like that: respectful and rather mature. Having said that, the pressure was high and tangible as first Alan Wake enjoys cult status, the sequel had to bring everything to a higher standard and leave people flabbergasted - easy right... but a privilege. There were few times when the pressure to deliver was through the roof and we were not "there" yet, that did challenge my stoicism but during those moments I had my better half there beside me, helping correcting the course.

**NATHALIE**: It felt incredibly special and also hard to grasp. Alan Wake was very important to me, and I have treasured memories about sharing that game with the people I care for and theorizing on what it all meant together! To work on a sequel is a dream come true, but also put some pressure on it because you want to do it justice for all the other fans out there.
    Thank you all for responding. And thank you all for making my game of the year. Really think you all did a great job living up to the legacy and were able to expand and grow the Alan Wake universe. Can’t wait to see where it goes from here.
**NATHALIE**: Thank you for your kind words!

The Pacific Northwest mirrored similar themes as the Dark Place through the shared murder sites and matching boss encounters. For example, in Return 2's Overlap, the final "blended" live-action video depicted a Subway tunnel, and was laid on top of the rock tunnel towards Nightingale. Both of these shots (Overlap and Subway) had a similarly central corridor focal point. Similarly, when you would find Nightingale in Initiation 2, a video depicting Cauldron Lake's tall trees was brought in to match the tall concrete pillars around the site. In this way, both the Pacific Northwest and the Dark Place mirrored each other.

We discussed between various crafts where we could create nicely framed locations to serve as a canvas for these videos, to emphasize the mirroring as much as we could. Usually we were fortunate to have enough available material to choose from, and could iterate on its contents through the video content, VFX, level design and environment art, to facilitate a good match.
**JOHN**: Yeah, my mum is in the game \\o/ also other dev members were scanned and put in game. I try my hardest to get as many in as possible within the range of scope.

**NATHALIE**: We have quite a few people in the game! Some of us are immortalized in Suomi Hall with very Nordic names, others are Coffee World employees, and some are featured in various narrative items!

We cast people to do the handwriting for specific characters internally, and my handwriting was selected to represent Rose. I adore Rose, so being able to convey her personality through handwritten notes was an absolute joy. Her positivity was infectious, especially when having a rough day. Some of these handwritten notes were put up around the office by her writer Clay Murphy, as we could all use her friendly support after all. <3
    Wow! Rose's positive handwritten notes are one of my favourite parts of the game, adding a touch of coziness to an otherwise scary experience! You have beautiful handwriting!
    I thought Rose was such an excellent addition in AW2 as well. I played the original AW before jumping into 2, it was great to see her appear in most chapters here.
**MARKO**: The key decision allowing us to have satisfactory control over resourcing was to go with a fully dynamic resource dispensing system, providing players the opportunities to acquire resources based on a set of rules like the player's inventory status, story progression, game difficulty etc. The hardest part indeed was to get the balancing to represent the intended survival horror experience: to have players minding their resources at all times, never getting too comfortable with what they had in their inventory. Due to game production realities a proper resource balancing effort may happen rather late in the project, as doing a holistic balancing pass requires long uninterrupted playthrough sessions simulating different styles of play in order to get a solid sampling of how well the system holds in the grand scheme of things. All this took numerous hours of both internal and external playtesting and yours truly playing the game and tuning the resourcing based on those findings. Naturally the high-level goals for the item distribution rules has to be oftentimes locked way before even all gameplay systems and mission beats are in place but the real balancing effort happens when you are playing the experience - you always need to define the baseline rules well in advance but to know if it feels good/right, there's really no other way than to play the experience over and over again.
Please give us the option to change Saga's jacket back to the FBI one in NG+ 😭
**JOHN**: Great question Pgull753, Sam Lake and all the directors gave critical feedback and direction to create strong tie to these inspirations. Having worked with Janne, Sam and Kyle in the past I already had an expectation of the production and how things would flow, this made the production process really enjoyable.
I also need to know this
They don't have the IP
If you haven't seen Twin Peaks it is a massive inspiration.
**JOHN**: The most challenging thing is trying to fit as much quality across all the characters as possible. Likely you always have to make some quality choices especially for NPC's but I try my hardest to make the quality as even across all assets as possible.

**MARKO**: As mundane as this may sound the most challenging part to me as a gameplay lead was not the creative process itself but to manage the constant context switching and finding time to do implementation level work. On the other hand I got to experience this game production through a completely different lens and to have the possibility to work with hundreds of people from various crafts is always fun and ensuring there was never a dull moment.

**NATHALIE**: I've answered this one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1ay2b2o/comment/kseelau/)!
**NATHALIE**: Lead mission designer Anne-Marie Grönroos worked on the design of We Sing so I asked her what her process was like.

There was an early version of the Herald of Darkness song and lyrics available, which she used as a foundation to build the gameplay beats onto. The song summarizes Alan's life, starting with his childhood, rise to fame, Bright Falls, and being trapped in the Dark Place. The song was divided into these four sections already in that early draft of the lyrics, but they didn't always suggest relevant gameplay beats. So in those cases the gameplay beats were designed first and the lyrics got adjusted to match that.

The point of We Sing was to recap the first game, which it does, but it's also a mini mirror of Wake trying to escape the Dark Place. So, on top of the narrative theme, she dedicated each section to a different gameplay concept (fake enemies in the first part, shadow enemies in the second part, Bright Falls style combat in the third part, Plot Board in the fourth part; more or less in the same order they're introduced in the actual Dark Place), which provided a clear focus for each section.
**NATHALIE**: We do have people on the team who can't handle scares and indeed, they were nice to test with! However, the ultimate challenge was in scaring the usually unfazed too. The early versions of horror sequences were playtested internally, but their effectiveness was sometimes hard to judge without final audio, lighting, VFX, etc. When they were a bit more developed we playtested more and more with people outside of the team and external playtesters as well. 

Our User Research team was crucial in this process. We kept a close eye on how players reacted to our horror sequences, in case something wasn't hitting the tone correctly. We were pretty happy if most people got some thrill out of it, as horror is so subjective and it might never resonate with everyone.

While I love horror and worked on multiple horror sequences, I have to admit they sometimes scared me too. I've yelped multiple times while testing something and it having slipped my mind there would be a scare somewhere. I took that as a good sign!
**JOHN**: I enjoyed the process of designing characters with Cosplay in mind for the fans, so for any future characters I want to focus on how we can build more iconic and colorful characters.

**MARKO**: To always strive to the parity between gameplay and narrative. One of the biggest high-level achievements for us was to succesfully glue the narrative and gameplay together into a cohesive packgage. This was one of the core game pillars but following it through across the development was not an easy feat.

**NATHALIE**: This project really drove home the fact that there is a magic in having everyone's expertise in their craft come together, and the outcome of that being so much better than you could imagine by yourself. A great team with mutual trust will provide a solid backbone for development. It inspires confidence that things will end up alright, and that we'll tackle challenges one way or another. Facilitating each other to thrive is something I'd love to take forward in any future project.
**MARKO**: The wolf being our first ever quadruped character with an AI did have some growing pains. My favorite one was a situation where the wolf frantically paced back and forth at the trailer park, occasionally barging through doors entering the trailers - just ignoring the player.

**NATHALIE**: We had a bug where dead bodies would spin around in place. It took you out of the mood, especially during horror design.
**NATHALIE**: In the Dark Place the danger is lingering and ever-present, whereas in the Pacific Northwest there is more of an ebb and flow. Playing the Dark Place for long sections of time can be a bit draining as it's interesting and engaging but also quite intense. In the Pacific Northwest playing as Saga we incentivize players more to go off the beaten path. The Dark Place is dangerous in comparison, and it's a high stakes decision to step off the main path there because you never know what's around the corner. Saga's sections act as a bit of a breather, done through slightly lower stakes exploration, various points of interest, and comedic relief. Also, the lighting, audio, and overall mood help!
**MARKO**: There were plenty of challenges we surpassed but I do need to highlight the unsung hero of the player experience: character controller.

Our approach to have more realistic and claustrophobic combat spaces created the need to rethink how player character would control in our game - to have a character controller that enables smooth navigation in cramped, complex and dynamic environments. A significant effort was put to ensure fluent player movement at all times and this was definitely not an easy task to convey to the team and get to the finishing line. In the end it was worth the effort and in grand scheme of things the solutions the team created may benefit the future Remedy games as well.

[Here you can get a glimpse of the character controller in action.](https://vimeo.com/880838821)
**JOHN**: I created the concept for the Y-Fronts but I remember having a sync with Kyle Rowley (Game Director), Sam Lake (Creative Director) and Janne Pulkinnen (Art Director) on ideas and what we could. I just did a visual to get an idea of how it might look. So it was mostly a joint Y Fronts Adventure.
**MARKO**: One of our gameplay animation pillars regarding feel was physicality. Physicality comes with a premise which suit the game we were making: player actions are more deliberate, take more time to perform and at all times reflect the avatar you are controlling. Finding the sweet spot between grounded and believable movement/actions and the responsiveness was one of the toughest challenges for us. In addition to that introducing new camera aesthetics to further create the sense of uneasiness and vulnerability is the polar opposite of how you approach designing third person action game cameras. These are a tough sell to people who have spent most of their career working in action games.

I've been a fan of survival horror games since the original Alone in the Dark and I've always wanted to work on a horror game so it did not take too much of convincing for me to say yes to this opportunity. It was all about switching the design mindset from action to more methodical survival horror game loop but the motivation and desire to work on this genre was there right from the beginning. I believe you need to enjoy playing the games you are making to stay motivated as a designer and I gravitate towards projects that resonate with me both as a player and as a professional.
**MARKO**: Restricting player abilities and removing verticality definitely introduced a new set challenges for us. Control's confrontational always forward combat loop was switched with methodical cautiousness. Desperate combat being one of our key pillars, it meant player being able to barely survive with the given tools and push back in the last moment. It was about these moments of just barely making it and second-to-second decisions leading to that success. Enemy variety and encounter setups were crucial to keep things fresh and surprising to player - we strived to keep players at their toes, never fully allowing them getting too comfortable with the situations they were thrown in.
**JOHN**: Most of the quirky characters come from film or T.V. shows. I love Fargo and Twin Peaks these were a huge inspiration for me, and I know for many on the team. I try to get as much inspiration as possible from other great shows/film and apply that. I remember going through a library of new casted heads we wanted to put in the game which had more variety in terms of the personality types of the pacific northwest, it was a fun part of the process.
    Thank you so much for such a great response!
**JOHN**: So I'm a big fan of DBD.. I really enjoyed seeing them come to life in their universe and I've been playing a lot. The process is pretty much the same in terms of modelling the assets. We worked closely to maintain the likeness of the outfits and quality as much as possible. I'm really happy with how it all looks and plays.
I also want to know!
**JOHN**: Great question: for me the number one thing personally is I like to keep colours to a minimum of three so keep the colour scheme nice and simple that usually helps to create a nice identity for the character. Adobe color charts are great for calibrating colours. And a great silhouette always helps.
    Thank you for the reply!!


Silhouette and smartly-used, limited colours that help to create a strong identity. Got it :)
Seconding this.
**JOHN**: Designing Alan and Saga, it means alot to work with directors who are friends and I respect. And also that they trust me to deliver their vision.

**NATHALIE**: I'm proud of getting a chance to work on various horror sequences across the game, and my part of the work done on various Cauldron Lake missions. It's been such a great journey overall, and I'm glad I got to tackle so many different challenges.
**JOHN**: I have a full coffee press every morning so about 3 cups, then maybe 2 more before 2pm.. it might be too much

**MARKO**: Average six cups of fine coffee per day for me. Sunlight is not that much of a thing in Finland during winter, so my personal ray of light is usually a double espresso shot that jump starts my day.

The concept of Nursery Rhymes was created by our Game Director Kyle Rowley and Lead Mission Designer Anne-Marie Grönroos as one of the key exploration rewards for our players with strong narrative tie-ins to Control.
**JOHN**: Long story but in short I was a fine artist and somehow got into games through graphic design. I spent many years doing UI art before slowly learning 3d in my spare time and finally ending up as a character artist and never left.

**MARKO**: Before games industry I worked in telecommunications for quite some time. The people I worked with were fantastic but the job itself was "just" a job to me - I was not satisfied and wanted something more. I took a conscious risk, left it all behind and went back to school to study digital media, my goal was to combine the technical knowledge I already had and tap into the creative side if things. Gaming has been a passion to me since the late 80s and already in young age I found myself analysing games in desire to understand how they were made - retrospectively the notes are rather hilarious to read but you need to start from somewhere. During my studies I got a chance to apply to a design internship in a then well-known Helsinki based mobile studio and the rest is history. This is my sixteenth year in the industry and no regrets!

**NATHALIE**: I was torn between game development and psychology when choosing a degree to study. I knew there existed a beautiful marriage between both, but where to start? I ended up going to university to study psychology, and enjoyed human-computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics so much I specialized in a MSc in Applied Cognitive Psychology. To conclude my studies I started an internship at a serious games company as a cognitive psychologist. During that time I absolutely fell in love with the development process. I worked directly with developers consulting them on design decisions using my research findings, but I learned then I wanted to be even more thoroughly involved. I wanted to help build the games directly. So I enrolled in a BSc in International Game Architecture and Design which taught me the tools and gave me the experience I needed to apply at Remedy Entertainment! I fell in love with the company since the first Max Payne, so being able to work here is a dream come true.
**JOHN**: The main inspiration for Saga came from the directors for capturing her unique character.  For the outfit design when concepting Saga I took inspiration for the raincoat from shows like Dark. For her character and attitude characters like Stana Katic from Absentia and Miireille Enos rom The Killing were a good reference point. I was able alongside the directors to iterate many times to land on something special.
    Oh man being from the northwest Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman’s portrayal of their character felt exactly like everyone I ever grew up with in Washington state.
Yes. Yoton Yo on Spotify plz
I’ll do you one better… WHY is Mr. Door?
**MARKO**: Hostile Shadows hide amongst groups of Shadows. Shining the Flashlight on the enemy will reveal which one of them are hostile - pay close attention how the light interacts with the ones that are Hostile versus the ones that are mere Shadows.
Touch some grass
    Because if you disagree with inserting propaganda into video games, you haven’t been outside enough. Makes sense
        "Inserting propaganda"

Lmao
        Don't be shy. Do elaborate
    Have you ever gone out for a jog?
        Yep
            Do it again but just keep going
                Rough couple of days eh?
                    How do you figure? I’ve been busy lifting heavy, eating good with my lovely wife, and spreading democracy
                        Sure thing bub
Great question that will be purposefully ignored
    Garbage bad-faith question that is rightfully ignored
Two expansions: Night Springs and the Lake House.
That's easy. But also end? Lol. More like middle. Anyway, Taken see regular humans as Taken. That's why they attack. Note Nightingale was speaking (relatively) well, asking for help, the Bookers thought he was ranting incoherently and screaming.
    Wow! I didn't realize the AMA had already started and I got a reply from a Remedy rep! Thank you so much!
        That literally is the answer. Lol. Good luck though, I guess? Sorry for ruining your experience by responding with an answer.
That answer is not going to come from three devs that have no input on the business dealings between Epic and Remedy. It’s really amazing how difficult this concept is for some people. Epic paid to have this game developed and released on their platform. They are the reason AW2 exists. If you don’t want to play it on the Epic launcher, that’s too bad. Remedy is not looking at your comment and thinking “Nah, he doesn’t deserve an answer,” because they have already given one. Right now, there are no plans to release AW2 on Steam. They’ve reiterated this time and again. If that ever changes, believe there will be an announcement.

Exactly what I thought.
    What did they say?
you have pronouns too honey <3
    Yeah, they're fuck/you
        "ohhhh I'm so edgy I hate a standard grammatical practice that has been around forever"
It's gotten better with more recent updates. The game isn't badly optimized, it just really is that demanding.
Stop! Don't open that door!
He's our old partner, yanno
I'd love to see an interaction between Barry and Ahti.
    Barry: ‘Ok Al, who the hell is this guy? he just keeps showing up out of nowhere and-‘
Alan:Barry Barry, calm down, he’s uhh, a friend.
Ahti: Right you are Tom, Never burn bridges, cause who knows when you’ll need to cross again.
Well, i'm sorry but he's probably....
it was me Barry!
Well tbh seems he's gonna be skinny, which imo is goof. If he's skinny that means they can use his original actor still instead of needing to recast to account for live action scenes (which is why others like Nightingale, Mulligan and Thornton were recast)
    Well, I wouldn't want him to be recast. But Alan's voice and live action are different actors, so maybe they would do the same thing for Barry? I remember he said he lost weight, but that was also in the email where he was talking about being in the cult thing, so idk how honest he was being with either Alice or himself.
        Yea they do it with Alan and Casey but that's a whole hassle and not the easiest. Having to hire two separate actors to play one character and then having their movements and lip-syncing all match isn't that easy, they do it for Alan cause he's the main character, and it works for Casey cause Sam Lake is already working on the game and James McCaffrey was his friend, but for others it's more difficult. I like to believe Barry was telling the truth, he did lose weight and he genuinely doesn't realize it's an actual cult. As long as we keep Fred Berman I'm happy
    I am getting the feeling that him losing weight is part of him potentially being indoctrinated by blessed and setting him up for either needing saving or some dramatic tension, I’m HERE for that. Barry saved us, let’s go save him back <3 bestfriend hours
Recently played Quantum Break for the first time directly after finishing Alan Wake 2. I took so many screenshots and studied the hell out of that board and still im noticing new things when I go back to it
It was so satisfying to read Barry's emails to Alice after having just played Control and read every collectible so I could see the name Blessed and go, "Oh no"
I think you're right, considering the emails. This will either be really funny or really sad or both.
I legit was playing the game for a second run and had just met Casey for the first time as Alan when I got the news. Being a long time fan of Max Payne I was devastated, had to quit the game for a while.
    I was replaying control the day he passed. Looked up the subreddit for a guide cuz I git stuck on a part and saw the news
        He did trench’s voice too right?
            Yes plus he was The Bright Presence (Thomas Zane/The Diver) in AW1
I would be disappointed beyond words if Remedy of all companies uses AI. They're better than that.
    Might get downvoted for this but I'm genuinely interested why?
        Because Remedy have been all about the art for 30ish years. I'd hope if they wanted to bring the character back, they'd recast rather than engage the Plagiarism Engine.
I would love more cosmetic options for sure
This
Alan spends most of his time at the bottom of a lake, that's gotta be hella cold

And it's not like he runs much faster in AW2, at most it's just a light jog
It’s not a lake, it’s an ocean.
    He set em up, and you knocked em down
    A lake that's not a lake
Nah… some of those plot elements *are* pretty heavy, so I’d argue it’s a perfect choice of words :)
Me, without the achievement because I verify my target before shooting.
    It was the last one I needed and actually had to look it up because I don’t waste ammo in a survival horror game.
That was my last achievement.... I had to actively try to figure out what I missed...
I didn't think about doing that now I gotta go back to coffee world thanks for the unintentional heads up.
That is the only trophy I missed in the game lol. I was hoarding bullets like my life depended on it. I did scream at that moment though.
First time I saw it I said to myself “there is going to be a trophy if I shoot this.”  Then I did and DING.
Psychodyssey was so good, it was really interesting to see the good and bad of developing a game. I'd love to see Remedy do something like that.
Is Remedy lost in a never ending night?
    I think they're diving deep to the surface.
        🎶And all your stories of crime and chilling thrillers
of hardboiled killers became bestsellers🎶
            Does the award go to... Alan Wake?
                Yes, but it was all too much, he had to get away.
    Are they diving deep to the surface?
        Did their mamas give them a magic clicker?
Are you lost in a neverending niiiiiight?
    Nah, I'm just taking a dive intk the surface!
I could only imagine what they would do to him.
    Yeah...look at what happened to Hartman.
        That was also because the hiss to I think. Hopefully by time AW2 happens I hope Jessie cleared out the hiss so they are at least contained somewhere or just completely eradicated. So hopefully estevez in Wake aren't in for a wild surprise that they can't enter the building with it on lockdown.
I did, I meant interacting with each other face to face, in the awe dlc she doesnt physically interacts with him
Elaborate? I played QB but don’t recall this, thx
    there's A LOT of element in this short film from 7 years ago that is in the game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDNGoVKfDw
        How IN THE HELL am I only seeing this now? Thanks for this dude!
            Because it plays at the start of the game as you’re making your way through the walking sim section at the entrance to the campus. 

It’s on a TV in game and you have to be close to hear it. My first playthrough I caught by complete accident cause I heard the “it’s not a lake, it’s an ocean” comment and got caught off guard. 
It definitely worked! The moment you pick up the flare gun in the middle of all the awesome chaos it's like yeahhh baby flare gun time come on Alan this is your time to shine. SO MUCH FUN!! Thanks for answering <3
This was one of the greatest levels/sequences in video game history imo. Kudos to the team, AW2 is now one of my all time favorite games
Thanks for replying! I really enjoyed Saga as a character, and loved learning about how the sweater came to be in another reply. The Plot Board was fun and now I want my office to look like that... Best I can do is use scrivener I guess. We Sing was so unexpected and a ton of fun, and I can't wait to play through it very soon in my latest replay! Thanks again for your work on the game and hope to see the DLCs soon!
The Heart was one of the most memorable missions I've played in video games ever, tied with We Sing. Thanks for helping make them!
Thank you so much for the response! I'll be checking that talk out!
Doesn’t the apartment change in different points of the game?
But the apartment in AW1 was much more visually appealing. A graphically updated version of that would have been far better looking, so the technical argument wouldn't really make sense.
this
Turns out that rent is much cheaper in The Dark Place than the real NYC. Rates aren't what they were 13 years ago. /s
When Alan walks in, he sees the spiral door and says "this was where I wrote my books"
EXCACTLY !
Oh yeah forsure im not expecting any kind of details I just wanna know if its even on their radar or part of their future plans
And Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes!

Remedy are BUSY
    Max Wake 4: Take Control
What do you mean we don’t know about DLC? Remedy already confirmed 2 and even named them already.
Yöton yö and ahti & the janitors merch would be cool too 😁
I'm just saying they could have at least offered her a ride!
Thanks for the response! You are so right about the Koskela ads hilarious and one of the more serious moments, they add so much to the game through their limited inclusion.
SUPER appreciated this! I kept marveling about her hair to anyone who would listen lol
When is Tom Zane?
    Why is Tom Zane?
        How is Tom Zane?
i wasnt complaining and yes
Great choices all round 😁
If I can have some Follow up questions answered?

* Nathalie - What was the hardest part of making Alan's Initiation part in the Oceanview? 

 * Additionally; Which part of the game, when being made where you unsure of, but when completed really reinforced "this was a good idea!"?

* Marko: Thanks! It's cool to know there might have been a mechanic - but I agree that it probably would've taken from the game. I have a new question now:

 * When was the decision to make the save locations, a physical thermos in a safe zone? Additionally; When the game was being play-tested, what were some of the funniest game-breaking bugs you heard of / saw?

* John: What about Agent Nightingale? Secondly, which character do you think had the most work done on them - who changed the most from conception to final product?
What he said was in addition to Night Springs and Lake House. Final Draft can be one, but he still said the statement as plural, and “pretty significant” at that. I wouldn’t count updates like Chapter Select, and unless Photo Mode has a story tie in, I wouldn’t consider that either.
Thank you all for responding. And thank you all for making my game of the year. Really think you all did a great job living up to the legacy and were able to expand and grow the Alan Wake universe. Can’t wait to see where it goes from here.
Wow! Rose's positive handwritten notes are one of my favourite parts of the game, adding a touch of coziness to an otherwise scary experience! You have beautiful handwriting!
I thought Rose was such an excellent addition in AW2 as well. I played the original AW before jumping into 2, it was great to see her appear in most chapters here.
Thank you so much for such a great response!
Thank you for the reply!!


Silhouette and smartly-used, limited colours that help to create a strong identity. Got it :)
Oh man being from the northwest Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman’s portrayal of their character felt exactly like everyone I ever grew up with in Washington state.
Because if you disagree with inserting propaganda into video games, you haven’t been outside enough. Makes sense
    "Inserting propaganda"

Lmao
    Don't be shy. Do elaborate
Have you ever gone out for a jog?
    Yep
        Do it again but just keep going
            Rough couple of days eh?
                How do you figure? I’ve been busy lifting heavy, eating good with my lovely wife, and spreading democracy
                    Sure thing bub
Garbage bad-faith question that is rightfully ignored
Wow! I didn't realize the AMA had already started and I got a reply from a Remedy rep! Thank you so much!
    That literally is the answer. Lol. Good luck though, I guess? Sorry for ruining your experience by responding with an answer.
What did they say?
Yeah, they're fuck/you
