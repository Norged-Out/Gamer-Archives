Cloud should be in Soul Calibur, not Tekken
    This makes way more sense for Cloud
    And either barret or aerith in smash.
    Came here to say the same thing. He'd be a perfect fit.
Ehrgeiz HD remake confirmed?
    Holy shit yes
    Wait what? Please tell me that's a real thing, please oh please. Man i miss that game
    God I want that so bad.
    Yes, I want to buy and sell wine in HD
    furiously scrolls through minigames for the dungeon crawler
    I fucking wish
    God Bless the Ring
    I would give everything to sse a remake or remaster of ehrgeiz.
Much better beat n' up than dissidia nt...
Totally, we need Tifa in Tekken AND Smash Ultimate

They gave her so much personality in her animations - We actually have a sense of what Zangan style is now üëäüèªüòé
    Tifa would be cool in Smash, but 2 FF7 characters? I feel like Tidus has a higher chance.

            Yes exactly! Let‚Äôs hope it happens
            There's some copyright issues going on behind the scenes. Some symptoms of this are the complete lack of more Final Fantasy music, as well as the lack of an English voice actor (contract concerns). Cloud and FF in Smash are dead in the water.
                What copyright issues?

My girlfriend is playing ff7, kingdom hearts 2, or the ff mmo from the other room... and I am goddamn tired of hearing that repetitive upbeat theme...
            Also the Fire Emblem characters all look the same.
                Don‚Äôt really agree with you there. Yes 4 of them are quite similar in terms of moveset but they‚Äôre all really fun. That‚Äôs the curse of being a Fire Emblem fan though lol. 

But for real Tifa would be so sick to have in the roster. We need a rush down fist fighter like Tifa that isn‚Äôt a fighting game one like Terry (though he is fun as fuck.)

        Haha just going off longevity, popularity, and Smash needing a female martial artist, I‚Äôd say Sakurai knows Tifa is the popular choice
        Leeeeeeet‚Äôs blitz!
        yeah 2 ff7 characters in smash would be weird
Correction,  we need Tifa in every game.
After watching this clip I am convinced that I have no idea how to actually use tifa well in the game.
    same. i need tutoring
        Here‚Äôs a tip: You can cancel the end lag of focused strike with a dodge (preferably a parry). This can be super useful because the ability has a special quality that refunds ATB when it lands, so you cancel the move into itself like 7 times in a row, or you can cancel it into different moves. It does pretty solid stagger damage as well so it can be good to spam when the enemy is pressured.
    Just Chi Trap bro
That's beautifull, I could look at it for hours
When I finally figured out you could play that game almost like a street fighter style with Tifa, the whole game changed. Battles were super fun, and I never got bored of fighting.

Dang dude. This game rules.
No arguments, I totally agree with this. Her movesets are build for fighting games.
Juggle skills are 10/10
    Indeed, I can't imagine how one could do this lol
        It's Sunhi, he does things with games that probably the developers didn't even know could be done.

Proof: Cory Barlog liked his God of War gifs so much, he sent him a PS4 Pro and a custom controller that was only given to the team that worked on the game at Santa Monica.
+1 for NieR OST
    surprised i had to scroll to the bottom to find this
Tifa for Tekken would be dope, I think Kiryu and Majima are my dream characters for Tekken though.
SMOKIN SEXY STYLE\~!
Cloud would make sense in games like Soul Caliber or Smash. But games like Tekken and Street Fighter are traditionally more hand to hand fighting. Tifa would be a great guest character
Tifa is my favourite character to fight with.  If she could also level up to a laser beam of death like Aerith, she would be the ultimate badass.
    THIS. Hope Part 2 gives her a hadouken or some projectile, give her better aerial game.
This makes me want to play the remake again.
    Keen for the ps5 so I can
Oof Tifa is awesome as fuck
Damn i love Tifa so much.
remove Noctis from Tekken, replace with best girl Tifa
I really like the editing on this one and her "Time to get serious!" reminds of "Get over here!" (not Tekken, but close lol)
Was just thinking about this the other day. Tifa would be great in Tekken, way better than Noctis. Also, sick combo!
She's too fast for Tekken, we'd be disappointed by how slow she feels compared to FFVII Remake
Her animations felt so fluid and fast paced, I loved playing as her the most
Tifa was definitely my favorite character to fight with in the remake. Everything felt so smooth and somehow didn‚Äôt seem repetitive.
She would even fit better in tekken as cloud
God! I will slowmo my every Tifa kick from now on!
I Played the game 3 times and never come close to anything like this, damn this make me want to play it again
This is amazing. Britt has to see this.
YOOOOO NICE
Hype
Got excited for a moment I thought Cloud was in Tekken for real :(
Yassss a thousand times yassss
Dear Lord.. \*heart eyes emoji\*
I have always hated that God damned dolphin.
Would rather Square Enix just make a good Dissidia game again. Tekken doesn't need more FF crossovers (cheapens both brands/series if it's overdone). Not to mention that doing a promotional crossover THIS long after both games' releases, completely defeats the point. Just sounds like a fantasy/pipedream to me, and not like a good business move for either company
Some "interesting" pieces of physics in that clip :p
My dream is for Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith to all be in a PS All-Stars sequel. Each of them play so uniquely, they'd all great additions to the roster!
Wait, what is theatrical mode?? üòØ
lol I doubt anyone was asking for Cloud in Tekken. Noctis was weird enough. But yeah Tifa would be nice.
Tifa fights Sephiroth with her bare hands. She will destroy everyone in Tekken
    *Tifa fights Sephiroth with*

*Her bare hands. She will destroy*

*Everyone in Tekken*

She's fist Eddy
Yeah Tifa would fit in to the Tekken roster easily
Tifa: "A quick death? No, not for you. Your death shall be... like a ballet!"
there are mods that exist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUa3nhwpILw
This just goes to show how well done this fam was
Meanwhile I'm doing certain challenges in Chapter 16. Cloud and Barret solo runs were easy, with Tifa I almost got the first enemy to half health.
you got so hype for this game i can't wait to finally be done with my exams and play it
