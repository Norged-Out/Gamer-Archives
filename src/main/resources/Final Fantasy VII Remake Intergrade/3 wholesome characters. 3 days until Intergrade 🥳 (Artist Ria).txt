[[3 wholesome characters. 3 days until Intergrade 🥳 (Artist Ria)]]





When they went shopping and Cloud was a pack chocobo. :)
    :D
    :D
    Ngl, I tried searching this picture to see if the artist included a pile of shopping bags and boxes that Cloud had to lug around before they settled at this cafe. I didn't find it, so I'm just gonna assume it's been saved into his inventory.
Love how Tifa and Aerith have modest coffees but Cloud has this monstrosity of a Iced Latte. I imagine him being a sweet tooth but thinking that it makes him less cool but he hides it, but fails at it like in the picture. 

Also I want Aerith's jacket. Its so cute.

        Yes. I love how in Remake, its clear that Cloud is trying so hard to act badass that it becomes a comedy.

Like I want a scene in Part 2 where he lets go and acts really dorky. Like making coos at a baby chocobo or like in this picture, Cloud having a meal that may be “childish” such as chicken tenders or mac and cheese.

Cloud is better when is is dorky and vulnerable than when he is a “badass” in my opinion.

                Not the OP but you’re spot on. I was significantly younger since I played the OG when it launched. The translation and *feel* wasn’t as apparent as it is in remake. There are so many scenes in remake where the artist are able to have the characters emote without saying a word but it still paints a picture. Like when Arieth teased Cloud about moonlighting as a crane operator, he has the slightest smirk showing he enjoys her banter before going back to being all business.

I actually love the story telling in the road to Wall Market. (I however do not love replaying it for trophies, uuugghhh wish you could skip the underground portion in replays).
                I think in these cases they were kinda distilled down, and in doing so lost a lot of the depth to their character. 

Cloud became a loner super cool guy, which he is by the end definitely, but he lost the self confidence he had gained in the OG. The confidence to be himself and not have to put up the front of a hero. 

I’m really glad that 7R brought us back to the classic characterizations of these characters because these characters have never been so on the money in any other media.
                >aloof loner misunderstood badass (that was Vincent)

The devs have said in interviews that Cloud and Vincient are or become very similar. That Cloud is Vincent's younger version or something along those lines...
            Playing as Cloud felt like having a dumbass son going through his teenage angst phase. Super frustrating and yet you can’t help but love the bastard.
                I felt gutted when everyone in Avalanche was celebrating at Seventh Heaven and he was asked to leave.  All because he wanted to play aloof even though he wants a place to belong. Oh that spikey haired dork
                I didn't get this feeling in the OG though. Always felt his story, from the beginning sequence to the end, was tragic. 

Never thought he was trying to be cool or trying to be someone else but that he this badass anti-hero of sorts who finds himself on a journey to discover who or what he is to become.
            > Yes. I love how in Remake, its clear that Cloud is trying so hard to act badass that it becomes a comedy.

AGREED. Actually, I think Remake ended up emphasizing how Cloud is *trying* to be stoic/cool but is in reality awkward - more than the OG even did. I think it's the most evident in the chapters with Aeris, because she pretty much starts slaying him from the start by teasing him for putting on the badass act.
        "I need you to go back to be a dorky asshole again"                     "That's the best thing I've heard in 23 years"
    I love that idea. I hope we see them ordering food and Cloud thinking "I'd like a strawberry milkshake and a piece of apple pie" but ordering an enormous steak and a jar of black beer instead XD
        Lol. At least he gets protein and B12 from the steak.

But the milkshake has calcium and vitamin C in it so yeah.
    At first I thought he ordered his coffee black but took one sip, nearly gagged, and Aerith gave him her iced latte. I can accept without hesitation that Aerith can take her coffee any way.
Barret: i will just be here in a corner... Alone...
    My man has Red XIII. He's set for life
        He always wanted a talking dog best friend
            That as well as

AVALANCHE TIME!
    He's the one taking the picture
    He wanted protein instead of saturated fats XD
    He's teaching Marlene how to ski at the bunny hill.
This is super cool. Seeing them in normal clothes makes them just that bit more real in some way.
    I seriously hope they will add some clothing options for the next installments. The northern continent is 90% ice, and Tifa is way underdressed for it (not that Cloud and especially Barret are good to go...)
        It'd be neat if they implemented a status debuff of sorts, kind of like how RDR did if Arther was overdressed or underdressed for the weather. I'd love for them to give us Tifa's AC outfit as an option and Aerith's OG Long dress.
    I felt exactly the same way. The artist Ria (@ria_neearts on Instagram) has a bunch of artwork with the characters in their traditional outfits as well as normal clothes
        ah, thank you, I'll have to check it out :)
I honestly love how they made Tifa and Aerith in the Remake compared to the OG. The Remake made it feel like they got along without any sort of jealousy towards Cloud. The OG had some sort of love triangle at times.
    It's definitely toned down in the Remake. Which is good cos I just love seeing the characters getting along with each other
        I do miss the scene of then in the jail cells, and cloud is in one with tifa and they talk to aerith through the wall and there's a moment of "wait what"
That Aerith portrait fits her character perfectly lol almost makes her too real in my opinion lol
Ria is the best FF fan artist.
This looks like an in-game replica so good
It's very nice but Tifa doesn't strike me as liking to paint her nails XD
    I think Aerith would do it for her though, and Tifa couldn’t say no to Aerith.
        Aerith convinced Cloud to crossdress, convincing Tifa to let her paint her nails would be easy as cake XD
    I don't have a strong opinion on this, but while I don't see Sector 5 Tifa often painting her nails, she was quite fashionable in her youth. She also wears an earring so I think she does probably accessorize. She theoretically threw together her Wallmarket dress herself, so absolutely knows how to doll up.

So I guess my point is, I definitely don't think Tifa is a stereotypical "tomboy" or whatever. I think she probably enjoys dressing up/accessorizing from time to time. 

On the flip side, I wonder if it isn't Aeris who is less likely to paint her nails! She gardens and that's always a good way to ruin painted nails. The other characters in Wallmarket make fun of her for looking "plain" (which is, wtf, but I guess that's meant to be her vibe). Not that Aeris doesn't accessorize, too, but apparently needed help with her "plain Jane clothes and makeup".
        Same, I don't get where this idea of tomboy Tifa comes from. Out of all of her outfits, only one isn't a dress or skirt. 

I think the plain comments were meant to make her dress reveal more exciting, but it doesn't really work cause she's gorgeous lol.
            Yeah, same.. Not accusing anyone in this thread of that, but I think "tomboy Tifa" is a pretty shallow first-glance reading of her character, probably meant to contrast "feminine Aeris". Sure, Tifa does martial arts and her OG/Remake outfit is somewhat.. punk(?), but Tifa definitely seems like someone who is fashionable, stylish and popular. We know Nibelheim Tifa was always wearing dresses and her cowgirl outfit is definitely a fashion choice, for instance. Remake implies she would've dressed up for a night on the town with Cloud and wore that same outfit for the Corneo audition (undoubtedly put together the outfit, hair, and makeup herself). The only outfit that's more utility over fashion seems to be the Advent Children outfit, and I'm sure one could read some kind of symbolism/character development in that.

Haha, you're probably right that the comments about Aeris being plain are meant to build up to the heart-stopping red dress reveal, but it's hilarious none the less. Either way, I can see Aeris liking cute clothes but I have to guess she's not intended to be as fashionable as Tifa.

I will say that I vaguely remember some interview quote from the OG times where the creators (Nojima, maybe?) called Tifa's style "tomboy" as a deliberate contrast to Aeris's feminine style, but that's hilarious because there's nothing stereotypically "boyish" about how Tifa dresses. Like, at all.
                AC had a bunch of kids in it so they put my girl in mom shorts 😄
                I always imagined the cowgirl outfit as her guide uniform.  Like it was decided by the City Council or if it’s a service and she has a boss, they just decided the guides would dress like cowboys/girls.  Total pulled out of my ass speculation, though.
        > She theoretically threw together her Wallmarket dress herself, so absolutely knows how to doll up.

Her purple dress is 100% a piece of lingerie and nobody will convince me otherwise, so I'm not sure she has that much of a fashion sense XD

It's not that I think she's a tomboy, she just strikes me as prefering a natural look and accessorizing with earrings and stuff like that and less with make up or painted nails. Also, her black leather skirt and suspenders give me punk vibes, so if she were to paint her nails I'd imagine she'd choose a dark colour.

I also think that both her and Aerith probably have seriously unkept hands. Gardening without gloves on and punching mechas sounds like a way to ruin your hands.
            >Her purple dress is 100% a piece of lingerie and nobody will convince me otherwise, so I'm not sure she has that much of a fashion sense XD

Oh no argument there LOL. That purple dress was def lingerie. I mean, she looks smoking in it but I was kind of disappointed since that's never how I pictured the OG dress looking in high res. Personally I thought the dress that suited her the most was the sporty dress - not because it's in any way "sporty" but I think the material seemed like it was more her style?

Hmm, tough to say, though, seems like at the end of the day it's just a matter of interpretation! I know Tifa's outfit is "punk" but something about that term doesn't quite fit her aesthetic to me. Like, she's still so "mainstream" pretty. I think there's probably some deliberate contrast to the cute outfits of her youth and her Midgar style, I'm sure living in the slums and fighting Shinra has made her prioritize fashion a bit less. I still have to think she knows how and likes to doll up once in awhile, though. I'd see her as definitely knowing how to do hair and makeup, as well as put together stylish outfits - probably more than Aeris.

I definitely agree that at least during the game, neither Aeris nor Tifa keeps up their nails. xD
    It's very funny that you say that cos that's probs my only critique of this art piece. But I believe she did it because red is a colour associated with Tifa, she has red eyes and red boots; two things that stand out from her design.
        I didn't mean it as a critique, red nails actually look good on her. It's just that I can't picture someone who regularly smashes her fists against faces/metal/etc painting them 😅
Her nails probably get broken and bruised all the time. Also, like it doesn't "match" her personality (IMO).
            That's a fair enough point 😅 I don't even think she painted her nails when she dressed up for Corneo for all three dresses (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
    She also doesn't really strike me as the type to want to get all dolled up on a date for Cloud, but there she was asking him what kind of style he preferred in Chapter... 3? (it's been a while).
        I don't think she's the kind to get dolled up in general. But I do think she's the kind to get dolled up for a date with Cloud in particular....she did get quite dolled up >!when she was a teenager to meet him before he left Nibelheim XD!<

Don't get me wrong though. I think this art looks lovely and I've always thought that red nails look great on most brunette women.
            I think she's exactly the type that gets dolled up for a night out with friends though. We mostly see her in the context of being an avalanche member in the game, but her personality is definitely the type to keep in mind what Cloud is thinking of her.
            And let's not forget the mission to get info from Corneo, but that was for a purpose.
            > she did get quite dolled up when she was a teenager to meet him before he left Nibelheim XD

Did she, though? She was already wearing that dress - I think her normal style back then was cute sun dresses + the cowgirl outfit. She was the popular, fashionable girl in Nibelheim.
                I think so. I mean, she's wearing a dress appropriate for a 13(?) year old but with those pretty sandals that match in colour.
                    Hmm, I could be misremembering but I thought that's the same dress she wears >!when her mom dies and she's with friends, and Cloud follows her.!< So that made me think that's just Tifa's style, she didn't specifically dress up for that evening, she's always dressing in a cute way.
                        I think you're right, it's the same dress. For some reason I thought that Tifa and Cloud were much younger, like 7-8 years old when >!Tifa's mom died!< so my brain erased the idea that she could be wearing the same dress aged 13(ish).

I guess I thought she dolled up because I remember that in the OG Cloud said that she was late and he was freezing while waiting, so I thought that was the reason, but it could be that she had to trick her dad / escape through her room's window to go see Cloud.

Also, her style has changed a lot by the time she lives in Midgar, as she does look a lot more dolled up in her daily clothes as a teen.
                            > but it could be that she had to trick her dad / escape through her room's window to go see Cloud.

That could be! Her dad really didn't like Cloud, after all. 

My reading of it was that she was debating whether or not to meet Cloud, since she didn't really know him well, apparently thought he was a little weird (according to an ultimania), and was surprised he asked to meet her. I figured she thought about it for awhile before deciding to go for it. I suppose she also could've been hanging with other friends, since she was a socialite, and so became "fashionably late." 

I bet Remake will explore the backstory here a bit more, whichever way is true!
                                I'd like to think that she wasn't such a dick, I mean the "fashionably late" part. But we'll find out in the next Parts.
        That was also for a night on the town, something I'd expect a date to dress up for.
I love this artwork, but seeing a hat on Aerith emphasises the ridiculousness of her bangs.
PS5 still sold out. Probably gonna miss out on Intergrade :(
    Same. I really hope they release a ffvii exclusive ps5 bundle with part 2... I will gladly wait until then.
    Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and this comment on every thread.

I've been downvoted almost as many times as this same comment has been posted below.
Such a cozy eating time at the slums
This is Barret erasure
Cool, I like the vibe of this artwork.
Omg I love this!!!!
So I’ll only be able to play on ps5 not 4?
    Yes. Intergrade is for PS5 only
Gotta love how FF7R brought back the Deviantart edits of FF characters in casual clothes days

Good times
This is the type of wholesome content I need
is intergrade free if you purchased FF7R on PS4 and have a PS5? I cant see a way to get it in the store as of yet.
    Yes it's free. You won't be able to get it until the 10th
        thanks /u/brigbain that info is harder to find than it should be.
    The Yuffie DLC will not be, though. You just get the visual enhancements and the photo mode. You'll have to pay about $20 USD for Yuffie.
        This is why I’m confused. Nothing in the PS store on the PS5 about anything other than the full enchilada for $60. I guess It’ll update tomorrow.
            That is my suspicion, as well.
This is so well made and I love red nail polish on Tifa!
I want this to be a mission in part 2, the party gets all casual dressed and go out for coffee and shopping. I can imagine yuffie fucking something up and stealing some materia then the mission gets some action
It is so close, but no way to get a PS5 to play it.
The artist is called Ria but you can find her artwork and social medias on:

Threesome
PS5 where you at?
Who is Ria? Any instagram or anything? I love this pic!
    Her instagram is @ria_neearts
        This says DO NOT REPOST in the middle, did you get her permission to share this here?
I’m gonna have to settle for watching my favorite YouTube and Twitch streamers play. Since I’ve had no luck with getting a PS5.

Btw ,Great art!
Wholesome picture
Wow so awesome ff7 Casual. I love it so much!
those are major words, its perfect!!
I will never forget Tifa's dead eyed stare in the sewers as Aerith called dibs on Cloud.

"Super bodyguard is here! Right?"
Adorable
:D
:D

                Hmm, I could be misremembering but I thought that's the same dress she wears >!when her mom dies and she's with friends, and Cloud follows her.!< So that made me think that's just Tifa's style, she didn't specifically dress up for that evening, she's always dressing in a cute way.
                    I think you're right, it's the same dress. For some reason I thought that Tifa and Cloud were much younger, like 7-8 years old when >!Tifa's mom died!< so my brain erased the idea that she could be wearing the same dress aged 13(ish).

I guess I thought she dolled up because I remember that in the OG Cloud said that she was late and he was freezing while waiting, so I thought that was the reason, but it could be that she had to trick her dad / escape through her room's window to go see Cloud.

Also, her style has changed a lot by the time she lives in Midgar, as she does look a lot more dolled up in her daily clothes as a teen.
                        > but it could be that she had to trick her dad / escape through her room's window to go see Cloud.

That could be! Her dad really didn't like Cloud, after all. 

My reading of it was that she was debating whether or not to meet Cloud, since she didn't really know him well, apparently thought he was a little weird (according to an ultimania), and was surprised he asked to meet her. I figured she thought about it for awhile before deciding to go for it. I suppose she also could've been hanging with other friends, since she was a socialite, and so became "fashionably late." 

I bet Remake will explore the backstory here a bit more, whichever way is true!
                            I'd like to think that she wasn't such a dick, I mean the "fashionably late" part. But we'll find out in the next Parts.
    That was also for a night on the town, something I'd expect a date to dress up for.
Same. I really hope they release a ffvii exclusive ps5 bundle with part 2... I will gladly wait until then.
Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and this comment on every thread.

I've been downvoted almost as many times as this same comment has been posted below.
Yes. Intergrade is for PS5 only
Yes it's free. You won't be able to get it until the 10th
    thanks /u/brigbain that info is harder to find than it should be.
The Yuffie DLC will not be, though. You just get the visual enhancements and the photo mode. You'll have to pay about $20 USD for Yuffie.
    This is why I’m confused. Nothing in the PS store on the PS5 about anything other than the full enchilada for $60. I guess It’ll update tomorrow.
        That is my suspicion, as well.
Her instagram is @ria_neearts
    This says DO NOT REPOST in the middle, did you get her permission to share this here?
Yes. I love how in Remake, its clear that Cloud is trying so hard to act badass that it becomes a comedy.

Like I want a scene in Part 2 where he lets go and acts really dorky. Like making coos at a baby chocobo or like in this picture, Cloud having a meal that may be “childish” such as chicken tenders or mac and cheese.

Cloud is better when is is dorky and vulnerable than when he is a “badass” in my opinion.

        Not the OP but you’re spot on. I was significantly younger since I played the OG when it launched. The translation and *feel* wasn’t as apparent as it is in remake. There are so many scenes in remake where the artist are able to have the characters emote without saying a word but it still paints a picture. Like when Arieth teased Cloud about moonlighting as a crane operator, he has the slightest smirk showing he enjoys her banter before going back to being all business.

I actually love the story telling in the road to Wall Market. (I however do not love replaying it for trophies, uuugghhh wish you could skip the underground portion in replays).
        I think in these cases they were kinda distilled down, and in doing so lost a lot of the depth to their character. 

Cloud became a loner super cool guy, which he is by the end definitely, but he lost the self confidence he had gained in the OG. The confidence to be himself and not have to put up the front of a hero. 

I’m really glad that 7R brought us back to the classic characterizations of these characters because these characters have never been so on the money in any other media.
        >aloof loner misunderstood badass (that was Vincent)

The devs have said in interviews that Cloud and Vincient are or become very similar. That Cloud is Vincent's younger version or something along those lines...
    Playing as Cloud felt like having a dumbass son going through his teenage angst phase. Super frustrating and yet you can’t help but love the bastard.
        I felt gutted when everyone in Avalanche was celebrating at Seventh Heaven and he was asked to leave.  All because he wanted to play aloof even though he wants a place to belong. Oh that spikey haired dork
        I didn't get this feeling in the OG though. Always felt his story, from the beginning sequence to the end, was tragic. 

Never thought he was trying to be cool or trying to be someone else but that he this badass anti-hero of sorts who finds himself on a journey to discover who or what he is to become.
    > Yes. I love how in Remake, its clear that Cloud is trying so hard to act badass that it becomes a comedy.

AGREED. Actually, I think Remake ended up emphasizing how Cloud is *trying* to be stoic/cool but is in reality awkward - more than the OG even did. I think it's the most evident in the chapters with Aeris, because she pretty much starts slaying him from the start by teasing him for putting on the badass act.
"I need you to go back to be a dorky asshole again"                     "That's the best thing I've heard in 23 years"
Lol. At least he gets protein and B12 from the steak.

But the milkshake has calcium and vitamin C in it so yeah.
He always wanted a talking dog best friend
    That as well as

AVALANCHE TIME!
It'd be neat if they implemented a status debuff of sorts, kind of like how RDR did if Arther was overdressed or underdressed for the weather. I'd love for them to give us Tifa's AC outfit as an option and Aerith's OG Long dress.
ah, thank you, I'll have to check it out :)
I do miss the scene of then in the jail cells, and cloud is in one with tifa and they talk to aerith through the wall and there's a moment of "wait what"
Aerith convinced Cloud to crossdress, convincing Tifa to let her paint her nails would be easy as cake XD
Same, I don't get where this idea of tomboy Tifa comes from. Out of all of her outfits, only one isn't a dress or skirt. 

I think the plain comments were meant to make her dress reveal more exciting, but it doesn't really work cause she's gorgeous lol.
    Yeah, same.. Not accusing anyone in this thread of that, but I think "tomboy Tifa" is a pretty shallow first-glance reading of her character, probably meant to contrast "feminine Aeris". Sure, Tifa does martial arts and her OG/Remake outfit is somewhat.. punk(?), but Tifa definitely seems like someone who is fashionable, stylish and popular. We know Nibelheim Tifa was always wearing dresses and her cowgirl outfit is definitely a fashion choice, for instance. Remake implies she would've dressed up for a night on the town with Cloud and wore that same outfit for the Corneo audition (undoubtedly put together the outfit, hair, and makeup herself). The only outfit that's more utility over fashion seems to be the Advent Children outfit, and I'm sure one could read some kind of symbolism/character development in that.

Haha, you're probably right that the comments about Aeris being plain are meant to build up to the heart-stopping red dress reveal, but it's hilarious none the less. Either way, I can see Aeris liking cute clothes but I have to guess she's not intended to be as fashionable as Tifa.

I will say that I vaguely remember some interview quote from the OG times where the creators (Nojima, maybe?) called Tifa's style "tomboy" as a deliberate contrast to Aeris's feminine style, but that's hilarious because there's nothing stereotypically "boyish" about how Tifa dresses. Like, at all.
        AC had a bunch of kids in it so they put my girl in mom shorts 😄
        I always imagined the cowgirl outfit as her guide uniform.  Like it was decided by the City Council or if it’s a service and she has a boss, they just decided the guides would dress like cowboys/girls.  Total pulled out of my ass speculation, though.
> She theoretically threw together her Wallmarket dress herself, so absolutely knows how to doll up.

Her purple dress is 100% a piece of lingerie and nobody will convince me otherwise, so I'm not sure she has that much of a fashion sense XD

It's not that I think she's a tomboy, she just strikes me as prefering a natural look and accessorizing with earrings and stuff like that and less with make up or painted nails. Also, her black leather skirt and suspenders give me punk vibes, so if she were to paint her nails I'd imagine she'd choose a dark colour.

I also think that both her and Aerith probably have seriously unkept hands. Gardening without gloves on and punching mechas sounds like a way to ruin your hands.
    >Her purple dress is 100% a piece of lingerie and nobody will convince me otherwise, so I'm not sure she has that much of a fashion sense XD

Oh no argument there LOL. That purple dress was def lingerie. I mean, she looks smoking in it but I was kind of disappointed since that's never how I pictured the OG dress looking in high res. Personally I thought the dress that suited her the most was the sporty dress - not because it's in any way "sporty" but I think the material seemed like it was more her style?

Hmm, tough to say, though, seems like at the end of the day it's just a matter of interpretation! I know Tifa's outfit is "punk" but something about that term doesn't quite fit her aesthetic to me. Like, she's still so "mainstream" pretty. I think there's probably some deliberate contrast to the cute outfits of her youth and her Midgar style, I'm sure living in the slums and fighting Shinra has made her prioritize fashion a bit less. I still have to think she knows how and likes to doll up once in awhile, though. I'd see her as definitely knowing how to do hair and makeup, as well as put together stylish outfits - probably more than Aeris.

I definitely agree that at least during the game, neither Aeris nor Tifa keeps up their nails. xD
I didn't mean it as a critique, red nails actually look good on her. It's just that I can't picture someone who regularly smashes her fists against faces/metal/etc painting them 😅
Her nails probably get broken and bruised all the time. Also, like it doesn't "match" her personality (IMO).
    That's a fair enough point 😅 I don't even think she painted her nails when she dressed up for Corneo for all three dresses (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
I don't think she's the kind to get dolled up in general. But I do think she's the kind to get dolled up for a date with Cloud in particular....she did get quite dolled up >!when she was a teenager to meet him before he left Nibelheim XD!<

Don't get me wrong though. I think this art looks lovely and I've always thought that red nails look great on most brunette women.
    I think she's exactly the type that gets dolled up for a night out with friends though. We mostly see her in the context of being an avalanche member in the game, but her personality is definitely the type to keep in mind what Cloud is thinking of her.
    And let's not forget the mission to get info from Corneo, but that was for a purpose.
    > she did get quite dolled up when she was a teenager to meet him before he left Nibelheim XD
