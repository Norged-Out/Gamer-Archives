[[Ready for Intergrade]]





I see you like to fuck everything lol
Where did you get those cloud and aerith sprites/figures? They look really cool!
    A game store in my city had them custom made I‚Äôm pretty sure, you could probably reach out to them and find out.

    Believe it or not the figures are what make the setup for me. Without them it's just another battlestation.
Wish I could find a ps5.
    I followed KillerCams channel on twitch, And was able to land both an Series X and PS5 back in December. I know it‚Äôs gotten even more difficult now, but don‚Äôt give up. 

Also as FFKL4488 said, it‚Äôs still early for the system so don‚Äôt worry about it to much.
        Yeah, for sure. I'm not sweating it but I loved 7R so much I'm chomping at the bit for more.

(Just watched the episode where this came up and couldn't help myself.)
    Honestly I got one by luck and I would say wait for them it‚Äôs a cool system but you can get majority of the games on the 4. I wish you the best of luck!
        Thanks! That's definitely how I feel. PS4 still has some juice left in its life cycle but I wish they'd release intergrade for it as well. Hard to justify an upsell if you don't have the consoles.
            I agree with you I am confused as to why they as of now not making a copy for the 4.
                Er... to encourage people to buy the new console. People won't buy new consoles unless they are console exclusives that they want to play. It's probably some deal SE had with Sony.

                        Sony had this exact same problem every single console launch from the PS1, including the PSP and Vita. Just take a moment to think back to 2013, 2006, etc. There are probably fundamental issues with hardware production at Sony, which is pretty ridiculous to be honest considering that besides the Playstation brand, they are a large hardware manufacturer, likely the largest in Japan. They probably have capacity to produce many 2 million units per year of each console line, which may have been barely enough for the PS1 and PS2 but doesn't keep up with increased demand from population increases 30 years later.
                            It's never been as bad as this. At every one of those consoles you listed you could walk into a game store around Christmas and buy one in the UK with the only issue being sitting in a queue for an hour waiting. I'll be lucky if I can do that the second Christmas after the consoles launch.

Yes they have always had shortages but never to the extent of trying to wait for stock to come in 8 months after the consoles release.
                The game is built to take advantage of the PS5. If it was on the PS4, the design could be held back by loading corridors and such. Not great for people still trying to get a PS5, but I‚Äôll be glad to get a sneak peek of how part 2 will look.
                    All they had to do was put the DLC on the 30fps ps4 version. Only differences between the 2 will be framerate and load times.
    It's not easy... it's either put in hours online 2 get one or work those extra hours and pay scalper prices... I've been lucky got 3 and re sold them for barely anything above... was the thrill of the hunt and 2 help friends get them
    Follw [@MattSwider](https://twitter.com/mattswider) on twitter, he posts when sites have new stock. Turn notifications on for his posts so that you see them  and can get a heads up. He often knows ahead of time when sites are getting them. I ended up having to get a Returnal/MLB/2nd controller bundle from Gamestop to get mine, supposedly bundles last longer.
Damn thats NICE‚ù§Ô∏è
Now that‚Äôs a set up.
Nice set up. üëç
So you the one that stole my pillow
Ready for a 81 gig download because early adopters can't pre load....
    Yep, its so dumb
    Is the download not available ahead of time?
    Hehehehehe√•
yes just yes
doesn't this hurt your neck?
Sweet set up!
That's perfect. Can't wait!
Me too boi
Sheeeeesh it's clean, but seriously nice set up
Very clean, I like it.
Nice! Like the blacked out Xbox controller.
Awesome setup!
Worried about your neck, do you crank your head up for extended hours while playing to view the monitor?
I've never been so lusty about a picture.
Nice setup dude! I'm really looking forward to intergrade too!
I‚Äôm honestly so sad I can‚Äôt play this on my PS4 :(
Nice setup.

Congrats on the sex with everything
*cry in PS4*
    *smiles in I have a lot of games on the ps4*
Too bad the LA Kings are not good lol Let's go Devils
did they say the expected file size yet? the PS store listing doesnt say and I dont have much space left and there is no pre-download either
    81 gb, RIP.
Damn‚Ä¶ and here I am still trying to get my hands on a PS5
Hope to have a PS5 for part 2 looking forward to seeing a walkthrough for the Yuffie chapter maybe a tease for part 2 at the end of it? I'm not really interested in anything else on the PS5 library.
‚Ä¶::sigh::‚Ä¶ :-|
Clean but I'd have spent the TV cash on bigger desk and another monitor in all honesty.

Unless of course you don't game on your pc?
What kind of PC is that?
I forgot it was tomorrow!!!
Lucky guy with a PS5!
Nice setup! I too have a TV set up high so I have to look up at it. It‚Äôs fine for most games including FF7R, but it started to give me gaming motion sickness for games I was fine with before.
Is this just the ps5 version of the one that came out like a year ago? Or is this the 2nd part to the story
Where did you get that PS5 controller stand? Would love one. Dope setup!

Is that a screensaver, or a desktop theme? That is kinda sick the blue bars on the bottom screen i mean.
