[[From the maker of the Zenith Tome. Comes the Zenith Summon]]





This is very well put together and the pixel art for the custom summons are great. Good stuff
    Its literally the same crafting tree as zenith but with summoning weapons instead. Unoriginal but yea the sprites do look good.

There's so many posts about other classes equivalent of zenith but they're all just copies of the original zenith crafting tree.
        That's...that's kinda the point. Yaknow, "Zenith summon"? It's right there in the title
            *That's...that's kinda the point.*

                    I do not like your username
        Who cares, it's well made
        First of all someone has already mentioned this but that’s the point, second of all it’s a bit different: it uses a duke drop, a single moon lord drop, evil bosses drop and obviously the optic staff is a bit different considering it’s made out of souls and lenses as well. Even if it wasn’t ‘original’ your on Reddit suck it up it’s still good
        Dam you have a small Brain, read the Title
        Rip your karma
        ~~This \^~~

I agree, because it is always the same recipe, with the only difference being that the weapons are for a different class. I do, still, respect your opinion if you think that this is a good post. I think it is a good post. The only problem I have with it is the fact that it straight-up copied the original Zenith recipe. 

Fixed it.
            The only thing worse than complaining about someone else's original work being uninspired is using such an uninspired comment as "this" to point it out. Good lord the hypocrisy and lack of imagination here physically hurts me.

(Sorry)
                    aint it wack how you got upvotes for saying this and i got downvotes

reddit 101
                        That’s ... because it was clearly sarcasm? I even apologised for saying it.
                            [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)
                                The clear indicator is the apology in brackets, you just failed to pick it up. If anything the irony created by the comment enhances and makes the sarcasm even clearer
                                    well you're right. im not really good at understanding sarcasm
                Idk how you can call it original when they just made new summoning weapons and used the exact same tree as zenith for some of them. Like making a new weapon from crimtane ore just like the one used in the terra blade. It's not original and it shouldn't be how the crafting tree should be if they were to add it.
                    1. Never claimed it was original m8 Its just a fun what if. And spriting new stuff from the existing color palettes is a really great pass time.

2. Never said "woah this should be vanilla" either.
                        Don't worry my guy. Its only jerks like these who don't appreciate ur hard work. Original or not, this is amazing af
                    Why shouldn't summon have a weapon made from crimtane and demonite? Summon literally only has 5 minions pre hardmode and 2 of them are really annoying to grind for, 1 is pure random chance and 2 are just craft it once you can
                        He said that there *shouldn't be one*
                            Yeah sorry, typo. I've fixed it now.
                    Mate it’s probably more original than anything you’ve ever made, the point of it is to be like the zenith crafting tree which you’d know if you bothered to read the title. And even then about half of it is original summon staffs that he made, so yes it is original now go back to whatever sewer you crawled out from.
                        My Ad Hominem detector is going insane rn
                        >and half of it is original summon staffs that he made

But its not, its just the same crafting tree as the terra blade but with summoning weapons instead. True optic staff instead of true Excalibur, demonite/crimtane staffs aswell, exactly like the terra blade. It's not original at all its literally a carbon copy of the zenith tree. I'm not trying to detract from OPs work on the sprite art but cmon man its the exact same crafting tree.
                            Wow it’s almost like the title calls it the zenith summon!!!! The point of it is to be the zenith of staffs therefore it has the same crafting tree!!! It’s like someone replaced your brain with a bag of shit just to see what would happen and this is the result.
                                Lol ok
                    I agree. I really don't understand why saying this is unoriginal gets you downvoted.

Ironically, i got upvoted once for pointing out the obvious unoriginality on a zenith crafting tree like this. (it was the bow one from june/july i think)
Reddit Logic for you buddy.
                who hurt you?
                    You must be fun at parties.
                        bold of you to assume i get invited
                            I really hate reddit speech
                                Better get used to it buddy
Love it! The only thing i would add would be adding the finchor slime staff to mirror the copper sword as your first summon weapon
    The problem with the Finch Staff is that it's not guaranteed to every world.
        Is Enchanted Sword guaranteed for each world? I’m not sure exactly how that works
            You can get them from crates.
                God damn, crates are even more OP than I thought I guess
                    Well its a 1% chance from a titanium crate, me and a friend grinded for hours with a gold hook, master bait, fishing and crate potions and still didnt find it.
                        gotta use those luck potions
                            Luck potions don't affect what you get from grabbags.
                It's the right answer, but the worst answer. I never want to fish again in my life (anglerrrrrrr)
        Slime staff grind let's go.
        they should either make it guaranteed from living wood chests, or make it a rare drop from birds
            Do you know how powerful that is early game? It took me from first night to post EoC and still helped in my fight against BoC. It's amazing!
        I mean, you could just put it in crates too. Definitely more common than the slime staff.
    Slime Staff is a hard item to get.
        u/hypervexed So is enchanted sword. /:
            Btw, as a note, on reddit, you don't need to include the username of the person you are replying to, they will get the notification regardless.
                yeah ik I just wanted to make sure they knew I was responding to then
                    I haven't really seen that to really be a problem on reddit, so I think you're good not doing it.
            Fair.
            You can get an enchanted swords by creating and running through small worlds and deleting them afterwards. I'd say enchanted sword is much easier to get
                And you can do the same for finch staff so I guess it’s decided then
            I've found maybe 20 enchanted swords in my playthroughs. I've found 0 slime staves.
            Slime staff is at least guaranteed, without fishing.
        Can't you get them from statue farming?
            I want to say they removed that in 1.4, but i might very well be wrong, I can’t recall
                this is what it says on the wiki.

An easy way to obtain the Slime Staff without much effort is to construct a statue farm with one or more Slime Statues, and lava just deep enough to not destroy any drops as it kills the slimes. Leave it alone for a while, and occasionally check if the staff has been dropped yet. Using advanced setups like engines and multiple statues can greatly accelerate the process. Note that as of version 1.3.0.1Desktop, Console, and Mobile Versions, there is a limit to how quickly statues can be triggered.


[wiki link for source](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Slime_Staff)
        I was insanely lucky and got one randomly from a pinky in the first hour of my world
This should be made into a mod once tModloader updates to 1.4, theses are some very cool ideas for summons
     The concept is mostly copied from mods, almost every single endgame weapon in calamity is crafted this way
        it's called having a complicated crafting tree. calamity didn't invent crafting trees
            If you even slightly look into it you will see the crafting ingredients are the weapons for the class you have gathered throughout the stages of the game, which is waaay too similar to calamity not to be noticed.
                so, the Terra Blade/Zenith??? which this was based on???
                    This man doesn't understand that you can't copyright large crafting trees
                r/usernamechecksout
I really like the concept of these all-powerful weapons for other classes, but they shouldn't be an exact replica of zenith's crafting recipe.
    Well the Spell Tome wasn't. I like Terra weapons more than the Zenith ones tho. So I'd much rather be doing those.
        I agree. The Terra Weapons are the best part about alternate class Zeniths. The Terra Blade is such an Iconic weapon and the way you craft it is really cool.
            I also really really enjoy the colors.
                It's really cool how Gold and Purple mix together into a really cool green. I'm not even sure what the exact color of the Terra Blade is but it's like Greens Equivalent to Gold as Gold is to Yellow. The enchanted parts of the True Weapons look really cool in Pixel Art, especially with the Blade being opposite, Light and Dark
                    Maybe make a summon for each of the bosses? There's already a lot for many of the existing ones. Optic staff, Slime staff, Pygmy Staff, etc.
        shouldn’t the last prism be a part of the recipe
            No? Its a mage weapon?...
                i thought it was a mage weapon that he was making ::/

big dum
    Funny how people agree with you here but I get 400 downvotes for saying the same thing lol
I would have added terraprisma as the right most item instead if the new meowmere summon but otherwise real cool
    Then it could be made pre-Lunar Events, which doesn't make that much sense.
        Does moonlord drop any summoner drops? Was just wondering with the idea that both starwrath and meowmere are moonlord drops and i personally think empress of light at daytime is the final boss of the run. Moonlord is such an easy last boss fight but empress can give you some trouble because of one shots
            Nah shes pretty easy to learn. Moon lord will alway keep you on your toes atleast.

Also Moonlord only drops sentry summons. And I'm excluding sentries because I'll be making them their own class if I ever get around to making this into a mod.
                I dunno man, master mode moonlord was still cheesable, beat the boss with 1 hand on mouse, i could just stand still and face tank the hits, at least against empress there is no such thing as standing still
                    Every boss is cheesable man. And you can only tank as melee class tho? There was no tanking that as summoner or mage. Possibly even ranger. I had 70 defense as a a ranger hybrid and I definitely had to dodge or else.

Empress can be cheesed because she attacks in a preset pattern. And its actually rather easy to manipulate where they go. And much easier to see than moon lords projectiles.
                        I have played the game with master mode for the worthy with all seeds, not mean't to come off as rude, it's true empress has a pattern that she repeats but i find myself getting hit with those way more often than moonlord since all of moonlords attacks are easy to see through, every attack of his shines or shows that it's coming before it happens letting you plan ahead, but this is only opinional thing, reason why i feel empress being harder is because i dont focus on the pattern so every dodge comes by reflex
                            I don't think I can count For the Worthy as viable judge wether something is harder or not. Because she gets increased attack speed there. 

And when I meant easy to see, I meant like there isnt some annoying fuzzy filter on the screen with a million things going on at once.. Empress always attacks from a single location. True eyes can be all over the place if they like. And you also just can't dish out damage super quickly to be done with the fight.
            Lunar Portal Staff and Rainbow Crystal Staff are both summoner weapons.
Sick!! The witching Hour sounds just like an endgame boss summon, but what about stardust dragon staff?
Great use for my 8 xeno staffs I got while trying to get a cosmic car key
I love all of these concepts, but I wish they weren't just summoner versions of zenith components. Like instead of it being a.meowmere summon, why not make it a true eye of cthulu? And instead of.it being the night staff, why not some sort of monstrosity summon that is an amalgamation of the previous ones? 

don't get me wrong, I love the art and the idea, (especially the final one) but I just wish there was a little more uniqueness
Where is Pirate Staff? Is he safe? Is he alright?
Where's the Finch staff
How about instead of summoning a mini MoonLord, it summons the actual Moon Lord?
    I would if it was a single player only game maybe.
        what abou every summon it summons a differenr smol boss?
Even if it isn't exactly identical to the zenith crafting tree I think it'd be cool if you added some iconic summoning weapons like the terraprisma or stardust dragon staff
Gotta say the crimson/corruption should not be clones of one another. Let them be different. Other than that very creative and good art/design.
    Who said their AI wouldn't differ in ways. Or speed, attack, etc.

Id prefer to keep them comparable or else people will be like "Bro you use THIS evil?? Fuck you! The meta is THIS evil"
        For me it's deciding if I want wrath positions or ichor. Both solid options.
Edit: Potions cuz I'm dumb
Anybody else notice that the moon on The Witching Hour is winking at us?
I just want to say this. But not every zenith has to have the aspec of a nights edge, with 4 pre hardmode weapons. It doesn't need something like the terra blade. All the zenith needs are unique weapons of the class. I agree with the rainbow toaster and the wicked/crimson staff tho. Those are dope. But yeah, not every zenith like item need to have a terra blade crafting tree. Even putting in the slime staff in the recipe imo would be better than copying a sword.
    Ill probably change the true parts but Terra is definitely a main stay.
I think I’d be happy having the Rainbow Toaster Staff
I think midnight staff is the coolest one
Look at that toaster cat. Adorable.
I am a mage but I would switch to summoner if I could get a toaster cat
I really like the idea of a staff like this that just summons one of EVERY minion that swarm enemies like a mob
I need a Rainbow Toaster staff. I don't need Zenith summons, I need 9 nyan cats following me...
Even has Zenith’s color scheme. Love it.
Will the W. Hour summon True EoC after bonus summon?
I personally had the idea of a black hole type of summon, that would get bigger and stronger the more times you summon it
    I had the idea of it summoning 5 different summons all buffed to endgame power levels, like how Zenith has you throw different swords.
What the hell this is so cool
YES.
We need this, NEED
Far better than my tome, well played. great job!
1. The custom staffs are awesome.

2. The skeletons are cute.

3. I want this in the game.

4. Can you post the link to the Zenith Tome?
    https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/hsd79g/i_sprited_a_zenith_spell_book_and_others/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
The midnight staff minion looks like a baby signus from calamity
Or the true optic staff uses 10 mana deal 93 damage average knockback fast speed 
Summons 3 eyes (moon lord eyes)
Each one have diferents attacks 
If the player haves minus that 50% life they will deal more damage 
Buff (minion) phantasmal eyes: you feel an evil presence fighting for you
Sorry for the bad english
A sentry zenith?
    SOON.tm
hey bro can I use this for a mod?
    Nah I'm gonna be using them later.
Idea: Instead of the Broken Staff simply coming from the Solar Eclipse, as, let's be honest, that's copying the Terra Blade part-for-part a little too much, why not have it drop from the Goblin Army? Because, y'know, Goblin ***Summoners***

Also what would the Rainbow Toaster Staff come from?

(and may I recommend adding in the Stardust Dragon)
    I was thinking it'd actually drop from the Blood moon instead. But I'm probably gonna cut that section out for something unique.

But Goblin Summoners are definitely gonna finally  drop a summon weapon.
I would have the witching hour summon true eyes of cthulhu instead of mini moonlord but awesome job either way
I just wish we had a digging worm ai as a summon, though I can see the drawback of this I still think it'd be way cooler than most of the stuff we already have.
    I think itd be pretty decent against most pre hardmode stuff. Kinda fucked against harpies tho.
This has got to be the best zenith type staff I’ve ever seen
What about the moonlord summon that already exists? Forget what it's called.
I like the idea of mini moon lords fight their father
Pretty cool. I'd say rename the word "staff" here and there because it gets a bit repetitive like maybe rod or something.
The last one should be a glowing cube, referencing that one copy pasta about a ending into heavens and seeing that god was not a man but 3 cubes all different colors because they laughed so hard
Great art!
zenith gun is now required
it’s just a high rpm chlorophyte spitter
    Zenith gun will shoot all three types of ammo.
RAINBOW TOASTER STAFF
the custom sprites look really good, but I wonder how the zenith summon would hang around the player
instead of a custom world evil staff id say just use the finch staff
You’ll also need the slime staff
You are very good at making pixel art that looks terraria like and names that sound like terraria item names
I like
Imagine having two stands. (Make moonlord a stand lol)
I really love the sprites you did but I think it's kinda weak as a concept, replacing every zenith piece with a summoner. I still love the Art!
The only thing I don’t like about this is the name of the Zenith summoning staff, but considering how much stuff is here, that’s pretty good.
The only thing I don’t like about this is the name of the Zenith summoning staff, but considering how much stuff is here, that’s pretty good.
Is this only concept art or are you considering making a mod ( or is this already in the works?). I'd def use this, terraria needs more summon weapons, especially prehardmode
    Concept. A very small part of a mod I'm planning. Waiting till 1.4 atleast tho. And I still need to learn alot more about the coding.
        That's fair, I'm excited to play! :)
This is awesome ! Will you make new whips too ?
Should include slime staff somewhere I was thinking  watching hour + slime staff = something
My disappointment will be gigantus if Relogic doesnt decide to add final weapons for each class besides Zenith
This is amazing but moon lord already drops a staff, the lunar portal staff but the nyan cat one is more fitting.
    Sentry is gonna become its own class in the mod.
        Ah makes sense
I will make my best try to do a mod with these
    Nah I'm already gonna do that.
Now imagine if this person can make mods
U ever going to make a mod out of all these zenith weapons, it’d be pretty epic
true optic staff should summon true eyes of Cthulhu 3 at a time imo
Another name concept for witching hour could be "Apex Predator"
Should have a dirt staff slapped in there too for the lols
No slime staff?
I wish they'd put even soem of what you have in there into the game, even without the end game version. Summoner really feels like it runs on fumes until reeeeall late game.
Id kill for that rainbow toaster.
So its pre ML?
    The rainbow toaster staff is, assumedly, an alternate meowmere
        Ah. That makes sense.
Please let someone make a mod with this stuff when the mod loader updates.
finallly, you made another one like this. now do ranger please
Wait a minute...

# ITS CRAFT IS HARDER THAN ZENITH?!?
This is the boost we NEED for the summoner reD
i want the rainbow toaster staff
Oh my god Rainbow Toaster is so brilliant!
This needs to become a reality
 Walpurgisnacht would’ve been an awesome name for the Witching Hour.
Currently making your zenith tome idea, might do this one after. Your ideas and sprites are awesome :)
I would prefer if instead of just upgrading the optic staff it would be upgraded to summon a little skeletron prime instead
Idea: If you plan on making a Ranged Zenith (which I understand if you aren't) instead of just making a Zenith Gun, why not have (Insert Terra Weapon here), 2 guns, 2 bows, and 2 cannons? That way all damage types are included leaving no Ranged player out (except for throwers but Redigit doesn't love them so why should we?)
is this a mod?
I really, really want a Rainbow Toaster Staff.
Zenith range weapon when?
Please make a ranger version of these
We need something like this for every class
The "thing + broken whatever = *True* thing" idea needs to die. It was kind of lazy in vanilla and *really* lazy to repeat for mods.

You're clearly putting effort into this, so I just really believe you can ascend above that.
    How was it lazy in vanilla? 

Tbh I do wanna chamge the broken hero sword equivalent, but I couldn't think anything. And it was one of the last things I did here for the sake of being able to upload it.
(Edit: Tho I do atleast intend for the ruptured mystic staff to be dropped from the blood moon instead atleast)
        I think using the same mechanism and same item for Excalibur -> True Excalibur and Night's Edge -> True Night's Edge is a bit lazy. It's like, "hmm I can't think of a new name...let's just say what you had before was somehow worse."

So what I'm saying is, don't *have* a broken sword equivalent for two upgraded versions of things that are called "True thing" which are then directly used to form "Terra thing".

One key problem, aside from the unoriginal naming, is that once you have access to *broken thing*, you basically go right from the two early items to the terra version. Even in vanilla you basically use a True Excalibur or True Night's Edge for 5 minutes if at all before combining them into the Terra Blade. If you can get one broken hero sword, you can get two, and there's no other barrier.
            Ah yea that makes sense. I'll note that down as something to change in my mod.
            who here is talking about unoriginal naming?
                Me?
Are there mods for these items as well as the tome
    Probably not
[nyan nyan nyan nyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4) ^^^sorry
Oh hey another zenith copy cat introducing 10 uneeded items.
    It'll never be vanilla so why cry about it.
        I hate These people
        Because I have every right to voice my opinion ?

I'm not saying you didn't do a good job, it's just the 10000th post about Zenith-type weapon/weapon tree, at this point it's a meme. It's just yet another copy of the zenith tree and I'm tired seeing them.
    "Uneeded" , have you ever made a summoner runs ?
        It's not the game's fault that you're running a stupid build.  
Summoners have the luxury to be able yo use any weapon they want efficiently, you chose not to because "iT doEsN'T SAy SuMmoNEr DAmAge", that's absolutely, 100% on you.

Summoners, when played decently, are absolutely and perfectly fine. If you choose, purposefuly, to run a shitty build, you shouldn't complain.
            First I can complain about anything I want ( ironic coming from someone complaining about something that doesn’t exist)

Second I play summoner "decently" as you say it. I’m not complaining about the fact that summoner is a hard class to play you can complete the game with every class if you want.

But there’s so little summoner weapon in the game it doesn’t even feel like a true class but just bonus damage for other classes and what’s wrong with adding more weapon to a class ? If you don’t want to play with them just don’t use it , what’s wrong with that?
I love this so much but seeing as the zenith contains 10 swords I think you should add in the vampire frog the sanguine the terrariums and the blade staff
Its literally the same crafting tree as zenith but with summoning weapons instead. Unoriginal but yea the sprites do look good.

There's so many posts about other classes equivalent of zenith but they're all just copies of the original zenith crafting tree.
    That's...that's kinda the point. Yaknow, "Zenith summon"? It's right there in the title
        *That's...that's kinda the point.*

Even if it wasn’t ‘original’ your on Reddit suck it up it’s still good

I agree, because it is always the same recipe, with the only difference being that the weapons are for a different class. I do, still, respect your opinion if you think that this is a good post. I think it is a good post. The only problem I have with it is the fact that it straight-up copied the original Zenith recipe. 

Fixed it.
        The only thing worse than complaining about someone else's original work being uninspired is using such an uninspired comment as "this" to point it out. Good lord the hypocrisy and lack of imagination here physically hurts me.

                aint it wack how you got upvotes for saying this and i got downvotes

reddit 101
                    That’s ... because it was clearly sarcasm? I even apologised for saying it.
                        [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)
                            The clear indicator is the apology in brackets, you just failed to pick it up. If anything the irony created by the comment enhances and makes the sarcasm even clearer
                                well you're right. im not really good at understanding sarcasm
            Idk how you can call it original when they just made new summoning weapons and used the exact same tree as zenith for some of them. Like making a new weapon from crimtane ore just like the one used in the terra blade. It's not original and it shouldn't be how the crafting tree should be if they were to add it.
                1. Never claimed it was original m8 Its just a fun what if. And spriting new stuff from the existing color palettes is a really great pass time.

2. Never said "woah this should be vanilla" either.
                    Don't worry my guy. Its only jerks like these who don't appreciate ur hard work. Original or not, this is amazing af
                Why shouldn't summon have a weapon made from crimtane and demonite? Summon literally only has 5 minions pre hardmode and 2 of them are really annoying to grind for, 1 is pure random chance and 2 are just craft it once you can
                    He said that there *shouldn't be one*
                        Yeah sorry, typo. I've fixed it now.
                Mate it’s probably more original than anything you’ve ever made, the point of it is to be like the zenith crafting tree which you’d know if you bothered to read the title. And even then about half of it is original summon staffs that he made, so yes it is original now go back to whatever sewer you crawled out from.
                    My Ad Hominem detector is going insane rn
                    >and half of it is original summon staffs that he made

But its not, its just the same crafting tree as the terra blade but with summoning weapons instead. True optic staff instead of true Excalibur, demonite/crimtane staffs aswell, exactly like the terra blade. It's not original at all its literally a carbon copy of the zenith tree. I'm not trying to detract from OPs work on the sprite art but cmon man its the exact same crafting tree.
                        Wow it’s almost like the title calls it the zenith summon!!!! The point of it is to be the zenith of staffs therefore it has the same crafting tree!!! It’s like someone replaced your brain with a bag of shit just to see what would happen and this is the result.
                            Lol ok
                I agree. I really don't understand why saying this is unoriginal gets you downvoted.

Ironically, i got upvoted once for pointing out the obvious unoriginality on a zenith crafting tree like this. (it was the bow one from june/july i think)
Reddit Logic for you buddy.

The problem with the Finch Staff is that it's not guaranteed to every world.
    Is Enchanted Sword guaranteed for each world? I’m not sure exactly how that works
        You can get them from crates.
            God damn, crates are even more OP than I thought I guess
                Well its a 1% chance from a titanium crate, me and a friend grinded for hours with a gold hook, master bait, fishing and crate potions and still didnt find it.
                    gotta use those luck potions
                        Luck potions don't affect what you get from grabbags.
            It's the right answer, but the worst answer. I never want to fish again in my life (anglerrrrrrr)
    Slime staff grind let's go.
    they should either make it guaranteed from living wood chests, or make it a rare drop from birds
        Do you know how powerful that is early game? It took me from first night to post EoC and still helped in my fight against BoC. It's amazing!
    I mean, you could just put it in crates too. Definitely more common than the slime staff.
Slime Staff is a hard item to get.
    u/hypervexed So is enchanted sword. /:
        Btw, as a note, on reddit, you don't need to include the username of the person you are replying to, they will get the notification regardless.
            yeah ik I just wanted to make sure they knew I was responding to then
                I haven't really seen that to really be a problem on reddit, so I think you're good not doing it.
        Fair.
        You can get an enchanted swords by creating and running through small worlds and deleting them afterwards. I'd say enchanted sword is much easier to get
            And you can do the same for finch staff so I guess it’s decided then
        I've found maybe 20 enchanted swords in my playthroughs. I've found 0 slime staves.
        Slime staff is at least guaranteed, without fishing.
    Can't you get them from statue farming?
        I want to say they removed that in 1.4, but i might very well be wrong, I can’t recall
            this is what it says on the wiki.

An easy way to obtain the Slime Staff without much effort is to construct a statue farm with one or more Slime Statues, and lava just deep enough to not destroy any drops as it kills the slimes. Leave it alone for a while, and occasionally check if the staff has been dropped yet. Using advanced setups like engines and multiple statues can greatly accelerate the process. Note that as of version 1.3.0.1Desktop, Console, and Mobile Versions, there is a limit to how quickly statues can be triggered.

    I was insanely lucky and got one randomly from a pinky in the first hour of my world
 The concept is mostly copied from mods, almost every single endgame weapon in calamity is crafted this way
    it's called having a complicated crafting tree. calamity didn't invent crafting trees
        If you even slightly look into it you will see the crafting ingredients are the weapons for the class you have gathered throughout the stages of the game, which is waaay too similar to calamity not to be noticed.
            so, the Terra Blade/Zenith??? which this was based on???
                This man doesn't understand that you can't copyright large crafting trees
            r/usernamechecksout
Well the Spell Tome wasn't. I like Terra weapons more than the Zenith ones tho. So I'd much rather be doing those.
    I agree. The Terra Weapons are the best part about alternate class Zeniths. The Terra Blade is such an Iconic weapon and the way you craft it is really cool.
        I also really really enjoy the colors.
            It's really cool how Gold and Purple mix together into a really cool green. I'm not even sure what the exact color of the Terra Blade is but it's like Greens Equivalent to Gold as Gold is to Yellow. The enchanted parts of the True Weapons look really cool in Pixel Art, especially with the Blade being opposite, Light and Dark
                Maybe make a summon for each of the bosses? There's already a lot for many of the existing ones. Optic staff, Slime staff, Pygmy Staff, etc.
    shouldn’t the last prism be a part of the recipe
        No? Its a mage weapon?...
            i thought it was a mage weapon that he was making ::/

big dum
Funny how people agree with you here but I get 400 downvotes for saying the same thing lol
Then it could be made pre-Lunar Events, which doesn't make that much sense.
    Does moonlord drop any summoner drops? Was just wondering with the idea that both starwrath and meowmere are moonlord drops and i personally think empress of light at daytime is the final boss of the run. Moonlord is such an easy last boss fight but empress can give you some trouble because of one shots
        Nah shes pretty easy to learn. Moon lord will alway keep you on your toes atleast.

Also Moonlord only drops sentry summons. And I'm excluding sentries because I'll be making them their own class if I ever get around to making this into a mod.
            I dunno man, master mode moonlord was still cheesable, beat the boss with 1 hand on mouse, i could just stand still and face tank the hits, at least against empress there is no such thing as standing still
                Every boss is cheesable man. And you can only tank as melee class tho? There was no tanking that as summoner or mage. Possibly even ranger. I had 70 defense as a a ranger hybrid and I definitely had to dodge or else.

Empress can be cheesed because she attacks in a preset pattern. And its actually rather easy to manipulate where they go. And much easier to see than moon lords projectiles.
                    I have played the game with master mode for the worthy with all seeds, not mean't to come off as rude, it's true empress has a pattern that she repeats but i find myself getting hit with those way more often than moonlord since all of moonlords attacks are easy to see through, every attack of his shines or shows that it's coming before it happens letting you plan ahead, but this is only opinional thing, reason why i feel empress being harder is because i dont focus on the pattern so every dodge comes by reflex
                        I don't think I can count For the Worthy as viable judge wether something is harder or not. Because she gets increased attack speed there. 

And when I meant easy to see, I meant like there isnt some annoying fuzzy filter on the screen with a million things going on at once.. Empress always attacks from a single location. True eyes can be all over the place if they like. And you also just can't dish out damage super quickly to be done with the fight.
        Lunar Portal Staff and Rainbow Crystal Staff are both summoner weapons.
I would if it was a single player only game maybe.
    what abou every summon it summons a differenr smol boss?
Who said their AI wouldn't differ in ways. Or speed, attack, etc.

Id prefer to keep them comparable or else people will be like "Bro you use THIS evil?? Fuck you! The meta is THIS evil"
    For me it's deciding if I want wrath positions or ichor. Both solid options.
Edit: Potions cuz I'm dumb
Ill probably change the true parts but Terra is definitely a main stay.
I had the idea of it summoning 5 different summons all buffed to endgame power levels, like how Zenith has you throw different swords.

SOON.tm
Nah I'm gonna be using them later.
I was thinking it'd actually drop from the Blood moon instead. But I'm probably gonna cut that section out for something unique.

But Goblin Summoners are definitely gonna finally  drop a summon weapon.
I think itd be pretty decent against most pre hardmode stuff. Kinda fucked against harpies tho.
Zenith gun will shoot all three types of ammo.
Concept. A very small part of a mod I'm planning. Waiting till 1.4 atleast tho. And I still need to learn alot more about the coding.
    That's fair, I'm excited to play! :)
Sentry is gonna become its own class in the mod.
    Ah makes sense
Nah I'm already gonna do that.
The rainbow toaster staff is, assumedly, an alternate meowmere
    Ah. That makes sense.
How was it lazy in vanilla? 

Tbh I do wanna chamge the broken hero sword equivalent, but I couldn't think anything. And it was one of the last things I did here for the sake of being able to upload it.
(Edit: Tho I do atleast intend for the ruptured mystic staff to be dropped from the blood moon instead atleast)
    I think using the same mechanism and same item for Excalibur -> True Excalibur and Night's Edge -> True Night's Edge is a bit lazy. It's like, "hmm I can't think of a new name...let's just say what you had before was somehow worse."

So what I'm saying is, don't *have* a broken sword equivalent for two upgraded versions of things that are called "True thing" which are then directly used to form "Terra thing".

One key problem, aside from the unoriginal naming, is that once you have access to *broken thing*, you basically go right from the two early items to the terra version. Even in vanilla you basically use a True Excalibur or True Night's Edge for 5 minutes if at all before combining them into the Terra Blade. If you can get one broken hero sword, you can get two, and there's no other barrier.
        Ah yea that makes sense. I'll note that down as something to change in my mod.
        who here is talking about unoriginal naming?
            Me?
Probably not
It'll never be vanilla so why cry about it.
    I hate These people
    Because I have every right to voice my opinion ?

I'm not saying you didn't do a good job, it's just the 10000th post about Zenith-type weapon/weapon tree, at this point it's a meme. It's just yet another copy of the zenith tree and I'm tired seeing them.
"Uneeded" , have you ever made a summoner runs ?
    It's not the game's fault that you're running a stupid build.  
Summoners have the luxury to be able yo use any weapon they want efficiently, you chose not to because "iT doEsN'T SAy SuMmoNEr DAmAge", that's absolutely, 100% on you.

Summoners, when played decently, are absolutely and perfectly fine. If you choose, purposefuly, to run a shitty build, you shouldn't complain.
        First I can complain about anything I want ( ironic coming from someone complaining about something that doesn’t exist)

Second I play summoner "decently" as you say it. I’m not complaining about the fact that summoner is a hard class to play you can complete the game with every class if you want.

But there’s so little summoner weapon in the game it doesn’t even feel like a true class but just bonus damage for other classes and what’s wrong with adding more weapon to a class ? If you don’t want to play with them just don’t use it , what’s wrong with that?
That's...that's kinda the point. Yaknow, "Zenith summon"? It's right there in the title
    *That's...that's kinda the point.*

*Yaknow, "zenith summon"? it's right*

*There in the title*

True eyes can be all over the place if they like. And you also just can't dish out damage super quickly to be done with the fight.
    Lunar Portal Staff and Rainbow Crystal Staff are both summoner weapons.
what abou every summon it summons a differenr smol boss?
For me it's deciding if I want wrath positions or ichor. Both solid options.
Edit: Potions cuz I'm dumb
That's fair, I'm excited to play! :)
Ah makes sense
Ah. That makes sense.
I think using the same mechanism and same item for Excalibur -> True Excalibur and Night's Edge -> True Night's Edge is a bit lazy. It's like, "hmm I can't think of a new name...let's just say what you had before was somehow worse."

So what I'm saying is, don't *have* a broken sword equivalent for two upgraded versions of things that are called "True thing" which are then directly used to form "Terra thing".

One key problem, aside from the unoriginal naming, is that once you have access to *broken thing*, you basically go right from the two early items to the terra version. Even in vanilla you basically use a True Excalibur or True Night's Edge for 5 minutes if at all before combining them into the Terra Blade. If you can get one broken hero sword, you can get two, and there's no other barrier.
    Ah yea that makes sense. I'll note that down as something to change in my mod.
    who here is talking about unoriginal naming?
        Me?
I hate These people
Because I have every right to voice my opinion ?

I'm not saying you didn't do a good job, it's just the 10000th post about Zenith-type weapon/weapon tree, at this point it's a meme. It's just yet another copy of the zenith tree and I'm tired seeing them.
It's not the game's fault that you're running a stupid build.  
Summoners have the luxury to be able yo use any weapon they want efficiently, you chose not to because "iT doEsN'T SAy SuMmoNEr DAmAge", that's absolutely, 100% on you.

Summoners, when played decently, are absolutely and perfectly fine. If you choose, purposefuly, to run a shitty build, you shouldn't complain.
    First I can complain about anything I want ( ironic coming from someone complaining about something that doesn’t exist)

Second I play summoner "decently" as you say it. I’m not complaining about the fact that summoner is a hard class to play you can complete the game with every class if you want.

But there’s so little summoner weapon in the game it doesn’t even feel like a true class but just bonus damage for other classes and what’s wrong with adding more weapon to a class ? If you don’t want to play with them just don’t use it , what’s wrong with that?
*That's...that's kinda the point.*

*Yaknow, "zenith summon"? it's right*

*There in the title*

            That’s ... because it was clearly sarcasm? I even apologised for saying it.

                        well you're right. im not really good at understanding sarcasm
    Idk how you can call it original when they just made new summoning weapons and used the exact same tree as zenith for some of them. Like making a new weapon from crimtane ore just like the one used in the terra blade. It's not original and it shouldn't be how the crafting tree should be if they were to add it.
        1. Never claimed it was original m8 Its just a fun what if. And spriting new stuff from the existing color palettes is a really great pass time.

2. Never said "woah this should be vanilla" either.
            Don't worry my guy. Its only jerks like these who don't appreciate ur hard work. Original or not, this is amazing af
        Why shouldn't summon have a weapon made from crimtane and demonite? Summon literally only has 5 minions pre hardmode and 2 of them are really annoying to grind for, 1 is pure random chance and 2 are just craft it once you can
            He said that there *shouldn't be one*
                Yeah sorry, typo. I've fixed it now.
        Mate it’s probably more original than anything you’ve ever made, the point of it is to be like the zenith crafting tree which you’d know if you bothered to read the title. And even then about half of it is original summon staffs that he made, so yes it is original now go back to whatever sewer you crawled out from.
            My Ad Hominem detector is going insane rn
            >and half of it is original summon staffs that he made

But its not, its just the same crafting tree as the terra blade but with summoning weapons instead. True optic staff instead of true Excalibur, demonite/crimtane staffs aswell, exactly like the terra blade. It's not original at all its literally a carbon copy of the zenith tree. I'm not trying to detract from OPs work on the sprite art but cmon man its the exact same crafting tree.
                Wow it’s almost like the title calls it the zenith summon!!!! The point of it is to be the zenith of staffs therefore it has the same crafting tree!!! It’s like someone replaced your brain with a bag of shit just to see what would happen and this is the result.
                    Lol ok
        I agree. I really don't understand why saying this is unoriginal gets you downvoted.

Ironically, i got upvoted once for pointing out the obvious unoriginality on a zenith crafting tree like this. (it was the bow one from june/july i think)
Reddit Logic for you buddy.

        You must be fun at parties.

                    Better get used to it buddy
You can get them from crates.
    God damn, crates are even more OP than I thought I guess
        Well its a 1% chance from a titanium crate, me and a friend grinded for hours with a gold hook, master bait, fishing and crate potions and still didnt find it.
            gotta use those luck potions
                Luck potions don't affect what you get from grabbags.
    It's the right answer, but the worst answer. I never want to fish again in my life (anglerrrrrrr)
Do you know how powerful that is early game? It took me from first night to post EoC and still helped in my fight against BoC. It's amazing!
Btw, as a note, on reddit, you don't need to include the username of the person you are replying to, they will get the notification regardless.
    yeah ik I just wanted to make sure they knew I was responding to then
        I haven't really seen that to really be a problem on reddit, so I think you're good not doing it.
Fair.
You can get an enchanted swords by creating and running through small worlds and deleting them afterwards. I'd say enchanted sword is much easier to get
    And you can do the same for finch staff so I guess it’s decided then
I've found maybe 20 enchanted swords in my playthroughs. I've found 0 slime staves.
Slime staff is at least guaranteed, without fishing.
I want to say they removed that in 1.4, but i might very well be wrong, I can’t recall
    this is what it says on the wiki.

An easy way to obtain the Slime Staff without much effort is to construct a statue farm with one or more Slime Statues, and lava just deep enough to not destroy any drops as it kills the slimes. Leave it alone for a while, and occasionally check if the staff has been dropped yet. Using advanced setups like engines and multiple statues can greatly accelerate the process. Note that as of version 1.3.0.1Desktop, Console, and Mobile Versions, there is a limit to how quickly statues can be triggered.

If you even slightly look into it you will see the crafting ingredients are the weapons for the class you have gathered throughout the stages of the game, which is waaay too similar to calamity not to be noticed.
    so, the Terra Blade/Zenith??? which this was based on???
        This man doesn't understand that you can't copyright large crafting trees
    r/usernamechecksout
I also really really enjoy the colors.
    It's really cool how Gold and Purple mix together into a really cool green. I'm not even sure what the exact color of the Terra Blade is but it's like Greens Equivalent to Gold as Gold is to Yellow. The enchanted parts of the True Weapons look really cool in Pixel Art, especially with the Blade being opposite, Light and Dark
        Maybe make a summon for each of the bosses? There's already a lot for many of the existing ones. Optic staff, Slime staff, Pygmy Staff, etc.
No? Its a mage weapon?...
    i thought it was a mage weapon that he was making ::/

big dum
Nah shes pretty easy to learn. Moon lord will alway keep you on your toes atleast.

Also Moonlord only drops sentry summons. And I'm excluding sentries because I'll be making them their own class if I ever get around to making this into a mod.
    I dunno man, master mode moonlord was still cheesable, beat the boss with 1 hand on mouse, i could just stand still and face tank the hits, at least against empress there is no such thing as standing still
        Every boss is cheesable man. And you can only tank as melee class tho? There was no tanking that as summoner or mage. Possibly even ranger. I had 70 defense as a a ranger hybrid and I definitely had to dodge or else.

Empress can be cheesed because she attacks in a preset pattern. And its actually rather easy to manipulate where they go. And much easier to see than moon lords projectiles.
            I have played the game with master mode for the worthy with all seeds, not mean't to come off as rude, it's true empress has a pattern that she repeats but i find myself getting hit with those way more often than moonlord since all of moonlords attacks are easy to see through, every attack of his shines or shows that it's coming before it happens letting you plan ahead, but this is only opinional thing, reason why i feel empress being harder is because i dont focus on the pattern so every dodge comes by reflex
                I don't think I can count For the Worthy as viable judge wether something is harder or not. Because she gets increased attack speed there.

    The clear indicator is the apology in brackets, you just failed to pick it up. If anything the irony created by the comment enhances and makes the sarcasm even clearer
        well you're right. im not really good at understanding sarcasm
Yeah sorry, typo. I've fixed it now.
Wow it’s almost like the title calls it the zenith summon!!!! The point of it is to be the zenith of staffs therefore it has the same crafting tree!!! It’s like someone replaced your brain with a bag of shit just to see what would happen and this is the result.
    Lol ok
I really hate reddit speech
    Better get used to it buddy

I don't think I can count For the Worthy as viable judge wether something is harder or not. Because she gets increased attack speed there. 

And when I meant easy to see, I meant like there isnt some annoying fuzzy filter on the screen with a million things going on at once.. Empress always attacks from a single location. True eyes can be all over the place if they like. And you also just can't dish out damage super quickly to be done with the fight.
