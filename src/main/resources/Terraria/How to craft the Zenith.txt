[[How to craft the Zenith]]





Obsidian = Waterbucket + Lavabucket

Waterbucket = Bucket + Water
    Bucket = iron + anvil
        Anvil = iron + workbench
            Iron = furnace + iron ore
                Furnace = Stone + Torches
                    Torches = wood + gel
                        gel=slime+zenith

                            Zenith = enchanted sword and terra blade

Terra blade = true Excalibur and true nights edge

True nights edge = broken hero sword and nights edge

Nights edge = muramasa and fiery great sword

Fiery great sword = hellforge and hellstone bar

Hellstone bar = hellstone ore and obsidian
 
Obsidian = lava bucket and water bucket

Water bucket = water and a bucket

Bucket = iron bars and a anvil

Anvil = iron bar and furnace

Furnace = stone and torches

Torches = gel and wood 

Wood = tree and axe

Axe = any ore and a work bench

Work bench = wood and no crafting station

No crafting station = inventory and a new character

New character = getting terraria and a platform to play it on

Platform to play terraria = going to the store and money

Money = hard work and a job

Job = skill and knowledge


what am I doing with my life
                                Skill and Knowledge = School
                                    School = Clever Humans

humans = Gorillas

Gorillas = Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs = Lizards

Lizards = Fish

Fish = specks

Specks = Earth

Earth = Asteroids

Asteroids = Sun

Sun = Solar System

Solar System = Milky Way

Milky Way = The Universe

The Universe = Nowhere

                            Gel = slime + copper shortsword
                                Copper Shortsword = 9.99$ + pc
                                    PC = $1000 + shipping
                                    $9.99 = 1 hour + Minimum wage Job
                    Torch = Gel + Wood
    Water = Water + Water
        Water and Water and Water Water
    Bucket = Iron bar+ anvil
    zenith = zenith + zenith

    And meowmere and starfury
        I killed like 30 moon lords and didn’t get meowmere so I just gave up and cheated it in
            that's horrible
            Ouch, and I thought my 26 kills was bad.

Walked out with like 6 SDMGs.

  


The worst was the meowmere minecarts, because every time they dropped I got excited thinking it was meowmere.
                wanna know something?

When I kill for the first time Moon Lord it gave me the Celebration...
                    Can you get the seedler on terraria for 3ds? I tried so many times but still nothing
                        Neither seedler nor zenith are on 3DS, and they never will be as the platform was abandoned in 2016
This is a phenomenal shitpost, thank you
    What do you guys call shit post ? I'm from 9gag so, over there, this post would be considered absolute gold.
        Honestly, calling something a “shitpost” has never been anything to do with the quality, just a certain energy something has. This is absolute gold tho
            Shitposting is a state of mind.
                It's a state of being. Like solid liquid or gas but for vibes
                    This comment is gold
                        Liquid butt gold!
                            So Midas' diarrhea?
                                Wait how does Midas poop.
                                    what about when he has to pee
                                It costs you exactly $0.00 to not post this.
                    I am the vibe
                Shitposting is a lifestyle
            A shitpost =/= a shit post

I guess it's more about the demeanor of it, taking a ridiculous, facetious route
                Solid Shit

Liquid Shit

Naked Shit

The Shit

Venom Shit
                    Nano machines, shit!
                        !
            I love that description. Shitpost vibe.
            Used to be called lowbrow comedy/humor, now it's a shitpost.
                Underrated
        [deleted]
            No, I kinda guessed it but I wanted to be sure. So basically, a shitpost is a meme / bad joke.
                [deleted]
                    I believe, under these guildines, it is indeed a shitpost
        I'd say the best way to sum up a good shitpost would be "When OP posted this, they had a shiteating grin on their face". As another person said, it's very much about the type of energy.

What exactly entails a shitpost varies from sub to sub since each one has their own culture so to speak. They often skirt or break the rules of a sub, but very intentionally and in a tongue and cheek fashion. Often rules related to no memes and/or "low quality/effort". That's probably where the concept came from, intentional low effort/quality posts that are funny in part because they're low quality in the first place. So it's a shitty post, but at the same time amazing.

Also, brave of you to mention you're from 9gag. Welcome to reddit, turn back now or all is lost.
        Mostly shot posts just have that energy to it.
        >  I'm from 9gag

This comment is a shitpost and literally no one understood it
        A shitpost typically refers to either an extremely low-effort post or a meme post. In this case it would be a strong example of the latter. 

Also I wouldn’t recommend saying that you’re from 9gag. A lot of the younger crowd on this site will harass you for that.
        No, see, a shitpost is something that makes you say “what the shit” either in a good way or a bad way.
        Well there’s your problem, you’re from 9gag
        Something that's posted on 9gag would usually be considered a shitpost.
            Or just shit

    Zenith has more ingredients than anything.
        But they’re a lot less random chance, and you can start working on it as soon as you start the world.
            you can? even if you don't want you already have one of the materials, you MUST
                Journey mode would like to talk
                    well, good point in that case, probably the only time mining copper to make a weapon makes sense to me
            I mean, fuck the fish finder
                Fuck the angler, hard in the ass.

    Fucking cell phone man lol this video would have to be like 5 times longer
        Cell phone = Magic mirror + PDA

PDA = REK/Goblin Tech/Fish Finder + GPS

GPS = Depth Meter/Compass + Gold watch

Gold watch = Gold bars + Chains

Chains = Iron bars + Anvil

Anvil = Iron bars + Work bench

It all boils down to the mighty work bench.
            Terraria indeed boils down to the humble workbench. Now, for some fucking reason, I have played for 400 hours and CANNOT EVER REMEMBER HOW TO MAKE A SAWMILL. Ever.
                One chain, some iron/lead, and some wood. Don't ask how I have that memorized.
                    why do you remember it?
                        I said don't ask bc I don't know why I remember it. Maybe because I make a bed in every world I make? Since the loom needs the sawmill. Idk
                            I remember the ingredients, but I always forget the quantities. I too need beds.
                i always loop around all my crafting stations trying to figure out in which one i can make copper bricks or some other random block that i need for a tiny roof or something and most of the time i dont even use it cuz i come to the realization that it looks bad
                It's the chain, I ALWAYS forget about the chain
            Plus all the fishing required.
I’ve been looking for years...what is the original video name!
    [i n f i n i t e DRAGON DREAM FEET](https://youtu.be/3K3MMtoG8rY)

It's the sequel to [ULTRA DRAGON DREAM FEET](https://youtu.be/eLYhnBaWOzc)
        Oh my god thank you so much!
        Obviously i n f i n i t e works for this meme, but ULTRA is a much better video.
        [my personal favorite version of the video](https://youtu.be/p-R1O7FN3yI)
        [The lesser known one](https://youtu.be/NApxz5bSl20)
            If this is a rick roll I swear
                Thank god
            Yeah that’s basically The Twinning in a nutshell ngl
            Best thing about this one is the colours match light party comp for ff14
            who is this man
        I’ve learned if you don’t think so
    I need this in my life, too.
    If i saw this meme earlier then i whould've  totally posted the link to Lennoz's infinite dragon feet so people wouldn't go search for it for ages. I am subbed to Lennoz from almost the very beginning of his channel and it was real nice to see his vid show up as a popular meme.
King slime as he loses health be like
This is so stupid......I LOVE IT
From r/all and have no idea what the fuck I’m looking at but I’m dying this is hilarious. Would love some context
    It’s the final sword in this game and to craft it you have to have a lot of swords you would’ve collected throughout the whole game
    Imagine that to craft the most powerful sword in the world, you need to get the most powerful swords from 100 different cities from 10 different continents.

I finally got my Zenith last night. This thing is stupid over powered, I love it to death!

        Good bot
Fantastic
For those who want to know the name of the video, it’s called infinite dragon dreamfeet
Should’ve put water and lava for the obsidian, but still this is god tier
    I would have but the og video ended
        Oh yeah. Still, I give you very high praise for this. Best guide to making the Zenith I’ve ever seen.
        Nitpick, but a Fiery Greatsword isn't made by Hellstone Bars + Furnace; it's Hellstone Bars + Anvil. But using the crafting station is a bit weird anyway since it's the first time you did that, so maybe the Blade of Grass would have been better, since that's made out of 2 ingredients. (Stinger + Jungle Spores)
            The furnace went completely over my head, I can’t believe i made such a dumb mistake. As for blade of grass i thought of adding it but fiery had more ingredients in case i needed to drag the video a bit more.
[deleted]
    Thank you i did not know it
I've found the quality shitpost that I never dream't  I would find.
I wheezed, thank you.
This is beautiful. I’ve looked at this for five hours now
Thanks to everyone that upvoted this, I really appreciate it. If you want me i can make an updated version with more ingredients for next weekend
“Help” made me laugh, good job op :)
Was planning to craft this thanks for the video. In all honesty though this was epic.
    Thank you
THERE’S A BETTER WEAPON THAN THE TERRA BLADE?!
    Yes it's been that way since past 1.2
    What rock you been living under, bud?
    Yeah its called the Influx Waver :\^)
        Influx Waver gang rise up
    There’s a harder boss then ocram????
        Who's ocram? I thought the last boss was skeletron...
            Sry I meant the eater of worlds..
    I just crafted the Nights Edge... why is that thing worse than the Fire sword...
        That's honestly how I felt about every stage of melee swords. A yoyo was better until influx. That's about the first time I cared to used a sword. Then you get the golem hatchet and just run around like a mad man autotargeting. 

I guess star wrath was nice to get early for farming moon lord. But melee is just so bad until you get zenith which is not even remotely a melee weapon. 

The archetype identities in 1.4 are just bad.
            I just got an Imp Staff and Bee Armor (and one of those extra summon stations) and running around with 4x fat cherub imps launching fireballs is amazing! Am I a summoner main (if that’s a thing) now??
                My friend was a summoner main. Then he found out how useless it becomes late game when you can't take a hit and your summons have mediocre AI. 

He definitely carried me though early game though.
We need more of these but for the cell phone and ankh shield
    I might do them if you liked this one that much
WHERES THE SHORTSWORD
Thank you sir! I haven’t laughed like this in a while!
*cries in Calamity*
I love this so much
I wanted to get all the parts here on console before the update but I can't get a gosh darn Seedler to drop )^:<
    Im on pc, Seedler was the last thing I needed and i swear I must’ve killed Plantera about 20 times before I got one... even Meowmere and Star Wrath only took about 6 Moon Lord fights total to drop
This is great
Hey you are forgetting the other side of the tree
    I might do the other one too

    Lucky you
This is the most beautiful thing I have seen
top tier post. And thanks.
    Thank you
I’ve watched this eight times now. This is beautiful. Thank you.
    Thank you too
I have spent a grand total of four hours grinding for zenith when I realized THAT 1.4 ISNT ON FUCKING XBOX
# comedy gold
The help at the end just... cherry on top... 10/10
What's funny is that it showed like 20% or 30% of the crafting recipe
# TOP POST ALL TIME

# 01/06/2020 - now
Congrats on top of all time
This is art
Awesome video.

Can I get how's that video/template called?
    I want It too
    https://youtu.be/3K3MMtoG8rY

Huh
Do the other half of the nights edge swords
    Oh god no
i kinda wished when each sword hit it did its specific thing like terra blade would make it rain projectiles on whatever it hit star wrath and star fury would rain stars on it etc and the copper shortsword would have a 4% chance to insta kill
    That would be cool but it would require so much patience that I don’t have
Don’t forget the copper short sword!!!
    Thats where 99.99999% of the Power  comes  from.
I actually was close to crafting the zenith when it got released. I lacked four things: influx waver, bee keeper, enchanted sword and, yes, copper shortsword.
Lmao
God, this is beautiful. Thank you
I imagine the creator of Fargo's soul mod laughing in his sit right now...
idk what's going on but i cant stop laughing
that’s dedication to your craft
    I was really bored
Change help to water and lava and then change lava to help.
What’s this called?
    Crafting?
        My bad, what’s the song called, and where do the original dance take place?
            Infinite dragon dream feet
This is great
LEGENDARY

This is the thing I needed to see today, thank you for that amazing tutorial
    It lacks a lot of ingredients but i hope it helped
Can't stop watching this
I found this quite halarius

I’ve already got all the materials



But I’m on mobile
    RIP
It's evolving, just backwards
I don't get it but I love the ending LMFAO XD
I completely lost it, legit wish I could give you *reddit* *luminite*
    You smile is all i need, hand it over
This will probably get buried but I actually met this guy multiple times he led a show choir event called America sings. He's actually a really nice guy
    I really want to meet him too
Omg! Lol. That was great!
    Thank you
I am happy I went through this hell to obtain a legendary Zenith
[deleted]
    I don’t use terrarria’s discord but know that i thought about this on my own and didn’t intentionally copy it from someone else
Wait they added another fucking step to the process of making the endgame sword
What is the original video, I love it

Wooooow didn’t plan out the script.*
How loud do you have against mooses?
How ya doin' Adamantite armor ?
Didnt night's edge have a extra sword to make? If i remember it was also the jungle sword
    It needs the Fiery Greatsword, Muramasa, Blade of Grass and Blood Butcherer or its corruption equivalent.

Fuck that woman. How horrible.

I stopped playing on my main world I poured over 300 hours in, came back for the update, was going to make the sword, but then realized I managed to lose all my swords except for star wrath, star fury, and of course copper short sword. I swear I had everything else until I logged back in.

Lmao, this is how to craft the terrablade, not the zenith. The whole zenith would be this + 9 more.
u/vredditdownloader
Obsidian should have been water + lava

u/Vredditdownloader
Hardest part is forgetting you need the copper sword, then finding copper,  then making it! Then remembering you had that one unused character you could’ve used
Bro that's impressive
I cannot recall the amount of times I’ve mistaken obsidian for coal, and tried to make torches with it

Bucket = iron + anvil

                        Zenith = enchanted sword and terra blade

Terra blade = true Excalibur and true nights edge

True nights edge = broken hero sword and nights edge

Nights edge = muramasa and fiery great sword

Fiery great sword = hellforge and hellstone bar

Hellstone bar = hellstone ore and obsidian
 
Obsidian = lava bucket and water bucket

Water bucket = water and a bucket

Bucket = iron bars and a anvil

Anvil = iron bar and furnace

Furnace = stone and torches

Torches = gel and wood 

Wood = tree and axe

Axe = any ore and a work bench

Work bench = wood and no crafting station

No crafting station = inventory and a new character

New character = getting terraria and a platform to play it on

Platform to play terraria = going to the store and money

Money = hard work and a job

Job = skill and knowledge


what am I doing with my life
                            Skill and Knowledge = School

humans = Gorillas

Gorillas = Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs = Lizards

Lizards = Fish

Fish = specks

Specks = Earth

Earth = Asteroids

Asteroids = Sun

Sun = Solar System

                                PC = $1000 + shipping
                                $9.99 = 1 hour + Minimum wage Job

That's if you're basic. Real men dig the water to the lava
And meowmere and starfury
    I killed like 30 moon lords and didn’t get meowmere so I just gave up and cheated it in
        that's horrible
        Ouch, and I thought my 26 kills was bad.

Walked out with like 6 SDMGs.

  


The worst was the meowmere minecarts, because every time they dropped I got excited thinking it was meowmere.
            wanna know something?

When I kill for the first time Moon Lord it gave me the Celebration...
                Can you get the seedler on terraria for 3ds? I tried so many times but still nothing
                    Neither seedler nor zenith are on 3DS, and they never will be as the platform was abandoned in 2016
What do you guys call shit post ? I'm from 9gag so, over there, this post would be considered absolute gold.
    Honestly, calling something a “shitpost” has never been anything to do with the quality, just a certain energy something has. This is absolute gold tho
        Shitposting is a state of mind.
            It's a state of being. Like solid liquid or gas but for vibes
                This comment is gold
                    Liquid butt gold!
                        So Midas' diarrhea?
                            Wait how does Midas poop.
                                what about when he has to pee
                            It costs you exactly $0.00 to not post this.
                I am the vibe
            Shitposting is a lifestyle
        A shitpost =/= a shit post

I guess it's more about the demeanor of it, taking a ridiculous, facetious route
            Solid Shit

Liquid Shit

Naked Shit

The Shit

Venom Shit
                Nano machines, shit!
                    !
        I love that description. Shitpost vibe.
        Used to be called lowbrow comedy/humor, now it's a shitpost.
            Underrated
    [deleted]
        No, I kinda guessed it but I wanted to be sure. So basically, a shitpost is a meme / bad joke.
            [deleted]
                I believe, under these guildines, it is indeed a shitpost
    I'd say the best way to sum up a good shitpost would be "When OP posted this, they had a shiteating grin on their face". As another person said, it's very much about the type of energy.

What exactly entails a shitpost varies from sub to sub since each one has their own culture so to speak. They often skirt or break the rules of a sub, but very intentionally and in a tongue and cheek fashion. Often rules related to no memes and/or "low quality/effort". That's probably where the concept came from, intentional low effort/quality posts that are funny in part because they're low quality in the first place. So it's a shitty post, but at the same time amazing.

Also, brave of you to mention you're from 9gag. Welcome to reddit, turn back now or all is lost.
    Mostly shot posts just have that energy to it.
    >  I'm from 9gag

This comment is a shitpost and literally no one understood it
    A shitpost typically refers to either an extremely low-effort post or a meme post. In this case it would be a strong example of the latter. 

Also I wouldn’t recommend saying that you’re from 9gag. A lot of the younger crowd on this site will harass you for that.
    No, see, a shitpost is something that makes you say “what the shit” either in a good way or a bad way.
    Well there’s your problem, you’re from 9gag
    Something that's posted on 9gag would usually be considered a shitpost.
        Or just shit
Zenith has more ingredients than anything.
    But they’re a lot less random chance, and you can start working on it as soon as you start the world.
        you can? even if you don't want you already have one of the materials, you MUST
            Journey mode would like to talk
                well, good point in that case, probably the only time mining copper to make a weapon makes sense to me

Fucking cell phone man lol this video would have to be like 5 times longer
    Cell phone = Magic mirror + PDA

PDA = REK/Goblin Tech/Fish Finder + GPS

GPS = Depth Meter/Compass + Gold watch

Gold watch = Gold bars + Chains

Chains = Iron bars + Anvil

Anvil = Iron bars + Work bench

It all boils down to the mighty work bench.
        Terraria indeed boils down to the humble workbench. Now, for some fucking reason, I have played for 400 hours and CANNOT EVER REMEMBER HOW TO MAKE A SAWMILL. Ever.
            One chain, some iron/lead, and some wood. Don't ask how I have that memorized.
                why do you remember it?
                    I said don't ask bc I don't know why I remember it. Maybe because I make a bed in every world I make? Since the loom needs the sawmill. Idk
                        I remember the ingredients, but I always forget the quantities. I too need beds.
            i always loop around all my crafting stations trying to figure out in which one i can make copper bricks or some other random block that i need for a tiny roof or something and most of the time i dont even use it cuz i come to the realization that it looks bad
            It's the chain, I ALWAYS forget about the chain

It's the sequel to [ULTRA DRAGON DREAM FEET](https://youtu.be/eLYhnBaWOzc)
    Oh my god thank you so much!
    Obviously i n f i n i t e works for this meme, but ULTRA is a much better video.
    [my personal favorite version of the video](https://youtu.be/p-R1O7FN3yI)
    [The lesser known one](https://youtu.be/NApxz5bSl20)
        If this is a rick roll I swear
            Thank god
        Yeah that’s basically The Twinning in a nutshell ngl
        Best thing about this one is the colours match light party comp for ff14
        who is this man
    I’ve learned if you don’t think so
I need this in my life, too.
If i saw this meme earlier then i whould've  totally posted the link to Lennoz's infinite dragon feet so people wouldn't go search for it for ages. I am subbed to Lennoz from almost the very beginning of his channel and it was real nice to see his vid show up as a popular meme.
It’s the final sword in this game and to craft it you have to have a lot of swords you would’ve collected throughout the whole game
Imagine that to craft the most powerful sword in the world, you need to get the most powerful swords from 100 different cities from 10 different continents.
Smort
    B99
        Yeah

    Good bot
I would have but the og video ended
    Oh yeah. Still, I give you very high praise for this. Best guide to making the Zenith I’ve ever seen.
    Nitpick, but a Fiery Greatsword isn't made by Hellstone Bars + Furnace; it's Hellstone Bars + Anvil. But using the crafting station is a bit weird anyway since it's the first time you did that, so maybe the Blade of Grass would have been better, since that's made out of 2 ingredients. (Stinger + Jungle Spores)
        The furnace went completely over my head, I can’t believe i made such a dumb mistake. As for blade of grass i thought of adding it but fiery had more ingredients in case i needed to drag the video a bit more.
Thank you i did not know it
Thank you
Yes it's been that way since past 1.2
What rock you been living under, bud?
Yeah its called the Influx Waver :\^)
    Influx Waver gang rise up
There’s a harder boss then ocram????
    Who's ocram? I thought the last boss was skeletron...
        Sry I meant the eater of worlds..
I just crafted the Nights Edge... why is that thing worse than the Fire sword...
    That's honestly how I felt about every stage of melee swords. A yoyo was better until influx. That's about the first time I cared to used a sword. Then you get the golem hatchet and just run around like a mad man autotargeting. 

I guess star wrath was nice to get early for farming moon lord. But melee is just so bad until you get zenith which is not even remotely a melee weapon. 

The archetype identities in 1.4 are just bad.
        I just got an Imp Staff and Bee Armor (and one of those extra summon stations) and running around with 4x fat cherub imps launching fireballs is amazing! Am I a summoner main (if that’s a thing) now??
            My friend was a summoner main. Then he found out how useless it becomes late game when you can't take a hit and your summons have mediocre AI. 

He definitely carried me though early game though.
I might do them if you liked this one that much
Im on pc, Seedler was the last thing I needed and i swear I must’ve killed Plantera about 20 times before I got one... even Meowmere and Star Wrath only took about 6 Moon Lord fights total to drop
I might do the other one too

That would be cool but it would require so much patience that I don’t have
Thats where 99.99999% of the Power  comes  from.

Crafting?

I killed like 30 moon lords and didn’t get meowmere so I just gave up and cheated it in
    that's horrible
    Ouch, and I thought my 26 kills was bad.

Walked out with like 6 SDMGs.

  


The worst was the meowmere minecarts, because every time they dropped I got excited thinking it was meowmere.
        wanna know something?

When I kill for the first time Moon Lord it gave me the Celebration...

                Neither seedler nor zenith are on 3DS, and they never will be as the platform was abandoned in 2016
Honestly, calling something a “shitpost” has never been anything to do with the quality, just a certain energy something has. This is absolute gold tho
    Shitposting is a state of mind.
        It's a state of being. Like solid liquid or gas but for vibes
            This comment is gold
                Liquid butt gold!
                    So Midas' diarrhea?
                        Wait how does Midas poop.
                            what about when he has to pee
                        It costs you exactly $0.00 to not post this.
            I am the vibe
        Shitposting is a lifestyle
    A shitpost =/= a shit post

I guess it's more about the demeanor of it, taking a ridiculous, facetious route
        Solid Shit

Liquid Shit

Naked Shit

The Shit

Venom Shit
            Nano machines, shit!
                !
    I love that description. Shitpost vibe.
    Used to be called lowbrow comedy/humor, now it's a shitpost.
        Underrated
[deleted]
    No, I kinda guessed it but I wanted to be sure. So basically, a shitpost is a meme / bad joke.
        [deleted]
            I believe, under these guildines, it is indeed a shitpost
I'd say the best way to sum up a good shitpost would be "When OP posted this, they had a shiteating grin on their face". As another person said, it's very much about the type of energy.

What exactly entails a shitpost varies from sub to sub since each one has their own culture so to speak. They often skirt or break the rules of a sub, but very intentionally and in a tongue and cheek fashion. Often rules related to no memes and/or "low quality/effort". That's probably where the concept came from, intentional low effort/quality posts that are funny in part because they're low quality in the first place. So it's a shitty post, but at the same time amazing.

Also, brave of you to mention you're from 9gag. Welcome to reddit, turn back now or all is lost.
Mostly shot posts just have that energy to it.
>  I'm from 9gag

This comment is a shitpost and literally no one understood it
A shitpost typically refers to either an extremely low-effort post or a meme post. In this case it would be a strong example of the latter. 

Also I wouldn’t recommend saying that you’re from 9gag. A lot of the younger crowd on this site will harass you for that.
No, see, a shitpost is something that makes you say “what the shit” either in a good way or a bad way.
Well there’s your problem, you’re from 9gag
Something that's posted on 9gag would usually be considered a shitpost.
    Or just shit
But they’re a lot less random chance, and you can start working on it as soon as you start the world.
    you can? even if you don't want you already have one of the materials, you MUST

GPS = Depth Meter/Compass + Gold watch

Gold watch = Gold bars + Chains

Chains = Iron bars + Anvil

Anvil = Iron bars + Work bench

It all boils down to the mighty work bench.
    Terraria indeed boils down to the humble workbench. Now, for some fucking reason, I have played for 400 hours and CANNOT EVER REMEMBER HOW TO MAKE A SAWMILL. Ever.
        One chain, some iron/lead, and some wood. Don't ask how I have that memorized.
            why do you remember it?
                I said don't ask bc I don't know why I remember it. Maybe because I make a bed in every world I make? Since the loom needs the sawmill. Idk
                    I remember the ingredients, but I always forget the quantities. I too need beds.
        i always loop around all my crafting stations trying to figure out in which one i can make copper bricks or some other random block that i need for a tiny roof or something and most of the time i dont even use it cuz i come to the realization that it looks bad
        It's the chain, I ALWAYS forget about the chain
    Plus all the fishing required.
Oh my god thank you so much!
Obviously i n f i n i t e works for this meme, but ULTRA is a much better video.

    If this is a rick roll I swear
        Thank god
    Yeah that’s basically The Twinning in a nutshell ngl
    Best thing about this one is the colours match light party comp for ff14
    who is this man
I’ve learned if you don’t think so
B99
    Yeah
Good bot
Oh yeah. Still, I give you very high praise for this. Best guide to making the Zenith I’ve ever seen.
Nitpick, but a Fiery Greatsword isn't made by Hellstone Bars + Furnace; it's Hellstone Bars + Anvil. But using the crafting station is a bit weird anyway since it's the first time you did that, so maybe the Blade of Grass would have been better, since that's made out of 2 ingredients. (Stinger + Jungle Spores)
    The furnace went completely over my head, I can’t believe i made such a dumb mistake. As for blade of grass i thought of adding it but fiery had more ingredients in case i needed to drag the video a bit more.
Influx Waver gang rise up
Who's ocram? I thought the last boss was skeletron...
    Sry I meant the eater of worlds..
That's honestly how I felt about every stage of melee swords. A yoyo was better until influx. That's about the first time I cared to used a sword. Then you get the golem hatchet and just run around like a mad man autotargeting. 

I guess star wrath was nice to get early for farming moon lord. But melee is just so bad until you get zenith which is not even remotely a melee weapon. 

The archetype identities in 1.4 are just bad.
    I just got an Imp Staff and Bee Armor (and one of those extra summon stations) and running around with 4x fat cherub imps launching fireballs is amazing! Am I a summoner main (if that’s a thing) now??
        My friend was a summoner main. Then he found out how useless it becomes late game when you can't take a hit and your summons have mediocre AI. 

He definitely carried me though early game though.
My bad, what’s the song called, and where do the original dance take place?

Ouch, and I thought my 26 kills was bad.

Walked out with like 6 SDMGs.

  


The worst was the meowmere minecarts, because every time they dropped I got excited thinking it was meowmere.
    wanna know something?

When I kill for the first time Moon Lord it gave me the Celebration...
        Can you get the seedler on terraria for 3ds? I tried so many times but still nothing
            Neither seedler nor zenith are on 3DS, and they never will be as the platform was abandoned in 2016

you can? even if you don't want you already have one of the materials, you MUST
