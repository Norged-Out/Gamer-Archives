[[As of today Terraria is the second best rated Steam game.]]





That's kinda funny because I think Terraria and Portal 2 are the only games on Steam that I've completed 100% achievements.
    You have the 200 fishing quests? You deserve a medal or something.
        Thankfully since it's a cumulative achievement, I managed to do it on multiple full character/world play throughs with different updates, most recently of course with 1.4
        That one goes by in an afternoon if you're 'in the zone' and especially quick now that there are pylons in the game. Like, I often finish my fishing quest before 30 minutes of in-game time goes by because I have pylons set up next to a fishing hole in most biomes.
            How so? The slow part is not actually getting the fish but waiting for the day to reset.
                Im pretty sure you can also use a journeymode character to set the time to the next day and just grind them away.
                    But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
                        I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
                If you click on the head of the bed you sleep now, if you sleep time goes by faster. Doesn't work during events and in multiplayer everyone has to sleep.
                    But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
        Just got mine in 1.4 by spamming day cycles in journey mode after all this time lol
    I still haven't 100%'d Portal 2 because I have no one to play the co-op campaign with.
        The co-op campaign just takes the genius design of that game to a whole new level.   Find someone and play it ASAP.  I’d do it again but you’d probably rather play with someone who hasn’t solved it already.

                    CST Central time and idk the time lol. Probably afternoon. Add me on steam; name's the same as here
                        [deleted]
        That's me and every Total War game where I have like 92% completion and zero of the MP achievements.

Would probably be that way with Civ and EU games as well but those tend to have some really impossible single player goals.
    That's kinda funny because the fishing achievement in Terraria is a perfect example of a horrible achievement and the devs should feel bad about it.
        No disagreement from me. It took me multiple play throughs of extensive fishing. Enough to get every possible reward you can get by doing the fishing quests multiple times over during those play throughs and then I still had to do more fishing quests on top of that.
Deservedly so. All 5 of those games likely belong on that list as ive found noone who was into the genre of those games who didnt like them.
    Btw, whats factorio, never heard of it

            You're forgetting that you're not making enough blue circuits. Where is the bottleneck? Oh, it's in your oil production. Fix that. Now your red circuits can't keep up with all the blue ones you are making.

You need more.

Expand your red circuits production. You need to go under some smelting facilities, but that's fine, a few underground belts should do it. Great, now why isn't it making anything?

Green circuits. You need more of those. But plastic production is in the way. You left it there a while ago thinking it will be enough. It was time for an upgrade anyway. Spent the next few hours moving and expanding your plastic production, and trying to re-connect it everywhere. Gad that's a mess, but it works, so don't fix what isn't broken.

Right, now you expand the green circuits. You need more copper wire, but you're not making as much as your factory can anyway, just smelt more copper plates.  But your trains are on maximum capacity. You need more carts, and that means messing with the train station, but some other thing is in the way. You need to move it elsewhere. There goes another hour messing with train signals....

More copper. Great, now you can finally, finally go back to what you where... Wait what? I now need more iron? Shit, i missed work
                [deleted]
                    Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.

                            it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
                                Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                                    I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                                    however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                                    I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                                    Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
                                Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                                    right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                                    the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
                                Cracktorio
                            Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
                                Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
                            It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
                                The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
                            On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
                            Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
                            Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
                    It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
                        Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
                            I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
                                It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                                    Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
                            It's also still in Alpha.
                    Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
                        Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
                            You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
                                Organic nukes only
                    Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
                        That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
                            Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
                    It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
                        I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
                    But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
                    It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
                    Its much more
                Factorio is a game that I love, byt I hate myself whenever I play it because I'm so inefficient. I have no clue what I'm doing.
                    Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
                        My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
                            My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
                                Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
                        My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
                I used to play it with my brother for I dunno, 30-40 hours and I feel the scenario
                I feel this.
                Bad news: You aren’t consuming enough heavy oil so all plastic production has stopped. You thought you had that covered with overflow solid fuel production, but since you’ve got your nuclear power up and running and most of your furnaces converted to electric, you simply aren’t consuming enough of it and all your buffer chests are full.
                This is where I get stuck in the game, there’s so much to fix but I don’t even know where to start and half the problems are self-created in an attempt to avoid the problems
                i just had ptsd...thanks
                [deleted]
                Bought the game a *loooooooong* time ago, and my then-roommate warned me about it. I booted up the tutorial and told him to stop me after two hours.

Ten minutes later, my roommate messaged me, and the clock and the sun outside were mysteriously two hours ahead.

Never booted up the game again after that. If I started playing again without supervision, I'd probably starve to death at my computer.
                Dude you and the above guy completely sold me on Factorio...it sounds like gameplay that appeals to me. Will have to give it a try.
                Don't forget after fixing grew circuits, "What was I doing now?" And just walking through your factory trying to remember and seeing that iron is struggling so decide to fix that then wonder four hours away why green circuits are trickling, and then remember oh right. 

The factory must grow.
                Man I remember the last time I played, I decided to try the "main bus"/ribbon cable method of organizing conveyors. The mess of lines splitting and joining the main bus was *BEAUTIFUL*
            Good enough, will try soon
                Prepare for spaghetti belts. Also the factory must grow, it is always hungry
                    i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
                        Kill the natives xdddd
                This is top tier irony.  
It's like going to the alcoholic anons and start heavy drinking after hearing their story.  


I'm glad you're joining. *The factory must grow.*
                There is a [demo available](https://factorio.com/download) on their website *and their steam page too
                *The factory must grow*
                Be careful. It's a game that will take over your life until you complete it haha
            The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.

                        colonialism is just the final form of capitalism tbh
                British Empire simulator.
            Also, the devs are amazing.

They are obsessed with code optimization (figures, the game is made in c++) and bug hunting. Even in the early stage of early access the game was more polished than lots of games that consider themselves released.

Also, they are incredibly transparent, as they post an update on their blog every week ("Factorio Friday Facts") where they talk about their progress, visions, ideas, fixed bugs, yet another optimization they managed to squeeze out of the code and occasionally a mod showcase. As of now they've reached FFF#354 without a single missed week.

I wish every development studio had this kind of mentality.
            Ah yes, Rimworld but with more automation at the cost of less warcrimes.
                You say that like it's a bad thing. What's wrong with having colonists improve their Doctor skill by removing prisoners' legs, replacing them with peg legs, then removing the peg legs and reattaching them over and over again?
                    The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
                    The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
                        Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
                        Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
                    Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.

            The factory must grow to feed the factory.

            The factory must grow. why are you wasting time on reddit?
            They don't call it Cracktorio for nothing
        Real-time factory management game where you mine and process resources into various parts, research new technology and eventually try to build a spaceship to escape the planet you crash-landed on, all while trying to keep your base protected from the local giant bugs that are none too happy that you're there.  It's absolutely amazing.
            You dont escape the planet though? you just get research from launching rockets with satellites?
                Well yeah, technically you don't, but that's mainly because the game is supposed to be an infinite sandbox.  Launching the rocket is considered the win condition for the main game and you can choose to exit or keep playing.
                    Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
                        One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
                There are mods that add in space and the ability to colonies other planets.
        [deleted]
            All of this. The dedication to making the game run flawlessly is astounding.

You can have a factory consisting of millions of parts, and the game runs fine. At worst, it starts to slow down ever so slightly. And if it does, they give you the 'under the hood' tools to figure out which part of your factory is slowing down your computer and you can optimize that. And somehow even that is fun.

I have, never, ever, not even once, had the vanilla game crash on me.

            I can't think of a trailer that explains the heart of its game better
                It really does. It's seldom that a trailer alone sells a game for me, but the first time I watched it I knew I had to have Factorio.
        https://youtu.be/KVvXv1Z6EY8

Developers are awesome, there's great mod support, even though it's already awesome the game is changing for the better and the 1.0 version releases soon

E: https://youtu.be/DR01YdFtWFI
        Its a game where you land on a deserted planet and your ultimate goal is launching a satellite with a rocket which you both handconstruct. You do this by setting up a system of factories which automatically mine resources and refine them into parts that you use to build more factories which mine other resources which can be refined into more parts and you aim to automate as much as possible of this process. Quite a fascinating game.
        The thing that just ate the entirety of my week so far.
        Its a game that will take every waking ounce of thought you have blend the days and nights together and turn your dreams into crude twisted machinations of robot arms, optimal ratios, and novel routes to efficiency.

 anyways 10/10 game
        Prepare yourself to disappear for days on end.

Make sure you notify loved ones so they don’t worry

    I like open world rpgs, I’ve tried the Witcher 3 multiple times but I just can’t get into it. Portal 2 and Terraria are definitely some of the all time greats, though. Never tried Factorio, and I didn’t like Stardew, but I wouldn’t consider myself a fan of whatever genre it is.
        same opinion on the witcher
        I enjoyed Witcher 3 and all but I don't find it to be nearly as good as people hype it up to be.  I felt like it was just bland combat, cutscene, bland combat, cutscene over and over.  Last game I can think of in that genre I really enjoyed was dragon age origin
            My main gripe was the fucking character movement. I just can't play a game with such good graphics and see Geralt running around like an Oblivion NPC. It's too weird.
                The horse riding drove me insane sometimes.  Maybe RDR2 spoiled me but my god did I hate controlling my man Roach sometimes.
                Another issue I have with the game is that if you don't like Geralt or don't find him interesting- tough luck, he's fully voiced and his mug is in every cut scene
                    So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
            See, and I really enjoyed the combat, when it was Me VS 1 Enemy. Like the griffon fight. Fucking loved that. There was a quest I had to find some crazy guys goat and I ended up fighting a bear. Another fantastic fight. Found the typical "Oh no, I'm turning into a monster. I gotta hide" house. The guy was a werewolf in a cave under his house. If it hadn't been for my sword breaking, it would have been a fucking amazing fight.

But you put me up against more than 2 enemies and the combat just dies. Every single good thing I have to say about the combat gets pulled out and thrown away when you fight more than 1-2 enemies. It goes from almost Souls-like or Monster Hunter-like combat, where you KNOW this enemy is stronger than you and your only hope of beating them is to not get hit, to a mindless, repetitive slog of "dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, get a single attack in, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge..." until you want to kill yourself.

This doesn't even touch on geralt. He is the most bland, 1-dimensional character I've ever seen. To the point where if you pick a dialogue option that isn't in that 1 dimension he's "good" at, it feels like someone has a gun to his head and is forcing him to say it.

And honestly, I kinda hate that I don't like the game. Its such a good game held back by too many enemies and a terrible protagonist.
            I really liked dragon age inquisition
        Would have been amazing if it had a better combat system.
        I love action adventure RPGs. Witcher 3 is the worst action adventure rpg I've ever played. Every aspect of the gameplay, from combat, to travel, to just navigating the menu system is like pulling teeth, and the story is like some greasy neckbeards dnd wet dream. I do not get why it's so popular.
            I'm shocked you're getting away with trashing it right now. I've been buried in downvotes before for saying it was overrated.
            What would you recommend instead?
                I had the same opinion as that guy and just off the top of my head I really enjoyed Skyrim, Dark Souls (all of them, even 2 is better), Bloodborne, Dragon Age Inquisition, Horizon.
                    As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
                Even dragon age 2 is better
        Also tried witcher and I don't like it either.
        That's because it's overhyped garbage that gets a review circlejerk from reddit. Didn't like it either in case it wasnt obvious.
    Almost all of the negative reviews on terraria is either people saying "stop looking at reviews and buy it" or "not my type of game"
        Yeah same with Factorio lol, i wonder what their actual ratings could be.
        Which is moronic, the games aren't flawless.
    Prepared for the downvotes but, as someone who's into those genres I was really excited about The Witcher 3 and it's story, but after completing it I didn't feel like it was anything more special than most games from the genres both story and gameplay wise. I honestly think it's really overhyped compared to other games from the top 5.
        Stardew Valley is kinda overhyped too. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and I love it. But objectively, Rune Factory 4 has almost everything that Stardew also has and has generally more content and 100x better story.
        I have never played a game that had this big of an open world without it feeling empty. All of the side quests are good with many have great stories. Multiple different endings, good gameplay, great voice acting, and cheap dlc that DOUBLES the length of the game. It does all that while having some of the best graphics around (when it released). Oh also a good modding community.
    Hard disagree with TW3

That game is just... not enjoyable at all to me, and I love RPGs
    I didn’t like the witcher, the story felt very slow, the graphic were oversaturated, and the combat was extremely meh.

I only played for like 8 hours, apparently the story gets good at hour 20, which in my opinion is a bad story.
    My man I'm not even a fan of farming games, I hate them to be honest, but stardew valley, I put 900 hours into that shit, and nobody can get between me and my pumpkins.
    I have played all of those and I thought the Witcher 3 wasn't anywhere near my GOTY for that year. 

I also think portal 1 is by far superior to 2
        Portal 2 expanded on everything that Portal 1 did right. Maybe going from nothing to Portal 1 is just a bigger leap than going from Portal 1 to Portal 2, and that's why you think Portal 1 is better?
        Well thats just like, your opinion. Also none of what youve said implies you disliked either of them.
            True. I didn't hate any of them. I just don't really get the top 5 of all time thing.

I also low-key get annoyed everytime I see people loving the Witcher 3 because it feels like a party I wasn't invited to.
                How dare you not like Sir Geralto's Lusty Gwent Adventure? Please delete your Reddit account now. 

Jokes aside, it's a shame it didn't catch on for you. Have you tried watching the Netflix show instead?
                    No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
                        Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
                            I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
                    The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
                I tried to play Witcher 3 twice and just wasn't hooked, despite being a huge fantasy RPG fan. Fuck sake I was more hooked by the broken shitshow that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance than Witcher 3.
                    Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
                        I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
                        I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
                if you need some company I didn't like it as well. The first like 10 hours are fine because novelty and stuff but afterwards all I was thinking was "I could've replayed mass effect instead".
        Portal 2 has J.K. Simmons. You're obviously insane. Seriously, though, and no pun intended, I found Portal 2 to be a much deeper game.
    I was not a fan of the Witcher despite liking s lot of other games like it frankly.
    Stardew Valley is great, but got too boring for me to even finish the first winter \[at the third day of winter I had already managed to finish all the bundles/get married/etc. - all that seemed to be left was grind, despite all the mods I was using\]. Still a thumb up though.
    TW3 is kinda boring honestly, same with Stardew Valley
    I absolutely love fantasy games, thousands of hours in Elder Scrolls, Middle earth, and others. But I cannot get through 15 minutes of the Witcher 3. Too many naked scenes, cut scenes, and directed narrative. Its very boring for me, like when does the game start
    I agree, I played stardew valley and fell in love with the style and music
    I have a friend who doesn’t like terraria because, “it’s not like the sims, you can’t time jump”
    Portal 2 is easily my favorite story game all-time. I’ve never had more fun playing through a game.
    I really didn't like witcher 3 but like that genere tho, in fact I really enjoyed witcher 1 but hated 2
all i can say is....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stardew Vally is in the top 5? i love that game (not more than terraria) i didnt know it was in the top 5, wow, these games came far
    Stardew valley honestly blew up and has a huge following like Terraria does.
        Stardew is on like every console + mobile as well. The dude that created the game made so much bank.
            *And* he's still coming out with content for the game. Content that's free.
                Which is exactly why both Stardew Valley and Terraria are in the top 5.
            Deserved.
                Honestly though, such a great game
                Totally, he worked many years alone on it
                Totally deserved, all the love and sweat put into the game shows.
            Absolutely deserved it too, guy made almost every part of the code, art, story, music, everything. Dudes a genius
                That's not something the ape would tell you.
                He did do everything. He worked on the game for four years before it was released and made $1m within the first 12 days of the pc release. Only time he got someone else to help him was with the code for the multiplayer update.
            And it was just one guy coding everything and designing everything for such a long time, he just decided to add people to the team when they added multiplayer cause he couldn’t do it himself. The guy is a mastermind
            Even more shocking is Factorio, imo.
        some say its the poor man's animal crossing, I say its the more accessible, deeper narrative version ~~if~~ of animal crossing.
            I thought it was way more fun than Animal Crossing (that being said I only played Animal Crossing on GameCube)

But Stardew Valley is just an improvement to games like harvest moon
            It's better than AC imo
                Yeah, you can't fuck the villagers in AC and have kids with them.
                lowkey think so too, just not planning on rustling any feathers hehe
    How’s stardew valley compared to say Animal crossing?
        In my opinion more goal oriented and "gamey". In animal crossing you can spend a day doing nothing and you haven't really lost anything. In stardew valley you want to progress more quickly to be ready for village events etc. Still a very relaxing game though
            I'd like to point out you don't really need to tho if you don't want. You can just chill for years and there's really no downside.
                There's only like two time-sensitive events, one cutscene with a NPC and a 'scoring' system for your farm. The latter can be repeated so really not a worry.

I still panic rushing home from the mines at 1am.
                    Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
                        You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
                            You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
                                i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                                    Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
                    whats cutscene with a box?
                        [deleted]
            Man, I think I just can't chill in games. Animal Crossing stressed me out as I felt like I was a failure if I didn't get on it and do my daily chores. It made me quit it, I'll probably go back at some point.
                Same happened to me with daily quests in World of Warcraft. Those made me quit when I realized I was rushing home from work to basically do virtual chores.
            [deleted]
                Sounds like you just want to pack too much in. You just have to get there's nothing wrong with spending the whole first 6 months just fishing if you feel like it. There's no real victory condition or end to the game. Take it slow.
                    I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
        Mildly similar, more in how it makes you feel than how it's played. Stardew is more farming focused, but you also get to raise animals and make artisan goods and you can totally avoid farming entirely if you prefer.

Similarities:

* Relaxing ambiance (with plenty of min-max potential for those who want that)

* "Play your way" style of game, with customization in the layout of your farm and the decorations in your home/building (not as many options to customize as Animal Crossing)

* Big collection component (fish, artifacts, recipes, crops, foraging)

Differences:

* The town is pre-set, townspeople don't move in/out

* The relationship system is emphasized more, with the ability to date/marry/divorce/have kids with a variety of dateable characters. There are also "heart events" you can trigger as you get closer to them, which are cutscenes or special scenarios where you typically learn more about them and get closer to them

* More structure/guidance in the core goals of the game (never required, but for those who feel too aimless in Animal Crossing this gives you more things to actively work toward)

* It's more bingeable - an ingame day takes ~15 min IRL, but you can go to sleep earlier to move to the next day. So you can play through a whole year without stopping if you want
            Thanks! That sounds like something my fiancé and I would enjoy. Is there a way for us to play together or visit each other’s farms like you can in AC?
                Yes actually, you can have multiplayer farms! One person has to host the file and get past the intro, then up to 3(?) players can have cabins on that farm and play together. You can also marry each other if you want. 

Or, you could each have separate save files but also each have a cabin on the other’s file, and then you could play together sometimes and alone sometimes.
                    Sounds perfect thank you!
                The game is multiplayer, you can have separate houses as well.
                It does have multiplayer, but it may work a bit differently (haven't played AC), you generally want to start a shared farm from the beginning.
                    Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
                        Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
            As an addendum, you don't need to engage with the other townsfolk at all to have an enjoyable experience. I haven't given one gift in any of my three playthroughs.
        [deleted]
            I think you’ve convinced me! Now to decide to buy it on my switch or PC 🤔
                It's a tough choice. Both are great, the ability to play anywhere even for a few minutes is perfect, but there are some mods I can't live without on my more serious farms.

I still suggest playing without mods at first, but by year 3 or on another playthrough, definitely look into them.
                PC for sure. It's way cheaper, I think slightly further along in updates, and you can mod it. Not even a debate in my opinion, unless of course you prioritize mobility over everything else.
                It’s nice being able to play in handheld mode on switch, the downside is the loading times are far longer than on pc. Pc also has the benefit of time-saving inventory shortcuts. It’s really not that different, it all depends on what matters most to you.
        Playing Animal Crossing eventually felt like chores to me. Stardews characters have a bit more depth,  tasks can be automated, and the game has more direction.
    Makes me *so* happy to see it in the top 5, very deserved imo. I think it's my favorite of the top 5. Such an awesome feat for a solo developer
    Stardew Valley has soo much charm and character with completely engaging gameplay. If you like the genre Stardew Valley is the best.
    Stardew Valley is amazing. It was one of those games I got during a sale because I heard it was good, but never actually played. I was bored one day so I tried it out, and it was an instant favorite from the moment I started playing. I love everything about it (except the flying snakes in the Skull Cavern) and highly recommend it to everyone.
    Can I play cross-platform switch and PC??? :(
    Unpopular opinion: stardew valley is boring as hell, the mining mechanics are garbage, watering your plants every day is a pain in the ass, the npcs are really boring to talk to and I hate having to follow a schedule. You play games to escape work, but the game feels like work. I’d rather play minecraft as my « relaxing game » because I can do whatever the hell i want.
HAHAHHA IS NUMBER 6 EURO TRUCKING SIMULATOR 2?!
    yes it is
        i dident know that meny people had the game .. i mean i have it and its alright ig
            It rules.
                ETS2 isn't flashy or genre definitely but it does what it wants to go extremely well. The models are super detailed and there are a lot of great features like tuning into actual radio stations and landmarks.


Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.
                    > Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
                        oh you have the patience to even attempt this
                    I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
            It has a very strong fanbase. 

Personally, I thought it was neat but got boring after about 10 hours or so.  Once I got the hang of parking and driving and upgraded beyond the shit slow early trucks you get, there's not much more to it.  And the locations are all super basic.  American Truck Simulator at least does a lot better job in that regard.
    Seriously, it's a really good game.
        is itt?
            it's surprisingly fun, very relaxing. a great game to play while talking to friends or attending a boring class in college. the online adds a whole new layer of fun to be had. it's very satisfying to get a shitload of money after driving for 3+ hours. plus it's often no more than 5 euro on sale.
                Not saying its bad it just gets boring after a while
                    Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.
    I absolutely love the game. Multiplayer mod is a cool addition when the admins are active too!  Its absolutely addicting, having a wheel or not.
        Had trouble enjoying the game with a key board and mouse. After I got a controller I gave it another try, and clocked like 300 hours in less then a month. The game is so relaxing!
        i cant see it being addictive all i can see it as is mabey relaxing because all you do is.. well Drive
If you are interested in the full list here it is [https://steam250.com/](https://steam250.com/)
    Cheers for that. 

Also Return of the Obra Dinn being down at 135 is criminal, and yes I know that's still with 96% positive reviews. Never played anything like it, and think it's unlikely I will again.
    I'm happy to see some Touhou games and also Rabi Ribi as high as they are
    Jesus fuck why is Doki Doki up so high? That game was an absolute dumpster fire.
        This seems like a complaint on the genre/anime art style than criticizing the game
Could be #1 if so many people weren't leaving "negative" reviews saying:
"Stop looking for negative reviews, the game is good, go buy it."
    Looking for negative reviews can be helpful to the potential buyer. I avoided many games that were ’supposedly good’, but contains elements I personally loathe.
        The only thing Terraria technically doesn't have is a full blown creative mode like Minecraft, but obviously that was an intentional choice and we were given journey mode, and mods/3rd party apps can do that for us, so it has everything, especially once mods come out
            Journey mode is so good. You can leave most of the challenge in but take out whatever grinding you think is dumb/not do things like mine out the marble biome of 4 worlds if you want a town made of marble.

                    Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
            Honestly pre hardmode summoner has problems
                and early hardmode. i have just spider armor and i’m unable to kill the mechanical bosses
                    It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
                        yeah
                        Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
                    you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
                        yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
                            For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
                            On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
                Honestly summoner in general is so underpowered that it feels weird that the class’s unbalanced state is apparently the final state of the game. 

I love 1.4 and all the stuff that it did add, but for a final update it did seem to leave just a few loose ends.
                pre _and_ hardmode. summoner still sucks, which is a shame
            \*Sad TmodLoader stuck in 1.3.5.3 noises\*
                Is there anywhere to see their progress? It would be interesting to know how far they are into development
                    sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
            I mean... for people that buy games for the building aspect that is a pretty big deal. Completely fair to not want to buy it based on that.

For the people saying Journey is a comparable mode, it’s just not. The research thing is so gimmicky and you still need to get plenty of the resource to actually build with it.
        I always go straight for negative reviews when seeing if I should get a game and if I can find some that are actual critiques I’ll listen to them and will then try to find actual praises in the positive reviews and I’ll compare the two

Too often I see in positive stuff just like “it’s a good game” and in negative I see stuff like “trash game”
    I'm sure the same happens to other games too, such as portal
        Can confirm the same for Factorio, too many """""funny""""" joke reviews are negative for the point of trying to get attention
    I’m keeping my review negative until they fix the Mac version.  It worked fine before the update, and then they broke it.
        This is why I don't understand people leaving good "negative" reviews. Not only are they literally decreasing the ratings of a game they like, but they are also crowding the negative reviews section, making justified negative reviews like yours harder to find, potentially misleading other customers. When I look at negative reviews of a game I'm planning to buy, I'm not looking for an excuse to hate the game, I'm trying to see if there are aspects of the game people dislike, that could potentially turn me off as well.
i thought that portal 2 would be way older for some reason.
    [deleted]
        [deleted]
            I think if you wanna get technical, Dota 2 came out of beta at some point between Portal 2 and HL:A as well.
                And then there's Artifact and Underlords as well
        Artifact counts damn it.  We count!!!!
            I think they made DotA Underlords since then as well. That counts at least as much as Artifact, right?
                They did.  And that also hasn't gone very well lol
        HLA isn't a actual game?
            An*
        HLA came out and it’s incredible.
        Half life alyx? That is definitely a real game
    It's really amazing how fast video game years go by. 

Realize that World of Warcraft, HL2, and Rome: Total War are all about to have their 16th birthday. Diablo 2 is now as many decades old as the number in the title.
That is really good seeing as nobody can compete with portal 2.
    That's cause portal 2 is the shit, recently I replayed it and the last 20 minutes are still one of my favourite parts of any game
        I think my favourite bit still has to be the start of chapter 9- 

>!GLaDOS: I think this is the part where he kills us!<

>!Wheatley: Hello! This is the part where I kill you!< 

>!Text on screen: Chapter 9 - The part where he kills you!<

>!Achievement unlocked: The part where he kills you - this is that part!<
            I just remembered the existence of that scene and now I can't stop laughing
            Fun fact: The music file for that part is called 
>!thepartwherehekillsyou.mp4!<
                Wasn’t there also an achievement at that part
                    the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
                    There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
                        Where you jump in the pit, right?
                            Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
            The music for that part is also called "the part where he kills you". 



But yeah, from that point until the end is the best part of any game ever
            Th best moment in any videogame ever
            My man Wheatley on the ledge and shit
            The sad part is that achievement only pops up the first time. 

It's an great joke that's never really the same the second time around.
            Fun fact. It’s called the part where he kills you because it’s the part where he kills you!
            God I love that game.
        Even better the massively giant door that just kept another normal sized door behind it.

Best joke in the entire game.
            There are so many good jokes but yeah that is one of the best
        recently played for the first time with a friend in coop

IT'S ULTRA FUN
            If you haven't already, PLEASE play the singleplayer story, too. It's beyond good. Gameplay is just as good as the coop, and it also has an absolutely amazing story with great voice acting and a lot of hilarious moments.
                I'm playing Portal 1's singleplayer first, but I will play PL2 afterwards.
                    Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
                        I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
                        Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past
        The turret orchestra will never not get tears into my eyes. It is the perfect ending and Chell deserved it so much.
            Look up the english translation of the lyrics, will create more tears
                I already know them mate, Italian opera I think is the original. It's beautiful. So fitting. Thanks for the suggestion though.
                    Ahh, cheers :]
                        Cheers to you too, fellow human :)
        I’ve never played it because my computer can’t handle it and it’s not on the PS4 or the switch. I am seriously considering getting my ps3 back out just for portal
            Even on the lower settings? Most older valve titles can run on nearly any system.
                I’m actually not sure. I know that my computer can barely run anything, so I usually just get it on consoles.
                    Ah ok. Portal 2 is still relatively newer compared to something like Half-Life 2 so I wouldn’t be too sure. But the games have all ran decently on the old laptop I had so it doesn’t hurt to check if you can run it.
                    Source Engine games are incredibly lenient on hardware, even the newer ones like Portal 2 from 2012 are well optimized. Most integrated graphics from the last 10 years or so can probably run it. Mind if you tell me your computer's specs, if you know any?
        That is why there will never be a portal 3. :(
        Cave Johnson is so unbelievably well performed that I seriously want to give JK Simmons a big, wet kiss on the mouth for it. 

That dude is just perfect in everything. Including the Ladykillers, which for some reason people hate.
        I am literally playing Portal 2 as I saw this post. I was mildly confused.
    Terraria is only 0.01 behind that's awesome
        And it has over 350k more votes
    I've never played it 😟
    Well if any game deserves a 10/10... 

That's not something easy (should not at least) to say that a game is perfect.

Lot of games are good, great, awesome, what you want. 

But perfect ? That hard. 

Portal 2 has an amazing story, a great gameplay, simple to grasp and intuitive, can cause some challenges without being too hard, is original, to my knowledge bug free (at least I was surprised when playing it that no matter in which hole I stuck myself I could get out), great level design, great voice acting, memorable characters despite them being two robots and a bunch of pre-recorded messages, mod support that makes it infinite, great humor, enjoyable co-op play, etc, etc, etc.

So yeah. Stays at the top.
    A great game but I honestly prefer portal 1. It was just a little tighter and more focused for me which I liked. Portal 2 is still a great game though.
Never tried Stardew Valley. Similar?
    You’re a farmer! There’s mines with monsters, and fun magical critters. I highly recommend it, watch a couple videos for it. I believe it was also a one man developer show, he made everything himself?
        That's why i respect this game so much. The dude working on this game made it entirely by himself and a only a few months ago he started getting a team to help him
            Well, more like a few years ago. I believe he needed help with net code and porting the game. But yeh. So many great indie games are the vision of one person who has the ability to reach that goal
        Yeah, I'll never forget my dear farmer, [434].
            And my sweet chicken companion [74].... *F*
    Eh, it's more in line with animal crossing/harvest moon
        It's basically a Harvest Moon, but ***better***.
    If you know Harvest Moon, it's basically that, but better, it's a wonderful chill game.
    Similar art styles, but not much else. Imagine Animal Crossing, but with a lot more emphasis on the farming aspect.
    Thank you all for the responses. Sounds like Terraria is more my thing.
    It's like all the best stuff of Harvest Moon with none of the badness.
    It's like Harvest Moon, if you know what that is.
    The biggest similarity is that they're both fun as fuck. But no they're different games. SDV is a farm management RPG. And emphasis on the RPG part.
    It's like aninal crossing but better.
That's a solid fucking list of games doe
    I know I’m late on this but Portal 2 and Terraria are both one of my favorite games
Half the negative reviews are people telling good jokes or telling you to go back to the positive section of the reviews.
    How to keep a game you like from being #1 simulator
    "good jokes"
I finally gave in and bought The Witcher 3 two weeks ago.

But somehow it doesn't catch me. I was a little overwhelmed as there seemed to be too many features and gimmicks, the fighting system also seemed unnecessarily complicated. I'm sure it deserves the rating and I felt it was a highest quality game. 

I'm not sure how it compares to games from the same genre though, I rarely played those as I mostly avoided them in my last 22 years.

I can agree on all other games from that list. Must-haves.
    I had the same issue when I first started it. I didn't even get out of the first area. I put it down for a few months and came back to it. I'm so glad I did. The second time around, I was hooked. 120 hours later I can honestly say it is truly the best video game I've ever played. I hope you decide to revisit it, as it is certainly a gem.
        That gives me hope. I absolutely loved Zelda Breath of the Wild for example and I hope a similar love will unfold itself with the Witcher series.
        This is EXACTLY what I felt. My friend recommended TW3 so I bought it and I just couldn't get into it for some reason so I stopped playing it for a few months and decided to come back later on, which is not something I usually do. Probably the best decision of my life, once I got to the bloody Barron quest I was hooked. Three playthroughs later I can say that it's hands down the best game ever made, and CDPR is perhaps the most consumer friendly company, i got both expansions for £10 where other companies would probably charge £25 for each
    I think I would have liked it more if everyone didn't claim it was the GOAT. Like. It was a solid game but it didn't make my dick explode with joy or anything.
    Yeah, I played for six hours and then stopped because I just couldn't get into it with a ton of overloaded menus that aren't explained or at least not explained in time. I'm also not a fan of the sexualization but that's more of a me-problem.
    I tried to play it twice both times only getting 7 hours into the game
    Combat seems complicated until you realise all you need to do is 1 attack, dodge, repeat, and you'll breeze through everything.
        That's also when you realize the combat is pretty fucking boring
    Play it on the easiest difficulty. It's worth it to go through the story.
    Welp thats the Witcher series for ya. I can say the same that it really didn't click at first but when it clicks, it clicks hard. I absolutely love the Witcher 3 and I can absolutely say that it truly deserves a spot on the top 5.
As a Mac user with steam, FUCK CATALINA OS
    Bootcamp my dude
    I don't want to be *that guy*, but if you dual-boot a Linux distro, you could play a lot of games. There's this thing called Proton that runs Windows games in Linux, and works with a large number of games.

If you have any questions I'd be glad to answer them.
        All of the games on the list except the Witcher run natively on Linux too.
        Always be that guy my guy I appreciate it
    Y u p
Deserved. 
What is that Factoryo game..? Its about survival too?
    It's amazing and incredibly addicting. The whole game is basically about building the most efficient factories possible so you can gather materials and craft things but you keep unlocking new improvements like faster conveyor belts or train tracks and keep improving your factories. It should be classified as a drug honestly.
        I think your description underestimates how additive it is
    The other comment explained it fairly well, but there's also a demo you can try on the steam store
        Thanks :)
    Crashed on an alien planet, build a factory to survive, factory makes pollution, natives don't like it, attack your factory, build bigger factory to make defences to defend factory to make better materials to make bigger factory... repeat, suddenly its 5am and you need to go to work.

Aka: it's fucking fun, but a lot of maths if you really want to get into it.
    I'd belive that this video sums it up pretty good:

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcLqqmlNqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcLqqmlNqQ)
    It's like crack, addictive and you'll lose your girlfriend and family because you play too much
        I have both ,but i dont like them.. whatever,come Factorio hahahahha thanx for answer. I love reddit and users here.
    100% worth it. Time will go faster and before you know it you’ve spent 200 hours on the game
    It also comes with the equivalent of tModloader built in, and has tons of free mods that add thousands of hours of content and complexity. Best to do your first playthrough vanilla though, as the complexity that mods like Pyanodon or Bob's/Angels add would be overwhelming if you're just learning the game. I'd argue that the mods available are even richer and add more content and complexity than those made for Terraria.
    It’s primarily a game about design and automation. There are hostile aliens on the planet but no other survival elements (no food, illness, etc).
Factorio is fucking awesome
    It's one of those games that can cause me to look up and realize the sun is rising and oh god I have to be at work in 30 minutes!
Has potential to be #1 if there weren’t so many ‘negative’ reviews that are actually positive. 1* rating followed by “just buy the game already, it’s amazing” :’(
    That's a problem with Steam in general, not just Terraria's reviews in particular. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of those shitty reviews for Portal 2 as well.
    Question: is there any incentive to rate? 200k vote difference from the next highest is pretty big.
        There is a bit. The more ratings it has the closer it is to the actual percentage. I think factorio has a higher positive rating percentage but the lack of votes gives it a bit of a penalty. I'll try to find the formula...

Edit. It is more complicated than I thought but is explained by the list maker here: https://steam250.com/about
    Wouldnt that balance out since all games have those types of reviews?
I adore Terrarria, but Portal 2 is... its on a new level tbh
With like double the reviews of the number one spot too they are 0.01% off the score.  That's not too shabby at all.

Although lets be real all of those games are bangers.
Oh I’ve never reviewed, time to do my civil duty
Thats great news
should be no.1 considering it has nearly double the votes and managed to keep that average score regardless. Terraria is by far one of the best games ever made and I just hope their next game will be made with the same passion and love that made Terraria, Terraria.
    As someone who loves Terraria, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and deserve the number one spot easily.
        Agreed. As somebody who loves every game on the top 5 (and selfishly think Factorio deserves #2) Portal 2 at the #1 spot is deserved. IMO, Portal 2 is the best game ever made.
            I couldn't agree more. I love all of the games in the top 5 and have hundreds of hours in each of them, but Factorio has the best devs hands down. [They routinely chase down](https://preview.redd.it/i9e7ghpd5k131.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8bdc5afec843eabe500872f195e73827b8a4) bugs that one person in an edge case is having just so the game will be perfect for them.
        Words escape me for how good JK Simmons is in that game.
    Both games are absolutely amazing but tbh the portal series is much better and Portal 2 definitely deserves number 1.

\-Somebody who has played both Portal 2 and Terraria
    Portal 2 is in a class all it’s own, but I do agree with the people saying that terraria could be seen as having a stronger rating, since it has 0.1 less average rating, with 250,000 more people voting. That is incredibly impressive!
Ah, Victory
well earned. never have I seen a developer so dedicated to his game & fans. could have easily sold all the big updates as DLC.
Factorio is now made by EA and costs 30$? What did I miss?
    not made by EA, but rather Early Access (i know, it's so complete it doesn't look like one)
        It's coming out of early access on September 25th, too.
            Btw, they moved the release date to August 14 so it wouldn't compete with the release of cyberpunk 2077
                > release of cyberpunk 2077

jokes on them cyberpunk isn't coming out until it's actually 2077
                Ah yes, I forgot about that. Googled "Factorio 1.0" and it showed the blogpost where that date was stated, instead of googling "Factorio release date".
            Is it gonna go up in price when this happens? I figure it’ll never ever go on sale so I’m wondering if I should just buy it now
                They already increased the price a few updates ago, with the reason given being "the content in the game is already pretty much what's gonna be in the 1.0 version", so I don't think they'll increase the price further.
                I haven't heard of any plans of a price increase, but it has a free demo they've been tweaking for a while now to give you a feel of the gameplay loop. If you like that, then buy the game; it will be the best $30 you've spent in a long time.
    T H E  F A C T O R Y   M U S T  G R O W  !
    why tf does factorio never go on sale. i rly wanna try out the game but dont feel like dropping $30. I've probably waited 2 years now and I don't think it has gone on sale once.
        [deleted]
            Is it working or is it the only thing stopping their indie game from being the most sold?
                It's hardly even early access anymore. At this point they're just ironing out small kinks and optimizing. I have every achievement and over 600 hours in the game and literally never once encountered a bug or crash.

On top of that they give incredibly detailed weekly developer updates: https://www.factorio.com/blog/

At this point I think the only thing really holding it back is just word of mouth and the fact that it's sort of a niche genre.
                    I was going to say it seems like they're scared of the money drying up after Factorio and flopping the next game and prolonging it, but  I saw one of the devs responding to reddit threads about general questions and bugs with modded versions. 

Now it's like this is their passion project first and foremost and a full release is daunting because where do you go from creating an instant classic on your first crack?
                        I have absolutely no clue what happens after launch (*besides patches and possibly content updates)* but given the quality of Factorio I'll be along for whatever they do next. These guys have won me over.
                Definitely stopped me from buying it so far even though it’s right up my alley

Woo for being a single data point!
                    There's a great demo, you know.
        They have a demo that will show you if you want to play further.
        It will never go on sale. If you want to try the game out, download the free demo.
        well it used to be $20 for a long time, guessed you missed out
            I actually bought it for $20 lmao, returned it bc the steam sale was abt to happen. then the sales happened and it went up to $30 💀
                Lmao you got dunked
            Hehe, I got it for like £7.50 back in the original Indiegogo. I've had to buy it a couple times for friends since just because they're such good devs.
        Play the demo, if it grips you - it is well worth the money.
Despite having over 1350 hours more on Terraria, portal 2 is my all-time favorite game
imo Portal 2 is Valve's best work ever, they will never top that
    We really need a new portal game, or at least a better version of the level editor
All of them are well deserved, but keep in mind, that there are few ways of counting votes and making score list - so any top 5, even top20 are all games extremely worthy, and making a list of which one of them are very slightly better than others, is very personal at this point.

also Portal2 and Factiorio have 99%, while Terraria and 2 others only 98%.

ah, and Factorio is not released yet (im curious what gonna happen to that score after release - afaik many ppl avoid ea games by the personal rule - i mean both ea meaning, jk, i guess), then, over years, Factorio made while new gaming genre - automation, that inspired many other devs (ok, Minecraft was slightly earlier and was inspiration for Factorio, but not on that scale)

whatever - gz Terraria keeping the very top score.
I don't think it'll pass Portal 2, that game is even better than Terraria
I can agree those top 3 are the top 3 of steam.
    I'd put the Witcher below factorio personally
[removed]
    That's a problem with Steam in general, not just Terraria. I bet Portal 2 also has a bunch of those shitty reviews.
    That applies to every game on that list though, so it doesn't change anything
        Some have it more than others
            The list is already weird since it ranked a 99% rated game below 98%
Probably most of the negative comments are people saying just buy the game and stop looking at these comments.
Damn, those really are top 3 games of all time IMHO
Should be number one!
so happy that stardew is on the list
Portal 2 is amazing, in not disputing that, but personally I would put the other four above it. Lots of people call it perfect but it's easier to be perfect when you're that short. With DLCs you can easily get 100 hrs out of Wild Hunt and for me every minute of it is gold.
    I’ve got several hundred on Factorio, and I’ve only finished the game twice. No mods or dlcs, just amazing gameplay that makes you want to take your time beating the game.
I think Terraria should be #1
Still witcher best
How do you view this list? I can't find it on steam, and trying to Google search it gives an entirely different list.
    It's Steam250.com
    > trying to Google search it gives an entirely different list

What did you search for?
Everyone get to reviewing terraria we need #1
It deserves to be #1
All great games! I am surprised that Rimworld isn't up there, though.
casual observation, it is also second but with over 500k votes, which means even more people have liked it compared to the other games.
I always found Starbound to be a better game, personally.
    Starbound became complete dogshit the moment they added a story

Also all that about unpaid underage labor for art assets...
Considering the ammount of reviews Terrarias got I think its pretty impressive
Portal 2 was great and not to downplay but is it really the best game on steam? I feel like there’s still a heavy valve bias when it comes to the rating system.
Portal 2 is a treasure, a giant step up from the first game which is also a masterpiece. 

Terraria is very enjoyable and I love the art style, It's just one of those games that you can sink a few hours into.

I havent played the other 3, but from what I've heard they all 5 deserve those spots. :)
DANG IT PORTAL 2,

#MOOOOOVE

^^/s ^^portal ^^2 ^^is ^^a ^^good ^^game
And my boy Portal is in first, understandable
BattleBlock Theater being on the list makes me happy. That game was the shit.
Hmm... this could settle my argument with my friend about portal 2 vs. portal 1 (portal 2 is better and anyone who says otherwise is WRONG)
Look at how many more votes it has than every other game too. It leads the count by more than 100k. 

Congrats Terraria!
I’m not crying you’re crying ok now I’m crying
This is tight but I'm happy to see stardew so high up
Seeing this makes my heart soar. :)
Best part is the portal gun in terraria is a reference to the portal games
    Also the companion cube
As much as I love portal 2, I can't help but feel valve has China'd those numbers numbers a bit, but then again Dota 2 isn't on the list nor is tf or cs so probably not
    Just because a game is massively popular, doesn’t mean it has perfect reviews like a masterpiece like portal 2. Look at the reviews for CSGO, for example, it actually has a ton of negative reviews, whether it’s people complaining about new directions the game is going in, or about hackers, or about the toxic community.
Where can i access to the full list? I cant find it
    Nvm, found it lol
This is the way.
Not that factario isn't a great game, but it's super not for everyone. So I'm surprised it's so high on this list.
    If you compare the game's number of votes to the others', you'll realize that it is much less played indeed.
Ehh, the witcher's great and all, but not top 5 level great, more like top 25 of 50.
You have the 200 fishing quests? You deserve a medal or something.
    Thankfully since it's a cumulative achievement, I managed to do it on multiple full character/world play throughs with different updates, most recently of course with 1.4
    That one goes by in an afternoon if you're 'in the zone' and especially quick now that there are pylons in the game. Like, I often finish my fishing quest before 30 minutes of in-game time goes by because I have pylons set up next to a fishing hole in most biomes.
        How so? The slow part is not actually getting the fish but waiting for the day to reset.
            Im pretty sure you can also use a journeymode character to set the time to the next day and just grind them away.
                But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
                    I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
            If you click on the head of the bed you sleep now, if you sleep time goes by faster. Doesn't work during events and in multiplayer everyone has to sleep.
                But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
    Just got mine in 1.4 by spamming day cycles in journey mode after all this time lol
I still haven't 100%'d Portal 2 because I have no one to play the co-op campaign with.
    The co-op campaign just takes the genius design of that game to a whole new level.   Find someone and play it ASAP.  I’d do it again but you’d probably rather play with someone who hasn’t solved it already.

        Me too, I'm available on the weekends if you want
            [deleted]
                CST Central time and idk the time lol. Probably afternoon. Add me on steam; name's the same as here
                    [deleted]
    That's me and every Total War game where I have like 92% completion and zero of the MP achievements.

Would probably be that way with Civ and EU games as well but those tend to have some really impossible single player goals.
That's kinda funny because the fishing achievement in Terraria is a perfect example of a horrible achievement and the devs should feel bad about it.
    No disagreement from me. It took me multiple play throughs of extensive fishing. Enough to get every possible reward you can get by doing the fishing quests multiple times over during those play throughs and then I still had to do more fishing quests on top of that.
Btw, whats factorio, never heard of it

        You're forgetting that you're not making enough blue circuits. Where is the bottleneck? Oh, it's in your oil production. Fix that. Now your red circuits can't keep up with all the blue ones you are making.

You need more.

Expand your red circuits production. You need to go under some smelting facilities, but that's fine, a few underground belts should do it. Great, now why isn't it making anything?

Green circuits. You need more of those. But plastic production is in the way. You left it there a while ago thinking it will be enough. It was time for an upgrade anyway. Spent the next few hours moving and expanding your plastic production, and trying to re-connect it everywhere. Gad that's a mess, but it works, so don't fix what isn't broken.

Right, now you expand the green circuits. You need more copper wire, but you're not making as much as your factory can anyway, just smelt more copper plates.  But your trains are on maximum capacity. You need more carts, and that means messing with the train station, but some other thing is in the way. You need to move it elsewhere. There goes another hour messing with train signals....

More copper. Great, now you can finally, finally go back to what you where... Wait what? I now need more iron? Shit, i missed work
            [deleted]
                Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.

                        it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
                            Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                                I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                                however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                                I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                                Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
                            Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                                right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                                the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...

                        Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
                            Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
                        It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
                            The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
                        On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
                        Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
                        Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
                It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
                    Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
                        I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
                            It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                                Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
                        It's also still in Alpha.
                Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
                    Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
                        You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
                            Organic nukes only
                Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
                    That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
                        Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
                It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
                    I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
                But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
                It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
                Its much more
            Factorio is a game that I love, byt I hate myself whenever I play it because I'm so inefficient. I have no clue what I'm doing.
                Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
                    My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
                        My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
                            Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
                    My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
            I used to play it with my brother for I dunno, 30-40 hours and I feel the scenario
            I feel this.
            Bad news: You aren’t consuming enough heavy oil so all plastic production has stopped. You thought you had that covered with overflow solid fuel production, but since you’ve got your nuclear power up and running and most of your furnaces converted to electric, you simply aren’t consuming enough of it and all your buffer chests are full.
            This is where I get stuck in the game, there’s so much to fix but I don’t even know where to start and half the problems are self-created in an attempt to avoid the problems
            i just had ptsd...thanks
            [deleted]
            Bought the game a *loooooooong* time ago, and my then-roommate warned me about it. I booted up the tutorial and told him to stop me after two hours.

Ten minutes later, my roommate messaged me, and the clock and the sun outside were mysteriously two hours ahead.

Never booted up the game again after that. If I started playing again without supervision, I'd probably starve to death at my computer.
            Dude you and the above guy completely sold me on Factorio...it sounds like gameplay that appeals to me. Will have to give it a try.
            Don't forget after fixing grew circuits, "What was I doing now?" And just walking through your factory trying to remember and seeing that iron is struggling so decide to fix that then wonder four hours away why green circuits are trickling, and then remember oh right. 

The factory must grow.
            Man I remember the last time I played, I decided to try the "main bus"/ribbon cable method of organizing conveyors. The mess of lines splitting and joining the main bus was *BEAUTIFUL*
        Good enough, will try soon
            Prepare for spaghetti belts. Also the factory must grow, it is always hungry
                i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
                    Kill the natives xdddd
            This is top tier irony.  
It's like going to the alcoholic anons and start heavy drinking after hearing their story.  


I'm glad you're joining. *The factory must grow.*
            There is a [demo available](https://factorio.com/download) on their website *and their steam page too
            *The factory must grow*
            Be careful. It's a game that will take over your life until you complete it haha
        The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

        Also, the devs are amazing.

They are obsessed with code optimization (figures, the game is made in c++) and bug hunting. Even in the early stage of early access the game was more polished than lots of games that consider themselves released.

Also, they are incredibly transparent, as they post an update on their blog every week ("Factorio Friday Facts") where they talk about their progress, visions, ideas, fixed bugs, yet another optimization they managed to squeeze out of the code and occasionally a mod showcase. As of now they've reached FFF#354 without a single missed week.

I wish every development studio had this kind of mentality.
        Ah yes, Rimworld but with more automation at the cost of less warcrimes.
            You say that like it's a bad thing. What's wrong with having colonists improve their Doctor skill by removing prisoners' legs, replacing them with peg legs, then removing the peg legs and reattaching them over and over again?
                The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
                The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
                    Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
                    Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
                Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.
        Everything must be automated and optimised
        The factory must grow to feed the factory.

        The factory must grow. why are you wasting time on reddit?
        They don't call it Cracktorio for nothing
    Real-time factory management game where you mine and process resources into various parts, research new technology and eventually try to build a spaceship to escape the planet you crash-landed on, all while trying to keep your base protected from the local giant bugs that are none too happy that you're there.  It's absolutely amazing.
        You dont escape the planet though? you just get research from launching rockets with satellites?
            Well yeah, technically you don't, but that's mainly because the game is supposed to be an infinite sandbox.  Launching the rocket is considered the win condition for the main game and you can choose to exit or keep playing.
                Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
                    One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
            There are mods that add in space and the ability to colonies other planets.

        All of this. The dedication to making the game run flawlessly is astounding.

You can have a factory consisting of millions of parts, and the game runs fine. At worst, it starts to slow down ever so slightly. And if it does, they give you the 'under the hood' tools to figure out which part of your factory is slowing down your computer and you can optimize that. And somehow even that is fun.

I have, never, ever, not even once, had the vanilla game crash on me.
    [deleted]
        I can't think of a trailer that explains the heart of its game better
            It really does. It's seldom that a trailer alone sells a game for me, but the first time I watched it I knew I had to have Factorio.
    https://youtu.be/KVvXv1Z6EY8

Developers are awesome, there's great mod support, even though it's already awesome the game is changing for the better and the 1.0 version releases soon

E: https://youtu.be/DR01YdFtWFI
    Its a game where you land on a deserted planet and your ultimate goal is launching a satellite with a rocket which you both handconstruct. You do this by setting up a system of factories which automatically mine resources and refine them into parts that you use to build more factories which mine other resources which can be refined into more parts and you aim to automate as much as possible of this process. Quite a fascinating game.
    The thing that just ate the entirety of my week so far.
    Its a game that will take every waking ounce of thought you have blend the days and nights together and turn your dreams into crude twisted machinations of robot arms, optimal ratios, and novel routes to efficiency.

 anyways 10/10 game
    Prepare yourself to disappear for days on end.

Make sure you notify loved ones so they don’t worry

I like open world rpgs, I’ve tried the Witcher 3 multiple times but I just can’t get into it. Portal 2 and Terraria are definitely some of the all time greats, though. Never tried Factorio, and I didn’t like Stardew, but I wouldn’t consider myself a fan of whatever genre it is.
    same opinion on the witcher
    I enjoyed Witcher 3 and all but I don't find it to be nearly as good as people hype it up to be.  I felt like it was just bland combat, cutscene, bland combat, cutscene over and over.  Last game I can think of in that genre I really enjoyed was dragon age origin
        My main gripe was the fucking character movement. I just can't play a game with such good graphics and see Geralt running around like an Oblivion NPC. It's too weird.
            The horse riding drove me insane sometimes.  Maybe RDR2 spoiled me but my god did I hate controlling my man Roach sometimes.
            Another issue I have with the game is that if you don't like Geralt or don't find him interesting- tough luck, he's fully voiced and his mug is in every cut scene
                So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
        See, and I really enjoyed the combat, when it was Me VS 1 Enemy. Like the griffon fight. Fucking loved that. There was a quest I had to find some crazy guys goat and I ended up fighting a bear. Another fantastic fight. Found the typical "Oh no, I'm turning into a monster. I gotta hide" house. The guy was a werewolf in a cave under his house. If it hadn't been for my sword breaking, it would have been a fucking amazing fight.

But you put me up against more than 2 enemies and the combat just dies. Every single good thing I have to say about the combat gets pulled out and thrown away when you fight more than 1-2 enemies. It goes from almost Souls-like or Monster Hunter-like combat, where you KNOW this enemy is stronger than you and your only hope of beating them is to not get hit, to a mindless, repetitive slog of "dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, get a single attack in, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge..." until you want to kill yourself.

This doesn't even touch on geralt. He is the most bland, 1-dimensional character I've ever seen. To the point where if you pick a dialogue option that isn't in that 1 dimension he's "good" at, it feels like someone has a gun to his head and is forcing him to say it.

And honestly, I kinda hate that I don't like the game. Its such a good game held back by too many enemies and a terrible protagonist.
        I really liked dragon age inquisition
    Would have been amazing if it had a better combat system.
    I love action adventure RPGs. Witcher 3 is the worst action adventure rpg I've ever played. Every aspect of the gameplay, from combat, to travel, to just navigating the menu system is like pulling teeth, and the story is like some greasy neckbeards dnd wet dream. I do not get why it's so popular.
        I'm shocked you're getting away with trashing it right now. I've been buried in downvotes before for saying it was overrated.
        What would you recommend instead?
            I had the same opinion as that guy and just off the top of my head I really enjoyed Skyrim, Dark Souls (all of them, even 2 is better), Bloodborne, Dragon Age Inquisition, Horizon.
                As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
            Even dragon age 2 is better
    Also tried witcher and I don't like it either.
    That's because it's overhyped garbage that gets a review circlejerk from reddit. Didn't like it either in case it wasnt obvious.
Almost all of the negative reviews on terraria is either people saying "stop looking at reviews and buy it" or "not my type of game"
    Yeah same with Factorio lol, i wonder what their actual ratings could be.
    Which is moronic, the games aren't flawless.
Prepared for the downvotes but, as someone who's into those genres I was really excited about The Witcher 3 and it's story, but after completing it I didn't feel like it was anything more special than most games from the genres both story and gameplay wise. I honestly think it's really overhyped compared to other games from the top 5.
    Stardew Valley is kinda overhyped too. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and I love it. But objectively, Rune Factory 4 has almost everything that Stardew also has and has generally more content and 100x better story.
    I have never played a game that had this big of an open world without it feeling empty. All of the side quests are good with many have great stories. Multiple different endings, good gameplay, great voice acting, and cheap dlc that DOUBLES the length of the game. It does all that while having some of the best graphics around (when it released). Oh also a good modding community.
Hard disagree with TW3

That game is just... not enjoyable at all to me, and I love RPGs
I didn’t like the witcher, the story felt very slow, the graphic were oversaturated, and the combat was extremely meh.

I only played for like 8 hours, apparently the story gets good at hour 20, which in my opinion is a bad story.
My man I'm not even a fan of farming games, I hate them to be honest, but stardew valley, I put 900 hours into that shit, and nobody can get between me and my pumpkins.
I have played all of those and I thought the Witcher 3 wasn't anywhere near my GOTY for that year. 

I also think portal 1 is by far superior to 2
    Portal 2 expanded on everything that Portal 1 did right. Maybe going from nothing to Portal 1 is just a bigger leap than going from Portal 1 to Portal 2, and that's why you think Portal 1 is better?
    Well thats just like, your opinion. Also none of what youve said implies you disliked either of them.
        True. I didn't hate any of them. I just don't really get the top 5 of all time thing.

I also low-key get annoyed everytime I see people loving the Witcher 3 because it feels like a party I wasn't invited to.
            How dare you not like Sir Geralto's Lusty Gwent Adventure? Please delete your Reddit account now. 

Jokes aside, it's a shame it didn't catch on for you. Have you tried watching the Netflix show instead?
                No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
                    Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
                        I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
                The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
            I tried to play Witcher 3 twice and just wasn't hooked, despite being a huge fantasy RPG fan. Fuck sake I was more hooked by the broken shitshow that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance than Witcher 3.
                Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
                    I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
                    I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
            if you need some company I didn't like it as well. The first like 10 hours are fine because novelty and stuff but afterwards all I was thinking was "I could've replayed mass effect instead".
    Portal 2 has J.K. Simmons. You're obviously insane. Seriously, though, and no pun intended, I found Portal 2 to be a much deeper game.
I was not a fan of the Witcher despite liking s lot of other games like it frankly.
Stardew Valley is great, but got too boring for me to even finish the first winter \[at the third day of winter I had already managed to finish all the bundles/get married/etc. - all that seemed to be left was grind, despite all the mods I was using\]. Still a thumb up though.
TW3 is kinda boring honestly, same with Stardew Valley
I absolutely love fantasy games, thousands of hours in Elder Scrolls, Middle earth, and others. But I cannot get through 15 minutes of the Witcher 3. Too many naked scenes, cut scenes, and directed narrative. Its very boring for me, like when does the game start
I agree, I played stardew valley and fell in love with the style and music
I have a friend who doesn’t like terraria because, “it’s not like the sims, you can’t time jump”
Portal 2 is easily my favorite story game all-time. I’ve never had more fun playing through a game.
I really didn't like witcher 3 but like that genere tho, in fact I really enjoyed witcher 1 but hated 2
Stardew valley honestly blew up and has a huge following like Terraria does.
    Stardew is on like every console + mobile as well. The dude that created the game made so much bank.
        *And* he's still coming out with content for the game. Content that's free.
            Which is exactly why both Stardew Valley and Terraria are in the top 5.
        Deserved.
            Honestly though, such a great game
            Totally, he worked many years alone on it
            Totally deserved, all the love and sweat put into the game shows.
        Absolutely deserved it too, guy made almost every part of the code, art, story, music, everything. Dudes a genius
            That's not something the ape would tell you.
            He did do everything. He worked on the game for four years before it was released and made $1m within the first 12 days of the pc release. Only time he got someone else to help him was with the code for the multiplayer update.
        And it was just one guy coding everything and designing everything for such a long time, he just decided to add people to the team when they added multiplayer cause he couldn’t do it himself. The guy is a mastermind
        Even more shocking is Factorio, imo.
    some say its the poor man's animal crossing, I say its the more accessible, deeper narrative version ~~if~~ of animal crossing.
        I thought it was way more fun than Animal Crossing (that being said I only played Animal Crossing on GameCube)

But Stardew Valley is just an improvement to games like harvest moon
        It's better than AC imo
            Yeah, you can't fuck the villagers in AC and have kids with them.
            lowkey think so too, just not planning on rustling any feathers hehe
How’s stardew valley compared to say Animal crossing?
    In my opinion more goal oriented and "gamey". In animal crossing you can spend a day doing nothing and you haven't really lost anything. In stardew valley you want to progress more quickly to be ready for village events etc. Still a very relaxing game though
        I'd like to point out you don't really need to tho if you don't want. You can just chill for years and there's really no downside.
            There's only like two time-sensitive events, one cutscene with a NPC and a 'scoring' system for your farm. The latter can be repeated so really not a worry.

I still panic rushing home from the mines at 1am.
                Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
                    You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
                        You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
                            i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                                Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
                whats cutscene with a box?

        Man, I think I just can't chill in games. Animal Crossing stressed me out as I felt like I was a failure if I didn't get on it and do my daily chores. It made me quit it, I'll probably go back at some point.
            Same happened to me with daily quests in World of Warcraft. Those made me quit when I realized I was rushing home from work to basically do virtual chores.

            Sounds like you just want to pack too much in. You just have to get there's nothing wrong with spending the whole first 6 months just fishing if you feel like it. There's no real victory condition or end to the game. Take it slow.
                I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
    Mildly similar, more in how it makes you feel than how it's played. Stardew is more farming focused, but you also get to raise animals and make artisan goods and you can totally avoid farming entirely if you prefer.

Similarities:

* Relaxing ambiance (with plenty of min-max potential for those who want that)

* "Play your way" style of game, with customization in the layout of your farm and the decorations in your home/building (not as many options to customize as Animal Crossing)

* Big collection component (fish, artifacts, recipes, crops, foraging)

Differences:

* The town is pre-set, townspeople don't move in/out

* The relationship system is emphasized more, with the ability to date/marry/divorce/have kids with a variety of dateable characters. There are also "heart events" you can trigger as you get closer to them, which are cutscenes or special scenarios where you typically learn more about them and get closer to them

* More structure/guidance in the core goals of the game (never required, but for those who feel too aimless in Animal Crossing this gives you more things to actively work toward)

* It's more bingeable - an ingame day takes ~15 min IRL, but you can go to sleep earlier to move to the next day. So you can play through a whole year without stopping if you want
        Thanks! That sounds like something my fiancé and I would enjoy. Is there a way for us to play together or visit each other’s farms like you can in AC?
            Yes actually, you can have multiplayer farms! One person has to host the file and get past the intro, then up to 3(?) players can have cabins on that farm and play together. You can also marry each other if you want. 

Or, you could each have separate save files but also each have a cabin on the other’s file, and then you could play together sometimes and alone sometimes.
                Sounds perfect thank you!
            The game is multiplayer, you can have separate houses as well.
            It does have multiplayer, but it may work a bit differently (haven't played AC), you generally want to start a shared farm from the beginning.
                Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
                    Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
        As an addendum, you don't need to engage with the other townsfolk at all to have an enjoyable experience. I haven't given one gift in any of my three playthroughs.

        I think you’ve convinced me! Now to decide to buy it on my switch or PC 🤔
            It's a tough choice. Both are great, the ability to play anywhere even for a few minutes is perfect, but there are some mods I can't live without on my more serious farms.

I still suggest playing without mods at first, but by year 3 or on another playthrough, definitely look into them.
            PC for sure. It's way cheaper, I think slightly further along in updates, and you can mod it. Not even a debate in my opinion, unless of course you prioritize mobility over everything else.
            It’s nice being able to play in handheld mode on switch, the downside is the loading times are far longer than on pc. Pc also has the benefit of time-saving inventory shortcuts. It’s really not that different, it all depends on what matters most to you.
    Playing Animal Crossing eventually felt like chores to me. Stardews characters have a bit more depth,  tasks can be automated, and the game has more direction.
Makes me *so* happy to see it in the top 5, very deserved imo. I think it's my favorite of the top 5. Such an awesome feat for a solo developer
Stardew Valley has soo much charm and character with completely engaging gameplay. If you like the genre Stardew Valley is the best.
Stardew Valley is amazing. It was one of those games I got during a sale because I heard it was good, but never actually played. I was bored one day so I tried it out, and it was an instant favorite from the moment I started playing. I love everything about it (except the flying snakes in the Skull Cavern) and highly recommend it to everyone.
Can I play cross-platform switch and PC??? :(
Unpopular opinion: stardew valley is boring as hell, the mining mechanics are garbage, watering your plants every day is a pain in the ass, the npcs are really boring to talk to and I hate having to follow a schedule. You play games to escape work, but the game feels like work. I’d rather play minecraft as my « relaxing game » because I can do whatever the hell i want.
yes it is
    i dident know that meny people had the game .. i mean i have it and its alright ig
        It rules.
            ETS2 isn't flashy or genre definitely but it does what it wants to go extremely well. The models are super detailed and there are a lot of great features like tuning into actual radio stations and landmarks.


Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.
                > Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
                    oh you have the patience to even attempt this
                I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
        It has a very strong fanbase. 

Personally, I thought it was neat but got boring after about 10 hours or so.  Once I got the hang of parking and driving and upgraded beyond the shit slow early trucks you get, there's not much more to it.  And the locations are all super basic.  American Truck Simulator at least does a lot better job in that regard.
Seriously, it's a really good game.
    is itt?
        it's surprisingly fun, very relaxing. a great game to play while talking to friends or attending a boring class in college. the online adds a whole new layer of fun to be had. it's very satisfying to get a shitload of money after driving for 3+ hours. plus it's often no more than 5 euro on sale.
            Not saying its bad it just gets boring after a while
                Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.
I absolutely love the game. Multiplayer mod is a cool addition when the admins are active too!  Its absolutely addicting, having a wheel or not.
    Had trouble enjoying the game with a key board and mouse. After I got a controller I gave it another try, and clocked like 300 hours in less then a month. The game is so relaxing!
    i cant see it being addictive all i can see it as is mabey relaxing because all you do is.. well Drive
Cheers for that. 

Also Return of the Obra Dinn being down at 135 is criminal, and yes I know that's still with 96% positive reviews. Never played anything like it, and think it's unlikely I will again.
I'm happy to see some Touhou games and also Rabi Ribi as high as they are
Jesus fuck why is Doki Doki up so high? That game was an absolute dumpster fire.
    This seems like a complaint on the genre/anime art style than criticizing the game
Looking for negative reviews can be helpful to the potential buyer. I avoided many games that were ’supposedly good’, but contains elements I personally loathe.
    The only thing Terraria technically doesn't have is a full blown creative mode like Minecraft, but obviously that was an intentional choice and we were given journey mode, and mods/3rd party apps can do that for us, so it has everything, especially once mods come out
        Journey mode is so good. You can leave most of the challenge in but take out whatever grinding you think is dumb/not do things like mine out the marble biome of 4 worlds if you want a town made of marble.
            \*duping to get infinite platinum pre-wall of flesh intensifies\*

                Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
        Honestly pre hardmode summoner has problems
            and early hardmode. i have just spider armor and i’m unable to kill the mechanical bosses
                It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
                    yeah
                    Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
                you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
                    yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
                        For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
                        On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
            Honestly summoner in general is so underpowered that it feels weird that the class’s unbalanced state is apparently the final state of the game. 

I love 1.4 and all the stuff that it did add, but for a final update it did seem to leave just a few loose ends.
            pre _and_ hardmode. summoner still sucks, which is a shame
        \*Sad TmodLoader stuck in 1.3.5.3 noises\*
            Is there anywhere to see their progress? It would be interesting to know how far they are into development
                sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
        I mean... for people that buy games for the building aspect that is a pretty big deal. Completely fair to not want to buy it based on that.

For the people saying Journey is a comparable mode, it’s just not. The research thing is so gimmicky and you still need to get plenty of the resource to actually build with it.
    I always go straight for negative reviews when seeing if I should get a game and if I can find some that are actual critiques I’ll listen to them and will then try to find actual praises in the positive reviews and I’ll compare the two

Too often I see in positive stuff just like “it’s a good game” and in negative I see stuff like “trash game”
I'm sure the same happens to other games too, such as portal
    Can confirm the same for Factorio, too many """""funny""""" joke reviews are negative for the point of trying to get attention
I’m keeping my review negative until they fix the Mac version.  It worked fine before the update, and then they broke it.
    This is why I don't understand people leaving good "negative" reviews. Not only are they literally decreasing the ratings of a game they like, but they are also crowding the negative reviews section, making justified negative reviews like yours harder to find, potentially misleading other customers. When I look at negative reviews of a game I'm planning to buy, I'm not looking for an excuse to hate the game, I'm trying to see if there are aspects of the game people dislike, that could potentially turn me off as well.

        I think if you wanna get technical, Dota 2 came out of beta at some point between Portal 2 and HL:A as well.
            And then there's Artifact and Underlords as well
    Artifact counts damn it.  We count!!!!
        I think they made DotA Underlords since then as well. That counts at least as much as Artifact, right?
            They did.  And that also hasn't gone very well lol
    HLA isn't a actual game?
        An*
    HLA came out and it’s incredible.
    Half life alyx? That is definitely a real game
It's really amazing how fast video game years go by. 

Realize that World of Warcraft, HL2, and Rome: Total War are all about to have their 16th birthday. Diablo 2 is now as many decades old as the number in the title.
That's cause portal 2 is the shit, recently I replayed it and the last 20 minutes are still one of my favourite parts of any game
    I think my favourite bit still has to be the start of chapter 9- 

>!GLaDOS: I think this is the part where he kills us!<

>!Wheatley: Hello! This is the part where I kill you!< 

>!Text on screen: Chapter 9 - The part where he kills you!<

>!Achievement unlocked: The part where he kills you - this is that part!<
        I just remembered the existence of that scene and now I can't stop laughing
        Fun fact: The music file for that part is called 
>!thepartwherehekillsyou.mp4!<
            Wasn’t there also an achievement at that part
                the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
                There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
                    Where you jump in the pit, right?
                        Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
        The music for that part is also called "the part where he kills you". 



But yeah, from that point until the end is the best part of any game ever
        Th best moment in any videogame ever
        My man Wheatley on the ledge and shit
        The sad part is that achievement only pops up the first time. 

It's an great joke that's never really the same the second time around.
        Fun fact. It’s called the part where he kills you because it’s the part where he kills you!
        God I love that game.
    Even better the massively giant door that just kept another normal sized door behind it.

Best joke in the entire game.
        There are so many good jokes but yeah that is one of the best
    recently played for the first time with a friend in coop

IT'S ULTRA FUN
        If you haven't already, PLEASE play the singleplayer story, too. It's beyond good. Gameplay is just as good as the coop, and it also has an absolutely amazing story with great voice acting and a lot of hilarious moments.
            I'm playing Portal 1's singleplayer first, but I will play PL2 afterwards.
                Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
                    I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
                    Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past
    The turret orchestra will never not get tears into my eyes. It is the perfect ending and Chell deserved it so much.
        Look up the english translation of the lyrics, will create more tears
            I already know them mate, Italian opera I think is the original. It's beautiful. So fitting. Thanks for the suggestion though.
                Ahh, cheers :]
                    Cheers to you too, fellow human :)
    I’ve never played it because my computer can’t handle it and it’s not on the PS4 or the switch. I am seriously considering getting my ps3 back out just for portal
        Even on the lower settings? Most older valve titles can run on nearly any system.
            I’m actually not sure. I know that my computer can barely run anything, so I usually just get it on consoles.
                Ah ok. Portal 2 is still relatively newer compared to something like Half-Life 2 so I wouldn’t be too sure. But the games have all ran decently on the old laptop I had so it doesn’t hurt to check if you can run it.
                Source Engine games are incredibly lenient on hardware, even the newer ones like Portal 2 from 2012 are well optimized. Most integrated graphics from the last 10 years or so can probably run it. Mind if you tell me your computer's specs, if you know any?
    That is why there will never be a portal 3. :(
    Cave Johnson is so unbelievably well performed that I seriously want to give JK Simmons a big, wet kiss on the mouth for it. 

That dude is just perfect in everything. Including the Ladykillers, which for some reason people hate.
    I am literally playing Portal 2 as I saw this post. I was mildly confused.
Terraria is only 0.01 behind that's awesome
    And it has over 350k more votes
I've never played it 😟
Well if any game deserves a 10/10... 

That's not something easy (should not at least) to say that a game is perfect.

Lot of games are good, great, awesome, what you want. 

But perfect ? That hard. 

Portal 2 has an amazing story, a great gameplay, simple to grasp and intuitive, can cause some challenges without being too hard, is original, to my knowledge bug free (at least I was surprised when playing it that no matter in which hole I stuck myself I could get out), great level design, great voice acting, memorable characters despite them being two robots and a bunch of pre-recorded messages, mod support that makes it infinite, great humor, enjoyable co-op play, etc, etc, etc.

So yeah. Stays at the top.
A great game but I honestly prefer portal 1. It was just a little tighter and more focused for me which I liked. Portal 2 is still a great game though.
You’re a farmer! There’s mines with monsters, and fun magical critters. I highly recommend it, watch a couple videos for it. I believe it was also a one man developer show, he made everything himself?
    That's why i respect this game so much. The dude working on this game made it entirely by himself and a only a few months ago he started getting a team to help him
        Well, more like a few years ago. I believe he needed help with net code and porting the game. But yeh. So many great indie games are the vision of one person who has the ability to reach that goal
    Yeah, I'll never forget my dear farmer, [434].
        And my sweet chicken companion [74].... *F*
Eh, it's more in line with animal crossing/harvest moon
    It's basically a Harvest Moon, but ***better***.
If you know Harvest Moon, it's basically that, but better, it's a wonderful chill game.
Similar art styles, but not much else. Imagine Animal Crossing, but with a lot more emphasis on the farming aspect.
Thank you all for the responses. Sounds like Terraria is more my thing.
It's like all the best stuff of Harvest Moon with none of the badness.
It's like Harvest Moon, if you know what that is.
The biggest similarity is that they're both fun as fuck. But no they're different games. SDV is a farm management RPG. And emphasis on the RPG part.
It's like aninal crossing but better.
I know I’m late on this but Portal 2 and Terraria are both one of my favorite games
How to keep a game you like from being #1 simulator
"good jokes"
I had the same issue when I first started it. I didn't even get out of the first area. I put it down for a few months and came back to it. I'm so glad I did. The second time around, I was hooked. 120 hours later I can honestly say it is truly the best video game I've ever played. I hope you decide to revisit it, as it is certainly a gem.
    That gives me hope. I absolutely loved Zelda Breath of the Wild for example and I hope a similar love will unfold itself with the Witcher series.
    This is EXACTLY what I felt. My friend recommended TW3 so I bought it and I just couldn't get into it for some reason so I stopped playing it for a few months and decided to come back later on, which is not something I usually do. Probably the best decision of my life, once I got to the bloody Barron quest I was hooked. Three playthroughs later I can say that it's hands down the best game ever made, and CDPR is perhaps the most consumer friendly company, i got both expansions for £10 where other companies would probably charge £25 for each
I think I would have liked it more if everyone didn't claim it was the GOAT. Like. It was a solid game but it didn't make my dick explode with joy or anything.
Yeah, I played for six hours and then stopped because I just couldn't get into it with a ton of overloaded menus that aren't explained or at least not explained in time. I'm also not a fan of the sexualization but that's more of a me-problem.
I tried to play it twice both times only getting 7 hours into the game
Combat seems complicated until you realise all you need to do is 1 attack, dodge, repeat, and you'll breeze through everything.
    That's also when you realize the combat is pretty fucking boring
Play it on the easiest difficulty. It's worth it to go through the story.
Welp thats the Witcher series for ya. I can say the same that it really didn't click at first but when it clicks, it clicks hard. I absolutely love the Witcher 3 and I can absolutely say that it truly deserves a spot on the top 5.
Bootcamp my dude
I don't want to be *that guy*, but if you dual-boot a Linux distro, you could play a lot of games. There's this thing called Proton that runs Windows games in Linux, and works with a large number of games.

If you have any questions I'd be glad to answer them.
    All of the games on the list except the Witcher run natively on Linux too.
    Always be that guy my guy I appreciate it
Y u p
It's amazing and incredibly addicting. The whole game is basically about building the most efficient factories possible so you can gather materials and craft things but you keep unlocking new improvements like faster conveyor belts or train tracks and keep improving your factories. It should be classified as a drug honestly.
    I think your description underestimates how additive it is
The other comment explained it fairly well, but there's also a demo you can try on the steam store
    Thanks :)
Crashed on an alien planet, build a factory to survive, factory makes pollution, natives don't like it, attack your factory, build bigger factory to make defences to defend factory to make better materials to make bigger factory... repeat, suddenly its 5am and you need to go to work.

Aka: it's fucking fun, but a lot of maths if you really want to get into it.
I'd belive that this video sums it up pretty good:

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcLqqmlNqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivcLqqmlNqQ)
It's like crack, addictive and you'll lose your girlfriend and family because you play too much
    I have both ,but i dont like them.. whatever,come Factorio hahahahha thanx for answer. I love reddit and users here.
100% worth it. Time will go faster and before you know it you’ve spent 200 hours on the game
It also comes with the equivalent of tModloader built in, and has tons of free mods that add thousands of hours of content and complexity. Best to do your first playthrough vanilla though, as the complexity that mods like Pyanodon or Bob's/Angels add would be overwhelming if you're just learning the game. I'd argue that the mods available are even richer and add more content and complexity than those made for Terraria.
It’s primarily a game about design and automation. There are hostile aliens on the planet but no other survival elements (no food, illness, etc).
It's one of those games that can cause me to look up and realize the sun is rising and oh god I have to be at work in 30 minutes!
That's a problem with Steam in general, not just Terraria's reviews in particular. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of those shitty reviews for Portal 2 as well.
Question: is there any incentive to rate? 200k vote difference from the next highest is pretty big.
    There is a bit. The more ratings it has the closer it is to the actual percentage. I think factorio has a higher positive rating percentage but the lack of votes gives it a bit of a penalty. I'll try to find the formula...

Edit. It is more complicated than I thought but is explained by the list maker here: https://steam250.com/about
Wouldnt that balance out since all games have those types of reviews?
As someone who loves Terraria, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and deserve the number one spot easily.
    Agreed. As somebody who loves every game on the top 5 (and selfishly think Factorio deserves #2) Portal 2 at the #1 spot is deserved. IMO, Portal 2 is the best game ever made.
        I couldn't agree more. I love all of the games in the top 5 and have hundreds of hours in each of them, but Factorio has the best devs hands down. [They routinely chase down](https://preview.redd.it/i9e7ghpd5k131.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8bdc5afec843eabe500872f195e73827b8a4) bugs that one person in an edge case is having just so the game will be perfect for them.
    Words escape me for how good JK Simmons is in that game.
Both games are absolutely amazing but tbh the portal series is much better and Portal 2 definitely deserves number 1.

\-Somebody who has played both Portal 2 and Terraria
Portal 2 is in a class all it’s own, but I do agree with the people saying that terraria could be seen as having a stronger rating, since it has 0.1 less average rating, with 250,000 more people voting. That is incredibly impressive!
not made by EA, but rather Early Access (i know, it's so complete it doesn't look like one)
    It's coming out of early access on September 25th, too.
        Btw, they moved the release date to August 14 so it wouldn't compete with the release of cyberpunk 2077
            > release of cyberpunk 2077

jokes on them cyberpunk isn't coming out until it's actually 2077
            Ah yes, I forgot about that. Googled "Factorio 1.0" and it showed the blogpost where that date was stated, instead of googling "Factorio release date".
        Is it gonna go up in price when this happens? I figure it’ll never ever go on sale so I’m wondering if I should just buy it now
            They already increased the price a few updates ago, with the reason given being "the content in the game is already pretty much what's gonna be in the 1.0 version", so I don't think they'll increase the price further.
            I haven't heard of any plans of a price increase, but it has a free demo they've been tweaking for a while now to give you a feel of the gameplay loop. If you like that, then buy the game; it will be the best $30 you've spent in a long time.

why tf does factorio never go on sale. i rly wanna try out the game but dont feel like dropping $30. I've probably waited 2 years now and I don't think it has gone on sale once.

        Is it working or is it the only thing stopping their indie game from being the most sold?
            It's hardly even early access anymore. At this point they're just ironing out small kinks and optimizing. I have every achievement and over 600 hours in the game and literally never once encountered a bug or crash.

On top of that they give incredibly detailed weekly developer updates: https://www.factorio.com/blog/

At this point I think the only thing really holding it back is just word of mouth and the fact that it's sort of a niche genre.
                I was going to say it seems like they're scared of the money drying up after Factorio and flopping the next game and prolonging it, but  I saw one of the devs responding to reddit threads about general questions and bugs with modded versions. 

Now it's like this is their passion project first and foremost and a full release is daunting because where do you go from creating an instant classic on your first crack?
                    I have absolutely no clue what happens after launch (*besides patches and possibly content updates)* but given the quality of Factorio I'll be along for whatever they do next. These guys have won me over.
            Definitely stopped me from buying it so far even though it’s right up my alley

Woo for being a single data point!
                There's a great demo, you know.
    They have a demo that will show you if you want to play further.
    It will never go on sale. If you want to try the game out, download the free demo.
    well it used to be $20 for a long time, guessed you missed out
        I actually bought it for $20 lmao, returned it bc the steam sale was abt to happen. then the sales happened and it went up to $30 💀
            Lmao you got dunked
        Hehe, I got it for like £7.50 back in the original Indiegogo. I've had to buy it a couple times for friends since just because they're such good devs.
    Play the demo, if it grips you - it is well worth the money.
We really need a new portal game, or at least a better version of the level editor
I'd put the Witcher below factorio personally
That's a problem with Steam in general, not just Terraria. I bet Portal 2 also has a bunch of those shitty reviews.
That applies to every game on that list though, so it doesn't change anything
    Some have it more than others
        The list is already weird since it ranked a 99% rated game below 98%
I’ve got several hundred on Factorio, and I’ve only finished the game twice. No mods or dlcs, just amazing gameplay that makes you want to take your time beating the game.
It's Steam250.com
> trying to Google search it gives an entirely different list

What did you search for?
Starbound became complete dogshit the moment they added a story

Also all that about unpaid underage labor for art assets...
Also the companion cube
Just because a game is massively popular, doesn’t mean it has perfect reviews like a masterpiece like portal 2. Look at the reviews for CSGO, for example, it actually has a ton of negative reviews, whether it’s people complaining about new directions the game is going in, or about hackers, or about the toxic community.
Nvm, found it lol
If you compare the game's number of votes to the others', you'll realize that it is much less played indeed.
Thankfully since it's a cumulative achievement, I managed to do it on multiple full character/world play throughs with different updates, most recently of course with 1.4
That one goes by in an afternoon if you're 'in the zone' and especially quick now that there are pylons in the game. Like, I often finish my fishing quest before 30 minutes of in-game time goes by because I have pylons set up next to a fishing hole in most biomes.
    How so? The slow part is not actually getting the fish but waiting for the day to reset.
        Im pretty sure you can also use a journeymode character to set the time to the next day and just grind them away.
            But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
                I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
        If you click on the head of the bed you sleep now, if you sleep time goes by faster. Doesn't work during events and in multiplayer everyone has to sleep.
            But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
Just got mine in 1.4 by spamming day cycles in journey mode after all this time lol
The co-op campaign just takes the genius design of that game to a whole new level.   Find someone and play it ASAP.  I’d do it again but you’d probably rather play with someone who hasn’t solved it already.

    Me too, I'm available on the weekends if you want
        [deleted]
            CST Central time and idk the time lol. Probably afternoon. Add me on steam; name's the same as here
                [deleted]
That's me and every Total War game where I have like 92% completion and zero of the MP achievements.

Would probably be that way with Civ and EU games as well but those tend to have some really impossible single player goals.
No disagreement from me. It took me multiple play throughs of extensive fishing. Enough to get every possible reward you can get by doing the fishing quests multiple times over during those play throughs and then I still had to do more fishing quests on top of that.

    You're forgetting that you're not making enough blue circuits. Where is the bottleneck? Oh, it's in your oil production. Fix that. Now your red circuits can't keep up with all the blue ones you are making.

You need more.

Expand your red circuits production. You need to go under some smelting facilities, but that's fine, a few underground belts should do it. Great, now why isn't it making anything?

Green circuits. You need more of those. But plastic production is in the way. You left it there a while ago thinking it will be enough. It was time for an upgrade anyway. Spent the next few hours moving and expanding your plastic production, and trying to re-connect it everywhere. Gad that's a mess, but it works, so don't fix what isn't broken.

Right, now you expand the green circuits. You need more copper wire, but you're not making as much as your factory can anyway, just smelt more copper plates.  But your trains are on maximum capacity. You need more carts, and that means messing with the train station, but some other thing is in the way. You need to move it elsewhere. There goes another hour messing with train signals....

More copper. Great, now you can finally, finally go back to what you where... Wait what? I now need more iron? Shit, i missed work
        [deleted]
            Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.
                [deleted]
                    it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
                        Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                            I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                            however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                            I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                            Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
                        Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                            right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                            the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
                        Cracktorio
                    Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
                        Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
                    It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
                        The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
                    On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
                    Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
                    Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
            It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
                Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
                    I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
                        It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                            Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
                    It's also still in Alpha.
            Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
                Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
                    You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
                        Organic nukes only
            Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
                That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
                    Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
            It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
                I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
            But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
            It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
            Its much more
        Factorio is a game that I love, byt I hate myself whenever I play it because I'm so inefficient. I have no clue what I'm doing.
            Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
                My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
                    My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
                        Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
                My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
        I used to play it with my brother for I dunno, 30-40 hours and I feel the scenario
        I feel this.
        Bad news: You aren’t consuming enough heavy oil so all plastic production has stopped. You thought you had that covered with overflow solid fuel production, but since you’ve got your nuclear power up and running and most of your furnaces converted to electric, you simply aren’t consuming enough of it and all your buffer chests are full.
        This is where I get stuck in the game, there’s so much to fix but I don’t even know where to start and half the problems are self-created in an attempt to avoid the problems
        i just had ptsd...thanks
        [deleted]
        Bought the game a *loooooooong* time ago, and my then-roommate warned me about it. I booted up the tutorial and told him to stop me after two hours.

Ten minutes later, my roommate messaged me, and the clock and the sun outside were mysteriously two hours ahead.

Never booted up the game again after that. If I started playing again without supervision, I'd probably starve to death at my computer.
        Dude you and the above guy completely sold me on Factorio...it sounds like gameplay that appeals to me. Will have to give it a try.
        Don't forget after fixing grew circuits, "What was I doing now?" And just walking through your factory trying to remember and seeing that iron is struggling so decide to fix that then wonder four hours away why green circuits are trickling, and then remember oh right. 

The factory must grow.
        Man I remember the last time I played, I decided to try the "main bus"/ribbon cable method of organizing conveyors. The mess of lines splitting and joining the main bus was *BEAUTIFUL*
    Good enough, will try soon
        Prepare for spaghetti belts. Also the factory must grow, it is always hungry
            i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
                Kill the natives xdddd
        This is top tier irony.  
It's like going to the alcoholic anons and start heavy drinking after hearing their story.  


I'm glad you're joining. *The factory must grow.*
        There is a [demo available](https://factorio.com/download) on their website *and their steam page too
        *The factory must grow*
        Be careful. It's a game that will take over your life until you complete it haha
    The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

                colonialism is just the final form of capitalism tbh
        British Empire simulator.
    Also, the devs are amazing.

They are obsessed with code optimization (figures, the game is made in c++) and bug hunting. Even in the early stage of early access the game was more polished than lots of games that consider themselves released.

Also, they are incredibly transparent, as they post an update on their blog every week ("Factorio Friday Facts") where they talk about their progress, visions, ideas, fixed bugs, yet another optimization they managed to squeeze out of the code and occasionally a mod showcase. As of now they've reached FFF#354 without a single missed week.

I wish every development studio had this kind of mentality.
    Ah yes, Rimworld but with more automation at the cost of less warcrimes.
        You say that like it's a bad thing. What's wrong with having colonists improve their Doctor skill by removing prisoners' legs, replacing them with peg legs, then removing the peg legs and reattaching them over and over again?
            The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
            The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
                Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
                Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
            Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.
    Everything must be automated and optimised
    The factory must grow to feed the factory.
    Idk bro, sounds like real life to me
    Sounds like 1600 colonisation to me but space

    The factory must grow. why are you wasting time on reddit?
    They don't call it Cracktorio for nothing
Real-time factory management game where you mine and process resources into various parts, research new technology and eventually try to build a spaceship to escape the planet you crash-landed on, all while trying to keep your base protected from the local giant bugs that are none too happy that you're there.  It's absolutely amazing.
    You dont escape the planet though? you just get research from launching rockets with satellites?
        Well yeah, technically you don't, but that's mainly because the game is supposed to be an infinite sandbox.  Launching the rocket is considered the win condition for the main game and you can choose to exit or keep playing.
            Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
                One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
        There are mods that add in space and the ability to colonies other planets.
[deleted]
    All of this. The dedication to making the game run flawlessly is astounding.

You can have a factory consisting of millions of parts, and the game runs fine. At worst, it starts to slow down ever so slightly. And if it does, they give you the 'under the hood' tools to figure out which part of your factory is slowing down your computer and you can optimize that. And somehow even that is fun.

I have, never, ever, not even once, had the vanilla game crash on me.
[deleted]
    I can't think of a trailer that explains the heart of its game better
        It really does. It's seldom that a trailer alone sells a game for me, but the first time I watched it I knew I had to have Factorio.
https://youtu.be/KVvXv1Z6EY8

Developers are awesome, there's great mod support, even though it's already awesome the game is changing for the better and the 1.0 version releases soon

E: https://youtu.be/DR01YdFtWFI
Its a game where you land on a deserted planet and your ultimate goal is launching a satellite with a rocket which you both handconstruct. You do this by setting up a system of factories which automatically mine resources and refine them into parts that you use to build more factories which mine other resources which can be refined into more parts and you aim to automate as much as possible of this process. Quite a fascinating game.
The thing that just ate the entirety of my week so far.
Its a game that will take every waking ounce of thought you have blend the days and nights together and turn your dreams into crude twisted machinations of robot arms, optimal ratios, and novel routes to efficiency.

 anyways 10/10 game
Prepare yourself to disappear for days on end.

Make sure you notify loved ones so they don’t worry

same opinion on the witcher
I enjoyed Witcher 3 and all but I don't find it to be nearly as good as people hype it up to be.  I felt like it was just bland combat, cutscene, bland combat, cutscene over and over.  Last game I can think of in that genre I really enjoyed was dragon age origin
    My main gripe was the fucking character movement. I just can't play a game with such good graphics and see Geralt running around like an Oblivion NPC. It's too weird.
        The horse riding drove me insane sometimes.  Maybe RDR2 spoiled me but my god did I hate controlling my man Roach sometimes.
        Another issue I have with the game is that if you don't like Geralt or don't find him interesting- tough luck, he's fully voiced and his mug is in every cut scene
            So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
    See, and I really enjoyed the combat, when it was Me VS 1 Enemy. Like the griffon fight. Fucking loved that. There was a quest I had to find some crazy guys goat and I ended up fighting a bear. Another fantastic fight. Found the typical "Oh no, I'm turning into a monster. I gotta hide" house. The guy was a werewolf in a cave under his house. If it hadn't been for my sword breaking, it would have been a fucking amazing fight.

But you put me up against more than 2 enemies and the combat just dies. Every single good thing I have to say about the combat gets pulled out and thrown away when you fight more than 1-2 enemies. It goes from almost Souls-like or Monster Hunter-like combat, where you KNOW this enemy is stronger than you and your only hope of beating them is to not get hit, to a mindless, repetitive slog of "dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, get a single attack in, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge..." until you want to kill yourself.

This doesn't even touch on geralt. He is the most bland, 1-dimensional character I've ever seen. To the point where if you pick a dialogue option that isn't in that 1 dimension he's "good" at, it feels like someone has a gun to his head and is forcing him to say it.

And honestly, I kinda hate that I don't like the game. Its such a good game held back by too many enemies and a terrible protagonist.
    I really liked dragon age inquisition
Would have been amazing if it had a better combat system.
I love action adventure RPGs. Witcher 3 is the worst action adventure rpg I've ever played. Every aspect of the gameplay, from combat, to travel, to just navigating the menu system is like pulling teeth, and the story is like some greasy neckbeards dnd wet dream. I do not get why it's so popular.
    I'm shocked you're getting away with trashing it right now. I've been buried in downvotes before for saying it was overrated.
    What would you recommend instead?
        I had the same opinion as that guy and just off the top of my head I really enjoyed Skyrim, Dark Souls (all of them, even 2 is better), Bloodborne, Dragon Age Inquisition, Horizon.
            As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
        Even dragon age 2 is better
Also tried witcher and I don't like it either.
That's because it's overhyped garbage that gets a review circlejerk from reddit. Didn't like it either in case it wasnt obvious.
Yeah same with Factorio lol, i wonder what their actual ratings could be.
Which is moronic, the games aren't flawless.
Stardew Valley is kinda overhyped too. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and I love it. But objectively, Rune Factory 4 has almost everything that Stardew also has and has generally more content and 100x better story.
I have never played a game that had this big of an open world without it feeling empty. All of the side quests are good with many have great stories. Multiple different endings, good gameplay, great voice acting, and cheap dlc that DOUBLES the length of the game. It does all that while having some of the best graphics around (when it released). Oh also a good modding community.
Portal 2 expanded on everything that Portal 1 did right. Maybe going from nothing to Portal 1 is just a bigger leap than going from Portal 1 to Portal 2, and that's why you think Portal 1 is better?
Well thats just like, your opinion. Also none of what youve said implies you disliked either of them.
    True. I didn't hate any of them. I just don't really get the top 5 of all time thing.

I also low-key get annoyed everytime I see people loving the Witcher 3 because it feels like a party I wasn't invited to.
        How dare you not like Sir Geralto's Lusty Gwent Adventure? Please delete your Reddit account now. 

Jokes aside, it's a shame it didn't catch on for you. Have you tried watching the Netflix show instead?
            No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
                Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
                    I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
            The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
        I tried to play Witcher 3 twice and just wasn't hooked, despite being a huge fantasy RPG fan. Fuck sake I was more hooked by the broken shitshow that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance than Witcher 3.
            Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
                I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
                I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
        if you need some company I didn't like it as well. The first like 10 hours are fine because novelty and stuff but afterwards all I was thinking was "I could've replayed mass effect instead".
Portal 2 has J.K. Simmons. You're obviously insane. Seriously, though, and no pun intended, I found Portal 2 to be a much deeper game.
Stardew is on like every console + mobile as well. The dude that created the game made so much bank.
    *And* he's still coming out with content for the game. Content that's free.
        Which is exactly why both Stardew Valley and Terraria are in the top 5.
    Deserved.
        Honestly though, such a great game
        Totally, he worked many years alone on it
        Totally deserved, all the love and sweat put into the game shows.
    Absolutely deserved it too, guy made almost every part of the code, art, story, music, everything. Dudes a genius
        That's not something the ape would tell you.
        He did do everything. He worked on the game for four years before it was released and made $1m within the first 12 days of the pc release. Only time he got someone else to help him was with the code for the multiplayer update.
    And it was just one guy coding everything and designing everything for such a long time, he just decided to add people to the team when they added multiplayer cause he couldn’t do it himself. The guy is a mastermind
    Even more shocking is Factorio, imo.
some say its the poor man's animal crossing, I say its the more accessible, deeper narrative version ~~if~~ of animal crossing.
    I thought it was way more fun than Animal Crossing (that being said I only played Animal Crossing on GameCube)

But Stardew Valley is just an improvement to games like harvest moon
    It's better than AC imo
        Yeah, you can't fuck the villagers in AC and have kids with them.
        lowkey think so too, just not planning on rustling any feathers hehe
In my opinion more goal oriented and "gamey". In animal crossing you can spend a day doing nothing and you haven't really lost anything. In stardew valley you want to progress more quickly to be ready for village events etc. Still a very relaxing game though
    I'd like to point out you don't really need to tho if you don't want. You can just chill for years and there's really no downside.
        There's only like two time-sensitive events, one cutscene with a NPC and a 'scoring' system for your farm. The latter can be repeated so really not a worry.

I still panic rushing home from the mines at 1am.
            Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
                You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
                    You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
                        i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                            Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
            whats cutscene with a box?
                [deleted]
    Man, I think I just can't chill in games. Animal Crossing stressed me out as I felt like I was a failure if I didn't get on it and do my daily chores. It made me quit it, I'll probably go back at some point.
        Same happened to me with daily quests in World of Warcraft. Those made me quit when I realized I was rushing home from work to basically do virtual chores.
    [deleted]
        Sounds like you just want to pack too much in. You just have to get there's nothing wrong with spending the whole first 6 months just fishing if you feel like it. There's no real victory condition or end to the game. Take it slow.
            I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
Mildly similar, more in how it makes you feel than how it's played. Stardew is more farming focused, but you also get to raise animals and make artisan goods and you can totally avoid farming entirely if you prefer.

Similarities:

* Relaxing ambiance (with plenty of min-max potential for those who want that)

* "Play your way" style of game, with customization in the layout of your farm and the decorations in your home/building (not as many options to customize as Animal Crossing)

* Big collection component (fish, artifacts, recipes, crops, foraging)

Differences:

* The town is pre-set, townspeople don't move in/out

* The relationship system is emphasized more, with the ability to date/marry/divorce/have kids with a variety of dateable characters. There are also "heart events" you can trigger as you get closer to them, which are cutscenes or special scenarios where you typically learn more about them and get closer to them

* More structure/guidance in the core goals of the game (never required, but for those who feel too aimless in Animal Crossing this gives you more things to actively work toward)

* It's more bingeable - an ingame day takes ~15 min IRL, but you can go to sleep earlier to move to the next day. So you can play through a whole year without stopping if you want
    Thanks! That sounds like something my fiancé and I would enjoy. Is there a way for us to play together or visit each other’s farms like you can in AC?
        Yes actually, you can have multiplayer farms! One person has to host the file and get past the intro, then up to 3(?) players can have cabins on that farm and play together. You can also marry each other if you want. 

Or, you could each have separate save files but also each have a cabin on the other’s file, and then you could play together sometimes and alone sometimes.
            Sounds perfect thank you!
        The game is multiplayer, you can have separate houses as well.
        It does have multiplayer, but it may work a bit differently (haven't played AC), you generally want to start a shared farm from the beginning.
            Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
                Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
    As an addendum, you don't need to engage with the other townsfolk at all to have an enjoyable experience. I haven't given one gift in any of my three playthroughs.
[deleted]
    I think you’ve convinced me! Now to decide to buy it on my switch or PC 🤔
        It's a tough choice. Both are great, the ability to play anywhere even for a few minutes is perfect, but there are some mods I can't live without on my more serious farms.

I still suggest playing without mods at first, but by year 3 or on another playthrough, definitely look into them.
        PC for sure. It's way cheaper, I think slightly further along in updates, and you can mod it. Not even a debate in my opinion, unless of course you prioritize mobility over everything else.
        It’s nice being able to play in handheld mode on switch, the downside is the loading times are far longer than on pc. Pc also has the benefit of time-saving inventory shortcuts. It’s really not that different, it all depends on what matters most to you.
Playing Animal Crossing eventually felt like chores to me. Stardews characters have a bit more depth,  tasks can be automated, and the game has more direction.
i dident know that meny people had the game .. i mean i have it and its alright ig
    It rules.
        ETS2 isn't flashy or genre definitely but it does what it wants to go extremely well. The models are super detailed and there are a lot of great features like tuning into actual radio stations and landmarks.


Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.
            > Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
                oh you have the patience to even attempt this
            I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
    It has a very strong fanbase. 

Personally, I thought it was neat but got boring after about 10 hours or so.  Once I got the hang of parking and driving and upgraded beyond the shit slow early trucks you get, there's not much more to it.  And the locations are all super basic.  American Truck Simulator at least does a lot better job in that regard.
is itt?
    it's surprisingly fun, very relaxing. a great game to play while talking to friends or attending a boring class in college. the online adds a whole new layer of fun to be had. it's very satisfying to get a shitload of money after driving for 3+ hours. plus it's often no more than 5 euro on sale.
        Not saying its bad it just gets boring after a while
            Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.
Had trouble enjoying the game with a key board and mouse. After I got a controller I gave it another try, and clocked like 300 hours in less then a month. The game is so relaxing!
i cant see it being addictive all i can see it as is mabey relaxing because all you do is.. well Drive
This seems like a complaint on the genre/anime art style than criticizing the game
The only thing Terraria technically doesn't have is a full blown creative mode like Minecraft, but obviously that was an intentional choice and we were given journey mode, and mods/3rd party apps can do that for us, so it has everything, especially once mods come out
    Journey mode is so good. You can leave most of the challenge in but take out whatever grinding you think is dumb/not do things like mine out the marble biome of 4 worlds if you want a town made of marble.
        \*duping to get infinite platinum pre-wall of flesh intensifies\*

        [deleted]
            Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
    Honestly pre hardmode summoner has problems
        and early hardmode. i have just spider armor and i’m unable to kill the mechanical bosses
            It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
                yeah
                Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
            you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
                yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
                    For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
                    On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
        Honestly summoner in general is so underpowered that it feels weird that the class’s unbalanced state is apparently the final state of the game. 

I love 1.4 and all the stuff that it did add, but for a final update it did seem to leave just a few loose ends.
        pre _and_ hardmode. summoner still sucks, which is a shame
    \*Sad TmodLoader stuck in 1.3.5.3 noises\*
        Is there anywhere to see their progress? It would be interesting to know how far they are into development
            sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
    I mean... for people that buy games for the building aspect that is a pretty big deal. Completely fair to not want to buy it based on that.

For the people saying Journey is a comparable mode, it’s just not. The research thing is so gimmicky and you still need to get plenty of the resource to actually build with it.
I always go straight for negative reviews when seeing if I should get a game and if I can find some that are actual critiques I’ll listen to them and will then try to find actual praises in the positive reviews and I’ll compare the two

Too often I see in positive stuff just like “it’s a good game” and in negative I see stuff like “trash game”
Can confirm the same for Factorio, too many """""funny""""" joke reviews are negative for the point of trying to get attention
This is why I don't understand people leaving good "negative" reviews. Not only are they literally decreasing the ratings of a game they like, but they are also crowding the negative reviews section, making justified negative reviews like yours harder to find, potentially misleading other customers. When I look at negative reviews of a game I'm planning to buy, I'm not looking for an excuse to hate the game, I'm trying to see if there are aspects of the game people dislike, that could potentially turn me off as well.

    I think if you wanna get technical, Dota 2 came out of beta at some point between Portal 2 and HL:A as well.
        And then there's Artifact and Underlords as well
Artifact counts damn it.  We count!!!!
    I think they made DotA Underlords since then as well. That counts at least as much as Artifact, right?
        They did.  And that also hasn't gone very well lol
HLA isn't a actual game?
    An*
HLA came out and it’s incredible.
Half life alyx? That is definitely a real game
I think my favourite bit still has to be the start of chapter 9- 

>!GLaDOS: I think this is the part where he kills us!<

>!Wheatley: Hello! This is the part where I kill you!< 

>!Text on screen: Chapter 9 - The part where he kills you!<

>!Achievement unlocked: The part where he kills you - this is that part!<
    I just remembered the existence of that scene and now I can't stop laughing
    Fun fact: The music file for that part is called 
>!thepartwherehekillsyou.mp4!<
        Wasn’t there also an achievement at that part
            the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
            There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
                Where you jump in the pit, right?
                    Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
    The music for that part is also called "the part where he kills you". 



But yeah, from that point until the end is the best part of any game ever
    Th best moment in any videogame ever
    My man Wheatley on the ledge and shit
    The sad part is that achievement only pops up the first time. 

It's an great joke that's never really the same the second time around.
    Fun fact. It’s called the part where he kills you because it’s the part where he kills you!
    God I love that game.
Even better the massively giant door that just kept another normal sized door behind it.

Best joke in the entire game.
    There are so many good jokes but yeah that is one of the best
recently played for the first time with a friend in coop

IT'S ULTRA FUN
    If you haven't already, PLEASE play the singleplayer story, too. It's beyond good. Gameplay is just as good as the coop, and it also has an absolutely amazing story with great voice acting and a lot of hilarious moments.
        I'm playing Portal 1's singleplayer first, but I will play PL2 afterwards.
            Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
                I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
                Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past
The turret orchestra will never not get tears into my eyes. It is the perfect ending and Chell deserved it so much.
    Look up the english translation of the lyrics, will create more tears
        I already know them mate, Italian opera I think is the original. It's beautiful. So fitting. Thanks for the suggestion though.
            Ahh, cheers :]
                Cheers to you too, fellow human :)
I’ve never played it because my computer can’t handle it and it’s not on the PS4 or the switch. I am seriously considering getting my ps3 back out just for portal
    Even on the lower settings? Most older valve titles can run on nearly any system.
        I’m actually not sure. I know that my computer can barely run anything, so I usually just get it on consoles.
            Ah ok. Portal 2 is still relatively newer compared to something like Half-Life 2 so I wouldn’t be too sure. But the games have all ran decently on the old laptop I had so it doesn’t hurt to check if you can run it.
            Source Engine games are incredibly lenient on hardware, even the newer ones like Portal 2 from 2012 are well optimized. Most integrated graphics from the last 10 years or so can probably run it. Mind if you tell me your computer's specs, if you know any?
That is why there will never be a portal 3. :(
Cave Johnson is so unbelievably well performed that I seriously want to give JK Simmons a big, wet kiss on the mouth for it. 

That dude is just perfect in everything. Including the Ladykillers, which for some reason people hate.
I am literally playing Portal 2 as I saw this post. I was mildly confused.
And it has over 350k more votes
That's why i respect this game so much. The dude working on this game made it entirely by himself and a only a few months ago he started getting a team to help him
    Well, more like a few years ago. I believe he needed help with net code and porting the game. But yeh. So many great indie games are the vision of one person who has the ability to reach that goal
Yeah, I'll never forget my dear farmer, [434].
    And my sweet chicken companion [74].... *F*
It's basically a Harvest Moon, but ***better***.
That gives me hope. I absolutely loved Zelda Breath of the Wild for example and I hope a similar love will unfold itself with the Witcher series.
This is EXACTLY what I felt. My friend recommended TW3 so I bought it and I just couldn't get into it for some reason so I stopped playing it for a few months and decided to come back later on, which is not something I usually do. Probably the best decision of my life, once I got to the bloody Barron quest I was hooked. Three playthroughs later I can say that it's hands down the best game ever made, and CDPR is perhaps the most consumer friendly company, i got both expansions for £10 where other companies would probably charge £25 for each
That's also when you realize the combat is pretty fucking boring
All of the games on the list except the Witcher run natively on Linux too.
Always be that guy my guy I appreciate it
I think your description underestimates how additive it is
Thanks :)
I have both ,but i dont like them.. whatever,come Factorio hahahahha thanx for answer. I love reddit and users here.
There is a bit. The more ratings it has the closer it is to the actual percentage. I think factorio has a higher positive rating percentage but the lack of votes gives it a bit of a penalty. I'll try to find the formula...

Edit. It is more complicated than I thought but is explained by the list maker here: https://steam250.com/about
Agreed. As somebody who loves every game on the top 5 (and selfishly think Factorio deserves #2) Portal 2 at the #1 spot is deserved. IMO, Portal 2 is the best game ever made.
    I couldn't agree more. I love all of the games in the top 5 and have hundreds of hours in each of them, but Factorio has the best devs hands down. [They routinely chase down](https://preview.redd.it/i9e7ghpd5k131.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8bdc5afec843eabe500872f195e73827b8a4) bugs that one person in an edge case is having just so the game will be perfect for them.
Words escape me for how good JK Simmons is in that game.
It's coming out of early access on September 25th, too.
    Btw, they moved the release date to August 14 so it wouldn't compete with the release of cyberpunk 2077
        > release of cyberpunk 2077

jokes on them cyberpunk isn't coming out until it's actually 2077
        Ah yes, I forgot about that. Googled "Factorio 1.0" and it showed the blogpost where that date was stated, instead of googling "Factorio release date".
    Is it gonna go up in price when this happens? I figure it’ll never ever go on sale so I’m wondering if I should just buy it now
        They already increased the price a few updates ago, with the reason given being "the content in the game is already pretty much what's gonna be in the 1.0 version", so I don't think they'll increase the price further.
        I haven't heard of any plans of a price increase, but it has a free demo they've been tweaking for a while now to give you a feel of the gameplay loop. If you like that, then buy the game; it will be the best $30 you've spent in a long time.
[deleted]
    Is it working or is it the only thing stopping their indie game from being the most sold?
        It's hardly even early access anymore. At this point they're just ironing out small kinks and optimizing. I have every achievement and over 600 hours in the game and literally never once encountered a bug or crash.

On top of that they give incredibly detailed weekly developer updates: https://www.factorio.com/blog/

At this point I think the only thing really holding it back is just word of mouth and the fact that it's sort of a niche genre.
            I was going to say it seems like they're scared of the money drying up after Factorio and flopping the next game and prolonging it, but  I saw one of the devs responding to reddit threads about general questions and bugs with modded versions. 

Now it's like this is their passion project first and foremost and a full release is daunting because where do you go from creating an instant classic on your first crack?
                I have absolutely no clue what happens after launch (*besides patches and possibly content updates)* but given the quality of Factorio I'll be along for whatever they do next. These guys have won me over.
        Definitely stopped me from buying it so far even though it’s right up my alley

Woo for being a single data point!
            There's a great demo, you know.
They have a demo that will show you if you want to play further.
It will never go on sale. If you want to try the game out, download the free demo.
well it used to be $20 for a long time, guessed you missed out
    I actually bought it for $20 lmao, returned it bc the steam sale was abt to happen. then the sales happened and it went up to $30 💀
        Lmao you got dunked
    Hehe, I got it for like £7.50 back in the original Indiegogo. I've had to buy it a couple times for friends since just because they're such good devs.
Play the demo, if it grips you - it is well worth the money.
Some have it more than others
    The list is already weird since it ranked a 99% rated game below 98%
How so? The slow part is not actually getting the fish but waiting for the day to reset.
    Im pretty sure you can also use a journeymode character to set the time to the next day and just grind them away.
        But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
            I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
    If you click on the head of the bed you sleep now, if you sleep time goes by faster. Doesn't work during events and in multiplayer everyone has to sleep.
        But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
Me too, I'm available on the weekends if you want

You're forgetting that you're not making enough blue circuits. Where is the bottleneck? Oh, it's in your oil production. Fix that. Now your red circuits can't keep up with all the blue ones you are making.

You need more.

Expand your red circuits production. You need to go under some smelting facilities, but that's fine, a few underground belts should do it. Great, now why isn't it making anything?

Green circuits. You need more of those. But plastic production is in the way. You left it there a while ago thinking it will be enough. It was time for an upgrade anyway. Spent the next few hours moving and expanding your plastic production, and trying to re-connect it everywhere. Gad that's a mess, but it works, so don't fix what isn't broken.

Right, now you expand the green circuits. You need more copper wire, but you're not making as much as your factory can anyway, just smelt more copper plates.  But your trains are on maximum capacity. You need more carts, and that means messing with the train station, but some other thing is in the way. You need to move it elsewhere. There goes another hour messing with train signals....

More copper. Great, now you can finally, finally go back to what you where... Wait what? I now need more iron? Shit, i missed work
    [deleted]
        Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.

                it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
                    Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                        I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                        however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                        I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                        Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
                    Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                        right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                        the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
                    Cracktorio
                Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
                    Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
                It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
                    The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
                On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
                Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
                Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
        It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
            Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
                I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
                    It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                        Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
                It's also still in Alpha.
        Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
            Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
                You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
                    Organic nukes only
        Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
            That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
                Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
        It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
            I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
        But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
        It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
        Its much more
    Factorio is a game that I love, byt I hate myself whenever I play it because I'm so inefficient. I have no clue what I'm doing.
        Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
            My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
                My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
                    Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
            My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
    I used to play it with my brother for I dunno, 30-40 hours and I feel the scenario
    I feel this.
    Bad news: You aren’t consuming enough heavy oil so all plastic production has stopped. You thought you had that covered with overflow solid fuel production, but since you’ve got your nuclear power up and running and most of your furnaces converted to electric, you simply aren’t consuming enough of it and all your buffer chests are full.
    This is where I get stuck in the game, there’s so much to fix but I don’t even know where to start and half the problems are self-created in an attempt to avoid the problems
    i just had ptsd...thanks
    [deleted]
    Bought the game a *loooooooong* time ago, and my then-roommate warned me about it. I booted up the tutorial and told him to stop me after two hours.

Ten minutes later, my roommate messaged me, and the clock and the sun outside were mysteriously two hours ahead.

Never booted up the game again after that. If I started playing again without supervision, I'd probably starve to death at my computer.
    Dude you and the above guy completely sold me on Factorio...it sounds like gameplay that appeals to me. Will have to give it a try.
    Don't forget after fixing grew circuits, "What was I doing now?" And just walking through your factory trying to remember and seeing that iron is struggling so decide to fix that then wonder four hours away why green circuits are trickling, and then remember oh right. 

The factory must grow.
    Man I remember the last time I played, I decided to try the "main bus"/ribbon cable method of organizing conveyors. The mess of lines splitting and joining the main bus was *BEAUTIFUL*
Good enough, will try soon
    Prepare for spaghetti belts. Also the factory must grow, it is always hungry
        i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
            Kill the natives xdddd
    This is top tier irony.  
It's like going to the alcoholic anons and start heavy drinking after hearing their story.  


I'm glad you're joining. *The factory must grow.*
    There is a [demo available](https://factorio.com/download) on their website *and their steam page too
    *The factory must grow*
    Be careful. It's a game that will take over your life until you complete it haha
The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.  
The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.

The factory must grow.
    The factory must expand to meet the needs of the expanding factory
America simulator?

        colonialism simulator
            colonialism is just the final form of capitalism tbh
    British Empire simulator.
Also, the devs are amazing.

They are obsessed with code optimization (figures, the game is made in c++) and bug hunting. Even in the early stage of early access the game was more polished than lots of games that consider themselves released.

Also, they are incredibly transparent, as they post an update on their blog every week ("Factorio Friday Facts") where they talk about their progress, visions, ideas, fixed bugs, yet another optimization they managed to squeeze out of the code and occasionally a mod showcase. As of now they've reached FFF#354 without a single missed week.

I wish every development studio had this kind of mentality.
Ah yes, Rimworld but with more automation at the cost of less warcrimes.
    You say that like it's a bad thing. What's wrong with having colonists improve their Doctor skill by removing prisoners' legs, replacing them with peg legs, then removing the peg legs and reattaching them over and over again?
        The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
        The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
            Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
            Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
        Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.
Everything must be automated and optimised
The factory must grow to feed the factory.
Idk bro, sounds like real life to me
Sounds like 1600 colonisation to me but space
Look at Mr. Self Control, stopping to go to work.
Realize it’s 5 am and you need to go to work? Kill the natives
The factory must grow. why are you wasting time on reddit?
They don't call it Cracktorio for nothing
You dont escape the planet though? you just get research from launching rockets with satellites?
    Well yeah, technically you don't, but that's mainly because the game is supposed to be an infinite sandbox.  Launching the rocket is considered the win condition for the main game and you can choose to exit or keep playing.
        Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
            One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
    There are mods that add in space and the ability to colonies other planets.
All of this. The dedication to making the game run flawlessly is astounding.

You can have a factory consisting of millions of parts, and the game runs fine. At worst, it starts to slow down ever so slightly. And if it does, they give you the 'under the hood' tools to figure out which part of your factory is slowing down your computer and you can optimize that. And somehow even that is fun.

I have, never, ever, not even once, had the vanilla game crash on me.
I can't think of a trailer that explains the heart of its game better
    It really does. It's seldom that a trailer alone sells a game for me, but the first time I watched it I knew I had to have Factorio.
Perfect
My main gripe was the fucking character movement. I just can't play a game with such good graphics and see Geralt running around like an Oblivion NPC. It's too weird.
    The horse riding drove me insane sometimes.  Maybe RDR2 spoiled me but my god did I hate controlling my man Roach sometimes.
    Another issue I have with the game is that if you don't like Geralt or don't find him interesting- tough luck, he's fully voiced and his mug is in every cut scene
        So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
See, and I really enjoyed the combat, when it was Me VS 1 Enemy. Like the griffon fight. Fucking loved that. There was a quest I had to find some crazy guys goat and I ended up fighting a bear. Another fantastic fight. Found the typical "Oh no, I'm turning into a monster. I gotta hide" house. The guy was a werewolf in a cave under his house. If it hadn't been for my sword breaking, it would have been a fucking amazing fight.

But you put me up against more than 2 enemies and the combat just dies. Every single good thing I have to say about the combat gets pulled out and thrown away when you fight more than 1-2 enemies. It goes from almost Souls-like or Monster Hunter-like combat, where you KNOW this enemy is stronger than you and your only hope of beating them is to not get hit, to a mindless, repetitive slog of "dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, get a single attack in, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge..." until you want to kill yourself.

This doesn't even touch on geralt. He is the most bland, 1-dimensional character I've ever seen. To the point where if you pick a dialogue option that isn't in that 1 dimension he's "good" at, it feels like someone has a gun to his head and is forcing him to say it.

And honestly, I kinda hate that I don't like the game. Its such a good game held back by too many enemies and a terrible protagonist.
I really liked dragon age inquisition
I'm shocked you're getting away with trashing it right now. I've been buried in downvotes before for saying it was overrated.
What would you recommend instead?
    I had the same opinion as that guy and just off the top of my head I really enjoyed Skyrim, Dark Souls (all of them, even 2 is better), Bloodborne, Dragon Age Inquisition, Horizon.
        As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
    Even dragon age 2 is better
True. I didn't hate any of them. I just don't really get the top 5 of all time thing.

I also low-key get annoyed everytime I see people loving the Witcher 3 because it feels like a party I wasn't invited to.
    How dare you not like Sir Geralto's Lusty Gwent Adventure? Please delete your Reddit account now. 

Jokes aside, it's a shame it didn't catch on for you. Have you tried watching the Netflix show instead?
        No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
            Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
                I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
        The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
    I tried to play Witcher 3 twice and just wasn't hooked, despite being a huge fantasy RPG fan. Fuck sake I was more hooked by the broken shitshow that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance than Witcher 3.
        Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
            I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
            I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
    if you need some company I didn't like it as well. The first like 10 hours are fine because novelty and stuff but afterwards all I was thinking was "I could've replayed mass effect instead".
*And* he's still coming out with content for the game. Content that's free.
    Which is exactly why both Stardew Valley and Terraria are in the top 5.
Deserved.
    Honestly though, such a great game
    Totally, he worked many years alone on it
    Totally deserved, all the love and sweat put into the game shows.
Absolutely deserved it too, guy made almost every part of the code, art, story, music, everything. Dudes a genius
    That's not something the ape would tell you.
    He did do everything. He worked on the game for four years before it was released and made $1m within the first 12 days of the pc release. Only time he got someone else to help him was with the code for the multiplayer update.
And it was just one guy coding everything and designing everything for such a long time, he just decided to add people to the team when they added multiplayer cause he couldn’t do it himself. The guy is a mastermind
Even more shocking is Factorio, imo.
I thought it was way more fun than Animal Crossing (that being said I only played Animal Crossing on GameCube)

But Stardew Valley is just an improvement to games like harvest moon
It's better than AC imo
    Yeah, you can't fuck the villagers in AC and have kids with them.
    lowkey think so too, just not planning on rustling any feathers hehe
I'd like to point out you don't really need to tho if you don't want. You can just chill for years and there's really no downside.
    There's only like two time-sensitive events, one cutscene with a NPC and a 'scoring' system for your farm. The latter can be repeated so really not a worry.

I still panic rushing home from the mines at 1am.
        Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
            You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
                You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
                    i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                        Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
        whats cutscene with a box?
            [deleted]
Man, I think I just can't chill in games. Animal Crossing stressed me out as I felt like I was a failure if I didn't get on it and do my daily chores. It made me quit it, I'll probably go back at some point.
    Same happened to me with daily quests in World of Warcraft. Those made me quit when I realized I was rushing home from work to basically do virtual chores.
[deleted]
    Sounds like you just want to pack too much in. You just have to get there's nothing wrong with spending the whole first 6 months just fishing if you feel like it. There's no real victory condition or end to the game. Take it slow.
        I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
Thanks! That sounds like something my fiancé and I would enjoy. Is there a way for us to play together or visit each other’s farms like you can in AC?
    Yes actually, you can have multiplayer farms! One person has to host the file and get past the intro, then up to 3(?) players can have cabins on that farm and play together. You can also marry each other if you want. 

Or, you could each have separate save files but also each have a cabin on the other’s file, and then you could play together sometimes and alone sometimes.
        Sounds perfect thank you!
    The game is multiplayer, you can have separate houses as well.
    It does have multiplayer, but it may work a bit differently (haven't played AC), you generally want to start a shared farm from the beginning.
        Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
            Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
As an addendum, you don't need to engage with the other townsfolk at all to have an enjoyable experience. I haven't given one gift in any of my three playthroughs.
I think you’ve convinced me! Now to decide to buy it on my switch or PC 🤔
    It's a tough choice. Both are great, the ability to play anywhere even for a few minutes is perfect, but there are some mods I can't live without on my more serious farms.

I still suggest playing without mods at first, but by year 3 or on another playthrough, definitely look into them.
    PC for sure. It's way cheaper, I think slightly further along in updates, and you can mod it. Not even a debate in my opinion, unless of course you prioritize mobility over everything else.
    It’s nice being able to play in handheld mode on switch, the downside is the loading times are far longer than on pc. Pc also has the benefit of time-saving inventory shortcuts. It’s really not that different, it all depends on what matters most to you.
It rules.
    ETS2 isn't flashy or genre definitely but it does what it wants to go extremely well. The models are super detailed and there are a lot of great features like tuning into actual radio stations and landmarks.


Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.
        > Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
            oh you have the patience to even attempt this
        I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
It has a very strong fanbase. 

Personally, I thought it was neat but got boring after about 10 hours or so.  Once I got the hang of parking and driving and upgraded beyond the shit slow early trucks you get, there's not much more to it.  And the locations are all super basic.  American Truck Simulator at least does a lot better job in that regard.
it's surprisingly fun, very relaxing. a great game to play while talking to friends or attending a boring class in college. the online adds a whole new layer of fun to be had. it's very satisfying to get a shitload of money after driving for 3+ hours. plus it's often no more than 5 euro on sale.
    Not saying its bad it just gets boring after a while
        Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.
Journey mode is so good. You can leave most of the challenge in but take out whatever grinding you think is dumb/not do things like mine out the marble biome of 4 worlds if you want a town made of marble.

        Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
Honestly pre hardmode summoner has problems
    and early hardmode. i have just spider armor and i’m unable to kill the mechanical bosses
        It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
            yeah
            Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
        you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
            yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
                For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
                On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
    Honestly summoner in general is so underpowered that it feels weird that the class’s unbalanced state is apparently the final state of the game. 

I love 1.4 and all the stuff that it did add, but for a final update it did seem to leave just a few loose ends.
    pre _and_ hardmode. summoner still sucks, which is a shame
\*Sad TmodLoader stuck in 1.3.5.3 noises\*
    Is there anywhere to see their progress? It would be interesting to know how far they are into development
        sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
I mean... for people that buy games for the building aspect that is a pretty big deal. Completely fair to not want to buy it based on that.

For the people saying Journey is a comparable mode, it’s just not. The research thing is so gimmicky and you still need to get plenty of the resource to actually build with it.
I think if you wanna get technical, Dota 2 came out of beta at some point between Portal 2 and HL:A as well.
    And then there's Artifact and Underlords as well
I think they made DotA Underlords since then as well. That counts at least as much as Artifact, right?
    They did.  And that also hasn't gone very well lol
An*
I just remembered the existence of that scene and now I can't stop laughing
Fun fact: The music file for that part is called

    Wasn’t there also an achievement at that part
        the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
        There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
            Where you jump in the pit, right?
                Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
The music for that part is also called "the part where he kills you". 



But yeah, from that point until the end is the best part of any game ever
Th best moment in any videogame ever
My man Wheatley on the ledge and shit
The sad part is that achievement only pops up the first time. 

It's an great joke that's never really the same the second time around.
Fun fact. It’s called the part where he kills you because it’s the part where he kills you!
God I love that game.
There are so many good jokes but yeah that is one of the best
If you haven't already, PLEASE play the singleplayer story, too. It's beyond good. Gameplay is just as good as the coop, and it also has an absolutely amazing story with great voice acting and a lot of hilarious moments.
    I'm playing Portal 1's singleplayer first, but I will play PL2 afterwards.
        Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
            I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
            Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past
Look up the english translation of the lyrics, will create more tears
    I already know them mate, Italian opera I think is the original. It's beautiful. So fitting. Thanks for the suggestion though.
        Ahh, cheers :]
            Cheers to you too, fellow human :)
Even on the lower settings? Most older valve titles can run on nearly any system.
    I’m actually not sure. I know that my computer can barely run anything, so I usually just get it on consoles.
        Ah ok. Portal 2 is still relatively newer compared to something like Half-Life 2 so I wouldn’t be too sure. But the games have all ran decently on the old laptop I had so it doesn’t hurt to check if you can run it.
        Source Engine games are incredibly lenient on hardware, even the newer ones like Portal 2 from 2012 are well optimized. Most integrated graphics from the last 10 years or so can probably run it. Mind if you tell me your computer's specs, if you know any?
Well, more like a few years ago. I believe he needed help with net code and porting the game. But yeh. So many great indie games are the vision of one person who has the ability to reach that goal
And my sweet chicken companion [74].... *F*
I couldn't agree more. I love all of the games in the top 5 and have hundreds of hours in each of them, but Factorio has the best devs hands down. [They routinely chase down](https://preview.redd.it/i9e7ghpd5k131.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8bdc5afec843eabe500872f195e73827b8a4) bugs that one person in an edge case is having just so the game will be perfect for them.
Btw, they moved the release date to August 14 so it wouldn't compete with the release of cyberpunk 2077
    > release of cyberpunk 2077

jokes on them cyberpunk isn't coming out until it's actually 2077
    Ah yes, I forgot about that. Googled "Factorio 1.0" and it showed the blogpost where that date was stated, instead of googling "Factorio release date".
Is it gonna go up in price when this happens? I figure it’ll never ever go on sale so I’m wondering if I should just buy it now
    They already increased the price a few updates ago, with the reason given being "the content in the game is already pretty much what's gonna be in the 1.0 version", so I don't think they'll increase the price further.
    I haven't heard of any plans of a price increase, but it has a free demo they've been tweaking for a while now to give you a feel of the gameplay loop. If you like that, then buy the game; it will be the best $30 you've spent in a long time.
Is it working or is it the only thing stopping their indie game from being the most sold?
    It's hardly even early access anymore. At this point they're just ironing out small kinks and optimizing. I have every achievement and over 600 hours in the game and literally never once encountered a bug or crash.

On top of that they give incredibly detailed weekly developer updates: https://www.factorio.com/blog/

At this point I think the only thing really holding it back is just word of mouth and the fact that it's sort of a niche genre.
        I was going to say it seems like they're scared of the money drying up after Factorio and flopping the next game and prolonging it, but  I saw one of the devs responding to reddit threads about general questions and bugs with modded versions. 

Now it's like this is their passion project first and foremost and a full release is daunting because where do you go from creating an instant classic on your first crack?
            I have absolutely no clue what happens after launch (*besides patches and possibly content updates)* but given the quality of Factorio I'll be along for whatever they do next. These guys have won me over.
    Definitely stopped me from buying it so far even though it’s right up my alley

Woo for being a single data point!
        There's a great demo, you know.
I actually bought it for $20 lmao, returned it bc the steam sale was abt to happen. then the sales happened and it went up to $30 💀
    Lmao you got dunked
Hehe, I got it for like £7.50 back in the original Indiegogo. I've had to buy it a couple times for friends since just because they're such good devs.
The list is already weird since it ranked a 99% rated game below 98%
Im pretty sure you can also use a journeymode character to set the time to the next day and just grind them away.
    But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
        I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
If you click on the head of the bed you sleep now, if you sleep time goes by faster. Doesn't work during events and in multiplayer everyone has to sleep.
    But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
[deleted]
    CST Central time and idk the time lol. Probably afternoon. Add me on steam; name's the same as here
        [deleted]
[deleted]
    Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.
        [deleted]
            it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
                Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                    I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                    however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                    I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                    Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
                Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                    right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                    the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
                Cracktorio
            Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
                Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
            It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
                The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
            On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
            Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
            Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
    It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
        Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
            I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
                It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                    Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
            It's also still in Alpha.
    Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
        Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
            You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
                Organic nukes only
    Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
        That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
            Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
    It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
        I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
    But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
    It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
    Its much more
Factorio is a game that I love, byt I hate myself whenever I play it because I'm so inefficient. I have no clue what I'm doing.
    Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
        My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
            My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
                Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
        My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
I used to play it with my brother for I dunno, 30-40 hours and I feel the scenario
I feel this.
Bad news: You aren’t consuming enough heavy oil so all plastic production has stopped. You thought you had that covered with overflow solid fuel production, but since you’ve got your nuclear power up and running and most of your furnaces converted to electric, you simply aren’t consuming enough of it and all your buffer chests are full.
This is where I get stuck in the game, there’s so much to fix but I don’t even know where to start and half the problems are self-created in an attempt to avoid the problems
i just had ptsd...thanks
[deleted]
Bought the game a *loooooooong* time ago, and my then-roommate warned me about it. I booted up the tutorial and told him to stop me after two hours.

Ten minutes later, my roommate messaged me, and the clock and the sun outside were mysteriously two hours ahead.

Never booted up the game again after that. If I started playing again without supervision, I'd probably starve to death at my computer.
Dude you and the above guy completely sold me on Factorio...it sounds like gameplay that appeals to me. Will have to give it a try.
Don't forget after fixing grew circuits, "What was I doing now?" And just walking through your factory trying to remember and seeing that iron is struggling so decide to fix that then wonder four hours away why green circuits are trickling, and then remember oh right. 

The factory must grow.
Man I remember the last time I played, I decided to try the "main bus"/ribbon cable method of organizing conveyors. The mess of lines splitting and joining the main bus was *BEAUTIFUL*
Prepare for spaghetti belts. Also the factory must grow, it is always hungry
    i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
        Kill the natives xdddd
This is top tier irony.  
It's like going to the alcoholic anons and start heavy drinking after hearing their story.  


I'm glad you're joining. *The factory must grow.*
There is a [demo available](https://factorio.com/download) on their website *and their steam page too
*The factory must grow*
Be careful. It's a game that will take over your life until you complete it haha
The factory must expand to meet the needs of the expanding factory

    colonialism simulator
        colonialism is just the final form of capitalism tbh
British Empire simulator.
You say that like it's a bad thing. What's wrong with having colonists improve their Doctor skill by removing prisoners' legs, replacing them with peg legs, then removing the peg legs and reattaching them over and over again?
    The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
    The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
        Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
        Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
    Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.
Well yeah, technically you don't, but that's mainly because the game is supposed to be an infinite sandbox.  Launching the rocket is considered the win condition for the main game and you can choose to exit or keep playing.
    Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
        One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
There are mods that add in space and the ability to colonies other planets.
It really does. It's seldom that a trailer alone sells a game for me, but the first time I watched it I knew I had to have Factorio.
The horse riding drove me insane sometimes.  Maybe RDR2 spoiled me but my god did I hate controlling my man Roach sometimes.
Another issue I have with the game is that if you don't like Geralt or don't find him interesting- tough luck, he's fully voiced and his mug is in every cut scene
    So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
I had the same opinion as that guy and just off the top of my head I really enjoyed Skyrim, Dark Souls (all of them, even 2 is better), Bloodborne, Dragon Age Inquisition, Horizon.
    As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
Even dragon age 2 is better
How dare you not like Sir Geralto's Lusty Gwent Adventure? Please delete your Reddit account now. 

Jokes aside, it's a shame it didn't catch on for you. Have you tried watching the Netflix show instead?
    No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
        Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
            I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
    The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
I tried to play Witcher 3 twice and just wasn't hooked, despite being a huge fantasy RPG fan. Fuck sake I was more hooked by the broken shitshow that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance than Witcher 3.
    Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
        I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
        I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
if you need some company I didn't like it as well. The first like 10 hours are fine because novelty and stuff but afterwards all I was thinking was "I could've replayed mass effect instead".
Which is exactly why both Stardew Valley and Terraria are in the top 5.
Honestly though, such a great game
Totally, he worked many years alone on it
Totally deserved, all the love and sweat put into the game shows.
That's not something the ape would tell you.
He did do everything. He worked on the game for four years before it was released and made $1m within the first 12 days of the pc release. Only time he got someone else to help him was with the code for the multiplayer update.
Yeah, you can't fuck the villagers in AC and have kids with them.
lowkey think so too, just not planning on rustling any feathers hehe
There's only like two time-sensitive events, one cutscene with a NPC and a 'scoring' system for your farm. The latter can be repeated so really not a worry.

I still panic rushing home from the mines at 1am.
    Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
        You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
            You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
                i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                    Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
    whats cutscene with a box?
        [deleted]
Same happened to me with daily quests in World of Warcraft. Those made me quit when I realized I was rushing home from work to basically do virtual chores.
Sounds like you just want to pack too much in. You just have to get there's nothing wrong with spending the whole first 6 months just fishing if you feel like it. There's no real victory condition or end to the game. Take it slow.
    I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
Yes actually, you can have multiplayer farms! One person has to host the file and get past the intro, then up to 3(?) players can have cabins on that farm and play together. You can also marry each other if you want. 

Or, you could each have separate save files but also each have a cabin on the other’s file, and then you could play together sometimes and alone sometimes.
    Sounds perfect thank you!
The game is multiplayer, you can have separate houses as well.
It does have multiplayer, but it may work a bit differently (haven't played AC), you generally want to start a shared farm from the beginning.
    Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
        Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
It's a tough choice. Both are great, the ability to play anywhere even for a few minutes is perfect, but there are some mods I can't live without on my more serious farms.

I still suggest playing without mods at first, but by year 3 or on another playthrough, definitely look into them.
PC for sure. It's way cheaper, I think slightly further along in updates, and you can mod it. Not even a debate in my opinion, unless of course you prioritize mobility over everything else.
It’s nice being able to play in handheld mode on switch, the downside is the loading times are far longer than on pc. Pc also has the benefit of time-saving inventory shortcuts. It’s really not that different, it all depends on what matters most to you.
ETS2 isn't flashy or genre definitely but it does what it wants to go extremely well. The models are super detailed and there are a lot of great features like tuning into actual radio stations and landmarks.


Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.
    > Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
        oh you have the patience to even attempt this
    I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
Not saying its bad it just gets boring after a while
    Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.

    Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
and early hardmode. i have just spider armor and i’m unable to kill the mechanical bosses
    It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
        yeah
        Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
    you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
        yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
            For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
            On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
Honestly summoner in general is so underpowered that it feels weird that the class’s unbalanced state is apparently the final state of the game. 

I love 1.4 and all the stuff that it did add, but for a final update it did seem to leave just a few loose ends.
pre _and_ hardmode. summoner still sucks, which is a shame
Is there anywhere to see their progress? It would be interesting to know how far they are into development
    sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
And then there's Artifact and Underlords as well
They did.  And that also hasn't gone very well lol
Wasn’t there also an achievement at that part
    the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
    There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
        Where you jump in the pit, right?
            Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
I'm playing Portal 1's singleplayer first, but I will play PL2 afterwards.
    Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
        I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
        Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past

I’m actually not sure. I know that my computer can barely run anything, so I usually just get it on consoles.
    Ah ok. Portal 2 is still relatively newer compared to something like Half-Life 2 so I wouldn’t be too sure. But the games have all ran decently on the old laptop I had so it doesn’t hurt to check if you can run it.
    Source Engine games are incredibly lenient on hardware, even the newer ones like Portal 2 from 2012 are well optimized. Most integrated graphics from the last 10 years or so can probably run it. Mind if you tell me your computer's specs, if you know any?
> release of cyberpunk 2077

jokes on them cyberpunk isn't coming out until it's actually 2077
Ah yes, I forgot about that. Googled "Factorio 1.0" and it showed the blogpost where that date was stated, instead of googling "Factorio release date".
They already increased the price a few updates ago, with the reason given being "the content in the game is already pretty much what's gonna be in the 1.0 version", so I don't think they'll increase the price further.
I haven't heard of any plans of a price increase, but it has a free demo they've been tweaking for a while now to give you a feel of the gameplay loop. If you like that, then buy the game; it will be the best $30 you've spent in a long time.
It's hardly even early access anymore. At this point they're just ironing out small kinks and optimizing. I have every achievement and over 600 hours in the game and literally never once encountered a bug or crash.

On top of that they give incredibly detailed weekly developer updates: https://www.factorio.com/blog/

At this point I think the only thing really holding it back is just word of mouth and the fact that it's sort of a niche genre.
    I was going to say it seems like they're scared of the money drying up after Factorio and flopping the next game and prolonging it, but  I saw one of the devs responding to reddit threads about general questions and bugs with modded versions. 

Now it's like this is their passion project first and foremost and a full release is daunting because where do you go from creating an instant classic on your first crack?
        I have absolutely no clue what happens after launch (*besides patches and possibly content updates)* but given the quality of Factorio I'll be along for whatever they do next. These guys have won me over.
Definitely stopped me from buying it so far even though it’s right up my alley

Woo for being a single data point!
    There's a great demo, you know.
Lmao you got dunked
But that’s basically cheating. It ain’t an achievement if you can just cheese it like that.
    I wouldn't call it a cheat since it's basically, like you said, a cheese. It's a game feature just like how you could make multiple characters and turn in the same quest a bunch of times prior to 1.4.

As someone who did them all normally I really don't mind them adding a simple time skip to get a terribly designed achievement...
But you can fish the quest item multiple times and complete the quests with multiple characters. You end up getting 40 quests done before you even realize
CST Central time and idk the time lol. Probably afternoon. Add me on steam; name's the same as here
    [deleted]
Pretty much.

But it definitely benefits from actually being designed to all work together, so you don't run into the issue of "which one of the 5 different versions of iron hopper do I need to get this to work" or wildly varying ideas of game balance from different mod authors.

        it's one of the few games with a free demo on steam highly recommended, it's like cocaine but legal.
            Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
                I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
                however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
                I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
                Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
            Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
                right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
                the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
            Cracktorio
        Also, unlike Minecraft technic the game is beautifully optimized with truly incredible devs hunting down every minor thing to optimize - you need to go to truly absurd scales in order to start slowing the game down.
            Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
        It is absolutely a ton of fun.

Plus it has coop MP and tons of mods.
            The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
        On that note, also check out Satisfactory if you like that kind of games.
        Check out a game called satisfactory too. Its like factorio but first person
        Uh just make sure you don't have any important tasks to do before you buy it. If you have an important test in two weeks - don't buy it yet
It was inspired by the MineCraft automation mods, so spot on.

It benefits tremendously from being built from the ground up to support that style of gameplay, though.

Another game (in Alpha) that has a similar theme is Satisfactory.
    Satisfactory is really fun too, but I think it somewhat misses on some QOL logistic circuits. Making a main bus is a pain in the ass because of how splitters work there.
        I think satisfactory isnt designed for a main bus style of transport, instead I usually go for a more distributed production scheme.
            It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
                Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
        It's also still in Alpha.
Except it's a bit more automated, machines mine, transport, and craft, and you just place the machines, you only do things manually for the first 10 minutes of the game
    Unless you're a goddamn barbarian hand crafting nukes like me
        You're not a barbarian. You're an artisan. And those nukes? Organic. Your hand crafted, artisan nuke should fetch a nice premium.
            Organic nukes only
Fun fact, it was actually inspired by an industrial Minecraft mod!  

But like others have said, it's a little less cryptic than Minecraft mods.
    That's actually awesome and makes me want to play it more lol
        Hell yeah, a big part of my childhood was the Industrialcraft/Buildcraft modpacks, I never got tired of them. Knowing that Factorio was inspired by them means I'm definitely buying it
It's also a shitton more optimized so your factories are **HUGE**.

It's normal to have 1000s of something (like trains, all with individual routes), but it's common to have 10,000s or 100,000s of something (like transport robots or assembling machines or mining drills or train signals or laser turrets) and it's not rare to have millions of things (like iron ore pallets or oil cosumed).

In fact, the largest bases have [billions of things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8DZo368Jw#t=2m20s) and millions per second - at 60fps.
    I don't know if I'd say having 1000s of trains is "common". That's way above the level required to "win". But I agree with your general point. Even on my modest computer I've never managed to build something big enough to cause performance problems.
But in 2D so you can actually see and make sense of what the fuck you are making. Oh, and you can basically play it on a potato on max settings because the devs are literally the best at what they do!
It was actually inspired by those mod packs. Funnily enough, there are now Minecraft mods inspired by factorio.
Its much more
Depends on your play style. Some people like to chase the bottleneck. Some people work out all the maths that is needed to keep everything running. If you're not having fun chasing bottlenecks, then you can search for a Factorio recipe calculator, then have fun trying to organise all those machines as neatly as possible. Efficiency doesn't really matter unless you're going for several thousand science packs per minute. Just play how you enjoy, and make sure you don't run out of power.
    My mistake is going to the subreddit a few times. Its like when you build that nice house on minecraft and then see a video of someone building a scale replica of the Notre-dame cathedral and your house feels inadequate.
        My inner perfectionist hates that game. I always want to make everything perfect, but also not spend the time to do math and excel sheets, because I should be able to do everything in my head, and then I start to rage because it never ever ever runs without me constantly fixing everything, but it should do, because the goal is full automation and not constant surveillance and adjustment and...

Then I just hate everything... T_T
            Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
    My favorite thing is making resources outputs. Being inefficient means I need more outposts so that's a win for me.
i thought it was doomguy for a second lmao
    Kill the natives xdddd
colonialism simulator
    colonialism is just the final form of capitalism tbh
The war crimes in Rimworld inched closer without really realising it. Mine started when I had a prisoner and suddenly needed an emergency organ transplant for an important colonist I would have had a hard time surviving without, so it just became  "which one of these two do I save?", which then morphed into "wait, how much do those organs sell for in the first place, and how many of them do I normally release?".
The -10 Buff to Morales. But you just start giving smokeleaf and you're good to go.
    Also, remove Morales's legs after distributing smokeleaf to your colonists.
    Ah, smokeleaf, the colony happiness saver.
Sometimes your dwarves don’t have fancy prosthetics and have to learn to become a +5 legendary crutch walker on top of his role as your best soap maker....... oh wait.
Can't quit playing until launching a rocket per minute
    One does not simply quit playing Factorio, period
So are you against having fully voiced characters in games?? I much prefer that to something like Zelda or a game where you don’t see *or* hear who you are playing as.
As much as I can somehow see why some one wouldn’t like Witcher 3, saying Skyrim, Da:I and horizon dawn are better games is just weird. While I liked Skyrim and horizon, the characters and stories are in both so boring. The only redeeming quality horizon has for me is the combat ( which is far from perfect) and the Dino robots. But that games story is just boring, the characters are god awful and forgettable and the world is so fucking empty.
No

I have the Witcher 1 downloaded but I haven't gotten around to it yet
    Honestly, if 3 didn't grab you don't force yourself to play 1. It's easily the least fun gameplay-wise. Check out the TV series. If it grabs you and you want to explore a bit more, maybe reconsider 3.
        I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
The acting (apart from Henry Cavill) and writing in that show are atrocious. I made it 2 episodes in before I had to give up.
Witcher 3 combat is booty butt cheeks. I love fantasy RPGs to death, I could not get into how the combat felt in the Witcher games. It's a fine game from what I've seen but it is not a satisfying game to play imo
    I liked combat for the first 20 hours or something like that. Then I got tired of combat about the same time I got bored with the new environment, Skellige and I fell off of it.
    I actually liked the combat

I thought the story was very average and it was too long. The side quests also werent as good as people say in my opinion.
Context, if it hits 2am and you’re not asleep you pass out and wake up way later, correct me if im wrong haven’t played in a while myself
    You pass out and wake up the next morning at home in bed. You also lose money and an item or two from your inventory.
        You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
            i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
                Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
whats cutscene with a box?
    [deleted]
I know, but I can't help but feel like I have to be on a timetable because of the energy and clock lol
Sounds perfect thank you!
Having one person join another's farm usually isn't a problem, as long as they aren't expecting to do full community center and all of that. The only problem is especially in early years if 4 people are planting crops and the host wants to play some, his or her entire day is watering all the crops for all 2-4 people...
    Also guests have to create a new character the first time they visit a given farm. You can't join using an existing character, unlike in Terraria where characters and worlds are stored separately.

So it's a bit less flexible, but it's still quite fun as a multiplayer game if you can work with that.
> Nobody who wants to play a trucking simulator will be unhappy with that game.

this is a good point
    oh you have the patience to even attempt this
I have no interest in trucking or trucks. But I love mindlessly driving on the highway for long stretches. And this game recreates that feeling. Helps me find my zen
Fair point, but mods fix that on a whole new level.
Pre boss*
    Pre everything*
it's fucking broken honestly. you literally need ONE SILVER and yeah infinite money

but I'm sure as hell not gonna be grinding enemies for 5 hours to get 1 (one) reforge on my celestial shell
*gets 100 copper coins*

*5 minutes later*

*Platinum coins*
Yeah. After 500+ hours, there are certain things you enjoy doing and certain things you don't.
It's a challenge, it still feels more like additional dps than a class to me
    yeah
    Once you have the raven (crow? I don’t remember right now) staff you’re golden. Especially if you’re not doing a pure summoner run and can get a terraprisma. That’s when summoner really shines. I tend to think that ranged and melee have the pre hardmode and early hardmode advantage, but mage and summoner get really strong in mid to late hardmode
you should be able do kill them. farm some potions to help you out! make an arena etc
    yeah but i’m pathetic and it’s expert mode
        For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
        On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
sadly no. Bet it would take another month or even more to update it.
the parent comment mentions that, but yes there is
There's another secret achievement at that part as well...
    Where you jump in the pit, right?
        Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
Portal 2 is much, much better than portal 1 so don't hesitate if you found portal 1 meh.
    I found portal 1 to be short, but portal 2 to be a great game
    Is it possible that I played portal 2 and forgot that I played it?

I know I definitely played portal 1, and I thought I played portal 2, but I don’t remember it being so much different than the first game... something tells me I have to play it again. I don’t remember anything that makes it clearly stand out in comparison to the first game

Edit: ok portal 2 was not in my steam library. I’m going to assume I played a demo or something in the past
Ahh, cheers :]
    Cheers to you too, fellow human :)

    Just make the most you can of everything. Nothing is wasted if the assembly line stops, and if you're running out of something make more.
I watched Joseph Anderson's video on Witcher 1 and it looked like I would enjoy it way more. I don't remember the details about the plot anymore so I didn't even get spoiled.
You only lose items if you were in the mines.

In the skull cavern or out on the farm you lose a percentage of your gold up to a Maximum of 1000.

Late game this means nothing and makes working til 2 am often the best thing to do.
    i often cant even use up all my energy in lategame...
        Yeah time is the limiting factor late game. Early game it’s energy and money.
For a summoner, killing a single mech boss opens up your options. But you're totally correct, options are very limited til then.

You running a sentry, along with summons? Big DPS boost, and limits don't count against each other.

Also, though the arena is a big help, another option is to make a runway. You can run away and dodge across the map while minions attack.

Lastly, if you want a quick assist with at least one of the mech bosses, let me know and I can hop on later tonight for ya. PM me if interested.
On Expert/Master defense is a lot better of a...defense. Consider wearing a mixed armor set, maybe fish for the palladium set bonus or wear some tavernkeep armor. Mixed sets can usually be better than the full set bonuses. Later on the Valhalla knight chest piece is amazing for pretty much every class in the game.
Yeah after Wheatley begs for it
Highjacking this to tell anyone who might be interested: the game never, ever goes on sale. According to the devs, it will always be $30.

And it's definitely worth the price. Updates are pretty frequent, and the game is extremely deep.
    I hardly ever pay full price for a PC game, since they almost always go on sale. However, I gave in and bought Factorio, since I realized it was never going to go on sale, and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth it, even at full price.
    however, with steam sale its currently technically on sale if its your first purchase over $30, because steam will shave off $5 free
    I played the demo for about 10 minutes and i knew i was in trouble. Ive probably played 500 hours in two months. Hard to say though. My grasp on the passing of time is shaky at best
    Huh I didn't know that it never goes on sale. I remember buying it for a friend for Christmas, and I remember waiting till the Christmas sales started and then just bought it full price anyway since it wasn't on sale that year
Sounds like fun, but I'm already addicted to legal heroin (WoW) haha. All jokes aside I'll probably check it out.
    right but if you play factorio then you can talk about your addiction with pride instead of shame
    the only two games i play these days are factorio and runescape, so i feel you haha. got about 1500hrs in osrs but factorio is slowly catching up...
Cracktorio
Eh, have delivery robots do all of your logistics and it slows down pretty quick, on my gaming laptop at least
The mod devs are amazing, if a new update comes out the mod devs will have updated to fit it really quickly.
It's just that I like everything neat and organized and got really frustrated when I had to do isolated cells. But after I managed to get used to it it's been a breeze.
    Satisfactory let's you do z-levels so that can really cut down on space.
Organic nukes only
