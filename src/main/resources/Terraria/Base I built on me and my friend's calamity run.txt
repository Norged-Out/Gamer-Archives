[[Base I built on me and my friend's calamity run]]





You and your friend wouldn’t happen to be termites by chance?

Cool build.
    The Destroyer would be the ant eater sticking its tongue in and eating the inhabitants
        Sluuurp.
    Even termites are more organized than this
        More than you too ?
It’s like someone took a bunch of houses and threw them together
    Forget sharknados we terrarians have *housenadoes*
        What in the mortal engines am i looking at!!
            I only read the first prequel.
        those are usually just regular tornados
            made me laugh, thankyou stranger
        Yeah but we also have sharknados
            The good/bad kind, not the one that has 32 unnecessary sequels.
        Terrarists*
        Unlike Minecraftians😏
            Someone clearly hasn't watched Hermitcraft Season 7
                Someone clearly knows that I'm more of a Minecraftian myself than a terrarian
    "Sir, the guide won't fit!"

"Put him in sideways!"

"This chest won't fit!"

"Drill out a hole and have it stick out the back!"

"The house no good!"

"GET 5 STARTER HOUSES AND STICK THEM TOGETHER!"
        peak Brittish engineering
        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY SO FUNNY
    Just squished together like clay
    A calamitous house, perhaps
    It looks like Howl's moving Castle.
I dont really know what im looking at but its cool
    Me either and same
    It’s a xbox remote
        From what angle? I'm really tryin here man.
            I believe he's referencing a YouTube video of a kid opening a bong he ordered in front of his mom and he tries to explain to her that he doesn't know what it is and he actually ordered an Xbox remotes. 

This base looks like a bong and I think he's making a joke.
                How tf do you just reference something so obscure like that xD.
Oddly specific moment:
                    It's for sure an all time great as far as YouTube videos go. Definitely not something I'm filtering out of my disease riddled brain.
            Sideways with it tipped up so the main controls are faceing the right side of the frame.
        i immediately thought of that video
    Looks like the game Forts
    I believe it’s Homer Simpson centaured with a turtle spilling his purple beer
        Truly a masterpiece
    Homer Simpson balancing his Lean on his moobs.
    Starforge PC logo (Read: >!A dick!<)
    Looks like a trojan horse
    To me it looks like a bong
looks like a fireboy and watergirl level
    How is your comment so accurate? lol
    That game was great stuff
    This is god damn true
    Wow I see it
    I can and will unsee that
I can feel the tension on that chain.

Cool build.
The hello neighbor house
    Right! Add some rails and it’s perfect
        add a room full of water with a shark in it too!
Looks vaguely like dickbutt
    Or dick
        Ah, yes... The cock cottage... A classic.
gave me the vibes of Howl's Moving Castle
    First thing I thought of too. Just needs more furnishings and mechanical parts
Bro you got that Dr. Seuss looking build and honestly it looks cool as hell
lean
    Came here to say this
Am i high or is this building trippy?
Anyways it looks awesome
    You are. It’s actually tippy
        Maybe a bit slippy
    Looks like a bong to me. Also somehow looks small af despite actually being huge. 

Its very uncanny valley.
        Definitely looks like a bong - my thoughts exactly. A dodgy AF homemade bong though with A* for effort 😂
This is abomination
    As a human abomination myself I can confirm that, yes, this looks like at least 50% of my ancestral lineage ✊
Mf got cup of lean as a part of building 💀
    Moon lord sized.
The structure
For some reason I see an abstract art version of drunk Homer Simpson with a card lodged into his head.
    Is that not what this is?  Also Homer is a centaur.
If you fell in that hole... at least you have a chair so you can die sitting..
shelly es i love what is esentially standard wooden box housing that expands like a cancerous growth into something stupid; its like my favourite genre of terraria build
Is that a cup of lea-
    LEAAAN I LOVE LEEAN!!!!
What in the mortal engines am I looking at
I feel like this can be r/mildlypenis
Dear God, I saw boxes, but this, this isn't boxes, this is shapes! My eyes are opened and now I am horrified
This is fuckin really cool actually
Looks awesome, but the geometry of it is gonna make me throw up
anti OCD build  


why..
It's horrible I love it
If I logged on to a Terraria server and saw this I would log out, uninstall, and never play again.

Not a stab at you, just saying I'm a much neater, OCD-style person when it comes to these kinds of games, and this gives me the heebie jeebies.
    Just cos it's made from wood doesn't mean it's incapable of feelings 😢
        This is a house the Angler would build.
That base looks like something an AI art generator would spit out
Ugliest bong I’ve seen, I like it
Damn, you live like this?
calamity indeed, christ.
I love how disheveled it looks!
why does this look like bart Simpson with a giraffe neck
Thats a unique ass build and I love it
Get out of my head, Get out of my head, Get out of my head, Get out of my head, Get out of my head, Get out of my head.
Looks like a penis.
Bender?
    It would definitely take me some kind of stimulant-fuelled bender to create a concept like this
If you wanted to build really deformed human with a cup of lean, you achieved perfection
good lord
What the hell is this
The more i stare. The more questions i have.
Vegapunk what are you doing here bro
That your missing one torch in the top right little room doesn’t bother me at all.  

*not at all.*
it looks like shit and like one of the coolest bases I've seen at the same time
Need to replace the walls with glass, flood the bottom bubble halfway with water, switch the water coming out to lava and have a party
are you a freaking termite?
This is just a fancy bong
Why did you build in italics?
Looks like a cross section howls moving castle
bro picked one wood type and stuck with it
r/TIHI

(I still upvoted it lol)
First thought that came to my mind was asking if you made dickbutt in terraria
yall living in a bong
black magic fuckery xd
    

A Calamity Run
Though its base I thought was won
The black magic fuckery
Had other things in store

I thought I'd have some fun
My friend and I, together one
But chaos was the plan
Our fate was to be undone

We thought we'd made a stand
But with a wave of their hand
Our base was gone in a flash
A powerful spell, so grand

We'd have to start anew
Our original plan, askew
But at least, in the end
We knew one thing was true:

That with each other, we can
Conquer any calamity run.
Looks like a bong lmao
r/oddlysatisfying
From the creators of La Creatura, we introduce:, La Estructora

Now really, it does look cool as all fuck
This is so wierd. And… oddly phallic.
Bepis
Box house LVL 10000
Is it a giant thumb?
groovy
Salvador Dalí house
This makes my brain itchy
It's beautiful
Does this have any relation to the movie howl’s moving castle??? Idk why but my kind just went howls moving castle when i looked at this
The chaos makes it look better
The ULTIMATE GRASS BIOME WOOD BOX
Run checks out
Looks like one of those water puzzles of which cup will fill first, in this case room.
Nepe
how XD
Is the shape supposed to be something specific?
Please become an architect
This looks like something out of Forts
You've managed to create an indescribable combination of terrifically ugly and fascinatingly impressive, well done
Inspired by PotC I assume? This sort of "jumbled mess"-type structure looks very familiar. I know Pirate101 has a very similar style of structure. Looks cool!
were you playing Terraria or were you playing Forts?
Watch out, its a monster!
haha the cup of lean sells it
Is that a cock?
It looks kinda like ant nest
Sippin on some sizzurp
Looks like my forts in forts
It kinda looks like a dinosaur, but weiird
Hello neighbor houses be like:
weinor
👍
Some people just wanna watch the world burn -Batmans fren
You're either dumb as hell or way too smart
Looks like those kinematic roll the ball somewhere games i used to have as a kid
Its... unique
What is the fever dream is this? Cool build fam.
Is this a reference from a tower defence game? Like Forts?
r/oddlysatisfying
👍
Extremely chaotic, I like it!
At first, i thought this was a gigantic dick, then after closer inspections, ... it still looks like a D
It looks like an ant nest… I love it!
It's so disgusting... And yet fascinating
I thought it was trash at first but it’s actually really fucking good
Ngl my dude that looks like a huge dong
What the fuck
Reminds me of my first terraria base: A skyscrapper with random rooms made of random blocks i got
    >skyscrapper  

Now I'm picturing a drunken 1v1 fisticuffs barscrap between Godzilla and the dickhead from Super Mario who floats around in his shit-cloud throwing junk at the player.
bro got that Dr. Doofenshmirtz evil and c.o house.
Idk why, but i find this beatiful
this makes me feel unyielding violence

good job
I'm not sure whether to be impressed or terrified.
The termite urge to build a mound
Nice, now change up the materials and you got a work of art.
spilt the lean
Harmony in Chaos.
Better than most houses since it's not rectangular.
This looks like an ant colony but for humans.
This looks like an angry birds level
An anthill
Howls moving castle?
It looks like a chicken
So cool
I'm getting some howl's moving castle vibes from this
Is this what happens after Destroying D December?
Best box house
It looks a bit like duck
What uh... What the fuck is it


Cool is what it is
No, I hate it. 
Its hurting me
Ever Heard of Forts? I think you're a natural
I see a Trojan llama with a bucket of water
Looks like a long neck r*tared person that have been hit by a brick.
unironically the coolest base i have seen on this sub
LEAN BUCKETTTT
(\_)\_):::::::::::::::::::::::D
Looks like a weird bong... Nice!
This looks like a house id see in my dreams
Weasley’s house
Looks like cock and balls
Looks like Venice from above
U sure you didn't play Forts?
A piece of my soul died looking at this

It looks so

Unsound
This is my sorting system as a house
it looks like an ant hill but BIGGER
That’s epic!
This is awesome!!!
This looks like a huuuge build crushed like snow to snowball. Don't mean it looks bad it just looks like an unsmooth wooden snowball turned into a build
It's a monsta. A big, drunk monsta.

Truffle looks super happy up there
Imagine this with nice decoration inside
hazbin hotel be like
Look like some normal build in forts
The lean cup 😭
Wow, this remind me so much of a Worms Armagedon map! I love it!
    Could hear the background music to Worms Armageddon the second I saw the pic.
Kind of like Howl's Moving Castle.
Are you an ant?
This is… I actually love this

I want to copy your homework
Terraria.br
Dude drew a dick with eyes closed and decided:

Yep, I'll live in it
youre actually sick in the head this is the best base ive seen ever
Looks like an upside down KidsNextDoors treehouse
Looks amazing, hope you made a special house for the Brimstone Witch
This is a Kids Next Door treehouse
I can see the spot where ares fired his laser


...and all the spots where ares fired his nuke
How long did this take to build?
It kinda looks like

A penis with that condition where urethra stops growing
Is that the inside of an ork gargant?

*distressed mechanicus noises*
The ultimate “I don’t know how to build but I don’t want a box!” House
sorta looks like 👍 with a disproportionately large thumb
/r/atbge
So many things happened in this photo
Bro made an ant farm
Well that's a home that exists
Almost looks like a trojan horse.
I do this from time to time, it’s pretty fun!
How long did that take?
My friend would kill me if I did this, it is definitely something I would do
Oh wow it makes me anxious in a good way
Are you ok?
I feel like this is the Burrow from Harry Potter.
Bong house
Penis house penis house penis house
What is the purple eye creature under the central throne room?
I think without rod of discord it will be difficult to move around the base
World Type: House
I hate this in the best way possible
Terraria Tower
BTD called!
They want their Bloonchipper back 🤣
Bros house looks like what a love craft creature is described like.
This makes me so uncomfortable and I don't know why, but I'm also blown away
I guess you could say this houses design is quite a 

Calamity
****Slaps roof**** this bad boy can fit so much room in it!
It looks like homer simpson
is gun?
Lean💜💜💜
This is a great starting point for a super cool build later on. As you play and get access to new decorative blocks, go through and block replace here and there to add some detail to it!
This looks like someone went on a rampage of monster energy drink and created this
Thanks, I hate it. (also really cool build)
Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!
Huh i didn't know ants could play terraria
i saw the tip, and i immediately thought "is that a dick"
It’s a bong
Looks like Van Naboris from Breath of the Wild
Makes me think of Cosmo Canyon
Those top right houses remind me of the “why isn’t my housing viable” memes
Are you and your friends terminates
I really like this, I can’t tell if I’m supposed to see something as a bigger picture though? I just see phalic and spilled drinks
Its cool and all but it's so empty.
I'm glad I'm not the only one confused about what I'm looking at I thought this was some weird reference
Where’s the chest room🤨
It looks like the game "Forts"
This is some real Dr. Seuss behavior right here
I like how the mushroom guy is just in his own little zone
It's definitely something
Man lives in an ant colony. But how exactly do you navigate this base?
Kinda reminds me of howls castle
You're missing a torch
Bro I can bearly build like a simple house wtf am I looking at? A sky scraper vaguely shaped like a penis?
Every part of my body hates the idea of building this because 0 symmetry...
But damn I love the design.
This looks like the house from What Remains Of Edith Finch

(which is a 3 hour mostly story-based game which I really liked but I doubt it has a ton of crossover with general Terraria players)
For those who don't know, this is based off of the game Forts I believe
Where did you get the corgi please tell me the fate of the republic lies in the balance.
this is making my head hurt, i like it
Bong perhaps if you are high enough
Ant nest
Vaguely reminds me of [Bunchies](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bunchie) for some reason. If that Bunchie was spilling a cup of lean.
Idk, it looks like a bong to me
I can’t stop looking, lol, it’s so cool! I think it just need more furnishings. Like random chaos, boxes and chairs stacked like they slid to one side!
It's very cool, we should do a, tell and shows structures in Terraria worlds
Love the little shroom planet!
u/GeorgeFlungusJr builds worst house ever, asked to leave terraria
Am I the only one that sees a bison with a nee high boot on its back
Hmmm.... this looks familiar...
You get around using a RoD
Literally an ant hill
Thumbs up? No. Peni-, no. bong? Maybe?
    Hotel ?
Feels like a Worms level.
It looks like that time Springfield rebuilt Flanders' house. I love it!
HAHA looks like a dick
r/mildlypenis
It looks like living there was a. Afterthought
Can I make a request. I'm very curious as to what your pathing is through this build. It looks amazing it just confuses my brain a little. Think you could like, map out some of the ways you move through your base?
PENIS
You havea drinking problem, get help
change the blocks andc it will be a masterpiece
Do you play Forts by chance? bc that kinda looks like alate game forts base
Tricky towers gameplay
Is that howls moving castle or am I tweaking
George’s Moving Castle
Now we know what’s inside those huge anthills lol
r/bossfight
What the fuck even is this
Jesus this house is a calamity by itself
That a lean cup?
Stuff like this is why I always ask for my friends to send me the world file. It's so much fun to expand or just HAVE that house you built.
Cock n' balls
This is the Terraria housing equivalent of modern art.
Bong?
Well at least it’s not made of dirt.
Dr. Seuss??
This is peak terraria building at its finest
Ignore my three story house
Trust me, I am an architect
Mohawk duck?
Lean
It's like there were a bunch of houses arranged in a strange way, then the game blocks suddenly had jelly like physics, the entire building almost fell down and just before that everything frozen up and now is... that hella of a mess  


Pretty creative and law-breaking either way, never thought on such way to build!
I want to play with you but also I really don't want to play with you /s
why does this look like the weasley household from Harry Potter tho?
Worms map lookin ass house
As an engineer, this is deeply disturbing and upsetting.
I think I'm having a stroke from trying to understand what's happening in this picture
No idea what im looking at, looks cool though.
Very abstract. Cool!
It's really cool, but it looks like hell to traverse.
This is art, actually. 

Also, love the platform clips being baked into the design, just adds to how gloriously unhinged this is.
Seens like Calamitas melted your city together
It's nice, but the angles are triggering me and it's all one color with no furniture
Looks like Marzipan from homestarrunner
Navigating this house must be a pain in the ass.
Am I the only one that sees a bong..?
Homer simpson with a bucket of shimmer
Yeah
👍
It’s a high heel with a foot going into it
looks like a dinosaur spilling its lean, and i love ot
Howel, is that you?
Wood appearance aside, that is a dope design. I love how wobbly it is.
What in the hello neighbour fuck is this?!



I like it

This makes me violently angry to look at.

Amazing, the Trojan....what-the-fuck-is-that?
Penis
Collossal titan hardened into terraria housing
i actually find this really pleasing to look at. i wanna say it feels *organic* or natural but i'm not sure that's the best way to describe it
Looks like something out of the original Lorax film.  I can’t be the only one right?
Idk if im wrong but is that a dinosaur lmao
Love the lean cup lol
the doohickey
This 100% looks like a base in Forts
The Burrow
this looks like an ant nest in a terrarium, super cool
Reminds me of howls moving castle
heheheheh peepee
Lol i thought it was a map. Noice
Bro took the wooden box to a whole new level.
This looks cool it reminds me of Howl’s moving castle
Did Pablo Picasso assist you?
dreag heap ds3
Is this the new gta 6 map?
I like the mix of very intentional aspects like the bucket, ball and chain, trophy room, tilted rectangular rooms, etc with the chaos of the small amorphous rooms
*Howl’s Moving Housing*
Cool as fuck
looks like a weiner
I hate it. Well made.
That is one fucked up bong
What in the ever loving architecture is making this a balanced house? Poly bridge physics?

Excellent house tho.
Termite
I’m so confused
I bet those pesky architects created this (btw this is a real civil engineer joke)
somewhat of a bong
This isn’t a base, it’s a man made biome.
that’s…. strange but cool
Chaotic good
For why
I don’t Like it but cool, the top with the trophies make brain hurt
What the fuck man (complimentary)
Bong base
This looks like Ron Weasley’s house ngl 🤣
Looks like a game of Worms
Um... Are you okay?
Needs some different blocks but i see that youre already working on that,good job!
The mass
I love the chaos of this build
You should die 



(A joke)
Looks like a weird bong lol
Now what in the structural instability
what the..
*screams in horror*
Sir?
*vomits*
Looks cool but also like someone asked the mad hatter to design a skyscraper
This looks AI generated

This bothers me so much.

Well done.

How many valid housing spaces?
wocky slush base
Someone over here playing Tricky Towers
Homa sumpson
I’m high as shit and this is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
This hurts my brain anywhere and everywhere.
First thing that cones to mind is “Honey wheres my super suit.”
i literally screamed when i saw this
It looks vaguely like a thumbs up. With some... minor modifications of course.
This is an excellent twist on the wooden box fortress
just why!
Bong or penis?
Remings me of the tower you build in the game World of Goo
The truffles house is the only thing stopping the house from collapsing
Are you by chance a Weasley??
Wowl's moving castle? nah that's woof's sliding bastion
That looks like a bong kinda....
Looks kind of like wood
Reminds me of Loco Roco 3 and that house with blue guys)

bruh they wasting the lean wtf :(
Is it a bong or a oddly shaped pp cool house tho
What drugs are you guys on? Gimme some!
Wock
Mf is playing forts
“It a Picasso”-the person who built this probably
This is giving me anxiety…
Trojan horse
As you can see the tower that is erected ver-
I can’t describe how much I hate this
This construction makes my sleep schedule look organized
epic
average base in forts
what is it supposed to be. it feels wierd to look at and i cant figure out whats going on
r/mildlypenis
my house in calamity is a train wreck compared to this...
This looks like you took a bunch of randomly sized rooms, threw it into a softbody sim and built it
Love it, especially the lean
Looks fun as fuck
Maybe its just bcs i spent 5 hours on BOTW today but all i see is “Divine Beast Tehr Aria”
It looks to be halfway there to being Howl's moving castle.
Love how the trophy room is slanted like it's boutta fall over
Looks like Patrick’s bruised thumb
The Destroyer would be the ant eater sticking its tongue in and eating the inhabitants
    Sluuurp.
Even termites are more organized than this
    More than you too ?
Forget sharknados we terrarians have *housenadoes*
    What in the mortal engines am i looking at!!
        I only read the first prequel.

            How tf do you just reference something so obscure like that xD.
Oddly specific moment:
                It's for sure an all time great as far as YouTube videos go. Definitely not something I'm filtering out of my disease riddled brain.
        Sideways with it tipped up so the main controls are faceing the right side of the frame.
