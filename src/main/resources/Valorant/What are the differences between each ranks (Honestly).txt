[[What are the differences between each ranks (Honestly)]]


I’ve been playing Valorant for a while now. I was wondering if I could gain some insight about the differences between each ranks? For example, between bronze and silver, between gold and plat, and between radiant and immortal. 

I understand sometimes it’s tempting for high-Elo players to say “players below (insert rank) is simply too bad at the game.” Or something like “every rank below (insert rank) is virtually the same”

But I genuinely want to know what separate players in a rank from a rank one tier higher. I’ve seen silver players with crazy plays and crosshair placements and diamond players who bottom frag bronze lobbies.

Also I’m hardstuck so :(


Peak radiant, current immortal. 
  
Iron-Plat - Bad aim, tendency to have bad util usage. Just learning the game at this point. Grinding the game is an inevitable way to get better. Team play almost never happens. Games are faster paced
  
Diamond - Aim starts to get better, util usage slightly better. Everyone is either ego peeking or not peeking at all and baiting their whole team. Team play almost never happens, but you start seeing it more because game starts to slow it’s pace because everyone learns to just default.   
  
Ascendant - I hate this rank the most. Slightly better but just the same as diamond, but everyone has a higher ego.  
  
Low immortal - I personally believe everyone’s aim plateus here, this is as good as you’re gonna get. Literally cannot improve beyond it, the gaps in aim will come down to innate talent, but this is where raw aim starts to matter less because utility usage is generally better. Still has ego problems, teamplay starts to become more common. Gaps in skill will come from game sense and util usage 
  
Immortal 2-Radiant - I haven’t been radiant in over a year so this one will be a little outdated but I genuinely feel the only thing that will separate Immortal 2+ and Radiant is how much they grind the game. Aim matters less, focus on util usage, everyone here tends to play smarter and use util and team play to win more rounds. Ego peeking is punished more often here so it happens less, people still have egos but you are used to it at this point.
    I totally forgot about game pace. This 10000%. Everytime you’re sitting there waiting out util or trying to obtain information on the defense and your ADHD teammates flipping their shit.
    The average aim and mechanics in a radiant lobby are much higher than low immortal as it becomes a necessity rather than a bonus, unless you're some kind of judge only god.
        Less about aim but more about positioning and crosshair placement imo
    immo 3 playing in radiant lobbies right now, mostly agree except there’s a huge skill gap between high ascendant-low immortal to high immortal, the biggest thing is consistency. hard to answer what is better because literally everything gets better, aim, game sense, util usage, people just know the “basic” util becuase only no life’s get to high elo. when i play with ascendant friends on high ascendant account i can easily drop 30 kills every game with very mediocre aim for my elo, just through trading properly, knowing the right timings to fight, knowing good off angles etc.
    Can I try to elaborate on the low ranks, as a bonafide low-tier player who loves watching pro content: 

Iron - the trash heap. Zero map sense. Has mechanics that would make anyone above silver cringe (yeah it's that bad). Games are either the funnest shit you can have or a giant waste of time (mostly the latter). You can find players here that knew how to aim at heads (but not anywhere else) and can't use even Reyna util.

Bronze - the kneejerk rank. Slight sign of contact elsewhere? Rotate/flank towards that direction. Mechanics are a bit drilled but they still among the worst. They either immediately swing an angle or sit in a rat spot with a shotty. Util is basically a passive because their main response is to look for fights. 

Silver - they have decent mechanics or have watched some guides on Youtube. They maintain crosshair placement until they have to swing an angle (or even engage on any aim duel), by which they default to crouch aiming afterwards. If they learned some agent tech (e.g. Grim walls), expect them to do it everytime they have the chance). They can put up numbers on low tier lobbies but can't comprehend how people Gold and above beat their ass backwards everytime. Util usage is still ass tho. 

Gold - everything people below Silver are doing are vastly improved on Gold. The catch is their playbook consists of things that work against trash players, not anyone mid-Platinum. That's as if they have a playbook or anything. They will do the standard shit, but anyone who knew advanced tech are very limited in other aspects. Map positioning works on wherever the top fragger on the team is. Most importantly, games can turn into a huge clusterfuck because Gold players only need one bad round to tilt to 180 degrees. 

Platinum - everything people from Gold do, Platinum people do slightly better. Holding angles, holding sites, peeking angles. Name it. The thing is, these players are probably casual players that have better game sense and mechanics, but not the time to actually grind. These players have better confidence, but not the consistency. A lot of low-tier players basically stop trying to rank up as soon as they reached platinum (or even Gold 3).
Iron - learning game. No util usage that’s effective. Aim is awful unless they’ve had prior experience with FPS. 

Bronze - better but still need to learn game mechanics. 

Silver - most have mechanically great aim but game sense, util, and team play is rough at best. Ego challenge everyone

Gold - better ego challenge everyone including the cracked out jett Smurf. 

Plat/Diamond - this is where I, opinion obviously, believe the inverse happens. Most folks start to plateau on their aim and their gameplay and team play gets much better.

Low Asc - cracked aim. Util usage is nice. Better team play and playing off your team. Less overheating for no reason. 

High Asc - I feel this is where the game got much harder for me. Exploiting the flaws of your team. 

Imm/Radiant. No clue not there. They’d probably shit on me with playing on inverted southpaw controls.

I’m Asc 2 peak last episode/act.
    I mostly agree and I played in every rank up until ASC 1. The only thing I disagree with is aim, I don't have mechanically good aim and the amount of people with good aim below plat is very low imo.
    Ascendant is elo hell because it's 50% players with good aim who don't care and 50% players who care but have bad aim, and all of them have a massive ego. Low immortal is not noticeably different at all mechanically but takes a much better mentality and some comming to get to. The hours to go from high immortal to radiant go up fast so naturally almost everyone has consistently strong mechanics up there.
Riot REALLLLLLY needs to add a “garbage” or “plastic” rank below iron. Ive seen some players… im worried…
different dick sizes

iron have biggest dick, radiants are smallest
Iron & Bronze are pretty much the same. It's players learning FPS-es in general and basically not focusing on any sort of area of improvement.

Silver is where people start to realize where they have to aim.

Gold is where people can aim properly.

Platinum is where people generally put less focus on their aim and start focusing on other aspects of the game - namely util usage and peeking

Diamond is sort of a transitional state where every simple thing you've learned (like aim, movement, util usage etc.) is about as good as it should be.

Ascendant is where people have to start thinking about the game in a macro sense. Proper rotations, faking, gameplans etcetera.

Immortal is where people know about the game in a macro sense well.

Radiant is where people have a solid grasp on every single mechanic in the game.
I think of the ranking system as three major tiers.

Garbage players (no offense): iron-gold

Decent players: plat-ascendant

Elite players: immo-radiant
For low elo (typically iron - gold), most players don't have the knowledge of certain mechanics. Most iron players do not know the concept of good crosshair placement, movement, and bursting. As you go up the ranks (platinum+), it becomes the battle of who does it more consistently and more refined.
I think if you're hardstuck, these types of questioning should not be the ones you should be asking. But if you insist, here are some tips: (Peak A3, currently Diamond).

1. **Gold and Below:** Should focus on aiming techniques and positioning. It sounds quite simple, but these two components should get you higher. Team comp has almost no effect. Big thing too in this elo is economy. Most people don't understand it, and if you can have your team buying and saving together, it will usually make a huge difference.

2. **Plat - Diamond:** Aim is usually better, as well as positioning. That's usually the elo where to progress you have to play a viable team comp, as well as using your util properly and playing slower. It's less about gunfight (although still important), but more about how you use your brain to make plays and win rounds.

3. **Ascendant and higher:** Since I have no experience with Immortal and higher, some things in here are mostly hypothetical from watching streams or playing at A3 level where some Immortals are in the lobbies. Pretty much, everything should be about mastered, either your character, your aim, positioning, economy, everything. At this point, it's almost a battle of who can aim the best, who can think of the best plays on the spot. Really it comes down to how good of a well rounded player you are, compared to your team and the enemy.

Hope this helps and hope you keep progressing.
I think iron is bad, bronze to gold roughly the same, plat diamond roughly the same, ascendant is the least fun rank in the game, and immortal is like 2 different worlds between immortal 1-2 peak players and people who are up at like 400 RR from what I've seen in scrims I've filled in for friends in
just a sidenote, around 75% of the ranked playerbase is Iron - Gold at this time

so if you've hit plat or higher you're relatively pretty good in the grand scheme even if some people are preposterously better
