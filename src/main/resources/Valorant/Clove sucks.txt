[[Clove sucks]]


Clove has the least amount of good utils for this game. She has 2 smokes which is alright and can regen plus she can deploy smokes after death which is good. But when you talk about the other 2, I absolutely despise them. Her nade acts like a temporary molly unless you push the spot. Which sucks since you cant use it to deny defuse, plants and clear angles. And it only last for 5 seconds. Her pick me up, more like walmart reyna consume, is irregular for a controller because you would expect a controller to not play selfishly but this ability encourages controllers to duel. Most of the time i wouldn’t even bother using these 2. Her ultimate, will force you to go back to friendly lines, then immediately push aggressively to get kills. 

Comparing to other dome smokers like omen and brim, clove is no match


While i agree Omen is better than clove, clove doesnt suck duelists who pick clove are the ones who suck. They only use smokes for themselves thinking its a jett cloudburst that lasts longer.

Btw clove’s pick me up makes you go so fast that itll throw off people holding an angle so i like that. Also her nade is a good util for holding or spamming that brim smoke that you know he is hiding on with a shorty.
    Brim is better tho
        Brim and Omen are definitely better agents, but I think Clove just works better for certain players. I’m more of a momentum player, so playing Clove feels much better than Brim and I have more impact with them
        I hate how heavy he sounds when he runs, i can hear a brim rotating from miles away.
Been one tricking since release. The overheal is so ridiculously strong on pistol rounds and overall just really strong. I use it for fast rotates, to heal off a pick after ulting, to rechallenge when the situation calls for it. It’s just strong. 

Smokes are meh. I’ve had no trouble as solo controller though. Would love a tad more range since they don’t last near as long as brim’s. 

Decay is great. Helps secure frags post ult, amazing for stalling pushes with a throw and spam through smoke, deters people from going for trades while I back up. 

Post death smokes are great. I can entry when I have ult and the kit lets me be aggressive in general. 

My KD isn’t great, a mere .96, but I’m also first out on retake, leading the squad when we rotate, generally just baiting myself because I can do my most important job from the grave. If I get frags, great. If not, I get traded. .96 KD but a 58% winrate when every other agent I’ve mained is 48-50%. 

So, no. Clove doesn’t suck. Incredibly balanced and, by that token, possibly the strongest agent in terms of potential impact.
Clove is great. Her smokes may not be as versatile as the ones from other agents (like Brimstone's) but her kit is still strong. Maybe your mind is just too fixated on one play style / tactic.
    Im a team player, so i want to have abilities that supportes the team. Unfortunately, clove is immortal so she only cares about herself
        The orb can be paired with damaging abilities from your team. If you're playing aggressively, you can go in with your teammates since she can still smoke when she's dead and her C ability helps with an aggressive play style. Her ult can stall the round or the defuse or even distract enemies for your team. She's a smoker, of course you use them for the team.
        If you want to play a really supportive role, go play initiator. The community is stuck in the ways of “controller is a support role” when it’s not. There are some support controllers in the role but not all should be played that way. Clove, Brim, Omen, and Harbor can all just throw their util and then go take fights. Go watch m80 Zander play Brim on bind and tell me is playing a support role.
Maybe you're just bad with Clove.
Clove is absolutely goated, the overheal in pistol is insane, you can pair the Q with your teammates util easily or hold off people from entering a site with it, the smokes after dying are op and the ult is crazy to entry site or make space
    For a duelist yes, for a controller main no. Clove have 3 utility while others have like 5 or 4 support utility. Clove is good when you play like a duelist, but she should be combined with another controller like viper or omen as well
        role doesn't matter as agent kit  
have more or less is not important than what they do

you can said brim have longer smoke and thick, it's harder for enemy to push into it  
but it also work same for your team, it's harder for you to push back to take space  
it denied your info longer if enemy rotate  
clove smoke is perfect for clove  
can drop fastest and it's great for oneway and pressure  
clove revive is more versatile than sage or phoenix ulti and can easier get value from it  
phoenix ulti good for entry and anchor but only if he can keep his spot safe as drawback  
sage res can res anyone but drawback is it need to cast and sometimes you can't use  
clove is more versatile can just click after death, drawback is just need to kill to stay alive  
but it's best to buy time for a team compare to other revive

you guys to fixated on buzzword like role, support and shit

after death smoke is good, other smoker can't smoke after dead  
sometimes it forced to play safer or risk of losing smoke for team for a round  
even if it's good risk reward, clove can go with team, die with team and still have smoke for team

it's a team game and everyone can support each other in different way  
it isn't support-carry like moba shit

initiator initiate first then duelist go in to make space for team
There is a big misconception in the community about the controller role. Everyone is stuck in the ways of “controller is a support role” when it’s not. There are some support controllers in the role like Viper and Astra but not all should be played that way. Clove, Brim, Omen, and Harbor can all just throw their util and then go take fights. Go watch m80 Zander play Brim on bind and tell me is playing a support role. The true support role is initiator, but the community also has a misconception about that.
I understand what you mean, there is no clear reason to choose Clove over the others, but it is more of a game proposal, it goes beyond skills, but some skills need a buff to compete more with others, these could be the solutions, not all necessarily.



Clove's Smokes recharge in 25 seconds, as it is limited in range.



Smokar killed in a larger area.



Decay be played longer



But she's a good character, not Iso again
in ranked clove is the best smoke. in coordinated play, not even close.
Shes the worst smokes for coordinated play but of the 3 ranked only characters shes the best because of how good smokes are. Her orb is meant to be used like a fade seize where you combo it with other util or have your team push with it to collapse on a power position. Her heal is decent but it lets her be more aggressive and take multiple fights because people suck at trading in ranked unfortunately.
Brim is better tho
    Brim and Omen are definitely better agents, but I think Clove just works better for certain players. I’m more of a momentum player, so playing Clove feels much better than Brim and I have more impact with them
