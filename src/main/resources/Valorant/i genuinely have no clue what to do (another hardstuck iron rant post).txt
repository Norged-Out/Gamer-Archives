[[i genuinely have no clue what to do (another hardstuck iron rant post)]]


i am hardstuck iron and genuinely believe that i deserve bronze-silver

&#x200B;

in the 15 matches i've played of comp so far i've:

deranked twice (from bronze 1 placement to iron 2)

had 4 throwers

had 7 leavers/afkers (including more than one half of a match)

had 4 leavers/afkers for more than one half of a match

top fragged out of my team for 13 matches

top fragged out of the match for 8 matches

had 3 people who got 0 kills

had 1 person who got 0 kills and 0 assists

and had 6 reyna instalockers (they got an average of 12 kills)

&#x200B;

what the hell do i do? i don't have any friends who are interested in the game and anytime i soloq i get put with people who don't even know the controls

i'm basically quitting valorant cuz this sucks right now, either leave other game suggestions in the comments or tips to get better, if they even exist


make a new account and see where you're placed. if you're back in iron you deserve iron
    "you deserve what rank you get" people when they realize there's four other people on my team:
        if you cant carry yourself out of a rank, you deserve that rank
            yeah honestly I should be able to do a 1v5 every round for 13 rounds you so right
                Alr, when I was bronze - silver just like what you think you deserve, I went 44 and 12 in a iron lobby. (I wasn't smurfing, just queued with my iron friend)
                    there's an average of around 19-20 rounds in a match. assuming you're killing everyone on the enemy team, that means you'd need 95-100 kills to 1v5 every round, give or take a couple. soooo where's the other 50?
                        I doubt you are 1v5ing every game lol
                        not to mention I'm getting placed with high bronze.anyways. there was a silver a couple of matches ago I got more kills than
                            Send the tracker for proof bc rn I have a lot of doubt
                                Lmao same im not that sceptical mostly but i get the frustration but OP sounds exaggerating drop the career page or the tracker
                If you think you deserve silver then yes, frakfurt silver could wipe a full iron team
                They dont mean HARD carry, they just mean, if you can't be the difference maker between a won round and a lost round, you're not going to rank up.
        And? Going by that logic there are also 5 shitters on the enemy team vs 4 on yours. If you think you are better than the whole lobby you should win.
        There should be (without counting smurfs) 5 of those same-skilled people on the enemy team. 

If youre silver, you should be looking like youre smurfing in iron, and should be at an advantage.
        Only common denominator is you big dog. Take accountability and try to improve your own game
What about the enemy team? Are they all tryharding? They should have even more throwers/ afk etc.
    I mean sorta? I've seen some but it's hard to tell when I don't have their comms and their experiences. leavers it's sorta equal afkers nit really
        There’s 5 enemies and you only have 4 teammates. Odds are they’ll have more throwers/afks than you
send your tracker so we can look at those stats
Where's the val tracker
I'm a terrible player and I solo queued to bronze 3 so it's def just a skill issue
Tracker please
record a vod and lets see it lmao
silver player is like a demon to iron lobby

i used to play on iron lobby  
sometimes ppl can't even hit me when i pull knife and running around lol  
in really low iron lobby u could even carry a team with knife only
valorants system for placing you only partialy uses kills. there are at least 3 other non-shooting factors that have high impact.
It's even worse in silver. This is just the pregame. Took me forever to get out and then I SHOT through gold. Do with that info what you will. Also, make sure you're doing the right things outside of the game. Everyone hates woohoojin now but his guide to get to gold is a good starting point.
Lock duelist and if u are good you will rank up
What have you tried so far to get out of iron?

//i solo queued from iron 1 to plat 3
As someone who solo pushed from bronze 3 to ascendant 1, you're just not as good as you think you are. I went through the same denial that you're going through after deranking from silver back to bronze. 

Keep playing and learning the ins and outs of every character and every map, you'll get better by the day.

Don't think about smurfs and throwers, focus on yourself and lock duelists if nothing else works
Yeah ur on some copium bro. Make a new account or get a new pc or switch games, pal world is looking great
It's iron not radiant. If you're not getting out of iron, then you deserve it and can just stay there with the other irons.
Join some discord community and play with other people. Try to duo with a smurf. He'll both teach you the game and carry you out of bronze.
Solo queuing in bronze and silver is hell. 
Source: Trust me bro. It took me 800 hours to reach plat from iron.
iron is filled with players who are very low skilled, have really bad equipment, or have terrible internet. Lucky for you, it's really easy to get out of iron if you fix your shooting. 

You should instalock Reyna in every rank you think you can out-aim and carry yourself out of. No point coaching randoms who barely listen to you. Go in there, kill one, heal, kill next, heal. In Iron, the game really is that simple. AFKs, throwers, really doesn't matter in iron, a silver 1 (the rank you think you deserve) can easily kill 2-3 iron players every round, so if you're at a silver level, you should be evening out the numbers quite easily for your team.

If you can't get out of iron even after 50 games, your aim and movement is actually terrible and you are placed in the right rank.
