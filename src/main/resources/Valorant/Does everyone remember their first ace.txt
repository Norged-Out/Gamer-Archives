[[Does everyone remember their first ace]]


Finally got my first ace today and my god it felt good. This game sure has its highs and lows but damn do those highs feel good. 


During my 2nd game in Beta ! You can see old icons for agents and old Viper fuel jauge

    Got mine around the same time
    it's easy to forget how different the game looked back then.
Nope. I remember a couple early ones but not my first.
Mine was a little after beta with a judge. I was so bad haha. Congrats on your first!!
still got my first clipped ace, back on old bind and astra with 5 stars. here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/NuHV3vz), not uploading video because of the volume, the gameplay is so bad (crouch spraying, 0 awareness) and very messy comms.
No, but the first time you get 25+ kills in a game is one I’ll remember the adrenaline from it is unforgettable 😭
    Damn is 25 a lot? I dropped 43 the other day for the loss too.
        When you first start off it’s a pretty good amount. The most kills I ever dropped was 40 and that was in bronze ever since I haven’t broken anymore than 30
            Yeah i sit around the 15-30 mark consistently.
i even have it recorded!

crazy how far we’ve come
    My first ace started the same way, except I omen tped onto that box and everyone ended up pushing a and mid
Map: Haven

Agent: Omen

Round: 1

Weapon: Frenzy

ELO: i think G2


We start the game, have 2 afks, somehow fend off the A attack with smokes and mollies and then I do a big brain play. I solo rotate to C site, crouch behind that gray metalic thing in the corner of the site and wait. Holy smokes all 5 of them come and my teammates also start to push. Commotion ensues and I get an ace with a mag and a half... 

We lost that game obviously cause 2 afks but still I felt amazing!
Nope, too long ago as I've been playing since Beta and I've aced several times since then, I barely remember anything from the old days except I sucked ass.
On Sunset ranked match, my whole team insta died so it was 1v5 and i managed to clutch it. My second was on Lotus, pretty much same scenario and was more satisfying because we won the whole game off it.
Viper
Split
Teammate spectating me chatting shit about my gameplay. 

Aced in mid and shut him up instantly
My first ace is very funny to me because all 5 shots are from kill steal my teammates. When I got the ‘Ace!’ announcements I went ‘huh?! When?! How?!’ because I only remember shooting along with my teammates. I was new to the game so thats why I was so clueless xD 

P/s: congrats on your first ace op!
I remember my first ace in csgo back in maybe 2014, but not my first valo one
My friend and I were playing one day and he said "if you ace today I'll buy you the battlepass." I was still relatively new but that sounded dope.

 Few hours later I was on Haven as Viper, last alive tucked into A sewer. Their entire team rushes me...one by one. Bit underwhelming in the end but I ended up getting the battlepass (velocity + hydrodip).
I don’t remember any of them. I’m actually more proud to play the enemy right into my team’s crosshairs.
Oh yeah and my reaction was just OMG I MIGHT BE THE BEST PLAY IN GAME haha 😂😭😭 it was back when I was iron and now in asc aces are way more common but no reaction it's just like Mhmmm cool
Vaguely, it was Reyna on ascent, I remember hiding behind an enemy sage wall and killing 4 in ult, then got iso ulted and won
The only thing I remember about it is that after I said it was my first ace, everyone made fun of me for it 💀
Mine was with a shorty (spike rush) with neon. It was over 2 years ago.
Yes. It was literally my first match during the beta. And it was a 1v5. And it was match point. 

It was also the first and the last time I played Sova since then 🙄
only if i find the recording
Played Breach for the first time in Ascent back in Episode 3. This was in Silver, i heard all 5 walk through Catwalk so i stunned them and sprayed them down with an ares. It happened so fast and so quick that my whole team just shouted.
    I was in Dog trying to stun A main but as luck would have it, they made noise. This is why, even now in Diamond/Ascendant, if I am in a slump and can't shoot with other agents. I play Breach just to relax, can't say the same things to my enemies seeing the light of God every round though.
Neon on a paris lookin map with a bucky
    ... "Paris looking map"?  
Are you talking about Pearl? Or Split, maybe..?
        HE'S TALKING BOUT ASCENT
            now that I think about it a lot of maps look like paris I think. I dont think it's even in the game anymore
            ...  
...  
I have no hecking idea how anyone could think Ascent looks like Paris oO
during beta with a spectre on bind, i thought the gun was the best in the game for like a year after that
No. Barely remember the last one. I remember more almost aces than actual aces because I beat myself up for getting too greedy and misplaying
Yes it was shit, we were getting destroyed so hard in comp the enemy team just threw and I got the worse ace ever. The second ace was way better, I got it in TDM and had a 20 kill streak
sometime during the beta on ascent A with cypher. I only have a screenshot
Yeah, well my first comp ace at least I might have gotten one before that outside of comp. On ascent as Neon. 

They attacked b site and killed all 3 of my teammates who were there. Figuring we'd get killed immediately if we went in by our side, my teammate went mid and I flanked by attacker spawn.

I kill sage who's at the spawn. I forgot who was the second one either at b main or market. Phoenix on site right on the left of the entrance, one more pops out from the stairs and I get them as well. Get onto site to diffuse, I diffuse half and hear their brim coming in so I stop and double headshot him for the ace. 
It was the first round of the match with a classic.
I remember it even better because I proceeded to only get 4 more kills for the rest of the match. 
I did get a lot of assists while doing entry on attack but still.
Yes, but I remember the almost aces more, esp when it was a 1v5 clutch. I've only had one ace ever and honestly the enemy just fed so I got an easy 5 kills. The times I got 4 kills was always very high but I'm just almost there. I did get 5 kills once but not ace cuz clove
yep I was playing phoenix in breeze (unrated). All my kills were ADSing.
Yup! First one was in april 2021 (i made a tweet about it lol) on ascent. I think I was playing Viper and man did it feel good
Being an initiator, I had difficulties getting kills but finally got ace a few weeks ago.
Yes I remember mine. I was iron 3 at that time and it wasn't a clean one but it felt so good.
My first ace was E7A2. 

Map: Sunset 
Agent: Viper 
Match: Unrated
Weapon: Guardian

Note: I killed the first enemy earlier in the round but it didn't clip.

Haven't aced for a long time man shit, but I remember the round back in silver when I aced two rounds in a row man there's no better feeling than when every single person in the lobby thinks you're a smurf but you just peaked in highschool
I remember my first casual ace and my first comp ace. First one was funny, second one was clutch
Yes it was on split back in the beta so everyone was getting used to things. And I got the ace using a judge lol, in fact I got 3 aces that game with a judge. Each time I fannies the enemy team from B point lol
Split, omen, started b main, rotated mid, terrible flash, killed one, smoked mid, walked past the smoke as sage and sova walked through it, shot them in the back, omen ulted and Reyna and omen pushed me from vents.  Sprayed down the Reyna, hid to reload, and got the cypher.

It's so incredibly ugly to watch, and thinking about how at one point in time this was my highest moment in valorant.  Tracker apparently doesn't go back far enough to find this game, but I would have been around bronze-silver at the time.  I'm currently Diamond peaked ascendent 1.  It's insane to think about how much I've improved.


[my first ace](https://youtu.be/Fs1UWlE84zs?si=oqRz_dTp65UkDdzu)
my first ace, (as a B1 not that long ago) was in a comp game, it was OT and 13-12 for the ennemies. I was the only one left with Neon, I ulted and got them all 5

I remember one of them even wrote "ggwp" that early so I got motivated from that and we went on to win the game
Nah, a lot of ace clips tho but can’t remember my first. I remember my first 1v4 post plant in season 1 to clutch up. Aces are only as cool as the situation imo. 5v5 aces are lame unless you come in gun blazing beginning of round.
with omen
Yes, and it was the most lucky one I’ve gotten to this day. Literally just chucked a raze nade through Ascent garage from defender side once I found out that was a thing. A few seconds went by and a couple explosions later I had my first ace, and my jaw on the floor.
Sova on Pearl with a bulldog. valo is my first fps so that was def memorable even though its just one of those simple clutches that aren't considered "clippable". Even now i still use a bulldog when i have bad games w no aim and suddenly i start getting kills lmao.
Spike rush map ascent and i was using vandal with omen i was so hyped i called my brother and I ACED
Map: Have

Agent: KillJoy

Round: 1

Weapon: Sheriff

This was in unrated and I was new
I remember it was with Viper and an Odin but that’s it. Wish I had a clip
I remember mine because it just wasnt what I was going to expect it to be. I was a KJ main that usually plays a bit more passively, and at the very least I would have expected my first Ace to be during a normal round. What actually happened was I got my first Ace with a Frenzy on pistol round, while playing Neon aggressively on Acsent, a map that 9 times out of 10 just gets you killed trying to run out main. 

After that my brain said "Neon's your character" for a bit and I learned to play way less passively. Even my current KJ is way more aggressive than it used to be.  I don't really play much Neon anymore but I think it was an important step of my skill climb.
Map: split
Agent: raze
Thats it
Yup and it’s recorded. Sometimes I watch it to cringe at how bad it actually is. Bronze was a hell of an elo for my aim. You would never guess, watching my first and most recent ace, that the player in them was the same.
Icebox as Cypher - 3 kills with an Ares I think and 2 with my sidearm.

Was relatively recently in Swiftplay as a fairly new player.  

I got most of them as they triggered a wire I left in mid trying to flank.

Ares I bought as was just switching up the weapons I use - I don’t main it before anyone says anything eh
First ace on Fracture the site with arcade and other was an ace clutch.
Yep about 1h ago happen
Mine was about 3 years ago on split as a bronze viper, pistol round with a ghost on attack, B site. My last kill was on a guy rafter I believe.
Map: Split, B site
Agent: Phoenix
Side: Attack
Gun: Odin
Rank (then): Iron 1

Needless to say I had no idea what I was doing at all.
Icebox. Losing 9-2 in Comp. They trolled and mass bought ops. Clutched and my team popped off - going on to win evry round after that.
No! I didn't even knew what ace was. I remember hearing that word after killing someone.
No. Had too many.
Nah 🥹
People first ace is usually when one is AFK in spawn lol
Iron 2 on icebox
I was so happy and i couldnt believe it
Mine was on fracture as brim, but my clipping software had to fail me specifically that day :(
Yeah it was as Cypher in a Spike Rush game on Ascent. We lost 1-4, but it was nice that my teammates were shooting at me when I got an Ace. I texted my friend Mason Ma on Snapchat about it and he said “nice.”
I started playing this year so yes. I remember screaming " its my first ace!!" And the whole team was super hyped and cool about it. Made it feel like it was my first nuke on mw2 (2009)
With Omen on Breeze. I think I got the final kill from window, but I'm not sure.
I was playing kay/o on icebox and got an ace with a ghost, so yes
During beta I was defending B on Haven with sage with an Ares. I managed to take out most of the enemy team except for one who tried to rush me straight after. I walled my self up and got him too. Beta days were so weird lol
I think it was a pistol ace on fracture with breach
I do remember my first ace, but it wasnt so epic lol. I was new to the game around bronze, i guess. I was playing KJ and bottom fragging. Team kept flaming me. i was defending ascent A site alone and the enemy team rushed and planted. I retook the entire site alone with an ace lol. It was much peaceful afterwards...

edit- it was with an odin
Yes! It was recently, I have it posted on my profile, and just got my second like yesterday
I don’t remember my first Ace because it just felt like I got a bunch of solo and double kills at different times and points on the map. No insane 5-man spray-down or 1v5 clutch or whatnot. All my Aces were like this. 

I do remember my first and only Hexakill though. Again, it was just a bunch of solo and double kills, but I won’t forget the 6 spinning icons in the kill banner and the huge Imperium finisher as the icing on top.
my friend was over and as soon as the game was over we had some tacos for celebration
my first ace was on lotus, i just swung everything with jett dash but mostly shot ppl on site via spray and pray
Nah unfortunately, pc wasn't good enough for recording software at the time so not a scooby when i did it. Played since beta though so it's been a while
Remember it like it was yesterday.
Was on preal b long on the right side hiding spot wait for everyone to pass then mauled down the team with a ghost
When I think abt i used to do way more aces back when I was silver than in acs
Got one my first ever game in beta. Coming from cs, valorant felt very natural but I guess the people I was playing against were completely new to first person shooters. Mowed down 5 while all 5 of them missed me with their sprays.
i got my first ace with classic it was low elo
Yeah a couple of days ago (started Val like 2 months ago, came from R6S), I was playing Skye on Bind at defense round, it was a 2v5 with my teammate trying to defuse and I aced that round, I never hit a better clip than that
Operator Ace in Icebox around 2021. Doesn't count. They peeked one by one with the same movement all I had to do was press left click.
Yes, it was in unrated while I was learning the game it was on split map with Phantom as Jett
Mine was first time playing omen back in the early days of valoramt I just tpied behind the box in B main in ascent and opened fire with my sweet odin I miss those days
Nah it was in beta. It was cool but I never really cared about them.
my first was a 6k with a spectre. i ads'd every shot and reloaded after every kill. it was gross, but still a 6k ace.
Never got an ace :/  
But still remember some exceptionnal moments:  
- Knife kills (one I sneaked on half the map to get in their back, and the other one they just didn't check a corner)

* A 4k (my only :/)
* A 1v3 clutch (my only, too...)
* A tripkill (this was so satisfying... you never expect the last enemy to randomly get into your trapwire, on the other side of the map, not destroy it, and die from that...)

(And also the moments you find some "lineups" (Idk how you call it for cams \^\^") you thought could work ok, but that in fact works perfect. Those are the ones you will never forget)
Not really, getting an ace is indeed exciting but winning a game is way more important than that, as you keep playing, you'll realize a win grants you rr but an ace doesn't, I don't think you'll remember how many ace you've got/ your first ace as your playtime gets longer and longer. Congrats on getting your first ace anyways.
    You get a win approximately half of your games, but an ace? Much less than that...  
And a win may give you rr, but an ace gives you satisfaction and confidence because it proves that you performed extremely well and that you're able to do it again.  
And the most important part of a game isn't winning, you won't get anything from that but colored pixels... It's having fun, feeling good. A loss against worthy opponents in which everyone played very well is worth way more than a win with toxic teammates and enemies...  
Therefore, an ace is more important than just a win
I never saw aces as important. I don't care if I get one, I don't care if my team takes mine, and I rather secure the round than try to get my teammate one (in comp.)

It's not really on the same level as like a pentakill.
Got mine around the same time
it's easy to forget how different the game looked back then.
Damn is 25 a lot? I dropped 43 the other day for the loss too.
    When you first start off it’s a pretty good amount. The most kills I ever dropped was 40 and that was in bronze ever since I haven’t broken anymore than 30
        Yeah i sit around the 15-30 mark consistently.
My first ace started the same way, except I omen tped onto that box and everyone ended up pushing a and mid
I was in Dog trying to stun A main but as luck would have it, they made noise. This is why, even now in Diamond/Ascendant, if I am in a slump and can't shoot with other agents. I play Breach just to relax, can't say the same things to my enemies seeing the light of God every round though.
... "Paris looking map"?  
Are you talking about Pearl? Or Split, maybe..?
    HE'S TALKING BOUT ASCENT
        now that I think about it a lot of maps look like paris I think. I dont think it's even in the game anymore
        ...  
...  
I have no hecking idea how anyone could think Ascent looks like Paris oO
