[[Has the role of tank been made unfun to play, if so how can it be improved.]]



I just saw a comment saying how overwatch devs keep making the role of tank a miserable role to play, and as a zarya main i kinda find it fun to play most of the time.


The tank meta is largely dominated by Zarya/Orisa because they’re the only tanks that don’t immediately get nuked. It isn’t really about them being broken (but that Zarya buff was wtf.) it’s about them being able to survive such heavy damage and sustain themselves when practically all other tanks cannot. Orisa is more of a sore spot because of her fortify and her 2 cc abilities. Fortify is getting nerf afaik this coming season, so that’s a plus.


All in all, I’d say the numbers (healing, damage) need to be dragged down substantially. Illari I think was the tipping point for this revelation. There really should be no reason for practically every support to have the ability the tank roster with relative comfort. This is all coming from a tank main.
    Plus zarya is the only Tank that can cleanse ana nade
    > There really should be no reason for practically every support to have the ability the tank roster with relative comfort

I think you might have forgotten a word. I can guess what you mean, but I'd like to know what you actually meant.
        I think they meant have the ability to counter the tank roster with relative comfort, like just having the mobility to run away from dive or stuff like sleep/anti
            Ye
    Uummm, doomfist?
        Wym? His ult? That really doesn’t seem like a good trade, Zarya has 2 cleanses on cooldown, what does doom have?
            You say that the meta is dominated by just Zarya and Orisa, but Orisa is mostly selected because she’s a counter to doom. Doom lobbies have been pretty abundant since the last patch, and his survivability was strongly increased since block now absorbs all types of damage. The cc with every and any punch ain’t a joke either. I’m obviously talking about my own experience, but I’ve had more matches than I can count with either a Dva (which is also broken atm since she can be flying every 3 seconds, not to mention eats nades, ults, cc, etc) or a Doomfist. Orisa is the counter for those 2 and Zarya is the counter to Orisa. So the 2 you said are not the only ones dominating the meta. How many games have you been playing per day?
                Orisa counters most tanks, not just Doom.
                A couple dozen, I have stuff to do for the majority of the day, and I primarily play sig and ram. Almost every time I play ram an orisa is swapped to, same thing with sig, with Zarya instead
                    Couple dozen is 24, and you say “I have stuff to do the majority of the day” lol. That puts you around 6-8 hours of gameplay daily. So either you’re lying in one or the other. And yes, because those two tanks (Orisa and Zarya) are the direct counters of the tanks YOU play, not that they are the “meta”.
                        First off that’s around 4 hours. And it’s 24 games maximum, so get your math right dumbass. And doom imo is much more enjoyable to face than the goddamn horse. Much more enjoyable to play too. Orisa has 2 cc abilities that fuck over hog, ram, rein, ball, Queen and Winston and sig to an extent. Fortify is busted, and Zarya is the only counter to orisa.
                            But what does that have to do with them being the “meta”? And no, my math is not off. Average game in comp is 15-20 min. Multiply that by 24 and divide by 60 to get hours. But I don’t know what I expected from a dummy from Reddit. The statement “they are the meta” just because they counter you is wrong. Again, that is YOUR experience, not mine. I get more divers than the horse herself. And guess what, I lose more against a Dva or a Doom being a support than by Zarya or Orisa. Orisa is cake if your supports go Zen (which I do). Zarya is easy to deal with as well if your party has some brain cells and just burn her after second bubble. Again you see them more because of the heroes you play, but by far the meta right now is either Junker Queen or Dva. What rank are you btw? By the sounds of it you’re either bronze or low gold.
                                I play a lot more qp. It’s roughly 10 minutes per game. And when a tank counters practically all others, they are meta. When only one tank counters the previously mentioned tank, they are meta. JQ and dva may be viable, but the meta is Zarya and orisa, it’s playing until 1 tank swaps orisa, then the other tank swaps to Zarya to counter. And I’m speaking as a tank, the meta for tanks is Zarya and orisa. Also wtf do ranks have to do with anything, almost universally orisa and Zarya are top picks right now.
                            Oh! I get it, you say 24 games in QP! No wonder you don’t know shit what the “meta” is.
                                Bro I can't even rn, orisa and zarya are much stronger than the rest of the tank roster. Orisa is used in almost every single game, throughout the entirety of comp, and zarya is the only counter to orisa. Other tanks are viable, but those two are 100% meta and if you think otherwise you have no clue what you're talking about.
                        Orisa also counters Rein, Dva (to an extent), Roadhog, really every tank except for Zarya and *maybe* Sigma but that’s me reaching
We got too much damage. Like way too fucking much.

And as a result we also now have a shit ton of healing to compensate for all the damage.

Now how tf is a tank supposed to tank when we get ass blasted the moment we step into the frontlines?

Lessen the damage output, lessen the healing output. It’s an easy fix.

There’s a reason Orisa n Zarya are the top contenders. They don’t die at the flip of a button.

We don’t need all this damage
    Less damage, less healing, totally agree.
    In fact they both have a 'not die' button available to them which specifically doesn't hamper their ability to fight.

Rein, Sigma, Doom and punchy-Ram all have to sit in their stance, the latter two having a recharge to put their arms in front of their face apparently. Sigma at least gets the defense from *most* attacks along with a temp buff after the fact which singles him out of these four, AND he's got the option of a floating shield when necessary.

Hog is stuck filling his gob with healing goop the whole time.

Winston has bugger-all health and has a shield that basically only protects him from everything you're not currently in your weapon's range of, so everything you're NOT currently engaging with your static shocks.

Ball's and Queen's not die buttons are far more fleeting, especially if the DPSs are on the case or one of the game's few remaining stuns scrambles their escape.

And D.Va's shield is fine for projectiles and she can still kind of fight with it up, but shame if you're against beams or melees.
They should change the tank passive so that any non-damage abilities have less of an effect. Don’t know what the percentage would be but let’s say all CC, anti, hack, discord, etc. did 20% less of the effect so weren’t stunned as long or locked out. It’s your job to eat damage and abilities, but there’s too many for one player to take even with the amount of health tanks have. It’s also unfun to play eating all of that.

If that isn’t an option then supports need some tuning to have slightly less healing or damage in their kit.
Have 2 tanks and split them into 2 rolls. Main and off.
    You're not allowed to say that around here.
Because zarya has been good all throughout ow2s life and has yet to be bad. Try playing rein or something in current ow and get the real tank experience
    She wasn’t good after the initial late season 1 nerf.
        She wasn’t bad though, zarya has never been bad in ow2 sure she has had times where she wasn’t good but she has never been a bad character
            She has been the 2nd worse tank for a long time before the buff and will go back to be after the nerf in season 7.

She is just easily countered by a lot of other tanks (Doom, Winston, Rein, Sigma) and has 0 vertical mobility.

She’s just good to farm in low elos.
                You can’t effectively play doom a lot of the time due to his numerous counters. Winston has sucked most this games life due to counters being good same with rein. So sigma mostly has been the counter play to zarya and then what? Cant rock her because you bubble projectile weapon easy bubble sure you have a shield but when that gets shredded by bastions and everything else she just shoots you through your grasp. Even if you still make it through all of this as sigma against zarya what do you do when the rest of her team swaps to counter you?
The devs flip flopped on a lot of their decisions for Ow2, namely sustain and some forms of CC. This makes tanks very irritating to play, since they have to walk on glass for a lot of things. On top of that, since support are overtuned, it makes getting picks harder, so burning your cooldowns as a tank is even more fragile. The best play style right now is to bunker down and hold a line (with orisa) or counter that comp/cc with Zarya.

Theres one or two things that we could do, thats been recommended a ton: add on to the tank passive, making debuffs and/or CC less impactful on tanks. So, if a tank is discorded, normally it'd be 25%, but with this passive, it'd be something like 20%. Same goes for anti which lasts less, or sombra's hack which has a shorter time period.

The other is nerfing supports, either their healing capabilities, or their survival. A team with bap/lifeweaver is not dying.
I’d say what they need to do is make a new tank passive that’s something like this.

Negative effects last for a shorter duration. When taking damage from multiple sources, incoming damage is reduced.

This change would make it so they don’t have to mess with the damage and healing numbers a ton on supports and dps, which would be very difficult and potentially unbalance the game in other ways.  But it does let tanks live longer when focused and be less effected by things like anti and hack.

While the damage reduction would need to be experimented with heavily to make sure it isn’t broken, I think it could be a really good change once the value is finalized. I know a lot of complaints rn are something along the lines of “nothing dies in this sustain meta” which is partially true, but also tanks die way too fast to be able to effectively fill their role and so I think this could be a good change.

The idea behind this is you really shouldn’t be targeting the tank first but because of how easy it is to kill them rn that is what happens in a lot of cases forcing people who play tank to have to use Zarya and Orisa because they are the only tanks that can really survive rn. This would make focusing them while they still have supports a bad idea because the healing would surpass/equalize the damage. It would also make tanks like rein, doom, and hog have an easier time against anti nade and similar abilities without instadying when hit by them. Could also help against discord on tank being so crippling. If this change becomes a thing they should probably rebuff Zen tho cause this would be a big nerf to him compared to the other supports since discord is single target
    I like this alot as long as they balance the tanks, if they did this update and nothing else right now Orisa would literally break the game even more than she already has lol
        Yeah it would have to be a huge overhaul to implement
Yknow how sleep doesn’t affect tanks the same as everyone? Ya put that on every debuff and that should include how long it takes sombra to hack. It should take her longer to hack tanks than others, yknow, make it so tanks can react to hack in the midst of everything.
Bringing back 6v6 is the ONLY way to improve the tank role. "But playing against double shield is boring and was a terrible meta🤡" it was, but there's 2-3 different solutions to permanently fixing that problem without removing a tank. Not only is having 1 tank unfun, but it also doesn't feel like ow anymore
    Also all of the OW1 tanks were made with 2 tanks in mind. We got main and off tanks
    Dont worry, blizz will bring back ow classic in 2 years and call it a new game lmao
        Full $70 dollar price as well! But don't worry, purchasing that also includes the first battlepass for FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
            and also coins which you can shove up your ass
    No it's not. Did you even play OW1? The tank role was the least popular role for years, the queue for DPS was like 20 times longer. It sucked to play, and it sucked to play against. Go back and watch some OW1 gameplay and tell me how fun it was to shoot at tanks and shields all game. 

And you seem to forget that if you introduce another tank to OW2 they will need to nerf their damage again. Tanks right now they are like a beefy dps, adding one more without a substantial nerf to dmg would break the game. So what would tanks become then? Less tanky than OW1 and the same low damage. Dude that sounds so fun to play!!!

Let's hear your "2-3 different solutions".
        >No it's not. Did you even play OW1?

Yes it would, and yes I did. I have thousands of hours of playing ow1

>The tank role was the least popular role for years, the queue for DPS was like 20 times longer. It sucked to play, and it sucked to play against.

The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is. Also, the queue times argument is invalid because ow1 was not f2p like ow2 is, so it's not gonna have the same amount of players like ow2 has. Not to mention the fact that it is easier to assemble a team with 5v5 than with 6v6. Even having an f2p 5v5 format, ow2 is having a hard time finding tank players lol. Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about.

>Go back and watch some OW1 gameplay and tell me how fun it was to shoot at tanks and shields all game. 

I have clips of my own, and I have played ow2 for 6 months so I can confidently say ow1 is better in EVERY WAY.

>And you seem to forget that if you introduce another tank to OW2 they will need to nerf their damage again.

That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

>Less tanky than OW1 and the same low damage. Dude that sounds so fun to play!!!

I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1.

>Let's hear your "2-3 different solutions".

Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that
            >The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is.

Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about. 

The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Ofc the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 

Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case.  This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

>That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

So why did you not mention it? Sounds to me like you did not realize it. Because I can tell you this, the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play. Being a bullet sponge with no damage is not fun for 99% of the playerbase. 

>I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1. 

Lmao, really? You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance. And you think **I** have a skill issue? Are you trolling or just bad?  

> Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that 

What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me".  

Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If **that's** your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 

And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.

It's funny how everytime someone demands 6v6 they say "it's so easy to fix", and then they don't actually have a fix at all. If you liked OW1's slower gameplay more, that's great, you are entitled to your opinion. But don't act like it's some sort of solution, because it's not.
                >The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Of course, the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 


Of course it was BECAUSE THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!! It's going to be the most popular because players were testing out the new format. Once tank players realized how dodo the role was after playing it for a while, it became just as low as ow1 because most of em quit. And It's not saying a lot because it went f2p, which means more players

>Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case. This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

That was never really the case in ow1 either unless you were in the high ranks. In my experience as a tank player in mastes, I only had to wait 5-8 minutes on average throughout the lifespan of ow1. If tank players are already quitting a year into ow2, then imagine what it's gonna be like in another year.

>So why did you not mention it?

Because anyone with a functioning brain cell would know that the tanks would need to revert back to their ow1 states. Hence, why it would go without saying. Nobody wants ow2 tanks as they r now in a 6v6 format. 

>the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play.

Tell that to the thousands of tank players that are saying the role is horrible. I can link you to multiple different videos showing you just that.

>You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance

Less mechanical skill??? You had the nerve to accuse me of not playing ow1 when this is whatchu think? Tank duos relied on tank synergies, which requires MECHANICAL SKILL lmao I'm dead as hell. Relying more on individual performance as a tank player is exactly why I said it doesn't feel like ow anymore because in ow1, it was all about TEAMWORK!! Now it's about who can counter swap who and how much healing supports can mindlessly pump into one tank. Idc about not having less cover if we have what I mentioned above.

>What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me". 


Did I say anything about standing behind shields? If the devs weren't so damn dense and didn't abandon ow1, we wouldn't have had to deal with that oppressive double shield meta for so long.

Option 1) Divide tanks into off tank and main tank. This is the safest option because it automatically removes double shield while allowing all tanks to be viable. I've seen a lot of players suggest this.

Option 2) give hog 1.5 - 2× more damage against shields when their are more than 1 in play. This allows hog to be a great counter to double shield and gives more usage than just punishing bad positioning. I came up with this one.

Option 3) nerf tf out of all the shields. If there's more than 1 shield on the field, then their health gets dropped in half. 

The first option is obviously the best, but the other two could easily destroy the double shield meta.

>Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If that's your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 


Tanks Reverting back to their original state alone would not be what fixes 6v6 smh🤦‍♂️ it would take multiple other changes to make it work, but it'll ultimately be easier to fix than 5v5.

And 6 years of tank being bad? Yea, you didn't play ow1 lol there's no way. Tank was not bad for that long because Sig, Orisa, and Brig were not in the game until years later.I don't remember what their exact release dates were, but it wasn't until later.

>And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.


Fun? As in mindlessly pumping heals into a single tank and have a bunch of get outta jail free card abilities that doesn't require much skill to use? Yea, that sounds like fun lol let's make ow require less skill and take away the tank experience to make everyone feel welcomed.
Add a second tank.
    So you mean bring back 6v6?
        Yep
            Man, I wish they would.
    Never going to happen. Much more productive to have a conversation about improving 5v5
        Imagine seeing a valid argument and going I don't wanna talk about that let's just talk about changes I'd like to see. Reddit at its finest, never change
            Yeah in the meantime let's talk about 7v7 and 232 comps.

Imagine screaming into the ether for a dev team to make a change they don't have the resources for, nor the playerbase to justify (sadly not enough tank players for 6v6 imo)

Never change.
            I am not sure you know what the word “argument” means.  This is just straight up an unproductive opinion.  At least the other dude is trying to be constructive, not saying I agree or disagree with either.
    Play open queue. Got 2 tanks, 2 supports, 1 dps

Done
        You're not living unless you're playing Mystery Heroes friend.
            Mystery heroes is good, not only because it's fun but because it teaches huge amounts of game sense in the process. You have to prioritize keeping yourself alive a lot more than in qp and especially for lower MMR players it can change the way you think about the game completely.
    As a mainly quickplay player, my only issue with two tanks is how often two off-tanks would get picked. Few people wanted to play shield tank.
        Shield doesn't equal main tank. 

But I just want a meta where I can play rein and it not be a throw pick 😔
            That I can agree with. Tanks need help, but I just don't think two tanks is necessarily the answer.
Personally as a plat tank main I am enjoying most games, but I will say it’s quite stressful. I wouldn’t go so far as to say other roles aren’t equally stressful, but I think with tank specifically you tend to miss out on the highest highs that other roles get, unless you are on the exact right hero at the exact right time. There are also a lot of picks in the game that you can play fine against, but they make your job a lot more boring. 

Essentially I still think tank is high impact, and tank is still built around controlling an area. You still win by contesting the most important angles and positions and by outputting pressure. However I think as it plays right now there’s a lot of like, whack a mole, cat and mouse kind of gameplay where you have to constantly show up and be enough of a threat to stop things from happening, but if you full commit to any play, you just die almost immediately. 

This can be really fun on mobile heroes, but I think it’s pretty unsatisfying on slower ones. A lot of the time when you do your job properly, the value is not immediately visible, you don’t get that visceral feedback of picking teams apart and getting kills. You’re kind of in a cycle of try to match the biggest enemy threat-> don’t chase them too far->check your team’s position->check enemy position->match their biggest threat, etc. until something happens. 

Usually it’s not something that you actively did either, even if you did a lot of work to enable it, you kinda just hustle all over the place and it feels like the game doesn’t really give you the direct credit unless your team gives you some endorsements at the end. It’s not even bad that tanking is like this, it’s just slowly gotten more and more extreme, with the fights lasting longer and longer and after juggling responsibilities for 75 full seconds you just lose the fight entirely because the 6th bastion grenade of the fight stuck your mercy, or someone got impatient sometime around the 2nd or 3rd turret form and peeked it. Honestly though these problems are kind of standard to the tank role in most games, which is historically not that popular in most games. 

For me the number one thing they could actually do is keep up these reworks, and minimize the amount of a hero’s power budget that goes into free value abilities. If it’s just a button for a self buff, has no movement or aim or timing involved, it really needs to be the weakest part of a hero’s kit simply because it’s the most boring to use and to play against. 

The best examples I can think of are torb overload, baptiste regen burst, and Orisa fortify. They are already characters that want to just spam in their best positions and then some of their best abilities are just like— “I have another health bar and do more damage” while they continue to do what they were already doing before and after using the ability. I’d highly prefer a little more skilled utility or at least timing to make it work. I think these types of abilities contribute heavily to the type of gameplay that can be unrewarding for tanks especially. They just aren’t dynamic. You force them out without overcommitting then retreat, over and over until someone forgets how to position correctly for a second then the fight ends. 

I also think smaller but significant issue is that the meta does not favor winston, and that rein is a little bit outdated for 5v5 unless you have a full team built around him. Rein is still one of the most popular tanks even when bastion is this good and Orisa is this common so having the rein experience be worse than usual dramatically and disproportionately affects people’s perception of how fun tank is.
    Nah being support is way less stressful
        Dunno, I'm support main, but I often dabble in tank for funsies, especially if I queue with two other friends who are also amazing supports and i'm having fun.

I find it less stressful. I just pewpew or bonkbonk and contest point and save their booties.

After, i'm quite a flex tank, I'm playing decently Rein/Orisa/Zarya/Ball/Sigma/JQ/Rammatra . AND I'm queing with friends that I know are great supports and who have my back and knows their jobs.

&#x200B;

BUT soloQ tank isn't the same at all in term of experience, and maybe more stressful, in the sense that supports are randomized ? You may have amazing ones, or supports who queue with DPS and let you die non stop because they just want to pocket their friend. In that sense, it is annoying AF.

BUT I still find it more frustrating than stressful. Supoort feels more stressful, between the pressure of keeping anyone alive AND being flanked non stop AND 95% of the time, not having anyone to peel for you.
            Yeah I don’t even bother with tank. I used to play DPS mostly. When I play illari or bap I feel like a (better tbh) DPS that has way more utility that can dictate the fight. When I play DPS no matter how many picks I get or how accurate I am I don’t feel like I have much control
                For me the issue, as a support main, is that i see more and more dps player picking support, just to DPS with them and ignoring healing the whole team, just focusing on killing. AND THAT'S SO ANNOYING ARGHHHHH
                    I feel like juggling the two isn’t hard but I don’t think it should be too far in one style
                        Yup. There's a large middle between heal botting and plain ingoring your whole team to just self healing and do DPS. Albeit heal botting is more tolerable than being selfish tbh.
                            Yeah like I have plenty of games on support where we have more damage than the other supports but less healing, but it’s also because they are taking more damage than we are. Even when I was DPS I would rather have an Ana who throws big antis or a bap that throws good lamps whilst helping me get picks than a lifeweaver heal botting. Because the latter makes matches feel like a stalemate

I think positioning is more important as a support making sure everyone is in your line of sight because you can just inflate your numbers healbotting an out position tank and ignoring your other teammates
i can't stand tanking anymore tbh, meta feels so stale and tank is objectively a lot more demanding than the other roles. imo two tanks again, healing or support utility nerfs, or a global dmg nerf would help. supports are kind of the plague of tanks, support feels great but the fact that i can solo a tank if my util is off cooldown is not good lmao. beyond that i just feel like a solo tank, even a decent one, can definitely get completely shut down by a team in the current state of the game. i wish they'd bring 6v6 back because some of the tanks complemented one another really well in ways that would compensate for the other tank's weakness, you couldn't win games just by targeting the shit out of one person. if one tank got fucked by all of the support utility you would still have a second tank to do their job or save the other tank you know? i miss hog and ball torture :(
I have no idea why they buffed zarya.
Add a second tank, i.e. go back to 6v6 lol. I was all for the speedier gameplay and less barriers but 5v5 just proves 1 tank has to do a ton of work and so the complaints are now tanks either get shredded, or they are incredibly hard to kill based on their abilities. 

I used to main tank in Overwatch but in 2 I am terrible as a solo tank and now mostly play dps.
The zaryas that arent having fun are just bubbling themselves the whole time
    I'm not personally a zarya fan but do enjoy those last minute bubble saves, especially when you throw it on a teammate rig HR before rein smashes them into a wall. She does always feel like the final destination in the tank counter game so they seem slightly less effected by meta compared to some other tanks. This season especially feels like Rock, Paper, Zarya
        Lol thats why people play meta. Winning is the most fun
[deleted]
    Leave hp pools till dmg and heal nerf to see how it feels imo
        Couldn't agree more
            Ya just too much at once with too much of a chance fucking everything up
    Agreed about healing
I find tanks fun when I'm with prebuilts. I don't trust my team to have my back in pubs. 

I think damage needs a rework for tanks. Increase the damage on unpopular tanks so they can contribute to demolishing opponent tanks so your team can collapse on the supports. 

A lot of complaints I see about the current state of tank is because supports are "broken" and tanks won't die because of that. So let tanks deal more damage to brawl it out with each other. Or a passive that lets tanks deal more damage to other tanks. Tankbuster etc
    Maybe better to let supports have less healing so the goal will be accomplished in that way?
        Because if you nerf heals on all supports then some of them won't be viable at all. How much slower do you need Zen and Lucio to be at healing without an ult or skill. Rather deal more damage than heal at all at that point. People are saying supports have too much sustain and utility to survive, so make the stakes higher by increasing tank damage so tanks can more easily bait out the utility and CD. Make their utility and CDs more skill heavy. 

Buffing damage on tanks lets tanks brawl each other. Lowering heals is just the same situation as now just faster. Might even see antiheal become even more powerful. Would lower heals promote aggressive or safer playing is a good question though.
I disagree, I play only ramattra because his playstyle is extremely fun
If you like tanking and don't take the criticism to heart it's fine and a lot of fun. I've main tanked in OW and WoW for years. Most people just buckle under the responsibility and can't handle being called shitty or insulted. And they usually lack the confidence/experience to play a tank they want instead of the meta. 

The tank experiences this in any and all games. Why it's the least played class in most games. It's also why some good tanks act like haughty fucks to counter the criticism they usually encounter or the result of an inflated ego.
    Its a lot of fun when you can play but it's certainly not fine unless we're using the argument that tank is fine the other roles have just crept a bit too much
As a [D.Va](https://D.Va) main (Orisia as backup) I don't tend to have a problem. What I've noticed though is that I do not have any decent DPS support (regardless of the tank I use). Either I have 2 snipers or 2 flankers on my team, and often when I make a suggestion about a DPS switch I'm told to STFU followed by gender insults.   


I think with the reworks being done, they really should look at other options such as sub-classes or even bringing back 6v6 (LOL I know they wont on either but a girl can wish right?)
    Play ball, embrace the hampter chad
Honestly I don’t know how to improve tank right now. I find the role unfun now because you’re the only tank, I loved duoing tank with my brother in OW1. It just feels so lonely now.

Knowing that a 6v6 isn’t in the cards, they gotta find someway to shake up the meta. Playing into Orisa and Zarya every game is so boring. I wanna play rein but it feels like you’re slamming your head against a wall
rework discord, sleep, antinade, nanoblade and phara, nerf soldier juuuuust a bit, delete cc in orisa spin, nerf hack to make it just an instant interrupt for tank and i'll be a happy rein.

maybe make ram punch reduced dmg when go through barrier. but that one's a really personnal choice.
    For the orb of discord you can make it something like this

**Orb of DiscordE**

  
**Type** Ability  
**Effect Type** Targeted  
*Launch this orb at an enemy to increase the damage they take.*

**Damage**:  
\+25% [damage received](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_amplification) for Damage and Supports 

\+15% [damage received](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_amplification) for tanks

  
**Ammo**:  
One active  
**Duration**:  
0.1 seconds (if out of sight)  
**Max. range**:  
25 meters  
**Projectile speed**:  
50 meters per second

this would make discord orb less effective against tanks and make it harder to keep up at all times

for sleep dart, there isn't really more we can do there it already does less against tanks 

for soldiers nerf, decrease the healing from his selfheal

for orisa spin to no longer do the lil boop, that is that

ram punch i dont think should be reduced damage through shields but i can see your point, about nade just make its effect be 1,5 sec longer (5,5 sec total) but only 1,5 seconds of this is actually no heals, for the remaining 4 seconds we make the anti heal go from a 100% negation to maybe 25% to make it still very valuable to hit a fat nade, but less of a tank instant death button
    I saw someone suggest anti nade should reduce healing by 100% for 1 second and it reduces by 25% every second after that and honestly that seemed perfect to still allow it to be useful to secure elims or force someone out but also making it reasonable to survive without a cleanse.

Sleep dart having reduced effectiveness on tanks should be how most cc is when it hits tanks imo. Because they only have 1 person to eat it all and if they are trying to get elims being the 600 hp character with usually the largest hit box that everyone focuses they need some way to actually engage and only orisa really has that right now and its so boring. Tanks get chain cc’d the moment they try to play the game because its optimal to bully them now since there is only 1. Sure the supports can help the tank survive but just sitting and waiting for someone else to let you have fun isnt good.
        i like the take on nade, good solution :)
Dude I'm just not having fun anymore. I either have to play too long or pay too much for the new heroes. The game is slowly deteriorating.
Unfun? Tanks are the most abusive class in the game atm. Most of them can easily erase any squishy out of position. Their damage is too much. If they’re going to have such large health pools and also shields then their damage needs to be reduced a bit.
    Lol ikr and supports are so weak they need double the health and healing they have right now and damage need double the damage they have and tanks shouldnt have more than 200 health, why should they have more health it's abusive

I’ve been beat boxing orissas as ram and it’s been fun
I think tanks want or expect too much, is it already not enough to be a raid boss? They often do the most damage of any role and are difficult to kill. DPS feels like a filler role. Maybe if tank damage was cut and survivability was slightly increased? IDK if it would be more fun, but they may feel like they are more than a bigger DPS.
I don’t think so lol
personally i think tanks are unfun because i as a tank do too little damage to make any meaningful plays and supports heal way to much, to mitigate this i think damage tanks do needs to come up by a bit, not enough to were picking tank outshines dps but enough to keep up with the healing supports can do . this is a much overall take but id make every tank hitscan, rn i think we have 3 hitscan tanks (4 if you include rein which technically is a hitscan if you think about it hard enough) ball, dva, and junker mommy. since tanks cant one shot i dont think itd be a game breaking change, i think itd help with consistency in dealing with players with small hitboxes (gramma ) or highly mobile characters (british lady). thats just me tho, id like to hear others inputs
Anti-heal makes the experience miserable at times. I'm surprised they still haven't done anything to change it
    Didn't they reduce it from 5 to 4 secs?
Balance, so characters like orisa, bastion, torb and so on are not that dominant. Except that, tank is fine
It's definitely more stressful than any other role, and I think supports being so strong is a big reason as to why. Tanks just aren't strong enough to only have one with how much damage and utility supports have. I'm a tank main and whenever something makes me tilted it's usually a support three tapping me mid fight, or canceling my abilities or ult, or CC'ing me
definitely an unpopular opinion, bring back two tank but implement big tank debuffs like debuff health/armour for all heroes closer to dps HP. debuff some abilities like doom/hammond, but keep double fire strike/bubble but a half flat debuff), but ESPICIALLY a medium-to-large shield debuff so double shield/turtling meta doesnt come back. Buff support healing to heal second tank on team. My most unrealistic idea is change map geometry like on 1cp so its less about holding a choke points. Also, add more heroes to the available hero roster, one or two more tank heroes that are more about medium manoeuvrability but not as fast as hammond/doom, and add another support that gives a speed boost. Give DPS a buff to headshots on tanks. Could also add a second role queue that limits the two tanks to only one flex, and one beef.I always thought that changing the game to 5 player teams was going too far and they just had to implement the hero changes and get rid of the 600hp shields. a 5 team definitely makes sense sometimes, but sometimes its also just impossible as a tank to be everywhere at once and push the objective while defending from dives.
Tank dont need biffs. Supports and dpses needs nerfs. Current ow balance team is dong every same mistake as previous one. They are just constantly overbuffing everyting while complitely ignoring the problem.

Easiest way to improve the game overall would be to fire all who are making balance decisions and hire competent people
Nerf healing and go back to 6v6
as a zarya main it’s a no brainer that you find it fun as she’s the most meta tank right now.

As a dva main, it is pain. I cannot go a single game without the enemy tank picking zarya as soon as i eliminate them once. counter picking is a fucking joke and makes the game boring for everyone involved, unless you actually enjoy playing zarya.
Kinda most of the time?
for me, it’s the orb of discord/bastion/anti comps that delete me in half a second
Here’s a thought make them FUCKING IMPACTFUL
as someone who used to mainly play the off-tank role, I miss having a second tank. I'm not a tank player as such, so this might be a very personal opinion, but having two tanks was nice.

now I mostly play support and the biggest problem I see is tank players who pick something without a shield just can't hold the front as much? especially if it's one without any shields and you are defending. can't even blame the tank cus maybe they are learning, or new or don't want to play other characters.
A lot of tank ultimates are also pretty terrible
    Sure if used improperly.
Man's really came on here like "what do you mean yall have a bad time playing tank I main zarya." Right you play the giga buffed meta tank. So obviously you going to have a better time then other tank mains. Case closed
For me , since transitioning to only one tank, I find it much more fun to play. If I was to improve upon it I would nerf orisa slightly
I WILL BE YOUR SHIELD! ^^just ^^as ^^soon ^^as ^^my ^^shield ^^regens, ^^I ^^was ^^out ^^of ^^cover ^^for ^^1.2 ^^seconds ^^vs ^^soldier ^^bastion
Plus zarya is the only Tank that can cleanse ana nade
> There really should be no reason for practically every support to have the ability the tank roster with relative comfort

I think you might have forgotten a word. I can guess what you mean, but I'd like to know what you actually meant.
    I think they meant have the ability to counter the tank roster with relative comfort, like just having the mobility to run away from dive or stuff like sleep/anti
        Ye
Uummm, doomfist?
    Wym? His ult? That really doesn’t seem like a good trade, Zarya has 2 cleanses on cooldown, what does doom have?
        You say that the meta is dominated by just Zarya and Orisa, but Orisa is mostly selected because she’s a counter to doom. Doom lobbies have been pretty abundant since the last patch, and his survivability was strongly increased since block now absorbs all types of damage. The cc with every and any punch ain’t a joke either. I’m obviously talking about my own experience, but I’ve had more matches than I can count with either a Dva (which is also broken atm since she can be flying every 3 seconds, not to mention eats nades, ults, cc, etc) or a Doomfist. Orisa is the counter for those 2 and Zarya is the counter to Orisa. So the 2 you said are not the only ones dominating the meta. How many games have you been playing per day?
            Orisa counters most tanks, not just Doom.
            A couple dozen, I have stuff to do for the majority of the day, and I primarily play sig and ram. Almost every time I play ram an orisa is swapped to, same thing with sig, with Zarya instead
                Couple dozen is 24, and you say “I have stuff to do the majority of the day” lol. That puts you around 6-8 hours of gameplay daily. So either you’re lying in one or the other. And yes, because those two tanks (Orisa and Zarya) are the direct counters of the tanks YOU play, not that they are the “meta”.
                    First off that’s around 4 hours. And it’s 24 games maximum, so get your math right dumbass. And doom imo is much more enjoyable to face than the goddamn horse. Much more enjoyable to play too. Orisa has 2 cc abilities that fuck over hog, ram, rein, ball, Queen and Winston and sig to an extent. Fortify is busted, and Zarya is the only counter to orisa.
                        But what does that have to do with them being the “meta”? And no, my math is not off. Average game in comp is 15-20 min. Multiply that by 24 and divide by 60 to get hours. But I don’t know what I expected from a dummy from Reddit. The statement “they are the meta” just because they counter you is wrong. Again, that is YOUR experience, not mine. I get more divers than the horse herself. And guess what, I lose more against a Dva or a Doom being a support than by Zarya or Orisa. Orisa is cake if your supports go Zen (which I do). Zarya is easy to deal with as well if your party has some brain cells and just burn her after second bubble. Again you see them more because of the heroes you play, but by far the meta right now is either Junker Queen or Dva. What rank are you btw? By the sounds of it you’re either bronze or low gold.
                            I play a lot more qp. It’s roughly 10 minutes per game. And when a tank counters practically all others, they are meta. When only one tank counters the previously mentioned tank, they are meta. JQ and dva may be viable, but the meta is Zarya and orisa, it’s playing until 1 tank swaps orisa, then the other tank swaps to Zarya to counter. And I’m speaking as a tank, the meta for tanks is Zarya and orisa. Also wtf do ranks have to do with anything, almost universally orisa and Zarya are top picks right now.
                        Oh! I get it, you say 24 games in QP! No wonder you don’t know shit what the “meta” is.
                            Bro I can't even rn, orisa and zarya are much stronger than the rest of the tank roster. Orisa is used in almost every single game, throughout the entirety of comp, and zarya is the only counter to orisa. Other tanks are viable, but those two are 100% meta and if you think otherwise you have no clue what you're talking about.
                    Orisa also counters Rein, Dva (to an extent), Roadhog, really every tank except for Zarya and *maybe* Sigma but that’s me reaching
Less damage, less healing, totally agree.
In fact they both have a 'not die' button available to them which specifically doesn't hamper their ability to fight.

Rein, Sigma, Doom and punchy-Ram all have to sit in their stance, the latter two having a recharge to put their arms in front of their face apparently. Sigma at least gets the defense from *most* attacks along with a temp buff after the fact which singles him out of these four, AND he's got the option of a floating shield when necessary.

Hog is stuck filling his gob with healing goop the whole time.

Winston has bugger-all health and has a shield that basically only protects him from everything you're not currently in your weapon's range of, so everything you're NOT currently engaging with your static shocks.

Ball's and Queen's not die buttons are far more fleeting, especially if the DPSs are on the case or one of the game's few remaining stuns scrambles their escape.

And D.Va's shield is fine for projectiles and she can still kind of fight with it up, but shame if you're against beams or melees.
You're not allowed to say that around here.
She wasn’t good after the initial late season 1 nerf.
    She wasn’t bad though, zarya has never been bad in ow2 sure she has had times where she wasn’t good but she has never been a bad character
        She has been the 2nd worse tank for a long time before the buff and will go back to be after the nerf in season 7.

She is just easily countered by a lot of other tanks (Doom, Winston, Rein, Sigma) and has 0 vertical mobility.

She’s just good to farm in low elos.
            You can’t effectively play doom a lot of the time due to his numerous counters. Winston has sucked most this games life due to counters being good same with rein. So sigma mostly has been the counter play to zarya and then what? Cant rock her because you bubble projectile weapon easy bubble sure you have a shield but when that gets shredded by bastions and everything else she just shoots you through your grasp. Even if you still make it through all of this as sigma against zarya what do you do when the rest of her team swaps to counter you?
I like this alot as long as they balance the tanks, if they did this update and nothing else right now Orisa would literally break the game even more than she already has lol
    Yeah it would have to be a huge overhaul to implement
Also all of the OW1 tanks were made with 2 tanks in mind. We got main and off tanks
Dont worry, blizz will bring back ow classic in 2 years and call it a new game lmao
    Full $70 dollar price as well! But don't worry, purchasing that also includes the first battlepass for FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
        and also coins which you can shove up your ass
No it's not. Did you even play OW1? The tank role was the least popular role for years, the queue for DPS was like 20 times longer. It sucked to play, and it sucked to play against. Go back and watch some OW1 gameplay and tell me how fun it was to shoot at tanks and shields all game. 

And you seem to forget that if you introduce another tank to OW2 they will need to nerf their damage again. Tanks right now they are like a beefy dps, adding one more without a substantial nerf to dmg would break the game. So what would tanks become then? Less tanky than OW1 and the same low damage. Dude that sounds so fun to play!!!

Let's hear your "2-3 different solutions".
    >No it's not. Did you even play OW1?

Yes it would, and yes I did. I have thousands of hours of playing ow1

>The tank role was the least popular role for years, the queue for DPS was like 20 times longer. It sucked to play, and it sucked to play against.

The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is. Also, the queue times argument is invalid because ow1 was not f2p like ow2 is, so it's not gonna have the same amount of players like ow2 has. Not to mention the fact that it is easier to assemble a team with 5v5 than with 6v6. Even having an f2p 5v5 format, ow2 is having a hard time finding tank players lol. Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about.

>Go back and watch some OW1 gameplay and tell me how fun it was to shoot at tanks and shields all game. 

I have clips of my own, and I have played ow2 for 6 months so I can confidently say ow1 is better in EVERY WAY.

>And you seem to forget that if you introduce another tank to OW2 they will need to nerf their damage again.

That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

>Less tanky than OW1 and the same low damage. Dude that sounds so fun to play!!!

I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1.

>Let's hear your "2-3 different solutions".

Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that
        >The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is. Also, the queue times argument is invalid because ow1 was not f2p like ow2 is, so it's not gonna have the same amount of players like ow2 has.

Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about. 

The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Ofc the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 

Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case.  This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

>That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

So why did you not mention it? Sounds to me like you did not realize it. Because I can tell you this, the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play. Being a bullet sponge with no damage is not fun for 99% of the playerbase. 

>I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1. 

Lmao, really? You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance. And you think **I** have a skill issue? Are you trolling or just bad?  

> Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that 

What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me".  

Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If **that's** your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 

And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.

It's funny how everytime someone demands 6v6 they say "it's so easy to fix", and then they don't actually have a fix at all. If you liked OW1's slower gameplay more, that's great, you are entitled to your opinion. But don't act like it's some sort of solution, because it's not.
            >The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Of course, the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 


Of course it was BECAUSE THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!! It's going to be the most popular because players were testing out the new format. Once tank players realized how dodo the role was after playing it for a while, it became just as low as ow1 because most of em quit. And It's not saying a lot because it went f2p, which means more players

>Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case. This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

That was never really the case in ow1 either unless you were in the high ranks. In my experience as a tank player in mastes, I only had to wait 5-8 minutes on average throughout the lifespan of ow1. If tank players are already quitting a year into ow2, then imagine what it's gonna be like in another year.

>So why did you not mention it?

Because anyone with a functioning brain cell would know that the tanks would need to revert back to their ow1 states. Hence, why it would go without saying. Nobody wants ow2 tanks as they r now in a 6v6 format. 

>the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play.

Tell that to the thousands of tank players that are saying the role is horrible. I can link you to multiple different videos showing you just that.

>You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance

Less mechanical skill??? You had the nerve to accuse me of not playing ow1 when this is whatchu think? Tank duos relied on tank synergies, which requires MECHANICAL SKILL lmao I'm dead as hell. Relying more on individual performance as a tank player is exactly why I said it doesn't feel like ow anymore because in ow1, it was all about TEAMWORK!! Now it's about who can counter swap who and how much healing supports can mindlessly pump into one tank. Idc about not having less cover if we have what I mentioned above.

>What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me". 


Did I say anything about standing behind shields? If the devs weren't so damn dense and didn't abandon ow1, we wouldn't have had to deal with that oppressive double shield meta for so long.

Option 1) Divide tanks into off tank and main tank. This is the safest option because it automatically removes double shield while allowing all tanks to be viable. I've seen a lot of players suggest this.

Option 2) give hog 1.5 - 2× more damage against shields when their are more than 1 in play. This allows hog to be a great counter to double shield and gives more usage than just punishing bad positioning. I came up with this one.

Option 3) nerf tf out of all the shields. If there's more than 1 shield on the field, then their health gets dropped in half. 

The first option is obviously the best, but the other two could easily destroy the double shield meta.

>Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If that's your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 


Tanks Reverting back to their original state alone would not be what fixes 6v6 smh🤦‍♂️ it would take multiple other changes to make it work, but it'll ultimately be easier to fix than 5v5.

And 6 years of tank being bad? Yea, you didn't play ow1 lol there's no way. Tank was not bad for that long because Sig, Orisa, and Brig were not in the game until years later.I don't remember what their exact release dates were, but it wasn't until later.

>And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.


Fun? As in mindlessly pumping heals into a single tank and have a bunch of get outta jail free card abilities that doesn't require much skill to use? Yea, that sounds like fun lol let's make ow require less skill and take away the tank experience to make everyone feel welcomed.
So you mean bring back 6v6?
    Yep
        Man, I wish they would.
Never going to happen. Much more productive to have a conversation about improving 5v5
    Imagine seeing a valid argument and going I don't wanna talk about that let's just talk about changes I'd like to see. Reddit at its finest, never change
        Yeah in the meantime let's talk about 7v7 and 232 comps.

Imagine screaming into the ether for a dev team to make a change they don't have the resources for, nor the playerbase to justify (sadly not enough tank players for 6v6 imo)

Never change.
        I am not sure you know what the word “argument” means.  This is just straight up an unproductive opinion.  At least the other dude is trying to be constructive, not saying I agree or disagree with either.
Play open queue. Got 2 tanks, 2 supports, 1 dps

Done
    You're not living unless you're playing Mystery Heroes friend.
        Mystery heroes is good, not only because it's fun but because it teaches huge amounts of game sense in the process. You have to prioritize keeping yourself alive a lot more than in qp and especially for lower MMR players it can change the way you think about the game completely.
As a mainly quickplay player, my only issue with two tanks is how often two off-tanks would get picked. Few people wanted to play shield tank.
    Shield doesn't equal main tank. 

But I just want a meta where I can play rein and it not be a throw pick 😔
        That I can agree with. Tanks need help, but I just don't think two tanks is necessarily the answer.
Nah being support is way less stressful
    Dunno, I'm support main, but I often dabble in tank for funsies, especially if I queue with two other friends who are also amazing supports and i'm having fun.

I find it less stressful. I just pewpew or bonkbonk and contest point and save their booties.

After, i'm quite a flex tank, I'm playing decently Rein/Orisa/Zarya/Ball/Sigma/JQ/Rammatra . AND I'm queing with friends that I know are great supports and who have my back and knows their jobs.

&#x200B;

BUT soloQ tank isn't the same at all in term of experience, and maybe more stressful, in the sense that supports are randomized ? You may have amazing ones, or supports who queue with DPS and let you die non stop because they just want to pocket their friend. In that sense, it is annoying AF.

BUT I still find it more frustrating than stressful. Supoort feels more stressful, between the pressure of keeping anyone alive AND being flanked non stop AND 95% of the time, not having anyone to peel for you.
        Yeah I don’t even bother with tank. I used to play DPS mostly. When I play illari or bap I feel like a (better tbh) DPS that has way more utility that can dictate the fight. When I play DPS no matter how many picks I get or how accurate I am I don’t feel like I have much control
            For me the issue, as a support main, is that i see more and more dps player picking support, just to DPS with them and ignoring healing the whole team, just focusing on killing. AND THAT'S SO ANNOYING ARGHHHHH
                I feel like juggling the two isn’t hard but I don’t think it should be too far in one style
                    Yup. There's a large middle between heal botting and plain ingoring your whole team to just self healing and do DPS. Albeit heal botting is more tolerable than being selfish tbh.
                        Yeah like I have plenty of games on support where we have more damage than the other supports but less healing, but it’s also because they are taking more damage than we are. Even when I was DPS I would rather have an Ana who throws big antis or a bap that throws good lamps whilst helping me get picks than a lifeweaver heal botting. Because the latter makes matches feel like a stalemate

I think positioning is more important as a support making sure everyone is in your line of sight because you can just inflate your numbers healbotting an out position tank and ignoring your other teammates
I'm not personally a zarya fan but do enjoy those last minute bubble saves, especially when you throw it on a teammate rig HR before rein smashes them into a wall. She does always feel like the final destination in the tank counter game so they seem slightly less effected by meta compared to some other tanks. This season especially feels like Rock, Paper, Zarya
    Lol thats why people play meta. Winning is the most fun
Leave hp pools till dmg and heal nerf to see how it feels imo
    Couldn't agree more
        Ya just too much at once with too much of a chance fucking everything up
Agreed about healing
Maybe better to let supports have less healing so the goal will be accomplished in that way?
    Because if you nerf heals on all supports then some of them won't be viable at all. How much slower do you need Zen and Lucio to be at healing without an ult or skill. Rather deal more damage than heal at all at that point. People are saying supports have too much sustain and utility to survive, so make the stakes higher by increasing tank damage so tanks can more easily bait out the utility and CD. Make their utility and CDs more skill heavy. 

Buffing damage on tanks lets tanks brawl each other. Lowering heals is just the same situation as now just faster. Might even see antiheal become even more powerful. Would lower heals promote aggressive or safer playing is a good question though.
Its a lot of fun when you can play but it's certainly not fine unless we're using the argument that tank is fine the other roles have just crept a bit too much
Play ball, embrace the hampter chad
For the orb of discord you can make it something like this

**Orb of DiscordE**

  
**Type** Ability  
**Effect Type** Targeted  
*Launch this orb at an enemy to increase the damage they take.*

**Damage**:  
\+25% [damage received](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_amplification) for Damage and Supports 

\+15% [damage received](https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_amplification) for tanks

  
**Ammo**:  
One active  
**Duration**:  
0.1 seconds (if out of sight)  
**Max. range**:  
25 meters  
**Projectile speed**:  
50 meters per second

this would make discord orb less effective against tanks and make it harder to keep up at all times

for sleep dart, there isn't really more we can do there it already does less against tanks 

for soldiers nerf, decrease the healing from his selfheal

for orisa spin to no longer do the lil boop, that is that

ram punch i dont think should be reduced damage through shields but i can see your point, about nade just make its effect be 1,5 sec longer (5,5 sec total) but only 1,5 seconds of this is actually no heals, for the remaining 4 seconds we make the anti heal go from a 100% negation to maybe 25% to make it still very valuable to hit a fat nade, but less of a tank instant death button
I saw someone suggest anti nade should reduce healing by 100% for 1 second and it reduces by 25% every second after that and honestly that seemed perfect to still allow it to be useful to secure elims or force someone out but also making it reasonable to survive without a cleanse.

Sleep dart having reduced effectiveness on tanks should be how most cc is when it hits tanks imo. Because they only have 1 person to eat it all and if they are trying to get elims being the 600 hp character with usually the largest hit box that everyone focuses they need some way to actually engage and only orisa really has that right now and its so boring. Tanks get chain cc’d the moment they try to play the game because its optimal to bully them now since there is only 1. Sure the supports can help the tank survive but just sitting and waiting for someone else to let you have fun isnt good.
    i like the take on nade, good solution :)
Lol ikr and supports are so weak they need double the health and healing they have right now and damage need double the damage they have and tanks shouldnt have more than 200 health, why should they have more health it's abusive

Didn't they reduce it from 5 to 4 secs?
Sure if used improperly.
I think they meant have the ability to counter the tank roster with relative comfort, like just having the mobility to run away from dive or stuff like sleep/anti
    Ye
Wym? His ult? That really doesn’t seem like a good trade, Zarya has 2 cleanses on cooldown, what does doom have?
    You say that the meta is dominated by just Zarya and Orisa, but Orisa is mostly selected because she’s a counter to doom. Doom lobbies have been pretty abundant since the last patch, and his survivability was strongly increased since block now absorbs all types of damage. The cc with every and any punch ain’t a joke either. I’m obviously talking about my own experience, but I’ve had more matches than I can count with either a Dva (which is also broken atm since she can be flying every 3 seconds, not to mention eats nades, ults, cc, etc) or a Doomfist. Orisa is the counter for those 2 and Zarya is the counter to Orisa. So the 2 you said are not the only ones dominating the meta. How many games have you been playing per day?
        Orisa counters most tanks, not just Doom.
        A couple dozen, I have stuff to do for the majority of the day, and I primarily play sig and ram. Almost every time I play ram an orisa is swapped to, same thing with sig, with Zarya instead
            Couple dozen is 24, and you say “I have stuff to do the majority of the day” lol. That puts you around 6-8 hours of gameplay daily. So either you’re lying in one or the other. And yes, because those two tanks (Orisa and Zarya) are the direct counters of the tanks YOU play, not that they are the “meta”.
                First off that’s around 4 hours. And it’s 24 games maximum, so get your math right dumbass. And doom imo is much more enjoyable to face than the goddamn horse. Much more enjoyable to play too. Orisa has 2 cc abilities that fuck over hog, ram, rein, ball, Queen and Winston and sig to an extent. Fortify is busted, and Zarya is the only counter to orisa.
                    But what does that have to do with them being the “meta”? And no, my math is not off. Average game in comp is 15-20 min. Multiply that by 24 and divide by 60 to get hours. But I don’t know what I expected from a dummy from Reddit. The statement “they are the meta” just because they counter you is wrong. Again, that is YOUR experience, not mine. I get more divers than the horse herself. And guess what, I lose more against a Dva or a Doom being a support than by Zarya or Orisa. Orisa is cake if your supports go Zen (which I do). Zarya is easy to deal with as well if your party has some brain cells and just burn her after second bubble. Again you see them more because of the heroes you play, but by far the meta right now is either Junker Queen or Dva. What rank are you btw? By the sounds of it you’re either bronze or low gold.
                        I play a lot more qp. It’s roughly 10 minutes per game. And when a tank counters practically all others, they are meta. When only one tank counters the previously mentioned tank, they are meta. JQ and dva may be viable, but the meta is Zarya and orisa, it’s playing until 1 tank swaps orisa, then the other tank swaps to Zarya to counter. And I’m speaking as a tank, the meta for tanks is Zarya and orisa. Also wtf do ranks have to do with anything, almost universally orisa and Zarya are top picks right now.
                    Oh! I get it, you say 24 games in QP! No wonder you don’t know shit what the “meta” is.
                        Bro I can't even rn, orisa and zarya are much stronger than the rest of the tank roster. Orisa is used in almost every single game, throughout the entirety of comp, and zarya is the only counter to orisa. Other tanks are viable, but those two are 100% meta and if you think otherwise you have no clue what you're talking about.
                Orisa also counters Rein, Dva (to an extent), Roadhog, really every tank except for Zarya and *maybe* Sigma but that’s me reaching
She wasn’t bad though, zarya has never been bad in ow2 sure she has had times where she wasn’t good but she has never been a bad character
    She has been the 2nd worse tank for a long time before the buff and will go back to be after the nerf in season 7.

She is just easily countered by a lot of other tanks (Doom, Winston, Rein, Sigma) and has 0 vertical mobility.

She’s just good to farm in low elos.
        You can’t effectively play doom a lot of the time due to his numerous counters. Winston has sucked most this games life due to counters being good same with rein. So sigma mostly has been the counter play to zarya and then what? Cant rock her because you bubble projectile weapon easy bubble sure you have a shield but when that gets shredded by bastions and everything else she just shoots you through your grasp. Even if you still make it through all of this as sigma against zarya what do you do when the rest of her team swaps to counter you?
Yeah it would have to be a huge overhaul to implement
Full $70 dollar price as well! But don't worry, purchasing that also includes the first battlepass for FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
    and also coins which you can shove up your ass
>No it's not. Did you even play OW1?

Yes it would, and yes I did. I have thousands of hours of playing ow1

>The tank role was the least popular role for years, the queue for DPS was like 20 times longer. It sucked to play, and it sucked to play against.

The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is. Also, the queue times argument is invalid because ow1 was not f2p like ow2 is, so it's not gonna have the same amount of players like ow2 has. Not to mention the fact that it is easier to assemble a team with 5v5 than with 6v6. Even having an f2p 5v5 format, ow2 is having a hard time finding tank players lol. Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about.

>Go back and watch some OW1 gameplay and tell me how fun it was to shoot at tanks and shields all game. 

I have clips of my own, and I have played ow2 for 6 months so I can confidently say ow1 is better in EVERY WAY.

>And you seem to forget that if you introduce another tank to OW2 they will need to nerf their damage again.

That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

>Less tanky than OW1 and the same low damage. Dude that sounds so fun to play!!!

I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1.

>Let's hear your "2-3 different solutions".

Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that
    >The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point?

Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about. 

The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Ofc the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 

Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case.  This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

>That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

So why did you not mention it? Sounds to me like you did not realize it. Because I can tell you this, the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play. Being a bullet sponge with no damage is not fun for 99% of the playerbase. 

>I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1. 

Lmao, really? You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance. And you think **I** have a skill issue? Are you trolling or just bad?  

> Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that 

What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me".  

Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If **that's** your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 

And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.

It's funny how everytime someone demands 6v6 they say "it's so easy to fix", and then they don't actually have a fix at all. If you liked OW1's slower gameplay more, that's great, you are entitled to your opinion. But don't act like it's some sort of solution, because it's not.
        >The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Of course, the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 


Of course it was BECAUSE THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!! It's going to be the most popular because players were testing out the new format. Once tank players realized how dodo the role was after playing it for a while, it became just as low as ow1 because most of em quit. And It's not saying a lot because it went f2p, which means more players

>Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case. This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

That was never really the case in ow1 either unless you were in the high ranks. In my experience as a tank player in mastes, I only had to wait 5-8 minutes on average throughout the lifespan of ow1. If tank players are already quitting a year into ow2, then imagine what it's gonna be like in another year.

>So why did you not mention it?

Because anyone with a functioning brain cell would know that the tanks would need to revert back to their ow1 states. Hence, why it would go without saying. Nobody wants ow2 tanks as they r now in a 6v6 format. 

>the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play.

Tell that to the thousands of tank players that are saying the role is horrible. I can link you to multiple different videos showing you just that.

>You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance

Less mechanical skill??? You had the nerve to accuse me of not playing ow1 when this is whatchu think? Tank duos relied on tank synergies, which requires MECHANICAL SKILL lmao I'm dead as hell. Relying more on individual performance as a tank player is exactly why I said it doesn't feel like ow anymore because in ow1, it was all about TEAMWORK!! Now it's about who can counter swap who and how much healing supports can mindlessly pump into one tank. Idc about not having less cover if we have what I mentioned above.

>What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me". 


Did I say anything about standing behind shields? If the devs weren't so damn dense and didn't abandon ow1, we wouldn't have had to deal with that oppressive double shield meta for so long.

Option 1) Divide tanks into off tank and main tank. This is the safest option because it automatically removes double shield while allowing all tanks to be viable. I've seen a lot of players suggest this.

Option 2) give hog 1.5 - 2× more damage against shields when their are more than 1 in play. This allows hog to be a great counter to double shield and gives more usage than just punishing bad positioning. I came up with this one.

Option 3) nerf tf out of all the shields. If there's more than 1 shield on the field, then their health gets dropped in half. 

The first option is obviously the best, but the other two could easily destroy the double shield meta.

>Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If that's your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 


Tanks Reverting back to their original state alone would not be what fixes 6v6 smh🤦‍♂️ it would take multiple other changes to make it work, but it'll ultimately be easier to fix than 5v5.

And 6 years of tank being bad? Yea, you didn't play ow1 lol there's no way. Tank was not bad for that long because Sig, Orisa, and Brig were not in the game until years later.I don't remember what their exact release dates were, but it wasn't until later.

>And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.


Fun? As in mindlessly pumping heals into a single tank and have a bunch of get outta jail free card abilities that doesn't require much skill to use? Yea, that sounds like fun lol let's make ow require less skill and take away the tank experience to make everyone feel welcomed.
Yep

JQ and dva may be viable, but the meta is Zarya and orisa, it’s playing until 1 tank swaps orisa, then the other tank swaps to Zarya to counter. And I’m speaking as a tank, the meta for tanks is Zarya and orisa. Also wtf do ranks have to do with anything, almost universally orisa and Zarya are top picks right now.
                Oh! I get it, you say 24 games in QP! No wonder you don’t know shit what the “meta” is.
                    Bro I can't even rn, orisa and zarya are much stronger than the rest of the tank roster. Orisa is used in almost every single game, throughout the entirety of comp, and zarya is the only counter to orisa. Other tanks are viable, but those two are 100% meta and if you think otherwise you have no clue what you're talking about.
            Orisa also counters Rein, Dva (to an extent), Roadhog, really every tank except for Zarya and *maybe* Sigma but that’s me reaching
She has been the 2nd worse tank for a long time before the buff and will go back to be after the nerf in season 7.

She is just easily countered by a lot of other tanks (Doom, Winston, Rein, Sigma) and has 0 vertical mobility.

She’s just good to farm in low elos.
    You can’t effectively play doom a lot of the time due to his numerous counters. Winston has sucked most this games life due to counters being good same with rein. So sigma mostly has been the counter play to zarya and then what? Cant rock her because you bubble projectile weapon easy bubble sure you have a shield but when that gets shredded by bastions and everything else she just shoots you through your grasp. Even if you still make it through all of this as sigma against zarya what do you do when the rest of her team swaps to counter you?
and also coins which you can shove up your ass
>The tank role is the least popular role now in ow2, so what's your point? Ow2 has only been out for about a year, and tank players are already coming out and expressing how shit their experience is. Also, the queue times argument is invalid because ow1 was not f2p like ow2 is, so it's not gonna have the same amount of players like ow2 has. Not to mention the fact that 5v5 is easier to assemble a team than 6v6. Even having an f2p 5v5 format, ow2 is having a hard time finding tank players lol. Playing against a non double shield tank duo was the best experience for tank players, so idk wth you're talking about. 

The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Ofc the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 

Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case.  This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

>That goes without saying. Obviously they would need to nerf the tanks back to their original stats. And nerf Ram and Queen to some extent. It shouldn't just stop at nerfing tanks. They would need to nerf supports as well. Otherwise, we would be back at quare one. 

So why did you not mention it? Sounds to me like you did not realize it. Because I can tell you this, the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play. Being a bullet sponge with no damage is not fun for 99% of the playerbase. 

>I'm sensing a skill issue here lmao but nobody said anything about being less tanky than ow1. 

Lmao, really? You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance. And you think **I** have a skill issue? Are you trolling or just bad?  

> Let's see you try and tackle what I said first, and then we'll talk about that 

What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me".  

Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If **that's** your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 

And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.

It's funny how everytime someone demands 6v6 they say "it's so easy to fix", and then they don't actually have a fix at all. If you liked OW1's slower gameplay more, that's great, you are entitled to your opinion. But don't act like it's some sort of solution, because it's not.
    >The tank role was the most popular role when OW2 got released by far, and that's saying something. 1 year later and the two newest heroes are support, and dps has both more to choose from and more fps-type heroes. Of course, the tank role is not as popular as if first was. Still, the queue times are basically the same between all roles. Not even close to how bad it was in OW1. 


Of course it was BECAUSE THE GAME JUST CAME OUT!!! It's going to be the most popular because players were testing out the new format. Once tank players realized how dodo the role was after playing it for a while, it became just as low as ow1 because most of em quit. And It's not saying a lot because it went f2p, which means more players

>Even if you have more people playing now, it should still be a big difference in queue times if one role was way less popular than the rest, but that's not the case. This was one of the reasons why they went with 5v5 instead of 6v6, and it's working!

That was never really the case in ow1 either unless you were in the high ranks. In my experience as a tank player in mastes, I only had to wait 5-8 minutes on average throughout the lifespan of ow1. If tank players are already quitting a year into ow2, then imagine what it's gonna be like in another year.

>So why did you not mention it?

Because anyone with a functioning brain cell would know that the tanks would need to revert back to their ow1 states. Hence, why it would go without saying. Nobody wants ow2 tanks as they r now in a 6v6 format. 

>the reason why tanks are more popular in OW2 is because they have more dmg, and so are more fun to play.

Tell that to the thousands of tank players that are saying the role is horrible. I can link you to multiple different videos showing you just that.

>You are asking to go back to a game that demands less use of natural cover, less mechanical skill, and are less reliant on individual performance

Less mechanical skill??? You had the nerve to accuse me of not playing ow1 when this is whatchu think? Tank duos relied on tank synergies, which requires MECHANICAL SKILL lmao I'm dead as hell. Relying more on individual performance as a tank player is exactly why I said it doesn't feel like ow anymore because in ow1, it was all about TEAMWORK!! Now it's about who can counter swap who and how much healing supports can mindlessly pump into one tank. Idc about not having less cover if we have what I mentioned above.

>What is there to tackle? Your rambling can be summarized to: "I want to afk behind shields again, ow2 is too hard for me". 


Did I say anything about standing behind shields? If the devs weren't so damn dense and didn't abandon ow1, we wouldn't have had to deal with that oppressive double shield meta for so long.

Option 1) Divide tanks into off tank and main tank. This is the safest option because it automatically removes double shield while allowing all tanks to be viable. I've seen a lot of players suggest this.

Option 2) give hog 1.5 - 2× more damage against shields when their are more than 1 in play. This allows hog to be a great counter to double shield and gives more usage than just punishing bad positioning. I came up with this one.

Option 3) nerf tf out of all the shields. If there's more than 1 shield on the field, then their health gets dropped in half. 

The first option is obviously the best, but the other two could easily destroy the double shield meta.

>Saying tanks should go back to the same state as OW1 is a hilariously bad take. If that's your solution just look at OW1... Dude we had 6 years of tanks being in a miserable state, a state that made the game boring to play for everyone, and most of all, boring for tanks themselves. 


Tanks Reverting back to their original state alone would not be what fixes 6v6 smh🤦‍♂️ it would take multiple other changes to make it work, but it'll ultimately be easier to fix than 5v5.

And 6 years of tank being bad? Yea, you didn't play ow1 lol there's no way. Tank was not bad for that long because Sig, Orisa, and Brig were not in the game until years later.I don't remember what their exact release dates were, but it wasn't until later.

>And yes, as you said, supports would need a nerf as well. The 5v5 format enabled Blizz to make them more impactful (aka fun). But yes, let's make them boring again.


Fun? As in mindlessly pumping heals into a single tank and have a bunch of get outta jail free card abilities that doesn't require much skill to use? Yea, that sounds like fun lol let's make ow require less skill and take away the tank experience to make everyone feel welcomed.
Man, I wish they would.
Yeah in the meantime let's talk about 7v7 and 232 comps.

Imagine screaming into the ether for a dev team to make a change they don't have the resources for, nor the playerbase to justify (sadly not enough tank players for 6v6 imo)

Never change.
I am not sure you know what the word “argument” means.  This is just straight up an unproductive opinion.  At least the other dude is trying to be constructive, not saying I agree or disagree with either.
Mystery heroes is good, not only because it's fun but because it teaches huge amounts of game sense in the process. You have to prioritize keeping yourself alive a lot more than in qp and especially for lower MMR players it can change the way you think about the game completely.
That I can agree with. Tanks need help, but I just don't think two tanks is necessarily the answer.
Yeah I don’t even bother with tank. I used to play DPS mostly. When I play illari or bap I feel like a (better tbh) DPS that has way more utility that can dictate the fight. When I play DPS no matter how many picks I get or how accurate I am I don’t feel like I have much control
    For me the issue, as a support main, is that i see more and more dps player picking support, just to DPS with them and ignoring healing the whole team, just focusing on killing. AND THAT'S SO ANNOYING ARGHHHHH
        I feel like juggling the two isn’t hard but I don’t think it should be too far in one style
            Yup. There's a large middle between heal botting and plain ingoring your whole team to just self healing and do DPS. Albeit heal botting is more tolerable than being selfish tbh.
                Yeah like I have plenty of games on support where we have more damage than the other supports but less healing, but it’s also because they are taking more damage than we are. Even when I was DPS I would rather have an Ana who throws big antis or a bap that throws good lamps whilst helping me get picks than a lifeweaver heal botting. Because the latter makes matches feel like a stalemate

I think positioning is more important as a support making sure everyone is in your line of sight because you can just inflate your numbers healbotting an out position tank and ignoring your other teammates
Ya just too much at once with too much of a chance fucking everything up

Orisa counters most tanks, not just Doom.
A couple dozen, I have stuff to do for the majority of the day, and I primarily play sig and ram. Almost every time I play ram an orisa is swapped to, same thing with sig, with Zarya instead
    Couple dozen is 24, and you say “I have stuff to do the majority of the day” lol. That puts you around 6-8 hours of gameplay daily. So either you’re lying in one or the other. And yes, because those two tanks (Orisa and Zarya) are the direct counters of the tanks YOU play, not that they are the “meta”.
        First off that’s around 4 hours. And it’s 24 games maximum, so get your math right dumbass. And doom imo is much more enjoyable to face than the goddamn horse. Much more enjoyable to play too. Orisa has 2 cc abilities that fuck over hog, ram, rein, ball, Queen and Winston and sig to an extent. Fortify is busted, and Zarya is the only counter to orisa.
            But what does that have to do with them being the “meta”? And no, my math is not off. Average game in comp is 15-20 min. Multiply that by 24 and divide by 60 to get hours. But I don’t know what I expected from a dummy from Reddit. The statement “they are the meta” just because they counter you is wrong. Again, that is YOUR experience, not mine. I get more divers than the horse herself. And guess what, I lose more against a Dva or a Doom being a support than by Zarya or Orisa. Orisa is cake if your supports go Zen (which I do). Zarya is easy to deal with as well if your party has some brain cells and just burn her after second bubble. Again you see them more because of the heroes you play, but by far the meta right now is either Junker Queen or Dva. What rank are you btw? By the sounds of it you’re either bronze or low gold.
