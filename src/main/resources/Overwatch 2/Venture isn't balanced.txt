[[Venture isn't balanced]]


Venture needs to be nerfed. Thats it. Thats the post. Braindead character.

Shouldve been a tank. They get too much shield HP from their abilities which have too short of a cooldown. Why is drill dash half the cooldown time whennused underground?

Also, werent they JUST trying to remove instakills out of the game? Didnt they swap DOOM to TANK because he had too much CC? They just gave it back to another character. The amount of CC, kill potential and self sustain they have is sickening for a DPS.


How is Venture an insta kill?
    It’s not an insta kill I guess but you can combo your abilities to almost instantly kill a non tank and there’s no counterplay other than not letting them get close to you
        Or healing the target, or CCing venture, or killing venture
            And they are up shit creek without a paddle if every ability is used to secure a kill. They have to all in.

I do think they shouldn't do 70 damage a primary shot. But it's not the end of the world that they do.
                [their combo](https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1bq4js0/venture_has_a_one_shot_combo/) doesn't use ALL the abilities though. they can still burrow away after snagging a kill
                    A) That's a stationary, Non-hostile target dummy. No engagement tools required for setup. A normal player will hear and shoot you. If they don't, well they kinda deserved that.

B) The only way for that combo to kill that quickly while keeping Burrow is to primary, MELEE CANCEL into Dash and follow up with primary again. Meaning you have to be in melee distance at the beginning of the combo. Nobody is going to realistically let you do that.

Like literally don't ignore them and you are fine unless you're widow in which I'm more concerned how you got snuck up on.
                        Yeah except that most people aren’t at full health for the majority of the match. So shoot, melee, dash is enough to kill. Idk why people always want to evaluate power level in a vacuum. 100 dmg is too much for an ability that can’t be dodged or blocked, has no delay and decent range. Especially when every single other thing they do does 70+ damage too.
                            First, only burrow can do 100 damage and its at full charge and your target has to be in the center. Everything else is a flat 70 damage assuming all tick markers hit. Your "ability" you are describing is 3 actions.

Second, its really funny when people make these arguments because they always describe the scenario where they get owned like it wasn't their fault they got owned. Like you shouldn't be forward enough that venture can just dive and get you using only 1 ability. And you forgot to mention that they are an all risk reward. Most of the roster outranges them, if they want to jump on you, they should need to expend abilities and they either kill you or get killed.

Its literally no different than if a doomfist jumped your ass. He has to use all of his abilities to secure your death. If he can do it with only 1 or even none, you fucked up.
            Healing the target is not something you can do, that’s entirely relying on your team. CC exists on almost no characters outside of tanks, and ventures abilities (burst from ground and dash attack) cannot be CCd in a meaningful way anyway. Killing venture is made more difficult because she generates shields with her abilities.

It’s really easy to type word vomit on your phone, a lot harder to actually put thought into it. I still recommend you try.
                Hardly any CC outside of tanks XD?

I guess you've never heard of a sleep, bash, whip, hinder, ashe's shotgun, mine, lucio's and pharah's boops? Not to mention that Venture moves very predictable so landing skillshots such as sleep dart is relatively easy. 

I know that this is a new hero that requires adjustments in your playstyle but don't make him into new dps doomfist
                    Uh. The only one of those that actually *stops* a venture is sleep. And pharah is irrelevant because she’s already a good counter to venture. You can boop them all you want and they’ll just burrow or drill right back into your face
What? Insta kill abilities? Too much cc? Did you even look at the numbers, or does all this come from you being half hp in the enemy backline getting absolutely demolished?
So this guy sucks at the game. Maybe don’t be positioned badly and you won’t get wiped. It’s not hard to counter them.
    Read my comments under the other posts, maybe clears up some things.

I get getting punished for bad positioning, thats fine, but it isnt about that, its about how fun it is to play against them
You sir are just terrible, braindead character?? Needs a nerf?? Are you silver or plat? L take.
    I would say the aspect of actually getting the kills is kinda braindead, but the real skill is figuring out how you’re gonna escape.
    Plat yeah, but honestly, they said in multiple videos when going from ow1 to ow2 that they wanted heroes to be fun tp play and to be fun to play AGAINST. This hero is missing the mark here because it isnt fun to play against them. 20 hp? Almost gonna kill her. Drill dash, whoops your dead. 10 hp? She doesnt have drill dash? She burries herself in the fucking ground to escape for 4 seconds, regens a bit of health and gains shields PLUS you cant damage her. Do you get my point?
        I truly don’t mean this as an insult, but in my own experience, when I’m not having fun at something it’s usually cause I’m bad at it. Just gotta put yourself out there and play against them more until you can easily defeat them or at least escape. Also, something that has helped me was playing as the character I couldn’t beat. Because then you can think like them and predict their movement.
            Yeah maybe i have fallen off but i had like 6 games in a row spread over 3 days where i had leavers in comp.

Before rank reset i was diamond 3 and now plat 4 so idk if im good or bad but yeah i can play venture but i just enjoy other characters more, but i do want to win in comp.

And good thing u mentioned escape because usually what i do when someone is low i chase them but that shouldnt really be done with venture now that im thinking about it
The worst thing about this game is the part of the community that screeches about balance like they know all about it. Imagine not making a character you want to in your game because some small army of abject nitwits postulates on the internet about so-called balance and what it is and isn't.

The idea of balance has poisoned so many gamers' minds. Miss the entire forest of potential by staring at the balance tree until your fucking eyes fall out. Any time some interaction doesn't playout in their favor or isn't exactly the way they wanted it to be it all of a sudden becomes an issue of balance.

This game will never be balanced because most games just aren't because after a certain point it's a fool's errand especially for a Hero Shooter. Balance is such a misleading concept too because all you can really do is make adjustments/reworks that tip the scale in one direction or another. It's such a magical concept that gamers have deluded themselves into thinking is real.

Fully realizing the potential of the cast is way more appealing to me than holding onto some stupid idea of balance.
    Read the first bit - first of all, i am not pretending i know about balance, i dont have the numbers, i dont have the data, i am not a developer. Did i say i know all about it? No.

Maybe you are too high in your little head as well? Touch some grass, how can a post inflict so much damage to your brain? 'Screeches'? 'Abject nitwits'? Get a reality check, please.

Im just saying its super annoying to play against them. Hey if they treated everyone the same as her, go ahead. Tell me i dont know anything about balance. But the way heroes get nerfed because the community collectively hates them is insane because some heroes (example mercy) arent doing great in the numbers but still stay in a weak position because people find her annoying as hell. Nerf tf outa venture or dont. But dont do it to some of the roster as well then.

They want heroes to be fun to play against as well, they said that on multiple occasions. Thats what im calling out here. Its not fun to play against them. You can not tell me you like to get someone to 1 hp just for them to regen like 100 hp on the fly and kill you within 0.5 seconds even though you were 150 hp? If so, you are mental.

Second part - it isnt "one time something didnt go my way" she is in every single game. You dont see people playing widow in every single game, right? That was season 3, the beloved unbalanced sniper season. (It was hated to death, agony at its finest). 

Third part - this game cant be balanced, i agree with u. Doesnt mean heroes should be way too good. Did you like mauga meta? Probably, no. They fucked up at blizzard because he was TOO good. Heroes can be better than other heroes, yes, the reason why sombra can murder widowmaker to the point its unplayable for her. But sombra and widow are both somewhat balanced right now. Not peaking or over or underperforming.

4th part - fully realizing is fun if it enables players, not disables them. Every time i see venture i pick reaper because he does burst damage and is also braindead to play, i do this because other heroes simply dont work (as well as reaper) to kill venture. This stops me from playing heroes i actually enjoy.
        "i dont know about balance, but venture is NOT balanced"
    It doesn’t take a fucking data analyst to recognize when a character is oppressive against more than half of the roster. They JUST removed 1 shots from the game, and now we’ve got a character that can consistently kill you in a moment, with no opportunity for counter-play. She needs nerfed. Get over it
Venture actually needs a buff lol.
    Do you ever play a match in overwatch where she isnt on either your or the enemies team?
        That is not an indication they are broken, that is just what happens when a character is new.

The only way a character who is brand new **wouldn't** be seen in almost every game is if they were very very bad on launch, and even then, I saw a bunch of launch lifeweavers.
            Yupp, new releases are always overplayed and - to no surprise - fun heroes are always popular regardless of balancing. When mercy and genji are bottom tier they are still the most popular heroes in the game.
            That’s not what they were saying. They’re saying, if you don’t think she’s overtuned, you haven’t played against her without her on your team to balance it out.
        Please dont tell me youre using usage data of a hero that just released as indicator for balancing. That's not how this works.
I couldn't agree more.
They are actually really bad in a lot of matchups.

They are terrible against any tank not named Ramattra.


DPS that basically nullify them:


-Junkrat(Boop)


-Pharah(Outrange, Flight, Boop)


-Ashe(Boop, outrange)


-Echo(Outrange, better burst, flight)


-Reaper(Outduels, Intangible, health steal)


-Torbjörn(Healthpool, Outduels)


-Bastion(Healthpool, better burst in turret)


Supports that ruin their game plan:


-Lucio(Boop, Speed boost)


-Moira(Fade, Heal orb)


-Brigitte(Damage soak, Boop)


The issue is that if you don't play any of these heroes properly or just refuse to switch into one of them, you're going to have a pretty bad time, especially supports.
You're right, Venture isn't balanced. Complete garbage against literally anything but bad DPS and easy as hell to counterpick. Maybe 2 weeks away from being completely dunked on after the community fully acclimates
Here is my (probably awful) take. If Venture's combo isn't an issue in the game give hog back his one shot hook combo. I do think it can be balanced to make it a little less annoying and have a bit more counter-play though. I also feel like her ult charges at pulse bomb type rates which is probably a bit much.
    hog has his one shot combo though, he just needs the trap for it
        I actually would prefer them to get rid of trap and go back to it being more skill shot based
            the skill is in hitting the hook, the trap doesnt change that, but also that doesnt matter cause he has both now as the hook pulls in closer since recent buffs

That’s not what they were saying. They’re saying, if you don’t think she’s overtuned, you haven’t played against her without her on your team to balance it out.
the skill is in hitting the hook, the trap doesnt change that, but also that doesnt matter cause he has both now as the hook pulls in closer since recent buffs
[their combo](https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1bq4js0/venture_has_a_one_shot_combo/) doesn't use ALL the abilities though. they can still burrow away after snagging a kill
    A) That's a stationary, Non-hostile target dummy. No engagement tools required for setup. A normal player will hear and shoot you. If they don't, well they kinda deserved that.

B) The only way for that combo to kill that quickly while keeping Burrow is to primary, MELEE CANCEL into Dash and follow up with primary again. Meaning you have to be in melee distance at the beginning of the combo. Nobody is going to realistically let you do that.

Like literally don't ignore them and you are fine unless you're widow in which I'm more concerned how you got snuck up on.
        Yeah except that most people aren’t at full health for the majority of the match. So shoot, melee, dash is enough to kill. Idk why people always want to evaluate power level in a vacuum. 100 dmg is too much for an ability that can’t be dodged or blocked, has no delay and decent range. Especially when every single other thing they do does 70+ damage too.
            First, only burrow can do 100 damage and its at full charge and your target has to be in the center. Everything else is a flat 70 damage assuming all tick markers hit. Your "ability" you are describing is 3 actions.

Second, its really funny when people make these arguments because they always describe the scenario where they get owned like it wasn't their fault they got owned. Like you shouldn't be forward enough that venture can just dive and get you using only 1 ability. And you forgot to mention that they are an all risk reward. Most of the roster outranges them, if they want to jump on you, they should need to expend abilities and they either kill you or get killed.

Its literally no different than if a doomfist jumped your ass. He has to use all of his abilities to secure your death. If he can do it with only 1 or even none, you fucked up.
Hardly any CC outside of tanks XD?

I guess you've never heard of a sleep, bash, whip, hinder, ashe's shotgun, mine, lucio's and pharah's boops? Not to mention that Venture moves very predictable so landing skillshots such as sleep dart is relatively easy. 

I know that this is a new hero that requires adjustments in your playstyle but don't make him into new dps doomfist
    Uh. The only one of those that actually *stops* a venture is sleep. And pharah is irrelevant because she’s already a good counter to venture. You can boop them all you want and they’ll just burrow or drill right back into your face
