[[Got this insane 5k save in GM Top 500 on overtime]]





I can‚Äôt believe i just saw an entire GM team stacked together on cart like that
    The Grand masters of stoopid
        They must be the ex-Xim players
    Overtime. 

They could do this or C9, overtime is the land of mistakes but also kind of dumb af an ult like this exists when the overtime scenario is forced in nearly every match.
        Yeah please tell me how this ult and tracers pulse are supposed to be similar power levels
            They‚Äôre not?
            Tectonic Shock costs 600 more points than Pulse Bomb does and can easily be avoided by hiding behind a wall or just getting higher than it. It's also completely useless if you have a decent Rein, Ramm, or Sig on your team. And Brig can save her team as well if she pops rally. If you're playing someone like Genji, Hanzo, Pharah, Echo, basically anyone with vertical mobility you should never die to this ult. Pulse Bomb is entirely determined on skill of the player and there're only a handful of abilities that can save you. If you're playing Reaper and get pulsed with no wraith, you're dead, get pulsed as Zen with no trans, you're dead. But Shock gets negated by high ground, simple (vertical) movement abilities, or just a shield. It's like complaining about D.va Bomb when your death to bomb is entirely your fault.
        There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for the entire team to be stacked cart. Just doom lucio and maybe even moira should be enough. Cass should be playing range and venture should be diving on and off their team. This is definitely not t500
            Can only imagine they didn't see venture much yet and didn't realize it can go under the cart. Them grouping looks like an instinct to duck for cover.
                Hear me out this is supposedly ‚Äútop 500‚Äù. People at this point in ranked are representatives of the peak of Overwatch skilled play. An ‚Äúinstinct to duck for cover‚Äù should always be overwritten by the more logical choice. That is, play your role at the right range and do not stack cart ESPECIALLY after hearing someone pop their ultimate
    This is what surprised me the most. It‚Äôs something you almost never see. I wonder if the quality of the player base has dropped over the years or not.
You'll want to avoid and be wary of this one, he's a disaster. Lol...

You can clean up your socials as much as you want my bro, but history in a particular type of person has a truly horrible habit of repeating itself, and I'd learn from yours if I were you. Lol...

His inflated and frail ego can't help itself though, this won't last long, anyone who played console OW in high elo back then will remember this one. Lol...

"Irish first, black second." "GFs for boost." And so much more. He also used Gyro/Xim while he was on console, and it was obvious. Lol...

He's a collosal frail narcissist, dumb as a rock, was never truly that good and is a unmarketable disaster. Lmfaooo...



Edit: He's already deleting comments. Hilarious.

2nd Edit: He's now messaging people on ALT accounts asking if anyone saved any screenshots of his deleted comments, and he also deleted his most recent live stream and pretends he is a blizzard streamer by putting drops enabled and a fake ass tick in his stream names. O.M.L...üòÇ  ü§£

As I said, he's not going to last two years.
    Yeah, very funny how OP deleted all of his downvoted-to-the-trenches toxic rebuttals. If you're going to be a massive POS on-stream AND on Reddit the least you can do is have a spine and stand by it :0
        üíØ
        Yo, checked updated comment. Lol...
            Man that's tough because I totally started to snip and prepare screenshots of his comments for upload but gave up halfway through because I decided this chump wasn't worth the energy. It's okay though. The trash will take itself out. This guys lack of any smidge of personability is punishment enough. I only feel bad for the people queuing with him in EU :(
When u look at it from a purely mechanical perspective, it's extremely underwhelming
    That's literally this whole sub tho ? 90% of POTG posted here are just "I press Q"
        OP: "I pressed Q while the enemy was grouped on the payload"

This sub: "OMG most broken ult *ever*!"

Venture is definitely strong right now and I expect some minor nerfs to their ability or weapon damage in the midseason patch, but their ult is not the problem and most other DPS ults would have been about as effective in this scenario.
            It gets much easier to deal with imo when you start treating it like a D.va ult. Get behind the nearest shield or piece of terrain.
                You have people in this very thread arguing that the ult is busted lmao
                    I agree that it might be a little bit over tuned but I don't think it needs as big a change as some people are saying. Maybe reduce the range a bit so they actually have to go deep to get as much mileage out of it? Idk, I'm a casual player so have no idea how that would be in practice.
            Except in the case of reaper there is almost always a tank to save your ass with a spear or something‚Ä¶ 

A dva bomb is powerful in this situation but less in most others. This has range and power and less risk than something that requires you up close.
            It's just that venture has a lot, great mobility, really good damage, stupidly tanky for a dive hero, has boops and their ult is good.
The main issue the ult has is it can't be CC, I've slept Blade's and Tac's had my team mates wake them and for them only get half the ult off, Venture on the other hand... Slept woken up and still got 4 casts.

Honestly the only thing I think they need to do to them is make their shield gain need damage or nuke it to a 25. Kinda nuts that a vent has more effective health then the 300 hp auto healer reaper but maybe I'm just a stupid metal rank that doesn't know my place.
    Totally. I mean, the enemy team has no barrier and that is literally the only thing that will stop tectonic shock. This isn't impressive at all.
        Yep. Bro pressed Q, held left click, and aimed straight forward at a team that stacked up and perfectly lined up for the Ult. Literally two inputs. I'm not even hating, that was a game winning play, but come on now. This is about as impressive as a Reaper dropping down from a ledge and pressing Q for a team kill. Like yeah, you did that...congrats for playing against a team of lobotomites, I suppose.
            Which also applies to Dva, Hanzo, Soldier, Reaper, Bastion, Doomshit, Reinhardt when you play against no shield which often happens since 5V5. And many more. So what's your point ?
                All that shit is low skill cap, if you post a clip getting kills with those ults and the enemy team is braindead I will not be impressed. Learn to read
            What the hell is wrong with this sub this guy just posted a good clip, no need to be so negative about it üò≠
                ‚ÄúThis clip doesn‚Äôt have you clicking heads? TRASH!‚Äù
            Now you are exaggerating
                This is literally the exact same as those clips where reaper teleports in and hits Q. I'm just keeping it real.  No need to glaze
                    I'm not sugarcoating anything, I was literally the first to mock this clip, however your logic is simply bad. Reaper ult is just about good positioning, while this one is about good positioning plus (minor) aiming.
                        The hitbox is big as fuck. Looking directly forward and everything in your sight getting blasted is hardly what I call "aim". Junkrat tier mechanical skill
                            It's not what you call aim, but it literally and technically is aiming. Again, I'm trying to make you aware of a certain nuance since you claimed it was the same as the reaper ult, but I suppose that is futile.
                                Bro pulled out the alternative account üíÄ I'm really living in your head rent free
                                    Bro, you immediately blocked me after u replied, who's living rent-free where :DDDD
                                It is tho, it requires, literally, the same level of mechanical skill. Reaper needs to position himself to be near the enemy team and he's golden. Vulture needs to position the team in front of her and she's golden. Venture usually accomplishes this by dive but this team decided to make things easy by being braindead. Just because you see a reticle on the screen, doesn't mean there's a mechanical difference, actually THINK about what the abilities do and how they work. Now begone bronzie, I was not engaging with you in the first place, I was engaging with the guy who replied to you. You're dismissed
                                    - you reply and immediately block me. How sensitive and cute

- the guy you replied to was replying to...me, so you kinda were engaging with me

- you still don't get it. There's no way to aim with reaper ultimate, whereas there's (minor, like I said) aim involved with the venture ult

- bronzie? Hey, if you have any account on GM (PC), lemme know, maybe we can play a game together ;)
    As are all the venture plays
Thats not GM ;) I was playing with u in masters. Gr8 clip tho
    could be a masters to gm game
        Nah more like D5-M3 He was streaming too :)
            Gm you getting spawned killed in
OT here :(
            [deleted]
                Yikes üò¨
                    what did he say that caused his account to straight up get deleted?
                        He tried admitting to smurfing (most likely because he's not actually GM and was pretending to look cool on this mid ass replay), kept puffing his chest as if being GM in the porn prequel game is some big achievement, and was generally being an enormous dick all over this thread.      
     
I really can't decide what's more cringe - actually smurfing like a fucking chud and thinking that people will be ok with it, or pretending like you have a smurf account to act like you're ranked higher than you are to impress randoms on a forum.
I see OP streaming on twitch sometimes. Such a rude and toxic player, and they lie about their rank too.

Unimpressive play from a massively ballooned ego. There's a reason you're getting sectioned in these comments
    Read my comment.
Dang, OP getting called out for lying about their rank by people that have seen him stream. Can't believe someone would overlay a rank they don't even have on their UI lol
OP has the most inflated ego I have ever seen. How are you this sensible?
Congrats, but too bad the ult is busted atm. Still nice though
    The ult is busted ? It's stopped by barriers or any kind of cover, doesn't affect any character who has vertical mobility, and will even be blocked by stairs just like earth shatter. It's also not a one shot so many ults like Sound Barrier, Transcendance, Tree, or even Sym barrier or brig's big shield will counter it.

Most of the characters in the clip (Venture, doom, Lucio, Moira) only died because they couldn't be bothered to move around.

More like you can't be bothered to try and play around it lol.
        Weird take.

An ulti should counter an ulti. That is fine. Trans, beatdrop, etc. are not "a lot of counters" to tectonic shock. They counter everything in the game.

Let's compare Tectonic Shock to Shatter, which does far less damage, is blocked by barriers, applies a stun that usually is immediately undone by Suzu (a normal ability) and only goes off once. Doing a successful Shatter requires a very good timing and awareness.

Which normal ability invalidates an entire Tectonic Shock? Venture has four charges. Two are enough to kill any squishy in the game. You get immediate value and all you need to do is... *checks notes* .... "not do it into a barrier."

But sure, let's all play Dva, Echo, Pharah, Mercy, Bap as soon as Venture is in play. "Just jump out of the way."

smh
            Weird take.

> Let's compare Tectonic Shock to Shatter

Yes let's compare one of the worst tank ults that's been power crept out of relevance to a DPS ult. A better argument would be comparing it to Overclock, or other DPS ults. But it doesn't make venture sound busted now does it ?

>Which normal ability invalidates an entire Tectonic Shock?

You don't need to invalidate the entire ult you need to survive the consequent hits of burst damage. As a reminder each wave deals 130 damage, which is comparable to a direct hit from junkrat, a widow body shot, or a close range shot from Reaper with a few headshots.

The ult is countered by :

- Every shield

- every mobility ability, especially teleportations and tri-dimensional ones

- every temporary invulnerability (mei's block, venture burrow, wraith form etc)

Some individual tools such as immo field, fortify, suzu... can also help clutch it.

>You get immediate value and all you need to do is... *checks notes* .... "not do it into a barrier."

Yes just like... Most damaging ults in the game ? 


>let's all play Dva, Echo, Pharah, Mercy, Bap as soon as Venture is in play

Obvious hyperbole aside, counter-picking is a core part of the game yes

>Just jump out of the way

Yes ? If you don't want to take that simple effort everytime you hear a character loudly yelling I don't think your Winrate is gonna be anything good
        Seriously that ult is nowhere near what people make it out to be. Too many counters
            This sub can be infuriating because it's always saying the game is being streamlined, everything feels like cod, etc. But when new stuff is added it becomes clear they just don't want to adapt to something
        What are you talking about? It goes through barriers 100%, I've been hit through the walls on colosseum on multiple occasions. You also need quite a bit of clearance from the ground, I've been killed by it as mercy before I can even lift off in time
    This is in GM. Denture is a plat stomper. Her effectiveness plummets pretty quick once people dont shit themselves at the prospect of a dive character. Her ult is strong but has many ways to nullify
        Venture is good in gm bro. Not a top frag character but they are strong especially if you save right click
        I found the best way to nullify is just to shut denture down fast lmao
            Lmfao, denture üòÇ
            That is part of the nullification process yes
        Their*
            Don't shit yourself nerd
        Whether or not they shit themselves when they're getting dived doesn't change just how ridiculously strong her combo is when able to land consistently


It's like going against a doomfist that can always pull of his punch combo, it's very oppressive when done right but more so on venture due to no charge up
        lol this is BS dafran had a 90% win rate even in GM as venture
            That is Dafran, dude. Lebron plays pickup against middle schoolers energy
                There are tons of good players he plays against lmao  it's top 500 lobbies.

That was one of the highest wrs of all dpses he played and he said himself how strong venture was
Only insane thing here is a Top 500 team all sitting on the payload.¬†
I like the part where you did nothing special, stood in front of the enemy like any other hero would, pressed your ult, clicked shoot a few times while not even aiming really(just shooting forward on the objective) and managed to grab a 5k like it was nothing.

Blizz sure knows how to make low skill ceiling braindead heros‚Ä¶.. what should have been impressive turned out to be unimpressive somehow. A hero with two get outta jail free cards, pretty much endless shields and practically unmissable abilities that are overtuned as hell. Nice job blizzard lol
Their ult shouldn't hit targets that aren't on the ground
Top 500? Idk. Maybe if it was console.
Can‚Äôt wait for the inevitable ult nerf because it‚Äôs way too broken right now.
This looked effortless because it WAS effortless. You just clicked four times and that was it. The ult is somewhat busted at the moment.
    Clearly don't have a decent sig, rein, ramm, or brig on your team
    [deleted]
        You yourself decide what you post on here. I'm not denying the skill that lead ot the enemies being that helpless in this situation, but your clip doesn't display it, at least on your part. The clip doesn't show you setting up the situation. It shows you digging around the corner, pressing Q and clicking four times into an already set team that could do nothing to prevent it (which is their fault, obviously). That is what Tectonic shock will give you, as long as you're not using it into a barrier. It does a ton of damage, its easy to use, and you get four tries. Shatter isn't defined by the damage it does, but rather by the stun effect that is usually immediately undone by some Suzu. Of course shatter would have went a lot harder here because getting value from a shatter is significantly more diffcult than getting value from Tectonic shock.  
  
And I'm sorry, what has this being GM to do with any of this? This is happening on the final point of this map, like 2 meters away from game over. Where is the enemy team supposed to be but in that very spot where you can easily hit them? Silvers would have been exactly there, golds would have been exactly there, plats would have also been exactly there.

I'll happily take the downvotes, but this is just your run-of-the-mill busted ultimate highlight.
        It's a really cool clip. But the "your brain can't comphrehend the greatness of this play" attitude kinda sucks.
God that hero is so overturned they should not be in comp ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
can blizzard nerf them already
    venture is not broken lil bro maybe for low elo like you but that's it
Venture is balanced and is ready for comp /s
New overpowered hero is overpowered. News at 11.
Venture is broken.. Ult is like 5 shatters with no cool-down. Splash+ dmg makes pharaoh rockets feel like tennis balls and has unstoppable escape
All of those movement legends and not one thought let me get out the way?? Gm apparently plays like plat fr
    it is OW2 GM tho. i know people who have bought GM accounts as metal rank players and are still GM. i've also seen so many players who are like silver consistently suddenly skyrocket up to masters-gm the next season.

althought tbh i think they were so grouped up because theyd thought they had already won
This looks like one of my quickplay games, I have never played a day of ranked.
That obnoxious childish screaming already gave me braindead asshole vibes from OP even before I read the comments
Want a cookie?
haters in the comments is sad ngl

good shit üí™

yea that thing isn't overpowered at all.
Mate you play venture chillwx shes easy as fuck also stop lying
Pogchamp
Before seeing the clip I figured it was a Venture or Ilari ult¬†
Why on Earth would you think throwing ‚ÄúGM‚Äù in the title would make this impressive? You pressed Q and left click twice. A bronze could do this lol
To bad this hero is busted and plays themselves
What a save. Suprised that the enemy team was so bunched up like that but I guess that‚Äôs what OT does to a player.
Cool clip, I'd be hype too
Busted ult for a boring play ü•± 
It‚Äôs also so dumb that they‚Äôre affected by a ‚Äòground attack‚Äô while up on a floating vehicle.

Can‚Äôt wait for them to be nerfed to hell like every other recent character and for them to stop being in every single game I play.
    Aint no way the mercy flair is talking boring
        Flairs don‚Äôt mean anything? I just like Mercy?
It‚Äôd be like me saying ‚Äòoh here‚Äôs the Brig flair! How‚Äôs the paper shield going?‚Äô
            \-Mercy player talking about boring plays

The joke writes itself
                And where does it say I actually play mercy?

One can like a character and not play them, surprising, I know.
            Ain't no way the mercy flair is talking boring
    I feel like Venture Ult is like one of the most C-Tier Ults in the game. It only really works in these long and wide corridors while you have space but even then you could just push into the Venture and most likely deny it.
"insane" bruh you used a busted ult on a group. not interesting nor insane. (yes I hate venture)
    [deleted]
        this is true, I will giveth 1 upvote
Holy fucking shit! Omg blizzard ban this guy for saying curse words please. Clean up your game. Omg
um, gg? didn't understand anything that was happening so gj. a wins a win
No idea why people are calling the ult busted. It‚Äôs really only effective in situations like this. Nice play OP
Spicy flank and juggle, approved üëåüèª
    What flank? The ult comes frontal. All OP did was click.

- the guy you replied to was replying to...me, so you kinda were engaging with me

- you still don't get it. There's no way to aim with reaper ultimate, whereas there's (minor, like I said) aim involved with the venture ult

- bronzie? Hey, if you have any account on GM (PC), lemme know, maybe we can play a game together ;)
As are all the venture plays
could be a masters to gm game
    Nah more like D5-M3 He was streaming too :)
        Gm you getting spawned killed in

I really can't decide what's more cringe - actually smurfing like a fucking chud and thinking that people will be ok with it, or pretending like you have a smurf account to act like you're ranked higher than you are to impress randoms on a forum.
Read my comment.
The ult is busted ? It's stopped by barriers or any kind of cover, doesn't affect any character who has vertical mobility, and will even be blocked by stairs just like earth shatter. It's also not a one shot so many ults like Sound Barrier, Transcendance, Tree, or even Sym barrier or brig's big shield will counter it.

Most of the characters in the clip (Venture, doom, Lucio, Moira) only died because they couldn't be bothered to move around.

More like you can't be bothered to try and play around it lol.
    Weird take.

An ulti should counter an ulti. That is fine. Trans, beatdrop, etc. are not "a lot of counters" to tectonic shock. They counter everything in the game.

Let's compare Tectonic Shock to Shatter, which does far less damage, is blocked by barriers, applies a stun that usually is immediately undone by Suzu (a normal ability) and only goes off once. Doing a successful Shatter requires a very good timing and awareness.

Which normal ability invalidates an entire Tectonic Shock? Venture has four charges. Two are enough to kill any squishy in the game. You get immediate value and all you need to do is... *checks notes* .... "not do it into a barrier."

But sure, let's all play Dva, Echo, Pharah, Mercy, Bap as soon as Venture is in play. "Just jump out of the way."

smh
        Weird take.

> Let's compare Tectonic Shock to Shatter

Yes let's compare one of the worst tank ults that's been power crept out of relevance to a DPS ult. A better argument would be comparing it to Overclock, or other DPS ults. But it doesn't make venture sound busted now does it ?

>Which normal ability invalidates an entire Tectonic Shock?

You don't need to invalidate the entire ult you need to survive the consequent hits of burst damage. As a reminder each wave deals 130 damage, which is comparable to a direct hit from junkrat, a widow body shot, or a close range shot from Reaper with a few headshots.

The ult is countered by :

- Every shield

- every mobility ability, especially teleportations and tri-dimensional ones

- every temporary invulnerability (mei's block, venture burrow, wraith form etc)

Some individual tools such as immo field, fortify, suzu... can also help clutch it.

>You get immediate value and all you need to do is... *checks notes* .... "not do it into a barrier."

Yes just like... Most damaging ults in the game ? 


>let's all play Dva, Echo, Pharah, Mercy, Bap as soon as Venture is in play

Obvious hyperbole aside, counter-picking is a core part of the game yes

>Just jump out of the way

Yes ? If you don't want to take that simple effort everytime you hear a character loudly yelling I don't think your Winrate is gonna be anything good
    Seriously that ult is nowhere near what people make it out to be. Too many counters
        This sub can be infuriating because it's always saying the game is being streamlined, everything feels like cod, etc. But when new stuff is added it becomes clear they just don't want to adapt to something
    What are you talking about? It goes through barriers 100%, I've been hit through the walls on colosseum on multiple occasions. You also need quite a bit of clearance from the ground, I've been killed by it as mercy before I can even lift off in time
This is in GM. Denture is a plat stomper. Her effectiveness plummets pretty quick once people dont shit themselves at the prospect of a dive character. Her ult is strong but has many ways to nullify
    Venture is good in gm bro. Not a top frag character but they are strong especially if you save right click
    I found the best way to nullify is just to shut denture down fast lmao
        Lmfao, denture üòÇ
        That is part of the nullification process yes
    Their*
        Don't shit yourself nerd
    Whether or not they shit themselves when they're getting dived doesn't change just how ridiculously strong her combo is when able to land consistently


It's like going against a doomfist that can always pull of his punch combo, it's very oppressive when done right but more so on venture due to no charge up
    lol this is BS dafran had a 90% win rate even in GM as venture

Clearly don't have a decent sig, rein, ramm, or brig on your team

    You yourself decide what you post on here. I'm not denying the skill that lead ot the enemies being that helpless in this situation, but your clip doesn't display it, at least on your part. The clip doesn't show you setting up the situation. It shows you digging around the corner, pressing Q and clicking four times into an already set team that could do nothing to prevent it (which is their fault, obviously). That is what Tectonic shock will give you, as long as you're not using it into a barrier. It does a ton of damage, its easy to use, and you get four tries. Shatter isn't defined by the damage it does, but rather by the stun effect that is usually immediately undone by some Suzu. Of course shatter would have went a lot harder here because getting value from a shatter is significantly more diffcult than getting value from Tectonic shock.  
  
And I'm sorry, what has this being GM to do with any of this? This is happening on the final point of this map, like 2 meters away from game over. Where is the enemy team supposed to be but in that very spot where you can easily hit them? Silvers would have been exactly there, golds would have been exactly there, plats would have also been exactly there.

I'll happily take the downvotes, but this is just your run-of-the-mill busted ultimate highlight.
    It's a really cool clip. But the "your brain can't comphrehend the greatness of this play" attitude kinda sucks.
venture is not broken lil bro maybe for low elo like you but that's it
it is OW2 GM tho. i know people who have bought GM accounts as metal rank players and are still GM. i've also seen so many players who are like silver consistently suddenly skyrocket up to masters-gm the next season.

althought tbh i think they were so grouped up because theyd thought they had already won
Aint no way the mercy flair is talking boring
    Flairs don‚Äôt mean anything? I just like Mercy?

I feel like Venture Ult is like one of the most C-Tier Ults in the game. It only really works in these long and wide corridors while you have space but even then you could just push into the Venture and most likely deny it.

    this is true, I will giveth 1 upvote
What flank? The ult comes frontal. All OP did was click.
They must be the ex-Xim players
Yeah please tell me how this ult and tracers pulse are supposed to be similar power levels
    They‚Äôre not?
    Tectonic Shock costs 600 more points than Pulse Bomb does and can easily be avoided by hiding behind a wall or just getting higher than it. It's also completely useless if you have a decent Rein, Ramm, or Sig on your team. And Brig can save her team as well if she pops rally. If you're playing someone like Genji, Hanzo, Pharah, Echo, basically anyone with vertical mobility you should never die to this ult. Pulse Bomb is entirely determined on skill of the player and there're only a handful of abilities that can save you. If you're playing Reaper and get pulsed with no wraith, you're dead, get pulsed as Zen with no trans, you're dead. But Shock gets negated by high ground, simple (vertical) movement abilities, or just a shield. It's like complaining about D.va Bomb when your death to bomb is entirely your fault.
There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for the entire team to be stacked cart. Just doom lucio and maybe even moira should be enough. Cass should be playing range and venture should be diving on and off their team. This is definitely not t500
    Can only imagine they didn't see venture much yet and didn't realize it can go under the cart. Them grouping looks like an instinct to duck for cover.
        Hear me out this is supposedly ‚Äútop 500‚Äù. People at this point in ranked are representatives of the peak of Overwatch skilled play. An ‚Äúinstinct to duck for cover‚Äù should always be overwritten by the more logical choice. That is, play your role at the right range and do not stack cart ESPECIALLY after hearing someone pop their ultimate
üíØ
Yo, checked updated comment. Lol...
    Man that's tough because I totally started to snip and prepare screenshots of his comments for upload but gave up halfway through because I decided this chump wasn't worth the energy. It's okay though. The trash will take itself out. This guys lack of any smidge of personability is punishment enough. I only feel bad for the people queuing with him in EU :(
OP: "I pressed Q while the enemy was grouped on the payload"

This sub: "OMG most broken ult *ever*!"

Venture is definitely strong right now and I expect some minor nerfs to their ability or weapon damage in the midseason patch, but their ult is not the problem and most other DPS ults would have been about as effective in this scenario.
    It gets much easier to deal with imo when you start treating it like a D.va ult. Get behind the nearest shield or piece of terrain.
        You have people in this very thread arguing that the ult is busted lmao
            I agree that it might be a little bit over tuned but I don't think it needs as big a change as some people are saying. Maybe reduce the range a bit so they actually have to go deep to get as much mileage out of it? Idk, I'm a casual player so have no idea how that would be in practice.
    Except in the case of reaper there is almost always a tank to save your ass with a spear or something‚Ä¶ 

A dva bomb is powerful in this situation but less in most others. This has range and power and less risk than something that requires you up close.
    It's just that venture has a lot, great mobility, really good damage, stupidly tanky for a dive hero, has boops and their ult is good.
The main issue the ult has is it can't be CC, I've slept Blade's and Tac's had my team mates wake them and for them only get half the ult off, Venture on the other hand... Slept woken up and still got 4 casts.

Honestly the only thing I think they need to do to them is make their shield gain need damage or nuke it to a 25. Kinda nuts that a vent has more effective health then the 300 hp auto healer reaper but maybe I'm just a stupid metal rank that doesn't know my place.
Yep. Bro pressed Q, held left click, and aimed straight forward at a team that stacked up and perfectly lined up for the Ult. Literally two inputs. I'm not even hating, that was a game winning play, but come on now. This is about as impressive as a Reaper dropping down from a ledge and pressing Q for a team kill. Like yeah, you did that...congrats for playing against a team of lobotomites, I suppose.
    Which also applies to Dva, Hanzo, Soldier, Reaper, Bastion, Doomshit, Reinhardt when you play against no shield which often happens since 5V5. And many more. So what's your point ?
        All that shit is low skill cap, if you post a clip getting kills with those ults and the enemy team is braindead I will not be impressed. Learn to read
    What the hell is wrong with this sub this guy just posted a good clip, no need to be so negative about it üò≠
        ‚ÄúThis clip doesn‚Äôt have you clicking heads? TRASH!‚Äù
    Now you are exaggerating
        This is literally the exact same as those clips where reaper teleports in and hits Q. I'm just keeping it real.  No need to glaze
            I'm not sugarcoating anything, I was literally the first to mock this clip, however your logic is simply bad. Reaper ult is just about good positioning, while this one is about good positioning plus (minor) aiming.
                The hitbox is big as fuck. Looking directly forward and everything in your sight getting blasted is hardly what I call "aim". Junkrat tier mechanical skill
                    It's not what you call aim, but it literally and technically is aiming. Again, I'm trying to make you aware of a certain nuance since you claimed it was the same as the reaper ult, but I suppose that is futile.
                        Bro pulled out the alternative account üíÄ I'm really living in your head rent free
                            Bro, you immediately blocked me after u replied, who's living rent-free where :DDDD
                        It is tho, it requires, literally, the same level of mechanical skill. Reaper needs to position himself to be near the enemy team and he's golden. Vulture needs to position the team in front of her and she's golden. Venture usually accomplishes this by dive but this team decided to make things easy by being braindead. Just because you see a reticle on the screen, doesn't mean there's a mechanical difference, actually THINK about what the abilities do and how they work. Now begone bronzie, I was not engaging with you in the first place, I was engaging with the guy who replied to you. You're dismissed

You have people in this very thread arguing that the ult is busted lmao
    I agree that it might be a little bit over tuned but I don't think it needs as big a change as some people are saying. Maybe reduce the range a bit so they actually have to go deep to get as much mileage out of it? Idk, I'm a casual player so have no idea how that would be in practice.
All that shit is low skill cap, if you post a clip getting kills with those ults and the enemy team is braindead I will not be impressed. Learn to read
‚ÄúThis clip doesn‚Äôt have you clicking heads? TRASH!‚Äù
This is literally the exact same as those clips where reaper teleports in and hits Q. I'm just keeping it real.  No need to glaze
    I'm not sugarcoating anything, I was literally the first to mock this clip, however your logic is simply bad. Reaper ult is just about good positioning, while this one is about good positioning plus (minor) aiming.
        The hitbox is big as fuck. Looking directly forward and everything in your sight getting blasted is hardly what I call "aim". Junkrat tier mechanical skill
            It's not what you call aim, but it literally and technically is aiming. Again, I'm trying to make you aware of a certain nuance since you claimed it was the same as the reaper ult, but I suppose that is futile.
                Bro pulled out the alternative account üíÄ I'm really living in your head rent free
                    Bro, you immediately blocked me after u replied, who's living rent-free where :DDDD
                It is tho, it requires, literally, the same level of mechanical skill. Reaper needs to position himself to be near the enemy team and he's golden. Vulture needs to position the team in front of her and she's golden. Venture usually accomplishes this by dive but this team decided to make things easy by being braindead. Just because you see a reticle on the screen, doesn't mean there's a mechanical difference, actually THINK about what the abilities do and how they work. Now begone bronzie, I was not engaging with you in the first place, I was engaging with the guy who replied to you. You're dismissed
                    - you reply and immediately block me. How sensitive and cute

- the guy you replied to was replying to...me, so you kinda were engaging with me

- you still don't get it. There's no way to aim with reaper ultimate, whereas there's (minor, like I said) aim involved with the venture ult

- bronzie? Hey, if you have any account on GM (PC), lemme know, maybe we can play a game together ;)
Yikes üò¨
    what did he say that caused his account to straight up get deleted?
        He tried admitting to smurfing (most likely because he's not actually GM and was pretending to look cool on this mid ass replay), kept puffing his chest as if being GM in the porn prequel game is some big achievement, and was generally being an enormous dick all over this thread.      
     
I really can't decide what's more cringe - actually smurfing like a fucking chud and thinking that people will be ok with it, or pretending like you have a smurf account to act like you're ranked higher than you are to impress randoms on a forum.
There are tons of good players he plays against lmao  it's top 500 lobbies.

That was one of the highest wrs of all dpses he played and he said himself how strong venture was
And where does it say I actually play mercy?

One can like a character and not play them, surprising, I know.
