[[Where I personally believe all overwatch heroes fall on a “balance vs fun” graph]]


“Fun” vs “unfun” takes into account both playing as and playing against the character, and “unbalanced” can mean either overpowered or underpowered. Also, as melon himself would say; this is just my opinion, yall. 


I feel like having overpowered and underpowered at the top and bottom of the graph would make more sense
Never cook again.
This guy does NOT like supports
sigma mains stay winning
I feel like there’s just a tad of bias here

i think soj is pretty balanced atm 🤷🏼‍♀️
    She’s not giga busted like she was back on ow2 release, but IMO shes def a better pick than cass, ashe, hanzo and soldier who are her main competition. Probably could’ve moved her slightly up but I didn’t really have space to do so
        I can beat a soj pretty often as ashe if I don’t aim worse than I already do
The exact reason I went from a kiri main to an illari main.
Sombra is easier to play, but having a really good game as sombra where you have no deaths is the best. Sombra is very fun I think, especially on big maps
Ashe? 

Fun to play? Probably.

Fun to play against? Absolutely not.
    That’s why she’s in the middle of fun and unfun
        Oh, ok
Hanzo being balanced and unfun are both L takes. Respectfully, a Hanzo main.
    Unfun because getting one shot by a random spam arrow is not a good feeling. And Hanzo is balanced, he's just a tank buster. Worse than Reaper, Echo, Bastion, Mei and the hitscan heros at that, but a tankbuster nonetheless (Sarcasm may apply)
