[[People seem endlessly never happy with the Tank state.]]


In Beta + Season 1, people complained that they couldn't play their favorite Tanks but force to fill as meta Tanks. If not, the enemy meta Tank could casually walk over their backlines and outmatch other Tanks easy. (JQ meta -> Zarya meta -> Orisa meta -> Roadhog meta)

In early Season 2, Doomfist meta lasted very short since he received nerfs after he got buffs for a few days.

After Ramattra buff in Season 2, everyone was happy that every Tank (maybe except Hog & Doom) could get into the play but eventually people got tired of it as it became a swap fest, rock-paper-scissors.

In Beta + S1, "I can't play my favourite Tank because I must mirror the meta Tank or lose."

S2 and after, "I can't play my favourite Tank because I must counter-pick or lose."


Tanking needs an overhaul, the fact that slight buffs can cause such massive waves in the meta is alarming
    This is the problem when you only have one tank. Nearly every tank is just slightly below busted and the moment a tank gets a buff he/she absolutely dominates.
        Tbh it’s more about the *perception* of the buff than anything else. People drastically overstate how firm the “meta” is in this game. Most people (like 80% of comp players) don’t even play the meta heroes/comps *correctly* anyway.
            You’re correct and so is the guy who replied to you. 

Meta is highly reflective of player experience and a lot of the tank feelings reflect more the strength of supports than the ranks vs each other. 

But Doom and Ball do struggle a bit being so easily disrupted with quick cool downs from a couple hero’s. 

It doesn’t even mean they are weak just other characters may be too unfair
                Agree across the board. Player hears that X hero got buffed->plays against that hero->loses->whines about how overtuned the hero is.

I literally had someone complaining about the Zarya buff yesterday because I was shitting down their throat the one round I played her. They were playing Orisa the whole game. *I didn’t bubble a teammate a single time that round*. Please good sir explain how the Zarya buff had *any* impact on the game whatsoever.

Edit: hey you’re the same person from the other comment chain lol
                    i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
                        The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
                This is why I wish they would bring back the 6th player and just add a "bruiser" role hero's like doom, ball, hog, Mei, and brig are some chars that could be put into this role. A tanker DPS that can't hit as hard, it would be nice if your team is lacking in one are the person in said bruiser role could now play around that
            LITERALLY, the only tank that really struggles IMO is Doomfist and Ball, and that’s because sombra is so bullshit
                She's bullshit but 95% of the mouthbreathers who swap to her can't play her. Like. Sure, she's hacking me all the time, but she's 1-9 with a 30% winrate and is an actual detriment to her team
                    This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
                honestly dooms doing good rn 6 sec slam and sticky block buff was acc perfect even he’s doing pretty good
                What rank are you in to say Doom is struggling? He’s one of the most played tanks and a positive win rate in comp right now, at least for diamond through GM. He has the highest win rate too among them except in GM where his win rate is just below Sigma’s.
                    Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
                        How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
                            Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
                Rein is easily beat by orisa, Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers and get out of jail free cards currently in the game+ dam boost bastion can completely counter you with no counter play, JQ is just terrible to play into Orisa, Sigma is ok but your literally not going to be killing anyone unless they're very out of position, Dva can't reasonably kill anything for the same reason as Winston tho she does slightly better against bast. And all of these are destroyed by a zen just placing discord or bastion just existing. While I agree in lower ranks most are still viable, in a setting where most players know what they're doing and have proper CD management and positioning the majority of tanks just become plain unfun and weak to play. Dive tanks do not have the burst to kill anything, and all brawl tanks are weak into Orisa apart from Zaraya. It's not even tanks being the only ones affected by overtuned supports rn dive heros as a whole are just miserable to play into the current meta.
                    > Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
                This man does not play reinhardt
            True, but also depends on which season. Stuff like Zarya in season 1 for example was played by pretty much every top 500 player in every region as the most played tank.
        Yeah they should just roll back to 2 tanks and be done with it. 

The game was originally balanced around it not to mention the community. 

This is so stupid.
            Was 2 tanks actually better in your opinion?

In my experience, the most the more active tanks, the harder matches are to balance.
    Possibly unpopular opinion but I feel like the tank problem would’ve never gotten this bad if they left us with two tanks.
        Objectively correct.
            Nah, tank duos ruled the roost in OW1. It was the same problem except you needed both tanks players to be on the same wavelength instead of your one tank player to just be good at what they're playing
        Would it really? Two tanks were still meta defining in OW1. I think Blizzard just can’t figure out how to balance tanks properly, be it one or two tanks (or three or four during the GOATS meta).
            Yea overall I’d argue it was better feeling for the tanks.

Like yes 2 tanks has problems but it’s nice to have a back up. 

Like now it’s like oh great they have orisa bastion I’m on rein we’ll get fucked I guess.

In 2 tank you could have a dva harass the bastion greater negating the biggest problem faces in horse bastion match up. Don’t swap now and you’re basically fucked.

Previously it was more like an mmo you had your MT and OT.
            Okay fair point but I believe the game was objectively more fun with two tanks. I’m a tank main and it was nice to have another tank to help out. I actually loved GOATS. I agree that blizzard needs to balance tanks but I also believe it was lots of fun to play with another tank!
            The problem here is not "tanks are meta defining", the problem is "tank feels shit to play"
        OW2 was a mistake and 5v5 was never needed
    It’s simple, bring back 6v6.
        bring back ow1
    I’m not sure if this will be agreed upon or not but small changes shaking up the meta isn’t a bad thing in a game with this many heroes. It’s actually a good thing. 

It’s actually pretty normal and with a game like overwatch that has a large variety of heroes you wouldn’t want big changes because some match ups are so heavily skewed in one direction it would become a nightmare. It would only force hard metas to arise where you won’t have as much variety.
    Idk why the devs didn't see this when they shifted to 5v5
        They didn't even realize that snipers needed to be nerfed until 6 seasons into OW2. This dev team doesn't know shit about shit, it's no wonder the game is only getting worse and worse
    The only fix is 6v6. Think about it!
It is SO STRESSFUL to be tank. It's always been, imo, the hardest role in the game because you have to be the shot caller, and be aware of positioning and how the fight is going back to front WHILE BEING in the very front like you have to have eyes at the back of your head
AND deal with CC, AND be at the mercy of the skill level/competence of your team more so than the other 2 roles as they are there to support your plays and follow through more often than the other way around.
    [deleted]
        Aye, then you can start almost predicting opportunities for insanely fast play.

So rewarding when you reach that point.
            I’ve been in a flow before where I would know what the other team was going to do. Like I was aware of where everyone was on my team, what the optimal position was to defend and apply pressure, AND I also remember thinking, oh this leaves us open to this over here, so I position myself waiting there and like 2 seconds later a lone DPS walks in and I get the pick. 

Rarely does that happen, cause it feels like my team also needs to play well enough to capitalize off plays like that but when I do get to play like that it’s amazing.
        Thank you for this. I'll take this in to consideration.
Like I don't HATE-HATE the tank role, i just can't play it too much or I get burned out hella fast (literally it is the only role I get when my friends and I ALL open que in a party IDK WHY LOL) 
There are games though when it feels like magic. I like to explain to my friends who are new that if teams were a snake the Tank is the head (brain and all), DPS is the muscle, and the Supports are the skeleton that props the team up. As the head of the snake when you and your team dominate (or even if you just dominate the other tank) the role can be INCREDIBLY rewarding.

But more often than not in my experience a game can be summed up like this one time i played a game with a DPS friend.

I, as tank, tried to make space. I died. I asked my friend where he was and why he didn't try to capitalize on the space I made.
He said it was because I didn't follow him so he couldnt have my back.

I paused, trying to take that response in without my head exploding.

I said "that's not how this works. YOU FOLLOW ME"
We won after he started following my lead but I don't exactly use a lot of coms with randos because my threshold for toxicity is very low hahaha
            This is why me and my friend dominate in any game if we're together, we have some crazy synergy, but as soon as one thing gets in the way of that or one of us dies or something, we get rolled 

Ex: Rein brig, Rein reaper, reaper cass, Ana Rein (we can both play all of these so these combos work really well)
        The thing is, the moment you slowdown, someone in your team suicide. In 4v5 state, you are a punching bag. So what ends up happening is that you wanna capitalize that 5v5 state before someone suicide like idiot.

What i end up doing is that picking Sigma and playing in autopilot idiot mode and praying my team wins the game. Otherwise you need a pocket support and dps needs to take off pressure of you and enemy shouldn't play Ana but enemy always plays Ana.
        Tl;Dr: play sigma for 50 hours then go back to your other tanks. You will be better at patience and waiting for enemy mistakes.
        This must be why I favour sigma so much and really enjoy him. Im the patient methodical type so enjoy being able to sit back and just pick away at them hoping to capitalize on any mistake or impatience. That and I like more traditional tanks.. too many feel like just beefier dps. Only downfall is when suddenly they whole enemy team jail breaks and it's 1v5.. I can only assume my own team got inpatient and all tried flanking and died.. I've also been in chat and been told that two enemy flankers killed the four of them while I was holding off 1v3.. which is a little disappointing.

I like rein too, but find it hard to balance when to be aggressive and when to be patient with him. Plus more open maps are more difficult
    >It is SO STRESSFUL to be tank.

And it is more so in 5v5 than it was in 6v6! This was a clearly identified issue when they first toyed with the idea of 5v5. Many expressed it was too much pressure, while only a *minority* of people felt exhilarated by the challenge. 

* Attention being split between you and the other tank made it a lot less stressful
* Playing into a duo tank synergy is more fun than playing into the meta flavor of the month. Reinhardt+Zarya is more fun than anything solo tanking offers. 
* Even when you play mismatched tanks, two players on their one-tricks are going to have more fun versus a synergistic tank duo than a solo tank being overwhelmed by the meta tank pick, more of a chance to score some kills, and more chance to beat the odds. **Nobody talks about how 6v6 was more fun to lose at than 5v5 is to win half the time.**

It was suppose to reduce queue times, but by removing some of the most fun aspects of tanking, they culled their tank population even further. 

Some say 5v5 was also to remove Double Shields. That is also dead wrong! 

* The core of Double Shields was Orisa+Sigma. And Orisa lost her shield with the rework. 
* Reinhardt, Winston, and Ramattra are not going to enable double shields if you pair them with Sigma for each of their own obvious reasons. 

We really should just go back to 6v6. 

>AND deal with CC

Ana's Sleep Dart already selectively affects tanks less. 5 seconds base, 3.5 seconds to tanks. 

If they are truly committed to 5v5, they should go ahead and make that effect baseline for the Tank passive. 

* All crowd-control and debuff duration or effectiveness are reduced by 30% (slows, stuns, hinders, hacks, discord orb, anti-heal, etc..)

But frankly, that could be equally achieved, if not better, with bringing 6v6 back and just a 2nd tank either protecting the main tank or taking half the pressure by being another big threat like Hog or Ball.

The team is now focused on PvP, so 6v6 wouldn't grow stagnant like before under the watch of a PvE-focused team.
        I also feel like there are so many more things that ignore shields now. Ram punches, Sojourn ult, Orisa ult, and the already existing Moira balls/ult. And sym/charging healing off shields. I feel like the double shield would be less effective today than in OW1 and they could make more changes to make it work instead of just removing a tank.
            FR, if they wanted, they could literally make Sym's orbs pierce again. Not just shields but multiple characters. That was such a goofy ability back in the day. 

Many tank players enjoyed the game for 3+ years before COVID, lawsuits, and the content drought really took its toll. Through GOATS, through Double Shield, through countless games of Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony (the true banes of 2CP, the other maps were ok). They still ultimately had fun. 

Meanwhile OW2 tank depression rises before even 1 year.
            > Sojourn ult, Orisa ult

those don't ignore shields AFAIK
                Orisa ult does ignore shields. They buffed it during season 2. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and isn’t super consistent but it does ignore them.
                Yes they do.
                    after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
                        Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
        They pitched 5v5 and EVERYONE who plays tank understood the issues that would come with it. Then they promised huge changes to make up for anentire 2nd person in the same mindset as you, and gave us "you have 2 fire strikes and can stop charging early." Aka stuff from experimental patches they held off years to give us so ow2 had SOMETHING.

People so overstate the influence of double shield when even if we had 2 tanks and lowered stats like you said, orisa is gone, double shield could have been dealt with YEARS AGO but again, was held off. Same with just cutting down CC.

Double shield wasn't a real issue anyway, walk through it or play stuff that ignores or destroys them in half a second. Friend and I played rein Winston into double shield and won every time.
        Terrible idea. 5v5 clears, and it’s not close
            5v5 blows and it's not even close.
            Oh man you got downvoted by the very vocal 6v6 lovers. 

I’m sorry man
                Oh no not my internet points!
                    For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
                        I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
                            I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
                                You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                                    Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
                            How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
            > Terrible reply. Opinionated cheer, and delulu~

*6v6 was more fun for MOST tanks.*

*Your argument is not only wrong, but woefully inadequate.*
                I’m the one crying? In this thread? Lol
    If you are feeling stressed about your game sense, stick to hog and treat it like you are a DPS. Go in, get a sneaky elim and back off for healing. Save your self heal for when you are away from healer's LOS or if you aren't able to be healed in time. Take your time to aim hook. Hook is worthless when its on cooldown, so take your time and aim it. When you land a hook, flick your screen 90 degrees so that they face into your team. It's subtle, but your team will be more likely to follow up with your hooks if you deliver the elim on a silver platter like that.

Play hog until you get comfortable reading how the fight is going. Hog will teach you good positioning, when to peak and when to punish your enemies for their positions.

I would also say you should practice your general skill in game by playing "1k damage" in the custom game section and maybe try some of the aim trainers too. I learned basically all of my skill through 1v1 practice and now I can confidently take any 1v1 match-up and have slightly better odds than 50/50 (yes, I even practiced my junk against pharah frequently. They never see it coming).
The only way to get rid of counter picking (be it 6v6 or 5v5) is to make cookie cutter tanks that all do the same things or you just get rid of hero selections and force everybody to play the same things (and is that even OW at that point)
    [deleted]
        They must stop making hard counters in DPS, supports on tanks. Simply. Because there is just one now. Tanks should be immune to many hard counters or have abilities to resists to them (all tanks), even if they decrease shield, health, damage afterwards for balance.

In fact, maybe tanks are too strong so it means all have to counter him for easy win. Make them less important, and it should leverage tank diversity.

Either we buff them to resist so they are all playable (but maybe powercreep loop). Or we nerf them all to the ground, so it doesn't impact that much the game so people stop hard counter / focus tank.
        I've been thinking this awhile. Two tanks gave more options. In the absence of a second tank, in a game with so many potential counters, you need to give more options to tanks. They don't have to be good at everything, but at least have some better mitigation abilities, like characters in a fighting game. There is plenty of potential mechanics to expand on. For example, orissa spear is swallowed by sigmas suck. What if you could charge the spear by holding down and then it beats suck, but at the expense of being stationary and vulnerable? Same with sigmas rock and orissa's fortify. Now you have some additional play and wiggle room. Rein has a unused melee button. What if it gave him a short dash? So much more exciting. Anyways, these are just suggestions, but the point is to open up tanks gameplay options, so they have tools to help mitigate a specific situation so their immediate thought isn't to switch to another tank because they feel helpless.
    People who don't want counter picking don't actually want to play a hero shooter.
        There's a difference between some counter picking being a thing and "you can just pick sombra/bastion/orisa to make 50% of the tanks absolutely miserable to play"
        Man is now defining a genre by its least fun mechanic.
            I'm defining a genre by its defining feature LOL
                How? In tf2, the defining hero shooter, counterswapping cant really happen as there’s so few characters to play that it’s generally not really helpful beyond swapping guns and maybe if one person is absolutely dominating u can focus him, but in other hero shooters like Paladins and Valorant u can’t even swap characters so countering is kind of impossible. Overwatch is the only game counter swapping is a thing, it’s important and i like it but it has nothing to do with the genre its in
                So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Personally, I can't wait to see what the enemy is playing so I can pick a counter. Even better when they see what I'm playing and pick a counter.
                    You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
                    > So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
                        "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
            I quite enjoy it, actually.

I like switching to Moira and dominating the Genji that was shitting on us. I like going Torb and making that Tracer switch off - hell, maybe they switch to Pharah and counter my Torb. Then I'm the one that has to switch.

Counter picking is a fun mechanic for some and mostly works as it should when it's DPS and support interactions. It's just unfortunate that it affects tanks so adversely and that's something that needs to be fixed.
    No, they need to have abilities that aren’t too good at shutting down others ability
        Spear, Javelin Halt and Twirl is just basically a fuck you to any sort of attack.
    No, you can prohibit people from swapping during the round. You pick a hero, you play it for the round. No mystery heroes bullshit. Obviously a system would have to exist where teams get to pick in order and see the heroes the enemy picked, like in Dota, so you don't end up with a terrible composition.
people tend to not mind winston dva and rein metas
    Because there is an "all-in" battle, easier for people to sync, and... fun? Now we poke from afar with orisa & hitscans until eventually, we have ults so we can push.
    That's because these heroes are counterable
    Because they have hard counters and you can actually play a variety of tanks into the mentioned ones
    Ngl Orisa meta is better for sups and dps. You can kinda ignore Orisa but monke and dva can just jump on top of you and you can't do anything to them they are mega 5v5 tanks.
Because most of the tanks were designed around 6v6, and with two tanks if the enemy picked one of your counters you could rely on your other tank to take them on.

1 tank means you either have to swap tanks every other fight or just get used to playing into your counters every single game.
    >with two tanks if the enemy picked one of your counters

The real problem is actually DPS heroes. If you start off as Winston and the enemy DPS are Reaper and Bastion, you straight up can't play the game unless they're completely incompetent.

Enemy team has a widow/hanzo/hitscan who can aim somewhat? Well, now you kinda need to be Rein or Sigma, or someone who can block their shots somehow. If you picked Hog, JQ, or Doom, your entire team is going to have a miserable experience.
        The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game. 

Playing rein into ana/zen is equally as bad as some hanzo/bastion, which is equally as bad as playing into orisa. And if you have all 5, you get a jackpot or some shit. 

The easiest gameplan to execute is to bully the tank. It’s easy to sleep the tank on cooldown, keep discord on them, spear them repeatedly, etc. It’s not some specific role that makes tank hell, it’s just playing tank that makes tank hell.
            >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.


Oh absolutely, my point was that most tank matchups are at least playable. But out of all cross-class matchups, Damage heroes have the most "anti-Tank" heroes (obviously), and since there are two DPS for every Tank, the dps players are free to pick the hardest counter, and exactly as you said: bully the tank. 

If you're a support being relentlessly dived by a dps, you can swap to Brig, Moira, maybe Bap or Zen if you really want to just take the duels. Most of those swaps aren't "hard" counters (like how Brig used to be able to delete Tracer with a full combo if recall was on CD) in the way Reaper deletes Winston by clicking m1 in his general direction, or how a symettra who doesn't place all her turrets in one spot can completely dogwalk Reinhardt.
                While I don’t think it’s disputable that dps have more anti tank options, I don’t feel they’re nearly as bad to play into as their support counterpart (ana and zen) or THE anti tank, orisa. I’d much rather play into the dps heroes because many of them have drawbacks that, as a tank player, you can capitalize on. Like playing into sym, to burst you down, that means she’s in your effective range. 

The same cannot be said for ana or zen, who require coordinated dives to deal with at high levels, and playing a brawl tank into them is just an instant L. And orisa is orisa, who gets to basically sit there and control your movements.
            in my experience bullying the tank is a bad strategy most of the time because of the sheer amount of healing supports can provide. That's why ana nade is so strong, but it's the exception to that rule
                No amount of healing is saving you from discord and a bastion.

And yes, anti is ridiculous, which is why ana was the best hero in the game for like 4 seasons straight. It took 3 consecutive nerfs to move her from best hero to “one of the best” now.
                    The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
                        Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
            >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.

My flaming hot take is that role queue was the game's biggest mistake and hero swapping the game's second biggest mistake.

The 2016 crowd just wanted to hop onto games with friends and go pew pew pew. Instead, now we have to have a carefully designed sports team with roles that don't match the audience's composition (with the MMO holy trinity, way more than 40% of people want to play DPS and way less than 40% want to be healers). This leads to long queue times, which leads to players leaving, which leads to longer queue times, and the game spirals.

Instead of role queue, IMO the proper fix would have been to make the characters more similar to each other to eliminate hard counters, both at the hero level (Pharah vs Junkrat) and at the team composition level (3 support and 3 tank vs 6 DPS). DPS could largely remain as is though Pharah would need a rework, tanks would change to fat DPS, support would either be closer to Zen with weak healing or Mercy with single target strong healing, and the OW2 support passive could be extended to all characters so that you wouldn't need healers as much.

Hero swapping is a much trickier argument. I'd argue that the way the majority of 2016 OW1 players want to play the game is more like how you play Smash Bros - find a character that is fun and play them. The hero swapping never worked the way that Jeff Kaplan and his team thought it would and the rock paper scissors dynamic ended up being the worst part of the game because people just wanted to play who they want to play. Additionally, you could have per hero SR, which would help matchmaking quality. Ever tried to learn a hero but keep having to switch back to your main because you are unable to keep up with your rank? Per hero SR would fix this problem.

Of course there's two problems with removing role queue and hero swapping. The first is that this dev team is way too incompetent to pull this off. First they broke the game with Brig, then when they did role queue they didn't rebalance it for half a year, and then when they did 5v5 they reworked a measly 4 characters. There's no way they could pull off the changes needed to homogenize the cast enough to eliminate hard counters.

The second is that it's not what the current game audience wants. The people who have stuck with OW are the ones who like the unique heroes and the sports team like roles. I would argue that the majority of the game's 2016 player base would prefer my vision, but I also recognize that they are gone and trying to swap out a current player base to get back one that's already left would be a bad move.
        The problem with double shield was dps heroes too but nobody wants to talk about that.

Double shield got popular because damage kept creeping up, had to start doing that so that you could survive. Double shield wasn't fun, if you have the option to play more fun teams then you'd usually pick them.
            The lower the TTK is, the better it becomes to just sit behind a shield and blast away in safety. When you have things like hanzo spam and roadhog hook threatening instant death, why risk playing dive where your supports can be picked off before you even crack the enemy Rein's shield?

Damage needs to come down across the board, and so does healing. The only things that should deal 225+ damage are ults, and damage boosted Widow/Hanzo headshots.
                Cut down the damage and cut down the cc and double shield would basically drop off the map, they did one but not the other.
                    They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
        that also leans back into 2 tanks though. if you're rein/zarya and they switch to bastion or junk, your off-tank can swap and you can stay as rein

if they switch to widow, 1 tank can switch to Winston and effectively stop it, while still having 1 main tank. in 5v5, if you switch to Winston to counter, your entire team has to either swap to dive or wait until your grouped. I think 6v6 was way easier to deal with counters, now with 5v5 you're changing the comp with no safety
        At that point it’s the job of your other teammates to support you. I’ve played Rein when the other team had a bastion and it’s the job of my DPS to help alleviate pressure. I’ve had games where widow is killing my supports and maybe I went doom so I could help them. Match ups are entirely within your role and a key part of the game is working with your team as a unit to cover shortcomings.
        >Enemy team has a widow/hanzo/hitscan who can aim somewhat? Well, now you kinda need to be Rein

Every day I'm reminded of how different low elo is.
        this is simply not true, you just need to get good. it’s hard but look at dafrans winston gameplay. It’s not impossible

The only way you’ll
even really have trouble with hard counters is in gm, you can get away with a lot of stuff in the lower ranks

You dont deserve t9 climb if you can’t outskilll your own rank

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
            What you describe only works on the perspective of Dafran, a GM player. If you are not at that level, of course you won't be able to play against counters. You know why Dafran's Winston only have trouble with hard counters on GM? is because those are player on his level. And if you follow your advice, "git gud", then you'll face people who also, "got gud", which will be countering you at your level.

I have no idea how you can consider what you just said constructive at all.
                you just need to get good, at lower ranks people just don’t know how to punish. Winston has an escape mechanic and a bubble to juggle on a short cooldown

I am said it’s hard, like playing most tanks but not impossible

Also if people are struggling in their level then it means they’re supposed to be at that level until they improve

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
                    Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
                        What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
                            ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
                                if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                                    Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                                    Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
    Similar thing happened with 2 tanks back then. Let's not forget how meta transitioned from goats when open queue was standard to double shield when role queue was standard. I remember very short burst of time where we had old orisa hog or rein zarya as the meta. They were enjoyable metas but even then counters were a thing. The only difference was you'd counter the duo rather than 1 target. More often than not the counter to tank duos ended up being brig or just blowing up tanks with reaper or something similar (role queue). As for goats, there was no real counter, you just ran a form of goats back.
        I don’t even think the first designed argument have a merit. When many of the tanks were first designed the game didn’t even have role queue, so you didn’t know it was a one tank, two, three or even six tank comp until after hero select. It’s turned into an entirely different game several times, and they have adjusted the tanks or reworked them over and over. It’s not a question of the first design teams intentions (the game was also SO unbalanced at release)

But yeah, the rock-paper-scissor counterpicking feels too damaging toward tanks rn
        I’d argue the counters were… softer with two tanks? You might swap your off tank or main tank to deal with one element of the enemy team composition. There was more nuance, as opposed to rock, paper, Orisa.
        Double shield didn't come straight out of goats. It didn't even get big until about a year and a half before ow2 released.
    I think the obvious solution to go back to 6v6 is make an official main and off tank category for role queue. 

That way you don't make it possible to choose two powerful shield tanks in a competitive match that was a problem in ow1. 

But they would have to rework some tanks to make them be a better off tank and remove the super buffs that made them viable as a single tank.
    I'm sorry but it was still the least popular role and hated back then.  Not to mention don't get me started on shields.

If they bring back 6v6 they need to have dedicated heros role for main tank and off thank.

Just the thought if an zarta, orisa combo seem awful.
        Zarya is an off tank and Orisa is main tho lol
            That comment just shows people have no idea what they’re talking about lol
                They just like to bitch about the game because it’s hard to accept responsibility for your losses/shortcomings
    Tank players were upset with the state of tanks for years back in 6v6 too, wym?
        Because of main tank experience and double shield, which was solved with tank passive and reworks.
Blizzard needs to just balance all the tanks so that they are just that, balanced. If every tank, or almost every, was on a semi level playing field, the role would feel a lot less constricting and imo, more fun.
    If all Tanks are balanced that they all can get into the play, then rock-paper-scissors / counter-pick situation carries on.
        to be fair most tanks’ complains with getting counter picked is when it’s *the whole team*. one good fight on doom & it’s sombra/orisa/ana/zen/cas , one good fight on rein it’s orisa/bastion/mei, etc. Tank “rock paper scissors” isn’t as free as people make it seem. A good Dva can play into Zarya, a good Doom can play into Orisa, getting full counterswapped is what sucks
            This is true, but the people that don't understand this the most seem to not actually play tank. It is the people that yell at me for "throwing" since I didn't switch off the second the other tank switched to a tank that was better against me.
            Sometimes when the whole team counter-swap you, you may indirectly enable someone else in your team. I had games that enemies switch to JQ + Bastion + Reaper against me as monkey, this means none of the enemies could contest my mid-long range DPS.
                Yea, but were you, personally, having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks?
                    > having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
        Better than meta's imo. I'd rather be able to play any tank instead of being limited to 2 or 3 or be "throwing"
            Well no you're still limited to 2 or 3 that are otherwise throwing, however they constantly change throughout the match as you and other tank counter pick each other

It's one of the core issues with only having one tank
                It was an issue in OW1 as well. Good luck playing Winston into Hog, even with a second tank.
                    Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
                        Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
                        And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
            Nah they need to balance it so basically no tank hard counters another so it’s up to the skill of the player and not just “my tank beats yours because I picked it”
                that’s not possible with a game that is heavily reliant on abilities. by the nature of having unique abilities and weapons, different characters will counter others and get countered all the same. a truly balanced game would have to revolve around counter picking for the most optimal play. by nature of a competitive game, players try and win and will look for the most efficient way which is how metas form. if one character is even just a little better than others, a meta will naturally revolve around it
                    It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
                        Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
                            Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
                                Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                                    Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
                        i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
                6 v6 cures so many problems with overwatch 2
        Oh no, the game that has the unique feature of being able to change character’s mid game will encourage players to change character’s mid game
            I prefer counter-pick more than "pick this meta Tank or lose" situation.
        Rock paper scissors is infinitely better than play these two tanks or lose instantly
            You’re a gold player; you can play literally any tank you want and do just fine.
                woah there buddy, no need to be condescending… I’ll have you know I’m in the top 50% of all ranked players… I’m sure you couldn’t say the same…
                    You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
                        nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
                            Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
                                Still better than you…  probably silver …
                                    I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
                    >  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
                Rank shaming in 2023 LMAOO
                    its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
                    Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
                        I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
                            No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
God I’d do anything for 6v6 again
    Felt so much better to tank. One enemy tank counter picks you? You still have the other tank player who can support you and you are not instantly forced to switch.
        yall have some *very* rose tinted glasses on.  the tank experience in 6v6 was 'load into hero select screen where other tank has already locked hog' * n
            Some diabolical revisionist history going ok in this comment section 😭😭
                it's pretty funny, i can vividly remember numerous OW1 tank queue sessions where i was just 'why the actual fuck do i play this game'.  but apparently it was some dreamland of zarya delivering perfect bubbles to rein being healed by ana and sped by lucio, or coordinated winston d.va dives on discord targets.  

it was a shitshow most of the time.  i liked 6v6 overall but am honestly having more fun tanking in OW2, if they tone down orisa a bit it will be fine
            I'd rather have a hog with me to eat some cooldowns than have sleep, anti nade and mag nade hit me when i drop shield.
                Instead the enemy went double shield. Where things like anti and discord could never get through, and you just lost if you didn't have the same broken tank synergy.
            Rose tinted glasses when I played overwatch 1 till the end and lost nearly all motivation in season one of overwatch 2?  Yall still use that argument all the time and think you won
        i have no idea what you guys are talking about. 

all 6v6 did was make you have to mirror comps or go double shield. and that always devolved into double shield poke meta. 

it's like i'm the only one that remembered how bad that crap was, and everyone complaining non stop in this sub. it was killing the game and overwatch was becoming irrelevant 

5v5 was a good change, a great change. i'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta 

i'm so glad the devs don't go back to that trash.
            Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

    5v5 was a good change, a great change. I'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta

Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

&#x200B;

Too much power has been put into the support roles imo. If there is to only be 1 tank then all the power and fun needs to go into the tanks otherwise why would anyone want to play the role.
                There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change. 

Clearly you don't understand that your opinion doesn't make something fact.
                        There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?
                
>Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

The short space of time of 2 years with 0 updates at the end of OW1?
                    These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
                > Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

what are you talking about??

it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

and ow1 was practically irrelevant and dying at the time due to how boring the gameplay was playing the same heroes in mirror comp all the time 

> Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

dive goats and brawl were fucking braindead mirrors like i said. there was barely any strategic "flex tank" switching like you guys claim. 

> Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1
                    >  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
                    The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
                        I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
                        clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
                        

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
                            Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
                                Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
                            It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
        That's why there were so many tanks in ow1 🙄😒
            Queues flex. Gets support everytime.
        > You still have the other tank player who can support you and you are not instantly forced to switch.

what if i told you there are still 4 players on your team who can counter
            There are also 4 more enemies to counter you and only you.
        What?  You were forced to play the one other tank that was “best” with the other tank or you were flamed for losing the game. And in Some metas you would be losing the game. Tanking in OW1 sucked ass it’s why NO ONE DID IT.
It’s just sort of weird. 1 tank is easier to play around and heal, but when I play tank (a lot less than OW1), I find myself missing the support of another person. Not to mention it’s a lot more sink or swim now, as there’s only one person on the role; nobody to pick up slack.
It's almost like going to 1 tank was a really stupid idea. The ONLY way to fix this is going back to 2v2v2.
A bigger part of the issue is dps and support having access to tools that hurt tanks most.

Characters like Cass got changes from raw damage to CC, hurting mobile tanks and heroes. Wouldnt be bad if tanks took less or a hit from cc.

Hacking sombras can open up a lot of the tank roster and really deal some damage. She was actually meta for a few seasons, she is kind of falling back now.

And on top of that the enemy tank could swap to counter after first fight
 Meaning youre often fighting uphill against cc and a tank that exploits your weaknesses.

Not to mention, that the character of Ana exists with not one but two fight winning abilities that are easiest and best used on the tank. Or discord orb melting any tank.

They just have to make tank more resistant to cc than even now and maybe even resistant to anti nade or discird. Make tank countering less powerful from the other roles
    Honestly. There's a part of me that wants to say.... just make tanks completely immune to cc unless it comes from another tank. Fuck sleep, fuck discord, fuck hindered, just make it so any cc applied to a tank does like, 30 Damage. In meis case make it so the tank does less damage will being hit by her Beam.
    > best used on the tank.

Sorry, this is not true. It's situational.
        Very true!

My statement is more general. But the fact remains if the tank dies the fight is usually completely loat. Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. Not to mention anti alone is a free excuse to push.

Its why forcing anti is so important to playing against ana. 

But of course Ana can anti anyone for value. Tank is the easiest to anti and most do.

Most anas I play against just spam anti and sleep at the tank ad nauseum. And it works maybe 50% of the time because some tanks play poorly or some other reason.
            > Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. 

No, it doesn't. Do you play Ana? I'm just curious because there's a lot of....knowledge you're kinda skipping over. 

It's situational:

What is the position of you and your team when their tank dies? What is the position of the enemy team? What's the ult statuses (i.e Does their genji have blade? Does their Soldier have visor?) Are the enemy support cooldowns up or did they blow them? Is your team actually coordinating and working together? etc.

Ever since they nerfed Ana where tanks wake up in 3 seconds instead of 5, it made it significantly worse to sleep tanks.
                This is neither a dissertation on ana nor an argument.

Do you play tank? Have you played tank against Ana at higher levels?

From masters to GM anti was frequently used on me as tank, forcing me to wait or play passively or outright guaranteeing my death.

Nade is available every 10 seconds or so. And many fights across all skill levels will involve up to two uses of nade.

Nading the tank to stop a push in part one of a fight and nading a support or dps to secure an elim 10 seconds later is still nading the tank and still giving value.

Many if not most of the Ana's i play against are nading the tank with exceptions, of course (because no ability exists in a vacuum, and I never implied it did) 

Ive played enough ana and enough tank to know she is part of the readon tank is so strenuous right now. She is one of the most played supports for a reason.
It never has been my main role but the most frustrating thing for me about playing tank is how extremely easy tanks are to counter.

Ana alone already is like your biggest enemy ( Glad I started playing Zarya ).

You get pretty much instantly counter-picked as soon as you outperform the enemy tank, which means they most of the time just switch to Orisa ( Yawn ).

But recently somewhat enjoy tank. As support main, Zarya is probably my best bet because i have somewhat more impact on my teammates. Especially on gold where they kinda just fiesta and are out of position i can get free charge and maybe snatch free kills because my barrier prevented someone from dying from their own mistake

EDIT: What I forgot... Tank is the only role that CAN'T counterpick to every possible problem. If the enemy plays a Pharrah, then who the hell do you pick? There is no real hitscan tank to get this annoying thing out of the sky and if you DPS refuses to do this job then it's like an auto-loss.
If we had more betas, I honestly think that the tanks could have been so much better but we never took the time to balance and rework the tanks that would clearly suck on a 5v5 format. We could also rework the 6v6 designed heroes
    If only we had something we could publicly test new features and changes on the game before they got permanently rolled out. Ugh if only
        Don't understand why they would ever remove experimental
            Because now we get a patch almost every 3 weeks. We get the season's patch, the 2 week patch, and the mid season patch. With how often we get updates, they won't bring back a mode to test features. They should do it to test future changes but we all know they won't
            Not like they actually used it anyway. They put charge cancel on there...4? 3? times and didn't implement it.
            Probably so they could force 5v5 on us. They didn’t make it so it could be tested and they could get feedback, they just implemented it and went “yup that’s how it is now.”
                The real reason I replied to the comment before you
Honestly, my enjoyment went up a LOT when I started incorporating open queue. Yeah there’s a soft meta there too (2-1-2) but it’s not as strict as role queue and it’s way less toxic from my recent experience. I’d play only comp MH if RNG didn’t hate my team every damn game.
    > comp MH

Sometimes it took ages to get one game.
        Yep, and then you'll get only dps all game against 2 reins, 2 bastions, and a mercy and remember why you don't play MH.
Yeah bc theres only 1 lol
This is why 5v5 is sucks fundamentally.
What if I tell you that people playing competitive games will never be happy with whatever meta is?
The game is stupidly dumb right now. Just go back to 6v6 already you dumb fucks (referring to blizzard)
    it's really stupid and wonky
    Not only would they have to re-balance the whole game again but then we would also go back to all the problems we used to complain about with 6v6 (no one wanted to play tank back then either, all the shields, support was less fun since you had to spend so much time healing both your tanks, etc) I feel like a lot of people in this sub only remember the good parts of OW 1 but that game had a lot of problems too. Me personally, I much prefer 5v5 and I feel like que times are much better now than they were at the end of OW 1 (despite everyone claiming this game is dead).
        they literally abandoned ow1. that was the root of the problem.
            I mean honestly that's a pretty good point. Blizzard is run by a bunch of idiots and I do wish I lived in the universe where a competent company had the Overwatch IP.
            People pull out old reason why 2 tank suck forget blizzard literally dont give a shit about the game state for 3 years. If they actually give effort and fix it non of those thing could happen. The rework of orisa in ow"2" have already fix some of the double shield problem. Kiriko suzu help counter alot of tank cc by her own, etc... It can be fixed if blizzard actually give a shit about their game.
        >Not only would they have to re-balance the whole game again

They haven't properly done that so far, so that's a non-issue.
            Thats what people fail to understand. Blizzard didn't rework everything for overwatch 2. They made minimal changes and kept most of it the same then tossed us in 5v5. Lazy fucks just made things worse.
        It's funny cause 6v6 was worst for 4 player out of 6.
            Not really supports were fine, you could make an argument for it being worse for dps but it was meta dependent.
                Support are way more fun now than they were before.
                    Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
        They have a save file of last ow1 balance. It would be super easy to go back and just balance the new ones
            Double shield meta again 😍
                How is it double shield when orisa literally got reworked? Ram and Sig wouldnt work that well together
                    But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
                        I feel sorry for you
                            Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
        How is double shield going to be an issue without orisa *having a shield.*
    > go back to 6v6 

Then DPS + Support queue times become long again because no one likes to play Tanks.

We'll also get DPS mains picking 'buffed DPS' (primarily off Tanks like Hog, JQ, Zarya, Sigma) to avoid long queue times. Since Roadhog sucks now, they'll pick JQ instead because she's 'better Hog'.

Synergized Tank duos are cool but let's not pretend bad Tank duos also exist (e.g Hog + Ball torture). Imagine the enemy team runs a synergized Tank duo but your Tank duo is Roadhog + Doomfist; the enemy team has Double Snipers guarded by Tanks like Sigma, DVA but your Tanks are Roadhog / Junker Queen / Zarya.
        DPS and support queue times are already long. Just the other day I saw DPS and Support queue times both at over 20 minutes. No one wants to play tank right now because tank is miserable
            Yes! Tank que times is 5 seconds for a reason lol
            [deleted]
        Getting bad team comps is already a thing tho. Never played OW1 but  can two tanks fundamentally not be salvaged? I've heard some tank synergies were unbelievably annoying like Orisa/Sigma, Orisa/Hog, but I feel like it'd be leagues better than all the pressure being put on one person.
            Exactly! People don't understand that though. Or choose to ignore it
            [deleted]
                I wouldn't say it's pure revisionist. I used to be a tank main, as was a friend of mine, and we tried for a bit in overwatch 2, but eventually gave it up. I haven't really touched tank for about 3 or 4 seasons. I tried once or twice after I dropped it, but it just sucks now, imo. Too much pressure on one player, and you can't enjoy the role like you used to be able to. Not all tank players disappeared, but this one at least did.
                    [deleted]
                        And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
        >Then DPS + Support queue times become long again because no one likes to play Tanks.

Which is ironic because my queue times on support now are way longer than ow1 during its life support period.

I'm currently averaging 7~10mins sup queue in qp no matter when i queue between 9pm~4pm my timezone.
            Because Supports is in the best state right now and many people are still enjoying / learning Illari and also buffed Lifeweaver.
        Support que times did not go over 1 minute in 6v6. DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports. 

Your second point makes no sense. Are people going to play tank or not? You can't have it both ways.

The third point also makes no sense. The whole point of role que is to pick teams that synergize well with each other. It would be the same with tanks. Why would people willingly play roles that don't go well with each other?
            > DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports.

DPS queues were minimum 20 minutes long at the end of OW1's life. And I have the screenshots to prove it. Plenty of old clips from streamers showing this too.

We can't go back to that, the game will die again if people have to wait 20 mins for a game.
                Dont forget that DPS queue times were so long that Blizz had to introduce Priority Passes (by playing tank or support) just so you can jump queue.

They HAD to incentivize tank and support just to cut dps queue times. And it was STILL long.
                    We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
                        Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
                I mean they currently have bots in quickplay. I don't think it could get more dead than it currently is. At least with 6v6 there was enough players to start games without the need of bots
            Lmao, we had 15 minute queues for DPS a the end of OW1’s lifecycle. Everyone has rose-tinted glasses looking back at 6v6. Sure, it had its pros, but we can’t forget about all the cons. Too many people either forget that double shield existed, or are lying to themselves that double shield wasn’t that bad. We are complaining about tank being in a bad place because of rock paper scissors, but at least there is diversity there instead of being forced to play Sigma/Orisa.
                Yeah now it's just being forced to play orisa. So much better.
                    Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
                        All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
                            You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
            But Competitive Overwatch preferred 5v5 more.

The best thing about 5v5, I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs / timid Reins or Orisa / slow lurking Balls could sod off.
                Except now you have one tank with literally all the pressure and way too many roles to fill in one slot, and if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.
                    I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
                    > if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
        >let's not pretend bad Tank duos also exist

Also why do ppl pretend you will always get good tank duos? In a lot of games when I was not tank, id get Zarya/Hog or Ball Hog or just straight up off-tanks.

Hell when I did tank, I was always relegates to main tanking because my duo always picks off-tank. I had so many hours on Orisa cuz of that. I rarely could play OT unless I instalock one when the match starts.
            [deleted]
                I feel like so many people ignore this aspect - mm was so dogshit for tanks because of hog.

It wasnt utopian, synergy barely existed.
        What if they specifically made the queue for off tank. And broke the tanks into 2 roles. Add a few more to both selections. The same could honestly be done for supports.
    6v6 is infinitely inferior to 5v5
        No it isnt. The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back. Idk why some of you defend 5v5 so bad. We've tried it and it sucks balls.
            > The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back.

Source?
                remember when tank queue in OW1 was so long because everyone wanted to play tank because it was so fun?

this happened in season, uh, *checks notes*, it was season *flips through pages* look - the community has spoken
                Try just searching 6v6 in this sub. Or Twitter. Or YouTube. Or the overwatch forum. Everywhere basically.
                Trust ♪⁠～⁠(⁠´⁠ε⁠｀⁠ ⁠)
            I've played ow since the original beta.

6v6 is imposible to balance, two tanks is stupid and it is not fun at all.
                played for a long ass too, 5v5 is stupid and playing tank is not fun at all.
                Except with any end up with role q until shortly before echo came out, so all that time beforehand was either goats, or no limit
                Yeah cause 5v5 is so balanced rn
                You're in the minority here buddy. Balanced or not people have spoken and they want 6v6 back. The majority of players found it more fun even if it was less balanced.
                    How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
                        I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
                            I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
                                I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
                    I think the 6v6 folks are just louder.  The 5v5 guys are too busy playing Overwatch.

I personally come here to fight against 6v6 because I found it actively torturous and never want to go back to it.
                        That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
                            I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
                                I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
                            I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
                    6v6 is not coming back. Deal with it.
                        We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
            > community has already spoken

Yeah, and they weren't playing tank because it was boring and unfun. A very vocal minority on reddit thinks 6v6 was better, while the people who like 5v5 are busy playing the game with the lowest queue times its ever had.
                Ever had? C'mon man we do not have to lie. People keep saying it's a vocal minority but just look at who's getting down voted and who's not. You can like 5v5. That's fine but like don't act like it's the popular position. Like people are in agreement that 6v6 is better. It just needed some tweaking. With the current state of tanks and supports 6v6 would work much better than it use to. The game would be fun again too!
                    Reread my comment. This whole subreddit is a vocal minority. Not even 10% of players use reddit. Even on the other Overwatch sub 5v5 is vastly preferred. But once again you can't argue against the fact that queue times were insanely long in OW1 because nobody wanted to play tank, if you actually played it.
Season 1 and 2 tanks were peak, the only problem was Zar was just so much stronger than the other tanks and then support players cried about getting dove and rolled by tanks and not being able to fight back so they gutted the entire tank roster because to this day support players are the most babied in the community. Could’ve just nerfed Zar so she wasn’t over tuned and it would’ve been fine but nah, they nerfed the tanks, then Giga buffed the supports and now tanking is miserable
    Supports were indeed the least favorable during Beta + Season 1 & 2, but the meta eventually shifts to favoring them. 

Bringing Mei + Cassidy CC hurt the Tanks (especially Ball + Doom) more. As Dive heroes were kept at bay, Supports like Ana + Zenyatta continue sh*tting the Tanks with anti-nade, sleep and discord.

Now the Tanks are died of being bullied so easy, Orisa is the answer to make enemies sad. It's 'me or them'.
        And Dva, Doom, and Winston got nerfed after the beta specifically because of how good they were against supports and because supports complained about it. Supports were balanced to be just as impactful as dps and suddenly support players weren’t having fun, it’s hilarious really lol.
        Cassidy’s CC is negligible and doesn’t effect any tank significantly other than doom and sometimes Dva. Mei is shit for tanks even without her CC, her wall needs to go as it’s what’s primarily what makes playing against her miserable. And yes supports were unfavorable, but instead of just buffing supports they also nerfed all the tanks increasing the power swing in favor of the supports and making it so multiple tanks are incapable of dealing with certain dps. Nerfing supports and the tank buster dps removes like 80% of the problems with playing tank
            Cassidy cc also fucks up winston. Want to jump back out? Nope.... and then insta melted by right click.
    Let’s not talk about mercy
        Mercy needs to go, her movement is too good, her healing is too good, her buffing is too good
            she does 0 damage and low healing she's fine
                Mmhmm “low healing” for a lot of characters her healing is plenty to get a kill on a enemy not being healed. She also is extremely hard to hit for a lot of people because of her movement
            And yet she's maybe the worst support at the moment, bottom 3 at the very least.
    Your post grossly understates what an absolute nightmare it was playing support the first few seasons. The role wasn’t “babied,” it had significantly lower player base because it was painstakingly unfun to play Dead by Daylight: Overwatch edition and get steamrolled by a Hog running around every six seconds because there was nothing you could do.

Couple that with far more limited choices to play as and yeah, the role was miserable and needed the help. Barring Hog and to a lesser extent Ball, the tanking isn’t even bad that now. Healing could be toned down a bit, but if you’re expecting to go back to “Raid boss” levels like season 1 and 2 you’re just asking to delusionally shift the balance way in favor of tanks again.
        More like support players got so used to be babysitted all the time they couldn't cope with the fact they now needed to think about positioning and take duels.

The original DPS passive was busted, sure, but it got removed really fast.
            You do realize the idea that removing a tank means also that supports too are far more greatly exposed than they were before, and saying “focus on your positioning” can only work so well for supports like Zen and Ana who have zero mobility and NEED to rely on their cooldowns to have a chance of getting away even remotely? That’s the entire point I’m making. Removing a tank increased pressure on everyone and going into OW2 and giving supports no additional tools to aid themselves beyond “move around better” only takes you so far. Not every character can Mercy or Lucio zip around in seconds.
                I'm not arguing that supports didn't need new tools to fit in the new sandbox. I'm saying that even when they had said tools, support players still felt underpowered simply because they weren't used to playing in such an active way. Now that they are, most supports are straight up busted.
        Tank still has the lowest player base and has so se OW1. I’m literally a flex player and play, Ana, Bap, Brig, and Lucio and all of them had impact and were fun to play depending on the comp, map, and  enemy heroes. Support players just got mad that they were just as squishy as the dps role so they had to play smart. Now we’re back to the brain dead support balance where they can 1 v 1 anyone on the roster because they have the strongest cooldowns and twice the sustain of dps. Dis supports need buffs? Yes, did they need to be power crept into oblivion well also nerfing the role that made them struggle? Absolutely not.
            I mean...of course it's going to have the lowest player base. You need one tank per team per game, thus of course the total number of players is going to be lower; the ratio of need for tanks is just mathematically lower at 1:2:2...? This should come as no surprise. If the tank population surged you would be waiting hours for a game.

It seems more like tank players wanted to be raid bosses to me and got a rude awakening when they realized the absence of a second tank increased pressure on \*everyone\*, including support players, and that it's just unfun to be dove in two seconds by a hog/doomfist and be unable to play the game. Also, if you're losing a 1v1 against a support that's more a reflection on you than it is on the role. Trapping a support should never be an automatic guarantee of a free kill. If you can't finish them off even with the sheer strength advantage...I don't know what to tell you. You should be easily able to kill a Zen/Ana as a [D.va](https://D.va). If you can't... Be better at the game, maybe?

Anyway, supports are going to stay roughly where they are, because they're all relatively balanced amongst each other and the role is finally good. Tanks will I'm sure get some sort of buffs/changed to compensate the role being stressful and more unfun (we see this with hog rework etc).
                That’s… that’s not how statistics work?? 😭
                    That’s…that’s not how making an argument works?? 😭
        Also I can tell you don’t play tank at high level just by that comment. The only tanks that don’t explode randomly currently are Ram, Orisa, and Zarya.
            What’s your rank?
        Support low player base? Lol you obviously never play tank. Us tanks have been getting chain stunned into oblivion for years to the point bliz removed half of our slots because we all quit playing them because its not fun.
            You obviously didn’t read the rest of my comment because I specific stated season 1 and 2 where that was the case lmao
                I did. I just think you're delusional. Supp was hard for 2 ENTIRE SEASONS oh you poor baby. Tank has been terrible for like 4 years now.
                    It actually just sounds like you’re a bitter crybaby who took my words out of context. Continue to cope and seethe; tank buffs are not going to make you better at the game lmao
Yeah it's almost as if tank fucking sucks and they have no clue how to handle it. They did 5v5 because they don't know how to balance their game, and in doing so just exacerbated all the issues with the tank role and every individual tank. This will never be fixed and playing tank will always be stressful and miserable.
    > playing tank will always be stressful and miserable

Unless we turn all of them into hard-to-kill raid bosses and then we'll get complains from DPS & Supports who hate to play against unkillable horse, S1 Zarya, Beta JQ, etc.
    they did 5v5 because they wanted to make it look like a sequel.
They honestly should have just made two tank categories, off tank and main tank. It would have hopefully got rid of all of the dumb metas like double shield, dive etc. I really just want 6v6 back as playing solo tank is too much responsibility and I hate it lmao
Almost 1 year of constant dpa and support buffs and you wonder why the other role is left out? Dude every patch they overtune another dps into a tankbuster. Rein pretty much gets indirect nerf every patch
    I guess Tanks aren't the majority.

DPS has lot of heroes, thus taking the majority. Support mains are also very vocal.
        It is more that devs have absolutely no idea how the game is actually played

And you are not wrong. And they fail to realize that is why they are having less and less tanks
Just add back the second tank
    Then we get double shield again especially when they nerf the tanks’ offensive capabilities to readjust to 2 tanks. Then no one is happy again.
        "BUT DOUBLE SHIELD THO"

Orisa has no shield. Ram's lasts 4 seconds
            And you don’t think they wouldn’t adjust the tanks accordingly? The reason the tanks are all souped up the way they are (and why the tank matchup / tank diff is so profound) is because there’s only 1 of them. Re-introducing two tanks they will likely gut many characters’ offensive kits - like probably reverting rein to one fire strike, or make it like 70 damage or something, nerfing charge back to entirely committal or even lower damage than it is now *because it isn’t nearly as committal*; make ram shield last longer and reduce punch damage / annihilation uptime; make zarya go back to the 1/1 bubble
                I'd take this any time vs getting targeted with every single CC the enemy has to offer every 8 seconds because there's only 1 tank.
                    ... you still would be targeted. Too much CC was the biggest complaint of tank players for the entirety of OW1.
                        yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
                        And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
        It feels like most people that complain so hard about double shield forgot that the double shield meta wasn't nearly as long as they act. The last like 1.5 years of overwatch 1 for example was already without it.
            It’s not even double shield so much as it is that everyone acts like this 1 tank game is so shit like we didn’t all have gripes with everything beforehand. Double shield, flashbang, doomfist as a dps, brig, stuns were crazy; the state of tanks in OW1 got so fucked up that they literally had to force a 2-2-2 role lock to make DPS usable in their esports league (and probably higher ranks too). 

Do you realize how bad it was with multiple tanks? Having that freedom *literally* invalidated… 38 heroes now, Doom was a dps, JQ/Ram/Kiriko/Sojourn/LW/Illari didn’t exist - we would have had 8 tanks and a total roster of 32 with 17 DPS? A specific combination of tanks - Rein/Zarya/Dva just completely invalidated the entire DPS roster in the highest level of play because why would you ever use a 150-250 HP hero when you can use 400-600 that have just as good or better damage?

In Open Queue in OW2 it was still enough of a problem that they nerfed the base health pools of the tanks. 

Reverting to 6v6 would just create new problems. Rn just please nerf orisa and revert turrets, shit is so unfun to play and play against. Orisa literally has minimal mobility and doesn’t have explosive damage but she lives forever and her cooldowns are amazing so it doesn’t matter and I have to play her anyway, and why they wanted a torb/bastion meta is beyond me.
        I liked double shield. More often it was a shield and an off tank.
            Bruh if there’s an offtank that’s not double shield 😂
                …Obviously. More often though it was not two big shielded tanks during that era. Sometimes there would be double shield and sometimes one shield one off sometimes two off tanks. But even when there were two shielded characters yes I liked that. People just were too dumb to shoot the shield
                Sigma?

??????????? 

Did you even play overwatch 1?
            The problem is their no fucking off tank role. So more often then not you end up with the 2 mets tank.

You think rein, Winston was fun? Or zarya, dva? It was horrible.
                Rein Winston was an actual fucking blast my guy

You walked over double shield because both your attacks ignored shields
                    To play... i'm talking about playing against.
        Make an offtank category then, without shield tanks there.
            And now queue times are even worse because so few people wanna play tank already since all the blame falls on them 😂
        Orisa. Ball. Ram can punch through shields. Double shield would not be a good comp in ow2
People are endlessly not happy with the state because it hasn’t been in a good state
If only we could have… idk… an equal number of them in comparison to the other roles! No, that’d make too much sense
Maybe bcs 5v5 inherently sucks major Wrecking Balls
It's almost like the game wasn't designed for only one tank and Blizz can't figure out how to make it work
What if there were TWO tanks? Like maybe idk, an off-tank role. Sounds crazy I know, but maybe they could try it out....
just bring back 6v6. Problem solved.
    In turn, DPS and Support have to lose their passives.
        I'm fine with that. It's either they lose their passives or people refuse to play tank.
Yes.

Nobody has been happy with the tank state since we moved to 5v5 with a single tank.

Therefore 5v5 with a single tank is probably the root cause.
Bring back 2 tanks. Adjusted tank HP in mystery heroes/open queue is nearly fine (may need some slight adjustments) and shows that multiple tanks can atleast be fine. 

Blizz dumped 2 tanks because of, atleast partially, their inability or unwillingness to address double shield meta. Well, in classic Blizzard fashion, rather than tweaking one thing at a time they made sweeping changes to everything. Blizzard dumped two tanks AND “fixed” the shield meta by introducing/reworking several characters that counter or circumvent the tank meta. (Ram introduced and a main ability ignores shields; Orisa rework to remove her shield AND counter Rein; DF rework to tank; JQ introduced and can out brawl the shield tanks etc)

Very frustrwtint
Bc tank inherently feels like shit in 5v5. Its extremely simple.
Almost like the Tank role in 5v5 is one gigantic mess.
Blizzard fault tank role was fine at 6v6 at 5v5 it plains suck
Oh man it’s crazy almost like there should be 2 tanks
One tank/5v5 sucks, that’s the answer. Two tanks allows for more countering and recountering even when there are strong/meta tanks. 6v6 was better even if there were pacing and balancing issues, tank synergy was such a fun part of the game and they killed it in favor of a CoD style run n gun game. They’re left trying to tweak the tanks on the margins and it still causes big time balancing waves. 

And there is also the very real issue of a significant tank diff just deciding the game before it starts. If there is a definitive gap and the better tank gets pocketed (and the heal/DPS battle isn’t like a high Diamond vs. Silver situation) that game is just a waste of time. Two tanks can allow for a better tank to cover big time deficiencies in the others game to where it works. A bozo diving DVA can actually produce value in spots if a good Rein is peeling for healers and providing a front line. When you isolate one player to a role that requires a ton of awareness and versatility in playstyle, probably going to cause issues, and it has.
It's almost like removing a tank had negative repercussions. Inb4 the 5v5 has no flaws and is easier to balance shills
Because Tank was designed with having 2 tanks, a main, and a side tank, but now in OW2 you only have one. Tank needs a complete Rework
The game has been shit since they ditched 6v6 anyway
Yeah its almost like 5v5 was a bad decision
The game is fundamentally broken without two tanks.
    Didn't OW1 also have forced Tank mirrors (e.g Orisa + Sigma; Roadhog + Zarya; etc)?
        Because the devs abandoned the game for years to work on “””“pve””””
            [deleted]
Part of the problem was them removing one tank which created this rock-paper-scissors playstyle.

I truly believe with minimal balance tweaks (like Zarya going back to only one bubble for her and teammates + open queue health) two tanks can work.
Wow, gee whiz, maybe removing one tank and then making the remaining tank the focal point of the entire match was an easily avoidable balance nightmare. 

Thanks again blizz
    > making the remaining tank the focal point of the entire match was an easily avoidable balance nightmare

It happened the same in OW1 when your co-Tank is being bad + useless and the enemy team has an extra player to bully you.
        “Your team was worse when one of your players was bad…”
            But bad Tanks are very hard to carry.
                Exactly. Now imagine they removed the other tank from the game altogether so you only had one tank. And then THAT was the bad tank.
                    With one less Tank, the enemy team has one less peeler and more chanced to be picked or dived.

It can still work if you're an amazing sniper who can pop their heads but how's that going to work in 6v6 if the enemy team runs Double Shields?

As Support, I have more room to do damage as I have only one Tank to heal and my damage won't be blocked by enemy two Tanks.
        I don’t see how this matters
    Oh just don't thank them yet, they are still doing their very best to butcher the game. It's taking them long but they will soon get there.
    Its almost like 2 tanks were an even bigger nightmare to balance and every player was crying for a solution...
        And the solution we get instead is multiple support abilities that prevent anything from dying. So instead we have a gigabuffed orisa which doesn't do much except cycle damage reduction cooldowns with a brief 3 second window in which she is killable but instead she gets yoinked away by lifeweaver, suzu'd or immortality field and you have another 20 seconds on cycling cooldowns before it happens again.

Lets be honest the current meta is equally as shit if not more so than double shield.
        Incorrect
            Its not, overwatch 1 had more balance issues than overwatch 2, people are just quick to forget.
                Nope
                    Wanna expand on your obviously wrong opinion?
                        It's not wrong
                            It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
        The only solution Blizzard has left is to remove the tank role.

It's their only solution because Blizzard is shit at game balance.
hmm, almost as if the double tank of overwatch 1 was better
Season 3 was best state of 5v5 OW2 so far. It's a downhill since. They messed it up further every single patch. Rein and Ball was good picks in that S3 meta but everything was viable.
    It went downhill as soon as they chopped it down to 5v5. Game was boring when it released. If you could even get in to play it
I mean wasn’t every tank outside of JQ and Ramantra designed for OW1? When they take away a whole slot you will have a hard time balancing the role. If your tank sucks you’ll likely instantly lose. I think all the tank criticism is fair.
    > If your tank sucks you’ll likely instantly lose.

That applies the same in 6v6. Your team has one bad useless Tank, it's mostly a loss.
        Not nearly as bad as having a bad tank in overwatch 2.
            Depends which role you're playing.

In 6v6, Tank hurts the most when another is being bad because he/she will be bullied by six players, meanwhile DPS + Supports are affected the least.

In 5v5, DPS & Supports would suffer along.
                Doesn't depend on which role you play. A bad tank in overwatch 2 is horrible for everyone in your team, a bad tank in overwatch 1 is more managable.
Tank needs an overhaul, can’t go from 5v5 to 6v6 and expect the one class that got the cut to just work itself out. Otherwise, there will always be an unbalance and 1 or 2 tanks running rampant
As a diamond support main. The biggest reason I got to where I got is because I make the tanks life as easy as possible.
I had 4000 into OW1 and highest reached was Masters on Tank and Support (always sucked at DPS). I absolutely loved Rein + Zarya, Dva + Winston, etc those classic tank duo combos. Double shield was awful but that wouldn't even be possible with Orisa not having a shield.

I jumped on OW2 for the first time in forever and was just winning every game on Dva and Zarya. It is fun but it feels empty I miss the inherit synergy's and I play primarily tank so being the only tank just feels like you have to be on your A game 100% and sometimes it feels that certain tanks don't die if their supports are better. 

Also I believe OW is always at it's best when Rein is viable since he's got a million ways to interact with and counter and it makes me sad I wonder when the last time you heard someone say FATTY SHATTY. 

OW1 definitely had it's issues. Double Shield was miserable and made a lot of people hate the game, overtuned launch heros like OG Brig were a nightmare and CC was rough. 

I think Tank will always be fun to me I love it so much. I don't know why it always clicked for me. New Supports seem crazy compared to old supports like I remember when Zen and Ana were scary but required a lot of positional awareness to be good. It feels like every support has an escape for free option now. 

(This is all my opinion as a veteran of OW1 and just coming back and playing for one day).
This is what happens when you put only one tank per game.

Overwatch tanks were built with synergy between each other.

They removed a tank slot, but didn't even rework or adjust characters for a one tank strategy.
Introducing 7v7. 

1 tank + 1 off tank + 3 DPS + 2 healers.
A symptom, not a cause. OW2 is trying to be too many different games. 

5v5 favors highly competitive skill based setups with the power difference between tanks and other characters. 

6v6 was much more casual as characters were relatively even in their total power. Matchups existed, but across entire teams they rarely broke anything, except some standouts like Sombra removing Lucio's ability to do anything at all or widowmaker being able to bruteforce anything that is not a shield.

They are balancing like the game was built for skill based competitive 5v5 with disparity in power based on picks. But also retained a lot of casual 6v6 stuff, where output and effort don't corelate (ex. Moira vs Ana, Doom or Ball vs any other tank current). Blizzard is trying to make two different types of hero shooter (+1 PvE) in one game, to maximise player appeal but its resulting in friction because they are not truly compatible... Mutually exclusive if you want proper balancing and player feel for being a competitive skill based hero shooter, or fun for all team focused hero shooter for a casual playerbase.


Of course they could have just maintained the original game and made it even more casual, and used the OW2 title for PvE and a more competitive format with a F2P model so anyone who wanted a more competitive version could play there. Adjust the hero pool and balancing, maybe share cosmetics maybe start from scratch (not taking the original away anymore after all).
Yeah bliz can’t balance with a singular tank. We need 6v6 back or we need to accept the tank role is now volunteer work. Thank your tank, they didn’t want to play that role
    > We need 6v6 back or we need to accept the tank role is now volunteer work.

And then we'll get DPS mains instant-lock off Tanks.
Only one tank = slightest bit of survivability buff breaks meta
You know, maybe this problem would be somewhat fixed if there were two tanks...
    And then we'll get DPS mains locking off-Tanks (e.g Hog, JQ, Zarya) to avoid long queues.
        They'd quickly find out that they do not really like those heroes, and if they end up liking them, good, now we have more tank players.
Balance tanks around there being two.

Go back to 6v6.

Everyone happy.
    Nobody was ever happy with overwatch balance
    > Go back to 6v6.

Competitive Overwatch will say otherwise.
        I really really really am tired of listening to competitive players
            For some reason the game seems to be developed around the two ends of the bell curve and not the huge majority in the middle.
                An item of character broken in competitive may be balanced perfectly for the average level gameplay. But then it gets nerfed do to competitive leaving every one else out to dry
            But that side has more players who have deeper knowledge to this game.
                I really don’t care, I am tired of casual players being f’ed over because competitive players wanna be whiny
                    And they represent such a small portion of the community and an even smaller portion of the community if they’re from the top ranks. Listening to like 5-10% of the playerbase is ridiculous
                        Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
                            OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
                        And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
                            People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
                            I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
                    because casual players aren't whiny ? lmao
                Then they can find another game to screw up with their "competitive" opinions.
People say the problem with tank is 5v5 but that’s not true, it’s because the support role is absurdly strong. Tanks were extremely strong until after season 2. Supports have the strongest abilities, ults, and stats.
    > it’s because the support role is absurdly strong. Tanks were extremely strong until after season 2. Supports have the strongest abilities, ults, and stats.

Yeah. Because of this (plus SR inflation), my Support goes up from Master 5 (S2) to GM3 (S5). In turn, my Tank peaked in Master 3 (S3) but dropped to Diamond 4 (S5). Support hero picks and performance plays a huge factor for many outcomes.
        S1 of OW2 with the DPS speed passive (and support players not wanting to adapt to actually having to think about positioning and dueling, lets be honest) has resulted in support characters being absolutely busted lmao. They are straight up the best duelists in the game, i'll take a 1v1 against Ashe or Bastion any day instead of Baptiste
        It doesn’t help that the community parrots whatever the idiot flats says. Wahh wahh zen is such an issue when he’s the easiest character to counter (besides hog but I play hog so whatever). 

I firmly believe Ana is the worst designed character in the game. She destroys every tank except Zarya. Anti-nade makes being a tank awful, and sleep is literally the strongest ability in the game. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been slept and instantly killed because of it.
            > Ana is the worst designed character in the game

Ana is like reworked Hanzo who has many strengths that outweigh her weakness. Support self-heal passive makes her gameplay more forgiving and she has a hidden passive which is her small wonky shape hitbox. Self-heal passive + small hitbox can be huge lifesavers unless she's attacked by Winston / Moira beam; Torb / Sym turret.
    > it’s because the support role is absurdly strong. 

this sub is absolutely not ready for this conversation, the slightest support nerfs are always met with endless complaints
        Some context: I played a few games of comp yesterday for the first time in a couple months (Diamond OW1/masters OW2 across the board).

Nothing dies, save for one-shots. The sustain is unreal, especially with LW/Mercy comps. I’m watching 4/5 players sit on main and survive via healbotting.

I think it would take a global 10% reduction in healing to make the game playable.
    Illari with her 2 shot headshot be like and a nuke of an ability
        Honestly her pylon is crazy on defense too. There are times where I can’t secure a kill on winston because I need to take out the pylon first and my bubble just goes down.
Solo tank is just actual bottom tier ideas, imagine how easy it is to just 5v1 the tank. Theres literally a reason why bastion is in meta rn, and its up to the dps to either try to help or lose and just blame the tank. This never existed when there was 2 tanks. 

Ive played ow2 on and off since its either really good or really bad, but i have to be honest, the only fun tank to play atm is junkerqueen. placed d2, then i go on a 9 loss streak. This almost never happened unless youre getting stream sniped. 

Only thing that would ever fix the game is bringing back the other tank, zero need to have so much pressure on such an important role that can easily be focused and removed from the equation depending if the randos hes playing with decide they dont feel like playing widow genji instead of mirroring their comp (think u talked about this being pains of the past, well idk what role u play but it still exists)
Can we just try 6 v 6 at least that will quell nostalgia for it or even confirm it works better. Maybe just a one season tester not even a comp version just an arcade or quick play.
    > Can we just try 6 v 6 at least that will quell nostalgia for it or even confirm it works better

Flanking Hogs: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
        Oh no better send my off tank.
Yeah, it's ALMOST as if the change over from 2 tanks to 1 tank was incredibly short sighted and in the long run did nothing but harm the entire games balancing.
no one wants to spend all game counter picking. like top comment said all tanks should be viable against all tanks.
    Thats not possible
        I don't see why people dont get this, It's simply not possible for ALL tanks to be equally viable unless they are cookie cutter copy and paste designs. 

Not only that but it goes against what overwatch is meant to be if you are picking a single hero for all maps and team comps.
            They didn't say equaly viable but overwatch isn't a 1v1 game. The 4 other player should be able to offset the tank difference to a point it doesn't matter.
        [deleted]
            dva has massive armor and mobility. zarya doesn't shutdown dva unless dva wants to. dva's biggest weakness is that she has a huge critbox yet zarya doesn't even crit.
                [deleted]
                    zarya has only 15m range with her beam and she is super slow. dva can use the all map and engage/disengage at will. zarya beats dva only in certain brawl maps if dva has to brawl. 

zarya is the brawler. different archetypes yet still dva is strong. if zarya is not high charge or doesnt have bubble available, dva can kill her face to face. It takes almost 8 seconds to demech dva.

dva is 146 dps. lets say she is 50% accurate face to face 75dps. she can crit too.

max charge zarya 130dps (w reload). Let's say she is high charge but not max. 100dps, 100% accuracy.

zarya 475hp

dva 350hp 300 armor

do the math. if there are any healers, dva is easier to heal and her armor increases the effectiveness of heal. zarya is harder to heal due to her slim figure and there is no armor.

this zarya counter dva knowledge is very old and outdated at this point. there are a lot of nuances in the match up.
Because 5v5 sucks
It all started with 5v5, then it went downhill from there...
    I don't want to go back to long, slow stale games.

I don't want to pair with flanking hogs.
        Then get used to this Meta...
            I actually like it now.

5v5 means I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs can sod off.
                We can agree to disagree.
        I prefer more tactical gameplay than this shithow of a game we have rn.
            > I prefer more tactical gameplay

What tactic? Tanks being shieldbots, DPS shoot shields, Supports being healbots.

I'm glad I could do something more than just healing.
                Shieldbots? Did you play for like 4 months during double shield meta and nwver again?

Healers were also just healbots when you don't understand your role.
What is a tank?

I know what DPS is supposed to do. I know what support is supposed to do. Both have direct feedback (saved crazy out of position genji, eliminated silly echo, etc)

But the role of the tank isn't as easy and the feedback often isn't there. Take space? That's not as simple a concept. You don't get a happy little sound when you've done that. Mitigate damage? Sure, feels great when you eat an ult but otherwise it's just eh. 

OW2 sought to make tank better by eliminating the one and powering the other up. But this led to tank diff problem. Because there's only one tank, it's very important to shut them down. Conversely, it's important as a tank to get value. Hence the frequent swaps that end up at the lowest common denominator of zarya or orisa. 

Other than maybe hero bans, I'm not sure how to get around the problem in 5v5

Everyone has individual impact in 5v5 instead of just the Tanks in 6v6.
The reason is 5v5.

Playing Tank is literally playing Counterwatch nonstop now.

It's not fun.
They need to nerf dmg role and support role or buff the other tanks. There’s simply too much bullshit for one tank to deal with. Also nerf mercy movement, tired of her flying half way across the map back and forth every 2 seconds. Or for fucks sake just buff tank mobility to keep up.
It is so poorly designed, i will never understand how it was shipped in this state and even less why it still exists like this, there are several big overhauls that i think is more then needed to make the role feel even slightly appealing, like reduced CC effects and negative status effects on tanks, you can just keep chucking nade, dynamite, orb, cass nade, hack, rock, javelin, bleeds, trap, hook, freeze on the tank and get very good value from it, so instead of being a bullet sponge who tramps through it, you are a anti-fun magnet who have to suffer through all the shit the enemy team has on cool downs, why would i want to do that? if throwing all of that at me meant less value, but putting a dent on a more important target there would at least be a reason try to work around me as a tank  


Heroes with so many tools and/or survivability that being close to a tank is not that big of a deal is just insanity, why should Mei be ok with being in shotgun range of Junker Queen? why should Winston have to run for his life when he is close to Reaper?   


Blizz changing things like "Axe now does 75dmg instead of 50dmg" is like prescribing over-the-counter painkillers to a cancer patient, they have not even started on fixing the real issue which is that a tank should not be a DPS with more health, slightly reduced knockback and maybe a shield, it should be its very own role with its very own rules, ana nade lasts for X% of the time, discord orb gives less effect on tank, tanks get less slowed by freeze and can break cryo freeze, reapers life steal is reduced on tanks.  


I would also like if suzu did not do anything against ults and Mercy take more damage while being in the air for X amount of seconds, but ill save that for when people start complaining about support again
Idk, I just play characters I like and am good at and tend to just win a lot of the time
Just delete the game, re-release OW1 with just ana as the new hero. 

Brigitte killed the game and forced us to have role queue due to GOATs being the only option regardless of map, by the time role queue released people had enough and couldn’t stand it anymore. 

Meta’s are fine to be honest … 6v6 was fine … the problem is when a heroes fundamental abilities can create an unbeatable meta no matter how you balance them then you’re fucked. However, rebalancing heroes season to season keeps the game fun. GOATs was fun for 1 season… Dive was fun for some time too.. each meta can be fun until it gets stale. 

Best case they could’ve just deleted Brigitte from comp mode and cut their losses on time spent on something crazy OP. Other heroes that some people hate for example Moira who is super low skilled actually isn’t that OP especially when you get to the high tier. 

That new support hero though that can 2 shot squishes. KEKW… OW2 is really fucked up and it’s so sad to see a franchise I loved die
This problem could be fixed if they just brought 6v6 back. Having 1 tank in your game encourages counter picking and a lot of these heroes were not balanced for 5v5 anyway. I personally like 6v6 because if I’m getting countered as a tank, the second tank could help cover my weaknesses and vice versa.
Just fucking delete the tank role at this point. 3 DPS and 2 Supports, whoever kills the other team better wins. Make all snipers do 1 damage so there’s no more one-shots in the game. Remove every single CC, invuln and healing ability for DPS. All abilities now have 45 second cooldowns so you can only use it once per engagement, you whiff it you lose it. 

There, I fixed the game. I will be expecting a job offer soon, Blizz.
    Mercy waiting 3 team fights to fly to her widow on 1hp
What if they made 2 tank roles? Like a 6v6 situation?
    Instant Main Tank queue, but longer off Tank queue.

I think it's bad like if your Main Tank locks Rein in maps like Watchpoint: Gibraltar, you cannot pick Winston / Ball but DVA only in order to contest high grounds. Not sure if Doomfist were main or off, but Rein + Doom doesn't feel like a good synergy.
5v5 is really fucking boring for a tank
I really like to play tank, have a nice day y’all ☀️
You're leaving out season 4 and 5 where tank was the funnest role, this season it's absolutely agonizing and has made me quit the game
Honestly I'd be very happy with tanks in general if Doom and Ball were removed as options. They work against the understanding I have of the point of a tank and serve to split up your own team instead of form the anchor of it. The people who play them simply don't seem to understand how the extract value with their picks most of the time and instead cost the game while arrogantly insisting "trust me, I'm good" over and over then quitting the match.

It has happened so many times I can't take anybody seriously that picks these heroes and I don't want to play with them. I've been actively playing more tank just to avoid getting rolled for having yet another shitty Doomfist on my team. Playing Sig and JQ has been great fun and not losing every single game is also enjoyable.
    plat brain take
people don't want Tanks, they want fat DPS with one-shots
It shows a CLEAR problem with 5v5. This is what the tank role will always be like for as long as we will have 1 tank on each team.
It's the current trend. People got tired of complaining about Mercy, now it's tank time. The game doesn't have many issues itself, its the player base that creates them. People who want to have fun playing whatever hero they want, me for instance, are still doing so. =)
Overwatch 1, having two tanks let each tank have a play style and role in each fight and it was far less stressful and frustrating to deal with because it took more effort to counter pick you. Overwatch 2, with one tank, my only issue is 90% of the tanks have an immediate and reliable counter that easily ruins them in every situation EXCEPT Orisa who takes more coordination. Every time I go Rein I’m immediately hit with a Bastion. Every time I go Dva I’m immediately hit with a Zarya/Sym. Every time I go Doom or Ball I’m immediately hit with a Sombra/Bastion. Sometimes when I swap in my spawn I can actually watch the enemy swap in real time on the leaderboard. Every role gets their fun while tank is stuck playing Rock Paper Scissors all game across every mode. It’s just no fun trying 100% more than the other roles for half the result. Overwatch 1 I was almost Diamond in tank and sucked at most DPS and Support. Now I’m hard stuck in Gold on a 0-9 loss streak because every game I play is just Orisa, Bastion, Zen comps. I’d rather go play DPS and Support where losing is because I just wasn’t good enough instead of Tank where I lose because they have a single character that hard counters my entire character and doesn’t allow me to play the game.
    When OW1 was fresh new, it's mostly 1-4-1.
OW3 is gonna be 4v4. Rein will be written off in the lore. Zarya will die from steroid over use. Dva will choke on a dorito chip while Junkrat will accidenly blow up his buddy hog. Doom and Ramattra will kill each other because of Mondatta. There OW is saved. Gg.
And people ask why some players prefer 6v6. It's because two tanks make the game work. It helps tanks balance each other out. It helps balance the entire game out.
The real problem comes from only having one tank. People didn't complain about playing tank back in overwatch one.
    > People didn't complain about playing tank back in overwatch one

Chain'CC? Forcing Tank mirrors?

Many people instant-locking off-Tanks? Flanking Hogs?
        Yeah the rewritten history on 6v6 being so much better is funny.
            The thing is, 6v6 made sense. 5v5 is wonky as hell. The game fundamentally broken and doesn't function properly. Every patch is a flavor and band aid fix.
    >People didn't complain about playing tank back in overwatch one.

And yet barely anyone wanted to play tank. The reason queue times were so bad in OW1 was because you were waiting for a tank player to finally show up.
        ow1 was dead. people didnt wanna que tank in dead abandoned game.
Nobody wants to mention the fact THIS IS ALL ANAS FAULT. She is ruining the game. Sleep dart and antiheal with a game with only one tank and 5 players is absolutely not okay. What other ability completely turns the tides of entire games like sleep dart and antiheal without it being an ultimate and not a really quick cool down ability? Nothing and they're on ONE CHARACTER. 

Ana needs a rework. The entire game is balanced around her kit. Kiriko was basically made to try to supplement the issue but it's not good enough. 

Has anyone noticed that every single game has Ana in it and also has? People are far too complacent with her existence because she's an OG and loved. She's ruining the game for any tank or anyone trying to use an ultimate to turn the tides of a game. She needs her kit replaced or 6v6 brought back.
    Everyone will just jump into "Ana is fun" / "Ana takes skill to play" bandwagon thanks to her strong fan armor.

Btw, Ana isn't OG and her addition is the birth of powercreep.
        Well, she was released within the first months of overwatch existence so OG to me but that's not relevant.

The game is actually playable when there is less stunning and gameplay preventing abilities like hacking, sleeping, antiheal and doomfist and orissa jav. All these stupid moves need to be removed or changed a lot. 

But Ana..  being in every game and having a sleep dart with a hit box the size of a barn against tanks with the size of a planet with an antiheal grenade with the blast radius of a galaxy and both of these effects lasts wayyyy too long... if I see a single person say skill I will hit the roof.
The solution is easier than 6v6.  Either nerf support self-healing or buff flankers like genji and tracer.

Supports have received so many buffs over the last year that they are just as hard to kill as Tanks are.
    Nerfing Supports will cause much bigger outcry but I'm fine with that. Support picks and performances play the biggest factor of many outcomes.

Overtuned Supports + SR inflation got me up to GM3 as Supports in Season 5. All you need is to pick Ana / Zen and bully the enemy Tank to death.
The revisionist history of tank having no issues in a 6v6 setting is so wild to me. Low-key disappointed some people think that way. Tank has issues. 6v6 is not the solution. We'll create more issues in a 6v6 setting but OK. Anything pro-OW1 related gets upvoted here I guess.
That’s the thing though, you can’t really balance most tanks. The likes of ana, zen, etc will always bully tanks unless they’re over tuned like Orissa atm. You can’t really nerf ana zen because they’re pretty easy to kill as a dps or even another support. Y’all wanted 5v5 this is just the unfortunate aspect of the game now.
Probably cuz im hardstuck diamond but its fun af for me
I prefer tanks now because when I play the game normally, I don't have to sweat the other half of my team's tanking ability and I not being on the same page, or them not having the skillset, or having to stress about what Tanks I play and what Tanks qualify as main tanks. Tanking is fun, but the reality is there's always been a big psychological component surrounding it that makes people just wanna queue DPS.
[deleted]
    ive said this so many times and i dont know how many times i need to keep saying it. if we go back to 6v6 right now, double shield wouldnt be possible. i swear dps and support players use double shield as their copium that 6v6 was bad because they want tanks to be dogshit so they can be pretty much the only roles that matter. either that, or people somehow forgot that orisa got reworked and no longer has a shield. 

ram shield only stays up for like 3 seconds, which isnt long enough to be a strong tank for double shield. 

rein doesnt count because he cant do anything else while shielding, so he would basically have no impact 

winston would kinda count for double shield but who tf would play winston like that? his bubble would get destroyed so quickly and he wouldnt be able to dive if he has to keep putting barriers up so why pick winston
        Double shield was just an example. tank duos were always impossible to balance, if double shield didn't exist, we would just get a dive meta or a rush meta, with no option to play anything else if you wanna win. 

The counter-pick meta is the result of mirrors getting fixed.
Tank mains trying not to complain about their role in ov2 (impossible)

Tank was fun in seasons 3 and 4, people were just mad that they couldn't one trick their way to a high rank. Swapping to gain an advantage is not a bad thing, but it becomes a problem when a large portion of tanks in the game just become unplayable with the right combination of picks. Luckily though it's been proven with the 5v5 format that tank can be quite fun, they just need to re-evaluate how they're balancing (like why tf did bastion need a gigabuff)
Honestly, I understand why but I personally love playing Tank. It's definitely worth the stress, especially since I play dive Tanks.
I honestly think the whole meta is kinda whack right now. I played four games today that devolved into Zarya/Genji shenanigans. The only reason I picked up Zarya was because I kept getting counterpicked by her so I figure I would just mirror. Now I am playing her almost every game. I don’t really feel like Poke comps are effective anymore and diving into a brawl mess is suicide so now we have these mirror games. Rant over
This is the problem when you only have one tank. Nearly every tank is just slightly below busted and the moment a tank gets a buff he/she absolutely dominates.
    Tbh it’s more about the *perception* of the buff than anything else. People drastically overstate how firm the “meta” is in this game. Most people (like 80% of comp players) don’t even play the meta heroes/comps *correctly* anyway.
        You’re correct and so is the guy who replied to you. 

Meta is highly reflective of player experience and a lot of the tank feelings reflect more the strength of supports than the ranks vs each other. 

But Doom and Ball do struggle a bit being so easily disrupted with quick cool downs from a couple hero’s. 

It doesn’t even mean they are weak just other characters may be too unfair
            Agree across the board. Player hears that X hero got buffed->plays against that hero->loses->whines about how overtuned the hero is.

I literally had someone complaining about the Zarya buff yesterday because I was shitting down their throat the one round I played her. They were playing Orisa the whole game. *I didn’t bubble a teammate a single time that round*. Please good sir explain how the Zarya buff had *any* impact on the game whatsoever.

Edit: hey you’re the same person from the other comment chain lol
                i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
                    The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
            This is why I wish they would bring back the 6th player and just add a "bruiser" role hero's like doom, ball, hog, Mei, and brig are some chars that could be put into this role. A tanker DPS that can't hit as hard, it would be nice if your team is lacking in one are the person in said bruiser role could now play around that
        LITERALLY, the only tank that really struggles IMO is Doomfist and Ball, and that’s because sombra is so bullshit
            She's bullshit but 95% of the mouthbreathers who swap to her can't play her. Like. Sure, she's hacking me all the time, but she's 1-9 with a 30% winrate and is an actual detriment to her team
                This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
            honestly dooms doing good rn 6 sec slam and sticky block buff was acc perfect even he’s doing pretty good
            What rank are you in to say Doom is struggling? He’s one of the most played tanks and a positive win rate in comp right now, at least for diamond through GM. He has the highest win rate too among them except in GM where his win rate is just below Sigma’s.
                Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
                    How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
                        Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
            Rein is easily beat by orisa, Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers and get out of jail free cards currently in the game+ dam boost bastion can completely counter you with no counter play, JQ is just terrible to play into Orisa, Sigma is ok but your literally not going to be killing anyone unless they're very out of position, Dva can't reasonably kill anything for the same reason as Winston tho she does slightly better against bast. And all of these are destroyed by a zen just placing discord or bastion just existing. While I agree in lower ranks most are still viable, in a setting where most players know what they're doing and have proper CD management and positioning the majority of tanks just become plain unfun and weak to play. Dive tanks do not have the burst to kill anything, and all brawl tanks are weak into Orisa apart from Zaraya. It's not even tanks being the only ones affected by overtuned supports rn dive heros as a whole are just miserable to play into the current meta.
                > Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
            This man does not play reinhardt
        True, but also depends on which season. Stuff like Zarya in season 1 for example was played by pretty much every top 500 player in every region as the most played tank.
    Yeah they should just roll back to 2 tanks and be done with it. 

The game was originally balanced around it not to mention the community. 

This is so stupid.
        Was 2 tanks actually better in your opinion?

In my experience, the most the more active tanks, the harder matches are to balance.
Possibly unpopular opinion but I feel like the tank problem would’ve never gotten this bad if they left us with two tanks.
    Objectively correct.
        Nah, tank duos ruled the roost in OW1. It was the same problem except you needed both tanks players to be on the same wavelength instead of your one tank player to just be good at what they're playing
    Would it really? Two tanks were still meta defining in OW1. I think Blizzard just can’t figure out how to balance tanks properly, be it one or two tanks (or three or four during the GOATS meta).
        Yea overall I’d argue it was better feeling for the tanks.

Like yes 2 tanks has problems but it’s nice to have a back up. 

Like now it’s like oh great they have orisa bastion I’m on rein we’ll get fucked I guess.

In 2 tank you could have a dva harass the bastion greater negating the biggest problem faces in horse bastion match up. Don’t swap now and you’re basically fucked.

Previously it was more like an mmo you had your MT and OT.
        Okay fair point but I believe the game was objectively more fun with two tanks. I’m a tank main and it was nice to have another tank to help out. I actually loved GOATS. I agree that blizzard needs to balance tanks but I also believe it was lots of fun to play with another tank!
        The problem here is not "tanks are meta defining", the problem is "tank feels shit to play"
    OW2 was a mistake and 5v5 was never needed
It’s simple, bring back 6v6.
    bring back ow1
I’m not sure if this will be agreed upon or not but small changes shaking up the meta isn’t a bad thing in a game with this many heroes. It’s actually a good thing. 

It’s actually pretty normal and with a game like overwatch that has a large variety of heroes you wouldn’t want big changes because some match ups are so heavily skewed in one direction it would become a nightmare. It would only force hard metas to arise where you won’t have as much variety.
Idk why the devs didn't see this when they shifted to 5v5
    They didn't even realize that snipers needed to be nerfed until 6 seasons into OW2. This dev team doesn't know shit about shit, it's no wonder the game is only getting worse and worse
The only fix is 6v6. Think about it!
[deleted]
    Aye, then you can start almost predicting opportunities for insanely fast play.

So rewarding when you reach that point.
        I’ve been in a flow before where I would know what the other team was going to do. Like I was aware of where everyone was on my team, what the optimal position was to defend and apply pressure, AND I also remember thinking, oh this leaves us open to this over here, so I position myself waiting there and like 2 seconds later a lone DPS walks in and I get the pick. 

Rarely does that happen, cause it feels like my team also needs to play well enough to capitalize off plays like that but when I do get to play like that it’s amazing.
    Thank you for this. I'll take this in to consideration.
Like I don't HATE-HATE the tank role, i just can't play it too much or I get burned out hella fast (literally it is the only role I get when my friends and I ALL open que in a party IDK WHY LOL) 
There are games though when it feels like magic. I like to explain to my friends who are new that if teams were a snake the Tank is the head (brain and all), DPS is the muscle, and the Supports are the skeleton that props the team up. As the head of the snake when you and your team dominate (or even if you just dominate the other tank) the role can be INCREDIBLY rewarding.

But more often than not in my experience a game can be summed up like this one time i played a game with a DPS friend.

I, as tank, tried to make space. I died. I asked my friend where he was and why he didn't try to capitalize on the space I made.
He said it was because I didn't follow him so he couldnt have my back.

I paused, trying to take that response in without my head exploding.

I said "that's not how this works. YOU FOLLOW ME"
We won after he started following my lead but I don't exactly use a lot of coms with randos because my threshold for toxicity is very low hahaha
        This is why me and my friend dominate in any game if we're together, we have some crazy synergy, but as soon as one thing gets in the way of that or one of us dies or something, we get rolled 

Ex: Rein brig, Rein reaper, reaper cass, Ana Rein (we can both play all of these so these combos work really well)
    The thing is, the moment you slowdown, someone in your team suicide. In 4v5 state, you are a punching bag. So what ends up happening is that you wanna capitalize that 5v5 state before someone suicide like idiot.

What i end up doing is that picking Sigma and playing in autopilot idiot mode and praying my team wins the game. Otherwise you need a pocket support and dps needs to take off pressure of you and enemy shouldn't play Ana but enemy always plays Ana.
    Tl;Dr: play sigma for 50 hours then go back to your other tanks. You will be better at patience and waiting for enemy mistakes.
    This must be why I favour sigma so much and really enjoy him. Im the patient methodical type so enjoy being able to sit back and just pick away at them hoping to capitalize on any mistake or impatience. That and I like more traditional tanks.. too many feel like just beefier dps. Only downfall is when suddenly they whole enemy team jail breaks and it's 1v5.. I can only assume my own team got inpatient and all tried flanking and died.. I've also been in chat and been told that two enemy flankers killed the four of them while I was holding off 1v3.. which is a little disappointing.

I like rein too, but find it hard to balance when to be aggressive and when to be patient with him. Plus more open maps are more difficult
>It is SO STRESSFUL to be tank.

And it is more so in 5v5 than it was in 6v6! This was a clearly identified issue when they first toyed with the idea of 5v5. Many expressed it was too much pressure, while only a *minority* of people felt exhilarated by the challenge. 

* Attention being split between you and the other tank made it a lot less stressful
* Playing into a duo tank synergy is more fun than playing into the meta flavor of the month. Reinhardt+Zarya is more fun than anything solo tanking offers. 
* Even when you play mismatched tanks, two players on their one-tricks are going to have more fun versus a synergistic tank duo than a solo tank being overwhelmed by the meta tank pick, more of a chance to score some kills, and more chance to beat the odds. **Nobody talks about how 6v6 was more fun to lose at than 5v5 is to win half the time.**

It was suppose to reduce queue times, but by removing some of the most fun aspects of tanking, they culled their tank population even further. 

Some say 5v5 was also to remove Double Shields. That is also dead wrong! 

* The core of Double Shields was Orisa+Sigma. And Orisa lost her shield with the rework. 
* Reinhardt, Winston, and Ramattra are not going to enable double shields if you pair them with Sigma for each of their own obvious reasons. 

We really should just go back to 6v6. 

>AND deal with CC

Ana's Sleep Dart already selectively affects tanks less. 5 seconds base, 3.5 seconds to tanks. 

If they are truly committed to 5v5, they should go ahead and make that effect baseline for the Tank passive. 

* All crowd-control and debuff duration or effectiveness are reduced by 30% (slows, stuns, hinders, hacks, discord orb, anti-heal, etc..)

But frankly, that could be equally achieved, if not better, with bringing 6v6 back and just a 2nd tank either protecting the main tank or taking half the pressure by being another big threat like Hog or Ball.

The team is now focused on PvP, so 6v6 wouldn't grow stagnant like before under the watch of a PvE-focused team.
    I also feel like there are so many more things that ignore shields now. Ram punches, Sojourn ult, Orisa ult, and the already existing Moira balls/ult. And sym/charging healing off shields. I feel like the double shield would be less effective today than in OW1 and they could make more changes to make it work instead of just removing a tank.
        FR, if they wanted, they could literally make Sym's orbs pierce again. Not just shields but multiple characters. That was such a goofy ability back in the day. 

Many tank players enjoyed the game for 3+ years before COVID, lawsuits, and the content drought really took its toll. Through GOATS, through Double Shield, through countless games of Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony (the true banes of 2CP, the other maps were ok). They still ultimately had fun. 

Meanwhile OW2 tank depression rises before even 1 year.
        > Sojourn ult, Orisa ult

those don't ignore shields AFAIK
            Orisa ult does ignore shields. They buffed it during season 2. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and isn’t super consistent but it does ignore them.
            Yes they do.
                after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
                    Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
    They pitched 5v5 and EVERYONE who plays tank understood the issues that would come with it. Then they promised huge changes to make up for anentire 2nd person in the same mindset as you, and gave us "you have 2 fire strikes and can stop charging early." Aka stuff from experimental patches they held off years to give us so ow2 had SOMETHING.

People so overstate the influence of double shield when even if we had 2 tanks and lowered stats like you said, orisa is gone, double shield could have been dealt with YEARS AGO but again, was held off. Same with just cutting down CC.

Double shield wasn't a real issue anyway, walk through it or play stuff that ignores or destroys them in half a second. Friend and I played rein Winston into double shield and won every time.
    Terrible idea. 5v5 clears, and it’s not close
        5v5 blows and it's not even close.
        Oh man you got downvoted by the very vocal 6v6 lovers. 

I’m sorry man
            Oh no not my internet points!
                For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
                    I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
                        I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
                            You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                                Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
                        How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
        > Terrible reply. Opinionated cheer, and delulu~

*6v6 was more fun for MOST tanks.*

*Your argument is not only wrong, but woefully inadequate.*
            I’m the one crying? In this thread? Lol
If you are feeling stressed about your game sense, stick to hog and treat it like you are a DPS. Go in, get a sneaky elim and back off for healing. Save your self heal for when you are away from healer's LOS or if you aren't able to be healed in time. Take your time to aim hook. Hook is worthless when its on cooldown, so take your time and aim it. When you land a hook, flick your screen 90 degrees so that they face into your team. It's subtle, but your team will be more likely to follow up with your hooks if you deliver the elim on a silver platter like that.

Play hog until you get comfortable reading how the fight is going. Hog will teach you good positioning, when to peak and when to punish your enemies for their positions.

I would also say you should practice your general skill in game by playing "1k damage" in the custom game section and maybe try some of the aim trainers too. I learned basically all of my skill through 1v1 practice and now I can confidently take any 1v1 match-up and have slightly better odds than 50/50 (yes, I even practiced my junk against pharah frequently. They never see it coming).

    They must stop making hard counters in DPS, supports on tanks. Simply. Because there is just one now. Tanks should be immune to many hard counters or have abilities to resists to them (all tanks), even if they decrease shield, health, damage afterwards for balance.

In fact, maybe tanks are too strong so it means all have to counter him for easy win. Make them less important, and it should leverage tank diversity.

Either we buff them to resist so they are all playable (but maybe powercreep loop). Or we nerf them all to the ground, so it doesn't impact that much the game so people stop hard counter / focus tank.
    I've been thinking this awhile. Two tanks gave more options. In the absence of a second tank, in a game with so many potential counters, you need to give more options to tanks. They don't have to be good at everything, but at least have some better mitigation abilities, like characters in a fighting game. There is plenty of potential mechanics to expand on. For example, orissa spear is swallowed by sigmas suck. What if you could charge the spear by holding down and then it beats suck, but at the expense of being stationary and vulnerable? Same with sigmas rock and orissa's fortify. Now you have some additional play and wiggle room. Rein has a unused melee button. What if it gave him a short dash? So much more exciting. Anyways, these are just suggestions, but the point is to open up tanks gameplay options, so they have tools to help mitigate a specific situation so their immediate thought isn't to switch to another tank because they feel helpless.
People who don't want counter picking don't actually want to play a hero shooter.
    There's a difference between some counter picking being a thing and "you can just pick sombra/bastion/orisa to make 50% of the tanks absolutely miserable to play"
    Man is now defining a genre by its least fun mechanic.
        I'm defining a genre by its defining feature LOL
            How? In tf2, the defining hero shooter, counterswapping cant really happen as there’s so few characters to play that it’s generally not really helpful beyond swapping guns and maybe if one person is absolutely dominating u can focus him, but in other hero shooters like Paladins and Valorant u can’t even swap characters so countering is kind of impossible. Overwatch is the only game counter swapping is a thing, it’s important and i like it but it has nothing to do with the genre its in
            So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Personally, I can't wait to see what the enemy is playing so I can pick a counter. Even better when they see what I'm playing and pick a counter.
                You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
                > So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
                    "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
        I quite enjoy it, actually.

I like switching to Moira and dominating the Genji that was shitting on us. I like going Torb and making that Tracer switch off - hell, maybe they switch to Pharah and counter my Torb. Then I'm the one that has to switch.

Counter picking is a fun mechanic for some and mostly works as it should when it's DPS and support interactions. It's just unfortunate that it affects tanks so adversely and that's something that needs to be fixed.
No, they need to have abilities that aren’t too good at shutting down others ability
    Spear, Javelin Halt and Twirl is just basically a fuck you to any sort of attack.
No, you can prohibit people from swapping during the round. You pick a hero, you play it for the round. No mystery heroes bullshit. Obviously a system would have to exist where teams get to pick in order and see the heroes the enemy picked, like in Dota, so you don't end up with a terrible composition.
Because there is an "all-in" battle, easier for people to sync, and... fun? Now we poke from afar with orisa & hitscans until eventually, we have ults so we can push.
That's because these heroes are counterable
Because they have hard counters and you can actually play a variety of tanks into the mentioned ones
Ngl Orisa meta is better for sups and dps. You can kinda ignore Orisa but monke and dva can just jump on top of you and you can't do anything to them they are mega 5v5 tanks.
>with two tanks if the enemy picked one of your counters

The real problem is actually DPS heroes. If you start off as Winston and the enemy DPS are Reaper and Bastion, you straight up can't play the game unless they're completely incompetent.

Enemy team has a widow/hanzo/hitscan who can aim somewhat? Well, now you kinda need to be Rein or Sigma, or someone who can block their shots somehow. If you picked Hog, JQ, or Doom, your entire team is going to have a miserable experience.
    The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game. 

Playing rein into ana/zen is equally as bad as some hanzo/bastion, which is equally as bad as playing into orisa. And if you have all 5, you get a jackpot or some shit. 

The easiest gameplan to execute is to bully the tank. It’s easy to sleep the tank on cooldown, keep discord on them, spear them repeatedly, etc. It’s not some specific role that makes tank hell, it’s just playing tank that makes tank hell.
        >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.


Oh absolutely, my point was that most tank matchups are at least playable. But out of all cross-class matchups, Damage heroes have the most "anti-Tank" heroes (obviously), and since there are two DPS for every Tank, the dps players are free to pick the hardest counter, and exactly as you said: bully the tank. 

If you're a support being relentlessly dived by a dps, you can swap to Brig, Moira, maybe Bap or Zen if you really want to just take the duels. Most of those swaps aren't "hard" counters (like how Brig used to be able to delete Tracer with a full combo if recall was on CD) in the way Reaper deletes Winston by clicking m1 in his general direction, or how a symettra who doesn't place all her turrets in one spot can completely dogwalk Reinhardt.
            While I don’t think it’s disputable that dps have more anti tank options, I don’t feel they’re nearly as bad to play into as their support counterpart (ana and zen) or THE anti tank, orisa. I’d much rather play into the dps heroes because many of them have drawbacks that, as a tank player, you can capitalize on. Like playing into sym, to burst you down, that means she’s in your effective range. 

The same cannot be said for ana or zen, who require coordinated dives to deal with at high levels, and playing a brawl tank into them is just an instant L. And orisa is orisa, who gets to basically sit there and control your movements.
        in my experience bullying the tank is a bad strategy most of the time because of the sheer amount of healing supports can provide. That's why ana nade is so strong, but it's the exception to that rule
            No amount of healing is saving you from discord and a bastion.

And yes, anti is ridiculous, which is why ana was the best hero in the game for like 4 seasons straight. It took 3 consecutive nerfs to move her from best hero to “one of the best” now.
                The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
                    Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
        >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.

My flaming hot take is that role queue was the game's biggest mistake and hero swapping the game's second biggest mistake.

The 2016 crowd just wanted to hop onto games with friends and go pew pew pew. Instead, now we have to have a carefully designed sports team with roles that don't match the audience's composition (with the MMO holy trinity, way more than 40% of people want to play DPS and way less than 40% want to be healers). This leads to long queue times, which leads to players leaving, which leads to longer queue times, and the game spirals.

Instead of role queue, IMO the proper fix would have been to make the characters more similar to each other to eliminate hard counters, both at the hero level (Pharah vs Junkrat) and at the team composition level (3 support and 3 tank vs 6 DPS). DPS could largely remain as is though Pharah would need a rework, tanks would change to fat DPS, support would either be closer to Zen with weak healing or Mercy with single target strong healing, and the OW2 support passive could be extended to all characters so that you wouldn't need healers as much.

Hero swapping is a much trickier argument. I'd argue that the way the majority of 2016 OW1 players want to play the game is more like how you play Smash Bros - find a character that is fun and play them. The hero swapping never worked the way that Jeff Kaplan and his team thought it would and the rock paper scissors dynamic ended up being the worst part of the game because people just wanted to play who they want to play. Additionally, you could have per hero SR, which would help matchmaking quality. Ever tried to learn a hero but keep having to switch back to your main because you are unable to keep up with your rank? Per hero SR would fix this problem.

Of course there's two problems with removing role queue and hero swapping. The first is that this dev team is way too incompetent to pull this off. First they broke the game with Brig, then when they did role queue they didn't rebalance it for half a year, and then when they did 5v5 they reworked a measly 4 characters. There's no way they could pull off the changes needed to homogenize the cast enough to eliminate hard counters.

The second is that it's not what the current game audience wants. The people who have stuck with OW are the ones who like the unique heroes and the sports team like roles. I would argue that the majority of the game's 2016 player base would prefer my vision, but I also recognize that they are gone and trying to swap out a current player base to get back one that's already left would be a bad move.
    The problem with double shield was dps heroes too but nobody wants to talk about that.

Double shield got popular because damage kept creeping up, had to start doing that so that you could survive. Double shield wasn't fun, if you have the option to play more fun teams then you'd usually pick them.
        The lower the TTK is, the better it becomes to just sit behind a shield and blast away in safety. When you have things like hanzo spam and roadhog hook threatening instant death, why risk playing dive where your supports can be picked off before you even crack the enemy Rein's shield?

Damage needs to come down across the board, and so does healing. The only things that should deal 225+ damage are ults, and damage boosted Widow/Hanzo headshots.
            Cut down the damage and cut down the cc and double shield would basically drop off the map, they did one but not the other.
                They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
    that also leans back into 2 tanks though. if you're rein/zarya and they switch to bastion or junk, your off-tank can swap and you can stay as rein

if they switch to widow, 1 tank can switch to Winston and effectively stop it, while still having 1 main tank. in 5v5, if you switch to Winston to counter, your entire team has to either swap to dive or wait until your grouped. I think 6v6 was way easier to deal with counters, now with 5v5 you're changing the comp with no safety
    At that point it’s the job of your other teammates to support you. I’ve played Rein when the other team had a bastion and it’s the job of my DPS to help alleviate pressure. I’ve had games where widow is killing my supports and maybe I went doom so I could help them. Match ups are entirely within your role and a key part of the game is working with your team as a unit to cover shortcomings.
    >Enemy team has a widow/hanzo/hitscan who can aim somewhat? Well, now you kinda need to be Rein

Every day I'm reminded of how different low elo is.
    this is simply not true, you just need to get good. it’s hard but look at dafrans winston gameplay. It’s not impossible

The only way you’ll
even really have trouble with hard counters is in gm, you can get away with a lot of stuff in the lower ranks

You dont deserve t9 climb if you can’t outskilll your own rank

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
        What you describe only works on the perspective of Dafran, a GM player. If you are not at that level, of course you won't be able to play against counters. You know why Dafran's Winston only have trouble with hard counters on GM? is because those are player on his level. And if you follow your advice, "git gud", then you'll face people who also, "got gud", which will be countering you at your level.

I have no idea how you can consider what you just said constructive at all.
            you just need to get good, at lower ranks people just don’t know how to punish. Winston has an escape mechanic and a bubble to juggle on a short cooldown

I am said it’s hard, like playing most tanks but not impossible

Also if people are struggling in their level then it means they’re supposed to be at that level until they improve

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
                Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
                    What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
                        ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
                            if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                                Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                                Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
Similar thing happened with 2 tanks back then. Let's not forget how meta transitioned from goats when open queue was standard to double shield when role queue was standard. I remember very short burst of time where we had old orisa hog or rein zarya as the meta. They were enjoyable metas but even then counters were a thing. The only difference was you'd counter the duo rather than 1 target. More often than not the counter to tank duos ended up being brig or just blowing up tanks with reaper or something similar (role queue). As for goats, there was no real counter, you just ran a form of goats back.
    I don’t even think the first designed argument have a merit. When many of the tanks were first designed the game didn’t even have role queue, so you didn’t know it was a one tank, two, three or even six tank comp until after hero select. It’s turned into an entirely different game several times, and they have adjusted the tanks or reworked them over and over. It’s not a question of the first design teams intentions (the game was also SO unbalanced at release)

But yeah, the rock-paper-scissor counterpicking feels too damaging toward tanks rn
    I’d argue the counters were… softer with two tanks? You might swap your off tank or main tank to deal with one element of the enemy team composition. There was more nuance, as opposed to rock, paper, Orisa.
    Double shield didn't come straight out of goats. It didn't even get big until about a year and a half before ow2 released.
I think the obvious solution to go back to 6v6 is make an official main and off tank category for role queue. 

That way you don't make it possible to choose two powerful shield tanks in a competitive match that was a problem in ow1. 

But they would have to rework some tanks to make them be a better off tank and remove the super buffs that made them viable as a single tank.
I'm sorry but it was still the least popular role and hated back then.  Not to mention don't get me started on shields.

If they bring back 6v6 they need to have dedicated heros role for main tank and off thank.

Just the thought if an zarta, orisa combo seem awful.
    Zarya is an off tank and Orisa is main tho lol
        That comment just shows people have no idea what they’re talking about lol
            They just like to bitch about the game because it’s hard to accept responsibility for your losses/shortcomings
Tank players were upset with the state of tanks for years back in 6v6 too, wym?
    Because of main tank experience and double shield, which was solved with tank passive and reworks.
If all Tanks are balanced that they all can get into the play, then rock-paper-scissors / counter-pick situation carries on.
    to be fair most tanks’ complains with getting counter picked is when it’s *the whole team*. one good fight on doom & it’s sombra/orisa/ana/zen/cas , one good fight on rein it’s orisa/bastion/mei, etc. Tank “rock paper scissors” isn’t as free as people make it seem. A good Dva can play into Zarya, a good Doom can play into Orisa, getting full counterswapped is what sucks
        This is true, but the people that don't understand this the most seem to not actually play tank. It is the people that yell at me for "throwing" since I didn't switch off the second the other tank switched to a tank that was better against me.
        Sometimes when the whole team counter-swap you, you may indirectly enable someone else in your team. I had games that enemies switch to JQ + Bastion + Reaper against me as monkey, this means none of the enemies could contest my mid-long range DPS.
            Yea, but were you, personally, having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks?
                > having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
    Better than meta's imo. I'd rather be able to play any tank instead of being limited to 2 or 3 or be "throwing"
        Well no you're still limited to 2 or 3 that are otherwise throwing, however they constantly change throughout the match as you and other tank counter pick each other

It's one of the core issues with only having one tank
            It was an issue in OW1 as well. Good luck playing Winston into Hog, even with a second tank.
                Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
                    Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
                    And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
        Nah they need to balance it so basically no tank hard counters another so it’s up to the skill of the player and not just “my tank beats yours because I picked it”
            that’s not possible with a game that is heavily reliant on abilities. by the nature of having unique abilities and weapons, different characters will counter others and get countered all the same. a truly balanced game would have to revolve around counter picking for the most optimal play. by nature of a competitive game, players try and win and will look for the most efficient way which is how metas form. if one character is even just a little better than others, a meta will naturally revolve around it
                It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
                    Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
                        Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
                            Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                                Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
                    i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
            6 v6 cures so many problems with overwatch 2
    Oh no, the game that has the unique feature of being able to change character’s mid game will encourage players to change character’s mid game
        I prefer counter-pick more than "pick this meta Tank or lose" situation.
    Rock paper scissors is infinitely better than play these two tanks or lose instantly
        You’re a gold player; you can play literally any tank you want and do just fine.
            woah there buddy, no need to be condescending… I’ll have you know I’m in the top 50% of all ranked players… I’m sure you couldn’t say the same…
                You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
                    nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
                        Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
                            Still better than you…  probably silver …
                                I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
                >  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
            Rank shaming in 2023 LMAOO
                its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
                Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
                    I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
                        No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
Felt so much better to tank. One enemy tank counter picks you? You still have the other tank player who can support you and you are not instantly forced to switch.
    yall have some *very* rose tinted glasses on.  the tank experience in 6v6 was 'load into hero select screen where other tank has already locked hog' * n
        Some diabolical revisionist history going ok in this comment section 😭😭
            it's pretty funny, i can vividly remember numerous OW1 tank queue sessions where i was just 'why the actual fuck do i play this game'.  but apparently it was some dreamland of zarya delivering perfect bubbles to rein being healed by ana and sped by lucio, or coordinated winston d.va dives on discord targets.  

it was a shitshow most of the time.  i liked 6v6 overall but am honestly having more fun tanking in OW2, if they tone down orisa a bit it will be fine
        I'd rather have a hog with me to eat some cooldowns than have sleep, anti nade and mag nade hit me when i drop shield.
            Instead the enemy went double shield. Where things like anti and discord could never get through, and you just lost if you didn't have the same broken tank synergy.
        Rose tinted glasses when I played overwatch 1 till the end and lost nearly all motivation in season one of overwatch 2?  Yall still use that argument all the time and think you won
    i have no idea what you guys are talking about. 

all 6v6 did was make you have to mirror comps or go double shield. and that always devolved into double shield poke meta. 

it's like i'm the only one that remembered how bad that crap was, and everyone complaining non stop in this sub. it was killing the game and overwatch was becoming irrelevant 

5v5 was a good change, a great change. i'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta 

i'm so glad the devs don't go back to that trash.
        Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

    5v5 was a good change, a great change. I'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta

Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

&#x200B;

Too much power has been put into the support roles imo. If there is to only be 1 tank then all the power and fun needs to go into the tanks otherwise why would anyone want to play the role.
            There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change. 

Clearly you don't understand that your opinion doesn't make something fact.
                    There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?
            
>Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

The short space of time of 2 years with 0 updates at the end of OW1?
                These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
            > Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

what are you talking about??

it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

and ow1 was practically irrelevant and dying at the time due to how boring the gameplay was playing the same heroes in mirror comp all the time 

> Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

dive goats and brawl were fucking braindead mirrors like i said. there was barely any strategic "flex tank" switching like you guys claim. 

> Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1
                >  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
                The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
                    I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
                    clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
                    

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
                        Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
                            Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
                        It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
    That's why there were so many tanks in ow1 🙄😒
        Queues flex. Gets support everytime.
    > You still have the other tank player who can support you and you are not instantly forced to switch.

what if i told you there are still 4 players on your team who can counter
        There are also 4 more enemies to counter you and only you.
    What?  You were forced to play the one other tank that was “best” with the other tank or you were flamed for losing the game. And in Some metas you would be losing the game. Tanking in OW1 sucked ass it’s why NO ONE DID IT.
Honestly. There's a part of me that wants to say.... just make tanks completely immune to cc unless it comes from another tank. Fuck sleep, fuck discord, fuck hindered, just make it so any cc applied to a tank does like, 30 Damage. In meis case make it so the tank does less damage will being hit by her Beam.
> best used on the tank.

Sorry, this is not true. It's situational.
    Very true!

My statement is more general. But the fact remains if the tank dies the fight is usually completely loat. Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. Not to mention anti alone is a free excuse to push.

Its why forcing anti is so important to playing against ana. 

But of course Ana can anti anyone for value. Tank is the easiest to anti and most do.

Most anas I play against just spam anti and sleep at the tank ad nauseum. And it works maybe 50% of the time because some tanks play poorly or some other reason.
        > Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. 

No, it doesn't. Do you play Ana? I'm just curious because there's a lot of....knowledge you're kinda skipping over. 

It's situational:

What is the position of you and your team when their tank dies? What is the position of the enemy team? What's the ult statuses (i.e Does their genji have blade? Does their Soldier have visor?) Are the enemy support cooldowns up or did they blow them? Is your team actually coordinating and working together? etc.

Ever since they nerfed Ana where tanks wake up in 3 seconds instead of 5, it made it significantly worse to sleep tanks.
            This is neither a dissertation on ana nor an argument.

Do you play tank? Have you played tank against Ana at higher levels?

From masters to GM anti was frequently used on me as tank, forcing me to wait or play passively or outright guaranteeing my death.

Nade is available every 10 seconds or so. And many fights across all skill levels will involve up to two uses of nade.

Nading the tank to stop a push in part one of a fight and nading a support or dps to secure an elim 10 seconds later is still nading the tank and still giving value.

Many if not most of the Ana's i play against are nading the tank with exceptions, of course (because no ability exists in a vacuum, and I never implied it did) 

Ive played enough ana and enough tank to know she is part of the readon tank is so strenuous right now. She is one of the most played supports for a reason.
If only we had something we could publicly test new features and changes on the game before they got permanently rolled out. Ugh if only
    Don't understand why they would ever remove experimental
        Because now we get a patch almost every 3 weeks. We get the season's patch, the 2 week patch, and the mid season patch. With how often we get updates, they won't bring back a mode to test features. They should do it to test future changes but we all know they won't
        Not like they actually used it anyway. They put charge cancel on there...4? 3? times and didn't implement it.
        Probably so they could force 5v5 on us. They didn’t make it so it could be tested and they could get feedback, they just implemented it and went “yup that’s how it is now.”
            The real reason I replied to the comment before you
> comp MH

Sometimes it took ages to get one game.
    Yep, and then you'll get only dps all game against 2 reins, 2 bastions, and a mercy and remember why you don't play MH.
it's really stupid and wonky
Not only would they have to re-balance the whole game again but then we would also go back to all the problems we used to complain about with 6v6 (no one wanted to play tank back then either, all the shields, support was less fun since you had to spend so much time healing both your tanks, etc) I feel like a lot of people in this sub only remember the good parts of OW 1 but that game had a lot of problems too. Me personally, I much prefer 5v5 and I feel like que times are much better now than they were at the end of OW 1 (despite everyone claiming this game is dead).
    they literally abandoned ow1. that was the root of the problem.
        I mean honestly that's a pretty good point. Blizzard is run by a bunch of idiots and I do wish I lived in the universe where a competent company had the Overwatch IP.
        People pull out old reason why 2 tank suck forget blizzard literally dont give a shit about the game state for 3 years. If they actually give effort and fix it non of those thing could happen. The rework of orisa in ow"2" have already fix some of the double shield problem. Kiriko suzu help counter alot of tank cc by her own, etc... It can be fixed if blizzard actually give a shit about their game.
    >Not only would they have to re-balance the whole game again

They haven't properly done that so far, so that's a non-issue.
        Thats what people fail to understand. Blizzard didn't rework everything for overwatch 2. They made minimal changes and kept most of it the same then tossed us in 5v5. Lazy fucks just made things worse.
    It's funny cause 6v6 was worst for 4 player out of 6.
        Not really supports were fine, you could make an argument for it being worse for dps but it was meta dependent.
            Support are way more fun now than they were before.
                Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
    They have a save file of last ow1 balance. It would be super easy to go back and just balance the new ones
        Double shield meta again 😍
            How is it double shield when orisa literally got reworked? Ram and Sig wouldnt work that well together
                But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
                    I feel sorry for you
                        Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
    How is double shield going to be an issue without orisa *having a shield.*
> go back to 6v6 

Then DPS + Support queue times become long again because no one likes to play Tanks.

We'll also get DPS mains picking 'buffed DPS' (primarily off Tanks like Hog, JQ, Zarya, Sigma) to avoid long queue times. Since Roadhog sucks now, they'll pick JQ instead because she's 'better Hog'.

Synergized Tank duos are cool but let's not pretend bad Tank duos also exist (e.g Hog + Ball torture). Imagine the enemy team runs a synergized Tank duo but your Tank duo is Roadhog + Doomfist; the enemy team has Double Snipers guarded by Tanks like Sigma, DVA but your Tanks are Roadhog / Junker Queen / Zarya.
    DPS and support queue times are already long. Just the other day I saw DPS and Support queue times both at over 20 minutes. No one wants to play tank right now because tank is miserable
        Yes! Tank que times is 5 seconds for a reason lol
        [deleted]
    Getting bad team comps is already a thing tho. Never played OW1 but  can two tanks fundamentally not be salvaged? I've heard some tank synergies were unbelievably annoying like Orisa/Sigma, Orisa/Hog, but I feel like it'd be leagues better than all the pressure being put on one person.
        Exactly! People don't understand that though. Or choose to ignore it
        [deleted]
            I wouldn't say it's pure revisionist. I used to be a tank main, as was a friend of mine, and we tried for a bit in overwatch 2, but eventually gave it up. I haven't really touched tank for about 3 or 4 seasons. I tried once or twice after I dropped it, but it just sucks now, imo. Too much pressure on one player, and you can't enjoy the role like you used to be able to. Not all tank players disappeared, but this one at least did.
                [deleted]
                    And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
    >Then DPS + Support queue times become long again because no one likes to play Tanks.

Which is ironic because my queue times on support now are way longer than ow1 during its life support period.

I'm currently averaging 7~10mins sup queue in qp no matter when i queue between 9pm~4pm my timezone.
        Because Supports is in the best state right now and many people are still enjoying / learning Illari and also buffed Lifeweaver.
    Support que times did not go over 1 minute in 6v6. DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports. 

Your second point makes no sense. Are people going to play tank or not? You can't have it both ways.

The third point also makes no sense. The whole point of role que is to pick teams that synergize well with each other. It would be the same with tanks. Why would people willingly play roles that don't go well with each other?
        > DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports.

DPS queues were minimum 20 minutes long at the end of OW1's life. And I have the screenshots to prove it. Plenty of old clips from streamers showing this too.

We can't go back to that, the game will die again if people have to wait 20 mins for a game.
            Dont forget that DPS queue times were so long that Blizz had to introduce Priority Passes (by playing tank or support) just so you can jump queue.

They HAD to incentivize tank and support just to cut dps queue times. And it was STILL long.
                We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
                    Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
            I mean they currently have bots in quickplay. I don't think it could get more dead than it currently is. At least with 6v6 there was enough players to start games without the need of bots
        Lmao, we had 15 minute queues for DPS a the end of OW1’s lifecycle. Everyone has rose-tinted glasses looking back at 6v6. Sure, it had its pros, but we can’t forget about all the cons. Too many people either forget that double shield existed, or are lying to themselves that double shield wasn’t that bad. We are complaining about tank being in a bad place because of rock paper scissors, but at least there is diversity there instead of being forced to play Sigma/Orisa.
            Yeah now it's just being forced to play orisa. So much better.
                Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
                    All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
                        You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
        But Competitive Overwatch preferred 5v5 more.

The best thing about 5v5, I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs / timid Reins or Orisa / slow lurking Balls could sod off.
            Except now you have one tank with literally all the pressure and way too many roles to fill in one slot, and if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.
                I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
                > if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
    >let's not pretend bad Tank duos also exist

Also why do ppl pretend you will always get good tank duos? In a lot of games when I was not tank, id get Zarya/Hog or Ball Hog or just straight up off-tanks.

Hell when I did tank, I was always relegates to main tanking because my duo always picks off-tank. I had so many hours on Orisa cuz of that. I rarely could play OT unless I instalock one when the match starts.
        [deleted]
            I feel like so many people ignore this aspect - mm was so dogshit for tanks because of hog.

It wasnt utopian, synergy barely existed.
    What if they specifically made the queue for off tank. And broke the tanks into 2 roles. Add a few more to both selections. The same could honestly be done for supports.
6v6 is infinitely inferior to 5v5
    No it isnt. The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back. Idk why some of you defend 5v5 so bad. We've tried it and it sucks balls.
        > The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back.

Source?
            remember when tank queue in OW1 was so long because everyone wanted to play tank because it was so fun?

this happened in season, uh, *checks notes*, it was season *flips through pages* look - the community has spoken
            Try just searching 6v6 in this sub. Or Twitter. Or YouTube. Or the overwatch forum. Everywhere basically.
            Trust ♪⁠～⁠(⁠´⁠ε⁠｀⁠ ⁠)
        I've played ow since the original beta.

6v6 is imposible to balance, two tanks is stupid and it is not fun at all.
            played for a long ass too, 5v5 is stupid and playing tank is not fun at all.
            Except with any end up with role q until shortly before echo came out, so all that time beforehand was either goats, or no limit
            Yeah cause 5v5 is so balanced rn
            You're in the minority here buddy. Balanced or not people have spoken and they want 6v6 back. The majority of players found it more fun even if it was less balanced.
                How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
                    I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
                        I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
                            I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
                I think the 6v6 folks are just louder.  The 5v5 guys are too busy playing Overwatch.

I personally come here to fight against 6v6 because I found it actively torturous and never want to go back to it.
                    That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
                        I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
                            I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
                        I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
                6v6 is not coming back. Deal with it.
                    We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
        > community has already spoken

Yeah, and they weren't playing tank because it was boring and unfun. A very vocal minority on reddit thinks 6v6 was better, while the people who like 5v5 are busy playing the game with the lowest queue times its ever had.
            Ever had? C'mon man we do not have to lie. People keep saying it's a vocal minority but just look at who's getting down voted and who's not. You can like 5v5. That's fine but like don't act like it's the popular position. Like people are in agreement that 6v6 is better. It just needed some tweaking. With the current state of tanks and supports 6v6 would work much better than it use to. The game would be fun again too!
                Reread my comment. This whole subreddit is a vocal minority. Not even 10% of players use reddit. Even on the other Overwatch sub 5v5 is vastly preferred. But once again you can't argue against the fact that queue times were insanely long in OW1 because nobody wanted to play tank, if you actually played it.
Supports were indeed the least favorable during Beta + Season 1 & 2, but the meta eventually shifts to favoring them. 

Bringing Mei + Cassidy CC hurt the Tanks (especially Ball + Doom) more. As Dive heroes were kept at bay, Supports like Ana + Zenyatta continue sh*tting the Tanks with anti-nade, sleep and discord.

Now the Tanks are died of being bullied so easy, Orisa is the answer to make enemies sad. It's 'me or them'.
    And Dva, Doom, and Winston got nerfed after the beta specifically because of how good they were against supports and because supports complained about it. Supports were balanced to be just as impactful as dps and suddenly support players weren’t having fun, it’s hilarious really lol.
    Cassidy’s CC is negligible and doesn’t effect any tank significantly other than doom and sometimes Dva. Mei is shit for tanks even without her CC, her wall needs to go as it’s what’s primarily what makes playing against her miserable. And yes supports were unfavorable, but instead of just buffing supports they also nerfed all the tanks increasing the power swing in favor of the supports and making it so multiple tanks are incapable of dealing with certain dps. Nerfing supports and the tank buster dps removes like 80% of the problems with playing tank
        Cassidy cc also fucks up winston. Want to jump back out? Nope.... and then insta melted by right click.
Let’s not talk about mercy
    Mercy needs to go, her movement is too good, her healing is too good, her buffing is too good
        she does 0 damage and low healing she's fine
            Mmhmm “low healing” for a lot of characters her healing is plenty to get a kill on a enemy not being healed. She also is extremely hard to hit for a lot of people because of her movement
        And yet she's maybe the worst support at the moment, bottom 3 at the very least.
Your post grossly understates what an absolute nightmare it was playing support the first few seasons. The role wasn’t “babied,” it had significantly lower player base because it was painstakingly unfun to play Dead by Daylight: Overwatch edition and get steamrolled by a Hog running around every six seconds because there was nothing you could do.

Couple that with far more limited choices to play as and yeah, the role was miserable and needed the help. Barring Hog and to a lesser extent Ball, the tanking isn’t even bad that now. Healing could be toned down a bit, but if you’re expecting to go back to “Raid boss” levels like season 1 and 2 you’re just asking to delusionally shift the balance way in favor of tanks again.
    More like support players got so used to be babysitted all the time they couldn't cope with the fact they now needed to think about positioning and take duels.

The original DPS passive was busted, sure, but it got removed really fast.
        You do realize the idea that removing a tank means also that supports too are far more greatly exposed than they were before, and saying “focus on your positioning” can only work so well for supports like Zen and Ana who have zero mobility and NEED to rely on their cooldowns to have a chance of getting away even remotely? That’s the entire point I’m making. Removing a tank increased pressure on everyone and going into OW2 and giving supports no additional tools to aid themselves beyond “move around better” only takes you so far. Not every character can Mercy or Lucio zip around in seconds.
            I'm not arguing that supports didn't need new tools to fit in the new sandbox. I'm saying that even when they had said tools, support players still felt underpowered simply because they weren't used to playing in such an active way. Now that they are, most supports are straight up busted.
    Tank still has the lowest player base and has so se OW1. I’m literally a flex player and play, Ana, Bap, Brig, and Lucio and all of them had impact and were fun to play depending on the comp, map, and  enemy heroes. Support players just got mad that they were just as squishy as the dps role so they had to play smart. Now we’re back to the brain dead support balance where they can 1 v 1 anyone on the roster because they have the strongest cooldowns and twice the sustain of dps. Dis supports need buffs? Yes, did they need to be power crept into oblivion well also nerfing the role that made them struggle? Absolutely not.
        I mean...of course it's going to have the lowest player base. You need one tank per team per game, thus of course the total number of players is going to be lower; the ratio of need for tanks is just mathematically lower at 1:2:2...? This should come as no surprise. If the tank population surged you would be waiting hours for a game.

It seems more like tank players wanted to be raid bosses to me and got a rude awakening when they realized the absence of a second tank increased pressure on \*everyone\*, including support players, and that it's just unfun to be dove in two seconds by a hog/doomfist and be unable to play the game. Also, if you're losing a 1v1 against a support that's more a reflection on you than it is on the role. Trapping a support should never be an automatic guarantee of a free kill. If you can't finish them off even with the sheer strength advantage...I don't know what to tell you. You should be easily able to kill a Zen/Ana as a [D.va](https://D.va). If you can't... Be better at the game, maybe?

Anyway, supports are going to stay roughly where they are, because they're all relatively balanced amongst each other and the role is finally good. Tanks will I'm sure get some sort of buffs/changed to compensate the role being stressful and more unfun (we see this with hog rework etc).
            That’s… that’s not how statistics work?? 😭
                That’s…that’s not how making an argument works?? 😭
    Also I can tell you don’t play tank at high level just by that comment. The only tanks that don’t explode randomly currently are Ram, Orisa, and Zarya.
        What’s your rank?
    Support low player base? Lol you obviously never play tank. Us tanks have been getting chain stunned into oblivion for years to the point bliz removed half of our slots because we all quit playing them because its not fun.
        You obviously didn’t read the rest of my comment because I specific stated season 1 and 2 where that was the case lmao
            I did. I just think you're delusional. Supp was hard for 2 ENTIRE SEASONS oh you poor baby. Tank has been terrible for like 4 years now.
                It actually just sounds like you’re a bitter crybaby who took my words out of context. Continue to cope and seethe; tank buffs are not going to make you better at the game lmao
> playing tank will always be stressful and miserable

Unless we turn all of them into hard-to-kill raid bosses and then we'll get complains from DPS & Supports who hate to play against unkillable horse, S1 Zarya, Beta JQ, etc.
they did 5v5 because they wanted to make it look like a sequel.
I guess Tanks aren't the majority.

DPS has lot of heroes, thus taking the majority. Support mains are also very vocal.
    It is more that devs have absolutely no idea how the game is actually played

And you are not wrong. And they fail to realize that is why they are having less and less tanks
Then we get double shield again especially when they nerf the tanks’ offensive capabilities to readjust to 2 tanks. Then no one is happy again.
    "BUT DOUBLE SHIELD THO"

Orisa has no shield. Ram's lasts 4 seconds
        And you don’t think they wouldn’t adjust the tanks accordingly? The reason the tanks are all souped up the way they are (and why the tank matchup / tank diff is so profound) is because there’s only 1 of them. Re-introducing two tanks they will likely gut many characters’ offensive kits - like probably reverting rein to one fire strike, or make it like 70 damage or something, nerfing charge back to entirely committal or even lower damage than it is now *because it isn’t nearly as committal*; make ram shield last longer and reduce punch damage / annihilation uptime; make zarya go back to the 1/1 bubble
            I'd take this any time vs getting targeted with every single CC the enemy has to offer every 8 seconds because there's only 1 tank.
                ... you still would be targeted. Too much CC was the biggest complaint of tank players for the entirety of OW1.
                    yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
                    And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
    It feels like most people that complain so hard about double shield forgot that the double shield meta wasn't nearly as long as they act. The last like 1.5 years of overwatch 1 for example was already without it.
        It’s not even double shield so much as it is that everyone acts like this 1 tank game is so shit like we didn’t all have gripes with everything beforehand. Double shield, flashbang, doomfist as a dps, brig, stuns were crazy; the state of tanks in OW1 got so fucked up that they literally had to force a 2-2-2 role lock to make DPS usable in their esports league (and probably higher ranks too). 

Do you realize how bad it was with multiple tanks? Having that freedom *literally* invalidated… 38 heroes now, Doom was a dps, JQ/Ram/Kiriko/Sojourn/LW/Illari didn’t exist - we would have had 8 tanks and a total roster of 32 with 17 DPS? A specific combination of tanks - Rein/Zarya/Dva just completely invalidated the entire DPS roster in the highest level of play because why would you ever use a 150-250 HP hero when you can use 400-600 that have just as good or better damage?

In Open Queue in OW2 it was still enough of a problem that they nerfed the base health pools of the tanks. 

Reverting to 6v6 would just create new problems. Rn just please nerf orisa and revert turrets, shit is so unfun to play and play against. Orisa literally has minimal mobility and doesn’t have explosive damage but she lives forever and her cooldowns are amazing so it doesn’t matter and I have to play her anyway, and why they wanted a torb/bastion meta is beyond me.
    I liked double shield. More often it was a shield and an off tank.
        Bruh if there’s an offtank that’s not double shield 😂
            …Obviously. More often though it was not two big shielded tanks during that era. Sometimes there would be double shield and sometimes one shield one off sometimes two off tanks. But even when there were two shielded characters yes I liked that. People just were too dumb to shoot the shield
            Sigma?

??????????? 

Did you even play overwatch 1?
        The problem is their no fucking off tank role. So more often then not you end up with the 2 mets tank.

You think rein, Winston was fun? Or zarya, dva? It was horrible.
            Rein Winston was an actual fucking blast my guy

You walked over double shield because both your attacks ignored shields
                To play... i'm talking about playing against.
    Make an offtank category then, without shield tanks there.
        And now queue times are even worse because so few people wanna play tank already since all the blame falls on them 😂
    Orisa. Ball. Ram can punch through shields. Double shield would not be a good comp in ow2
In turn, DPS and Support have to lose their passives.
    I'm fine with that. It's either they lose their passives or people refuse to play tank.
Didn't OW1 also have forced Tank mirrors (e.g Orisa + Sigma; Roadhog + Zarya; etc)?
    Because the devs abandoned the game for years to work on “””“pve””””
        [deleted]
> making the remaining tank the focal point of the entire match was an easily avoidable balance nightmare

It happened the same in OW1 when your co-Tank is being bad + useless and the enemy team has an extra player to bully you.
    “Your team was worse when one of your players was bad…”
        But bad Tanks are very hard to carry.
            Exactly. Now imagine they removed the other tank from the game altogether so you only had one tank. And then THAT was the bad tank.
                With one less Tank, the enemy team has one less peeler and more chanced to be picked or dived.

It can still work if you're an amazing sniper who can pop their heads but how's that going to work in 6v6 if the enemy team runs Double Shields?

As Support, I have more room to do damage as I have only one Tank to heal and my damage won't be blocked by enemy two Tanks.
    I don’t see how this matters
Oh just don't thank them yet, they are still doing their very best to butcher the game. It's taking them long but they will soon get there.
Its almost like 2 tanks were an even bigger nightmare to balance and every player was crying for a solution...
    And the solution we get instead is multiple support abilities that prevent anything from dying. So instead we have a gigabuffed orisa which doesn't do much except cycle damage reduction cooldowns with a brief 3 second window in which she is killable but instead she gets yoinked away by lifeweaver, suzu'd or immortality field and you have another 20 seconds on cycling cooldowns before it happens again.

Lets be honest the current meta is equally as shit if not more so than double shield.
    Incorrect
        Its not, overwatch 1 had more balance issues than overwatch 2, people are just quick to forget.
            Nope
                Wanna expand on your obviously wrong opinion?
                    It's not wrong
                        It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
    The only solution Blizzard has left is to remove the tank role.

It's their only solution because Blizzard is shit at game balance.
It went downhill as soon as they chopped it down to 5v5. Game was boring when it released. If you could even get in to play it
> If your tank sucks you’ll likely instantly lose.

That applies the same in 6v6. Your team has one bad useless Tank, it's mostly a loss.
    Not nearly as bad as having a bad tank in overwatch 2.
        Depends which role you're playing.

In 6v6, Tank hurts the most when another is being bad because he/she will be bullied by six players, meanwhile DPS + Supports are affected the least.

In 5v5, DPS & Supports would suffer along.
            Doesn't depend on which role you play. A bad tank in overwatch 2 is horrible for everyone in your team, a bad tank in overwatch 1 is more managable.
> We need 6v6 back or we need to accept the tank role is now volunteer work.

And then we'll get DPS mains instant-lock off Tanks.
And then we'll get DPS mains locking off-Tanks (e.g Hog, JQ, Zarya) to avoid long queues.
    They'd quickly find out that they do not really like those heroes, and if they end up liking them, good, now we have more tank players.
Nobody was ever happy with overwatch balance
> Go back to 6v6.

Competitive Overwatch will say otherwise.
    I really really really am tired of listening to competitive players
        For some reason the game seems to be developed around the two ends of the bell curve and not the huge majority in the middle.
            An item of character broken in competitive may be balanced perfectly for the average level gameplay. But then it gets nerfed do to competitive leaving every one else out to dry
        But that side has more players who have deeper knowledge to this game.
            I really don’t care, I am tired of casual players being f’ed over because competitive players wanna be whiny
                And they represent such a small portion of the community and an even smaller portion of the community if they’re from the top ranks. Listening to like 5-10% of the playerbase is ridiculous
                    Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
                        OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
                    And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
                        People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
                        I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
                because casual players aren't whiny ? lmao
            Then they can find another game to screw up with their "competitive" opinions.
> it’s because the support role is absurdly strong. Tanks were extremely strong until after season 2. Supports have the strongest abilities, ults, and stats.

Yeah. Because of this (plus SR inflation), my Support goes up from Master 5 (S2) to GM3 (S5). In turn, my Tank peaked in Master 3 (S3) but dropped to Diamond 4 (S5). Support hero picks and performance plays a huge factor for many outcomes.
    S1 of OW2 with the DPS speed passive (and support players not wanting to adapt to actually having to think about positioning and dueling, lets be honest) has resulted in support characters being absolutely busted lmao. They are straight up the best duelists in the game, i'll take a 1v1 against Ashe or Bastion any day instead of Baptiste
    It doesn’t help that the community parrots whatever the idiot flats says. Wahh wahh zen is such an issue when he’s the easiest character to counter (besides hog but I play hog so whatever). 

I firmly believe Ana is the worst designed character in the game. She destroys every tank except Zarya. Anti-nade makes being a tank awful, and sleep is literally the strongest ability in the game. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been slept and instantly killed because of it.
        > Ana is the worst designed character in the game

Ana is like reworked Hanzo who has many strengths that outweigh her weakness. Support self-heal passive makes her gameplay more forgiving and she has a hidden passive which is her small wonky shape hitbox. Self-heal passive + small hitbox can be huge lifesavers unless she's attacked by Winston / Moira beam; Torb / Sym turret.
> it’s because the support role is absurdly strong. 

this sub is absolutely not ready for this conversation, the slightest support nerfs are always met with endless complaints
    Some context: I played a few games of comp yesterday for the first time in a couple months (Diamond OW1/masters OW2 across the board).

Nothing dies, save for one-shots. The sustain is unreal, especially with LW/Mercy comps. I’m watching 4/5 players sit on main and survive via healbotting.

I think it would take a global 10% reduction in healing to make the game playable.
Illari with her 2 shot headshot be like and a nuke of an ability
    Honestly her pylon is crazy on defense too. There are times where I can’t secure a kill on winston because I need to take out the pylon first and my bubble just goes down.
> Can we just try 6 v 6 at least that will quell nostalgia for it or even confirm it works better

Flanking Hogs: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
    Oh no better send my off tank.
Thats not possible
    I don't see why people dont get this, It's simply not possible for ALL tanks to be equally viable unless they are cookie cutter copy and paste designs. 

Not only that but it goes against what overwatch is meant to be if you are picking a single hero for all maps and team comps.
        They didn't say equaly viable but overwatch isn't a 1v1 game. The 4 other player should be able to offset the tank difference to a point it doesn't matter.
    [deleted]
        dva has massive armor and mobility. zarya doesn't shutdown dva unless dva wants to. dva's biggest weakness is that she has a huge critbox yet zarya doesn't even crit.
            [deleted]
                zarya has only 15m range with her beam and she is super slow. dva can use the all map and engage/disengage at will. zarya beats dva only in certain brawl maps if dva has to brawl. 

zarya is the brawler. different archetypes yet still dva is strong. if zarya is not high charge or doesnt have bubble available, dva can kill her face to face. It takes almost 8 seconds to demech dva.

dva is 146 dps. lets say she is 50% accurate face to face 75dps. she can crit too.

max charge zarya 130dps (w reload). Let's say she is high charge but not max. 100dps, 100% accuracy.

zarya 475hp

dva 350hp 300 armor

do the math. if there are any healers, dva is easier to heal and her armor increases the effectiveness of heal. zarya is harder to heal due to her slim figure and there is no armor.

this zarya counter dva knowledge is very old and outdated at this point. there are a lot of nuances in the match up.
I don't want to go back to long, slow stale games.

I don't want to pair with flanking hogs.
    Then get used to this Meta...
        I actually like it now.

5v5 means I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs can sod off.
            We can agree to disagree.
    I prefer more tactical gameplay than this shithow of a game we have rn.
        > I prefer more tactical gameplay

What tactic? Tanks being shieldbots, DPS shoot shields, Supports being healbots.

I'm glad I could do something more than just healing.
            Shieldbots? Did you play for like 4 months during double shield meta and nwver again?

Healers were also just healbots when you don't understand your role.
> OW2 sought to make tank better by eliminating the one and powering the other up. But this led to tank diff problem. Because there's only one tank, it's very important to shut them down. Conversely, it's important as a tank to get value. Hence the frequent swaps that end up at the lowest common denominator of zarya or orisa.
> 
> Other than maybe hero bans, I'm not sure how to get around the problem in 5v5

Everyone has individual impact in 5v5 instead of just the Tanks in 6v6.
Mercy waiting 3 team fights to fly to her widow on 1hp
Instant Main Tank queue, but longer off Tank queue.

I think it's bad like if your Main Tank locks Rein in maps like Watchpoint: Gibraltar, you cannot pick Winston / Ball but DVA only in order to contest high grounds. Not sure if Doomfist were main or off, but Rein + Doom doesn't feel like a good synergy.
plat brain take
When OW1 was fresh new, it's mostly 1-4-1.
> People didn't complain about playing tank back in overwatch one

Chain'CC? Forcing Tank mirrors?

Many people instant-locking off-Tanks? Flanking Hogs?
    Yeah the rewritten history on 6v6 being so much better is funny.
        The thing is, 6v6 made sense. 5v5 is wonky as hell. The game fundamentally broken and doesn't function properly. Every patch is a flavor and band aid fix.
>People didn't complain about playing tank back in overwatch one.

And yet barely anyone wanted to play tank. The reason queue times were so bad in OW1 was because you were waiting for a tank player to finally show up.
    ow1 was dead. people didnt wanna que tank in dead abandoned game.
Everyone will just jump into "Ana is fun" / "Ana takes skill to play" bandwagon thanks to her strong fan armor.

Btw, Ana isn't OG and her addition is the birth of powercreep.
    Well, she was released within the first months of overwatch existence so OG to me but that's not relevant.

The game is actually playable when there is less stunning and gameplay preventing abilities like hacking, sleeping, antiheal and doomfist and orissa jav. All these stupid moves need to be removed or changed a lot. 

But Ana..  being in every game and having a sleep dart with a hit box the size of a barn against tanks with the size of a planet with an antiheal grenade with the blast radius of a galaxy and both of these effects lasts wayyyy too long... if I see a single person say skill I will hit the roof.
Nerfing Supports will cause much bigger outcry but I'm fine with that. Support picks and performances play the biggest factor of many outcomes.

Overtuned Supports + SR inflation got me up to GM3 as Supports in Season 5. All you need is to pick Ana / Zen and bully the enemy Tank to death.
ive said this so many times and i dont know how many times i need to keep saying it. if we go back to 6v6 right now, double shield wouldnt be possible. i swear dps and support players use double shield as their copium that 6v6 was bad because they want tanks to be dogshit so they can be pretty much the only roles that matter. either that, or people somehow forgot that orisa got reworked and no longer has a shield. 

ram shield only stays up for like 3 seconds, which isnt long enough to be a strong tank for double shield. 

rein doesnt count because he cant do anything else while shielding, so he would basically have no impact 

winston would kinda count for double shield but who tf would play winston like that? his bubble would get destroyed so quickly and he wouldnt be able to dive if he has to keep putting barriers up so why pick winston
    Double shield was just an example. tank duos were always impossible to balance, if double shield didn't exist, we would just get a dive meta or a rush meta, with no option to play anything else if you wanna win. 

The counter-pick meta is the result of mirrors getting fixed.
Tbh it’s more about the *perception* of the buff than anything else. People drastically overstate how firm the “meta” is in this game. Most people (like 80% of comp players) don’t even play the meta heroes/comps *correctly* anyway.
    You’re correct and so is the guy who replied to you. 

Meta is highly reflective of player experience and a lot of the tank feelings reflect more the strength of supports than the ranks vs each other. 

But Doom and Ball do struggle a bit being so easily disrupted with quick cool downs from a couple hero’s. 

It doesn’t even mean they are weak just other characters may be too unfair
        Agree across the board. Player hears that X hero got buffed->plays against that hero->loses->whines about how overtuned the hero is.

I literally had someone complaining about the Zarya buff yesterday because I was shitting down their throat the one round I played her. They were playing Orisa the whole game. *I didn’t bubble a teammate a single time that round*. Please good sir explain how the Zarya buff had *any* impact on the game whatsoever.

Edit: hey you’re the same person from the other comment chain lol
            i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
                The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
        This is why I wish they would bring back the 6th player and just add a "bruiser" role hero's like doom, ball, hog, Mei, and brig are some chars that could be put into this role. A tanker DPS that can't hit as hard, it would be nice if your team is lacking in one are the person in said bruiser role could now play around that
    LITERALLY, the only tank that really struggles IMO is Doomfist and Ball, and that’s because sombra is so bullshit
        She's bullshit but 95% of the mouthbreathers who swap to her can't play her. Like. Sure, she's hacking me all the time, but she's 1-9 with a 30% winrate and is an actual detriment to her team
            This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
        honestly dooms doing good rn 6 sec slam and sticky block buff was acc perfect even he’s doing pretty good
        What rank are you in to say Doom is struggling? He’s one of the most played tanks and a positive win rate in comp right now, at least for diamond through GM. He has the highest win rate too among them except in GM where his win rate is just below Sigma’s.
            Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
                How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
                    Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
        Rein is easily beat by orisa, Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers and get out of jail free cards currently in the game+ dam boost bastion can completely counter you with no counter play, JQ is just terrible to play into Orisa, Sigma is ok but your literally not going to be killing anyone unless they're very out of position, Dva can't reasonably kill anything for the same reason as Winston tho she does slightly better against bast. And all of these are destroyed by a zen just placing discord or bastion just existing. While I agree in lower ranks most are still viable, in a setting where most players know what they're doing and have proper CD management and positioning the majority of tanks just become plain unfun and weak to play. Dive tanks do not have the burst to kill anything, and all brawl tanks are weak into Orisa apart from Zaraya. It's not even tanks being the only ones affected by overtuned supports rn dive heros as a whole are just miserable to play into the current meta.
            > Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
        This man does not play reinhardt
    True, but also depends on which season. Stuff like Zarya in season 1 for example was played by pretty much every top 500 player in every region as the most played tank.
Yeah they should just roll back to 2 tanks and be done with it. 

The game was originally balanced around it not to mention the community. 

This is so stupid.
    Was 2 tanks actually better in your opinion?

In my experience, the most the more active tanks, the harder matches are to balance.
Objectively correct.
    Nah, tank duos ruled the roost in OW1. It was the same problem except you needed both tanks players to be on the same wavelength instead of your one tank player to just be good at what they're playing
Would it really? Two tanks were still meta defining in OW1. I think Blizzard just can’t figure out how to balance tanks properly, be it one or two tanks (or three or four during the GOATS meta).
    Yea overall I’d argue it was better feeling for the tanks.

Like yes 2 tanks has problems but it’s nice to have a back up. 

Like now it’s like oh great they have orisa bastion I’m on rein we’ll get fucked I guess.

In 2 tank you could have a dva harass the bastion greater negating the biggest problem faces in horse bastion match up. Don’t swap now and you’re basically fucked.

Previously it was more like an mmo you had your MT and OT.
    Okay fair point but I believe the game was objectively more fun with two tanks. I’m a tank main and it was nice to have another tank to help out. I actually loved GOATS. I agree that blizzard needs to balance tanks but I also believe it was lots of fun to play with another tank!
    The problem here is not "tanks are meta defining", the problem is "tank feels shit to play"
OW2 was a mistake and 5v5 was never needed
bring back ow1
They didn't even realize that snipers needed to be nerfed until 6 seasons into OW2. This dev team doesn't know shit about shit, it's no wonder the game is only getting worse and worse
Aye, then you can start almost predicting opportunities for insanely fast play.

So rewarding when you reach that point.
    I’ve been in a flow before where I would know what the other team was going to do. Like I was aware of where everyone was on my team, what the optimal position was to defend and apply pressure, AND I also remember thinking, oh this leaves us open to this over here, so I position myself waiting there and like 2 seconds later a lone DPS walks in and I get the pick. 

Rarely does that happen, cause it feels like my team also needs to play well enough to capitalize off plays like that but when I do get to play like that it’s amazing.
Thank you for this. I'll take this in to consideration.
Like I don't HATE-HATE the tank role, i just can't play it too much or I get burned out hella fast (literally it is the only role I get when my friends and I ALL open que in a party IDK WHY LOL) 
There are games though when it feels like magic. I like to explain to my friends who are new that if teams were a snake the Tank is the head (brain and all), DPS is the muscle, and the Supports are the skeleton that props the team up. As the head of the snake when you and your team dominate (or even if you just dominate the other tank) the role can be INCREDIBLY rewarding.

But more often than not in my experience a game can be summed up like this one time i played a game with a DPS friend.

I, as tank, tried to make space. I died. I asked my friend where he was and why he didn't try to capitalize on the space I made.
He said it was because I didn't follow him so he couldnt have my back.

I paused, trying to take that response in without my head exploding.

I said "that's not how this works. YOU FOLLOW ME"
We won after he started following my lead but I don't exactly use a lot of coms with randos because my threshold for toxicity is very low hahaha
    This is why me and my friend dominate in any game if we're together, we have some crazy synergy, but as soon as one thing gets in the way of that or one of us dies or something, we get rolled 

Ex: Rein brig, Rein reaper, reaper cass, Ana Rein (we can both play all of these so these combos work really well)
The thing is, the moment you slowdown, someone in your team suicide. In 4v5 state, you are a punching bag. So what ends up happening is that you wanna capitalize that 5v5 state before someone suicide like idiot.

What i end up doing is that picking Sigma and playing in autopilot idiot mode and praying my team wins the game. Otherwise you need a pocket support and dps needs to take off pressure of you and enemy shouldn't play Ana but enemy always plays Ana.
Tl;Dr: play sigma for 50 hours then go back to your other tanks. You will be better at patience and waiting for enemy mistakes.
This must be why I favour sigma so much and really enjoy him. Im the patient methodical type so enjoy being able to sit back and just pick away at them hoping to capitalize on any mistake or impatience. That and I like more traditional tanks.. too many feel like just beefier dps. Only downfall is when suddenly they whole enemy team jail breaks and it's 1v5.. I can only assume my own team got inpatient and all tried flanking and died.. I've also been in chat and been told that two enemy flankers killed the four of them while I was holding off 1v3.. which is a little disappointing.

I like rein too, but find it hard to balance when to be aggressive and when to be patient with him. Plus more open maps are more difficult
I also feel like there are so many more things that ignore shields now. Ram punches, Sojourn ult, Orisa ult, and the already existing Moira balls/ult. And sym/charging healing off shields. I feel like the double shield would be less effective today than in OW1 and they could make more changes to make it work instead of just removing a tank.
    FR, if they wanted, they could literally make Sym's orbs pierce again. Not just shields but multiple characters. That was such a goofy ability back in the day. 

Many tank players enjoyed the game for 3+ years before COVID, lawsuits, and the content drought really took its toll. Through GOATS, through Double Shield, through countless games of Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony (the true banes of 2CP, the other maps were ok). They still ultimately had fun. 

Meanwhile OW2 tank depression rises before even 1 year.
    > Sojourn ult, Orisa ult

those don't ignore shields AFAIK
        Orisa ult does ignore shields. They buffed it during season 2. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and isn’t super consistent but it does ignore them.
        Yes they do.
            after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
                Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
They pitched 5v5 and EVERYONE who plays tank understood the issues that would come with it. Then they promised huge changes to make up for anentire 2nd person in the same mindset as you, and gave us "you have 2 fire strikes and can stop charging early." Aka stuff from experimental patches they held off years to give us so ow2 had SOMETHING.

People so overstate the influence of double shield when even if we had 2 tanks and lowered stats like you said, orisa is gone, double shield could have been dealt with YEARS AGO but again, was held off. Same with just cutting down CC.

Double shield wasn't a real issue anyway, walk through it or play stuff that ignores or destroys them in half a second. Friend and I played rein Winston into double shield and won every time.
Terrible idea. 5v5 clears, and it’s not close
    5v5 blows and it's not even close.
    Oh man you got downvoted by the very vocal 6v6 lovers. 

I’m sorry man
        Oh no not my internet points!
            For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
                I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
                    I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
                        You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                            Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
                    How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
    > Terrible reply. Opinionated cheer, and delulu~

*6v6 was more fun for MOST tanks.*

*Your argument is not only wrong, but woefully inadequate.*
        I’m the one crying? In this thread? Lol
They must stop making hard counters in DPS, supports on tanks. Simply. Because there is just one now. Tanks should be immune to many hard counters or have abilities to resists to them (all tanks), even if they decrease shield, health, damage afterwards for balance.

In fact, maybe tanks are too strong so it means all have to counter him for easy win. Make them less important, and it should leverage tank diversity.

Either we buff them to resist so they are all playable (but maybe powercreep loop). Or we nerf them all to the ground, so it doesn't impact that much the game so people stop hard counter / focus tank.
I've been thinking this awhile. Two tanks gave more options. In the absence of a second tank, in a game with so many potential counters, you need to give more options to tanks. They don't have to be good at everything, but at least have some better mitigation abilities, like characters in a fighting game. There is plenty of potential mechanics to expand on. For example, orissa spear is swallowed by sigmas suck. What if you could charge the spear by holding down and then it beats suck, but at the expense of being stationary and vulnerable? Same with sigmas rock and orissa's fortify. Now you have some additional play and wiggle room. Rein has a unused melee button. What if it gave him a short dash? So much more exciting. Anyways, these are just suggestions, but the point is to open up tanks gameplay options, so they have tools to help mitigate a specific situation so their immediate thought isn't to switch to another tank because they feel helpless.
There's a difference between some counter picking being a thing and "you can just pick sombra/bastion/orisa to make 50% of the tanks absolutely miserable to play"
Man is now defining a genre by its least fun mechanic.
    I'm defining a genre by its defining feature LOL
        How? In tf2, the defining hero shooter, counterswapping cant really happen as there’s so few characters to play that it’s generally not really helpful beyond swapping guns and maybe if one person is absolutely dominating u can focus him, but in other hero shooters like Paladins and Valorant u can’t even swap characters so countering is kind of impossible. Overwatch is the only game counter swapping is a thing, it’s important and i like it but it has nothing to do with the genre its in
        So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Personally, I can't wait to see what the enemy is playing so I can pick a counter. Even better when they see what I'm playing and pick a counter.
            You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
            > So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
                "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
    I quite enjoy it, actually.

I like switching to Moira and dominating the Genji that was shitting on us. I like going Torb and making that Tracer switch off - hell, maybe they switch to Pharah and counter my Torb. Then I'm the one that has to switch.

Counter picking is a fun mechanic for some and mostly works as it should when it's DPS and support interactions. It's just unfortunate that it affects tanks so adversely and that's something that needs to be fixed.
Spear, Javelin Halt and Twirl is just basically a fuck you to any sort of attack.
The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game. 

Playing rein into ana/zen is equally as bad as some hanzo/bastion, which is equally as bad as playing into orisa. And if you have all 5, you get a jackpot or some shit. 

The easiest gameplan to execute is to bully the tank. It’s easy to sleep the tank on cooldown, keep discord on them, spear them repeatedly, etc. It’s not some specific role that makes tank hell, it’s just playing tank that makes tank hell.
    >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.


Oh absolutely, my point was that most tank matchups are at least playable. But out of all cross-class matchups, Damage heroes have the most "anti-Tank" heroes (obviously), and since there are two DPS for every Tank, the dps players are free to pick the hardest counter, and exactly as you said: bully the tank. 

If you're a support being relentlessly dived by a dps, you can swap to Brig, Moira, maybe Bap or Zen if you really want to just take the duels. Most of those swaps aren't "hard" counters (like how Brig used to be able to delete Tracer with a full combo if recall was on CD) in the way Reaper deletes Winston by clicking m1 in his general direction, or how a symettra who doesn't place all her turrets in one spot can completely dogwalk Reinhardt.
        While I don’t think it’s disputable that dps have more anti tank options, I don’t feel they’re nearly as bad to play into as their support counterpart (ana and zen) or THE anti tank, orisa. I’d much rather play into the dps heroes because many of them have drawbacks that, as a tank player, you can capitalize on. Like playing into sym, to burst you down, that means she’s in your effective range. 

The same cannot be said for ana or zen, who require coordinated dives to deal with at high levels, and playing a brawl tank into them is just an instant L. And orisa is orisa, who gets to basically sit there and control your movements.
    in my experience bullying the tank is a bad strategy most of the time because of the sheer amount of healing supports can provide. That's why ana nade is so strong, but it's the exception to that rule
        No amount of healing is saving you from discord and a bastion.

And yes, anti is ridiculous, which is why ana was the best hero in the game for like 4 seasons straight. It took 3 consecutive nerfs to move her from best hero to “one of the best” now.
            The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
                Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
    >The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.

My flaming hot take is that role queue was the game's biggest mistake and hero swapping the game's second biggest mistake.

The 2016 crowd just wanted to hop onto games with friends and go pew pew pew. Instead, now we have to have a carefully designed sports team with roles that don't match the audience's composition (with the MMO holy trinity, way more than 40% of people want to play DPS and way less than 40% want to be healers). This leads to long queue times, which leads to players leaving, which leads to longer queue times, and the game spirals.

Instead of role queue, IMO the proper fix would have been to make the characters more similar to each other to eliminate hard counters, both at the hero level (Pharah vs Junkrat) and at the team composition level (3 support and 3 tank vs 6 DPS). DPS could largely remain as is though Pharah would need a rework, tanks would change to fat DPS, support would either be closer to Zen with weak healing or Mercy with single target strong healing, and the OW2 support passive could be extended to all characters so that you wouldn't need healers as much.

Hero swapping is a much trickier argument. I'd argue that the way the majority of 2016 OW1 players want to play the game is more like how you play Smash Bros - find a character that is fun and play them. The hero swapping never worked the way that Jeff Kaplan and his team thought it would and the rock paper scissors dynamic ended up being the worst part of the game because people just wanted to play who they want to play. Additionally, you could have per hero SR, which would help matchmaking quality. Ever tried to learn a hero but keep having to switch back to your main because you are unable to keep up with your rank? Per hero SR would fix this problem.

Of course there's two problems with removing role queue and hero swapping. The first is that this dev team is way too incompetent to pull this off. First they broke the game with Brig, then when they did role queue they didn't rebalance it for half a year, and then when they did 5v5 they reworked a measly 4 characters. There's no way they could pull off the changes needed to homogenize the cast enough to eliminate hard counters.

The second is that it's not what the current game audience wants. The people who have stuck with OW are the ones who like the unique heroes and the sports team like roles. I would argue that the majority of the game's 2016 player base would prefer my vision, but I also recognize that they are gone and trying to swap out a current player base to get back one that's already left would be a bad move.
The problem with double shield was dps heroes too but nobody wants to talk about that.

Double shield got popular because damage kept creeping up, had to start doing that so that you could survive. Double shield wasn't fun, if you have the option to play more fun teams then you'd usually pick them.
    The lower the TTK is, the better it becomes to just sit behind a shield and blast away in safety. When you have things like hanzo spam and roadhog hook threatening instant death, why risk playing dive where your supports can be picked off before you even crack the enemy Rein's shield?

Damage needs to come down across the board, and so does healing. The only things that should deal 225+ damage are ults, and damage boosted Widow/Hanzo headshots.
        Cut down the damage and cut down the cc and double shield would basically drop off the map, they did one but not the other.
            They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
that also leans back into 2 tanks though. if you're rein/zarya and they switch to bastion or junk, your off-tank can swap and you can stay as rein

if they switch to widow, 1 tank can switch to Winston and effectively stop it, while still having 1 main tank. in 5v5, if you switch to Winston to counter, your entire team has to either swap to dive or wait until your grouped. I think 6v6 was way easier to deal with counters, now with 5v5 you're changing the comp with no safety
At that point it’s the job of your other teammates to support you. I’ve played Rein when the other team had a bastion and it’s the job of my DPS to help alleviate pressure. I’ve had games where widow is killing my supports and maybe I went doom so I could help them. Match ups are entirely within your role and a key part of the game is working with your team as a unit to cover shortcomings.
>Enemy team has a widow/hanzo/hitscan who can aim somewhat? Well, now you kinda need to be Rein

Every day I'm reminded of how different low elo is.
this is simply not true, you just need to get good. it’s hard but look at dafrans winston gameplay. It’s not impossible

The only way you’ll
even really have trouble with hard counters is in gm, you can get away with a lot of stuff in the lower ranks

You dont deserve t9 climb if you can’t outskilll your own rank

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
    What you describe only works on the perspective of Dafran, a GM player. If you are not at that level, of course you won't be able to play against counters. You know why Dafran's Winston only have trouble with hard counters on GM? is because those are player on his level. And if you follow your advice, "git gud", then you'll face people who also, "got gud", which will be countering you at your level.

I have no idea how you can consider what you just said constructive at all.
        you just need to get good, at lower ranks people just don’t know how to punish. Winston has an escape mechanic and a bubble to juggle on a short cooldown

I am said it’s hard, like playing most tanks but not impossible

Also if people are struggling in their level then it means they’re supposed to be at that level until they improve

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
            Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
                What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
                    ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
                        if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                            Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                            Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
I don’t even think the first designed argument have a merit. When many of the tanks were first designed the game didn’t even have role queue, so you didn’t know it was a one tank, two, three or even six tank comp until after hero select. It’s turned into an entirely different game several times, and they have adjusted the tanks or reworked them over and over. It’s not a question of the first design teams intentions (the game was also SO unbalanced at release)

But yeah, the rock-paper-scissor counterpicking feels too damaging toward tanks rn
I’d argue the counters were… softer with two tanks? You might swap your off tank or main tank to deal with one element of the enemy team composition. There was more nuance, as opposed to rock, paper, Orisa.
Double shield didn't come straight out of goats. It didn't even get big until about a year and a half before ow2 released.
Zarya is an off tank and Orisa is main tho lol
    That comment just shows people have no idea what they’re talking about lol
        They just like to bitch about the game because it’s hard to accept responsibility for your losses/shortcomings
Because of main tank experience and double shield, which was solved with tank passive and reworks.
to be fair most tanks’ complains with getting counter picked is when it’s *the whole team*. one good fight on doom & it’s sombra/orisa/ana/zen/cas , one good fight on rein it’s orisa/bastion/mei, etc. Tank “rock paper scissors” isn’t as free as people make it seem. A good Dva can play into Zarya, a good Doom can play into Orisa, getting full counterswapped is what sucks
    This is true, but the people that don't understand this the most seem to not actually play tank. It is the people that yell at me for "throwing" since I didn't switch off the second the other tank switched to a tank that was better against me.
    Sometimes when the whole team counter-swap you, you may indirectly enable someone else in your team. I had games that enemies switch to JQ + Bastion + Reaper against me as monkey, this means none of the enemies could contest my mid-long range DPS.
        Yea, but were you, personally, having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks?
            > having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
Better than meta's imo. I'd rather be able to play any tank instead of being limited to 2 or 3 or be "throwing"
    Well no you're still limited to 2 or 3 that are otherwise throwing, however they constantly change throughout the match as you and other tank counter pick each other

It's one of the core issues with only having one tank
        It was an issue in OW1 as well. Good luck playing Winston into Hog, even with a second tank.
            Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
                Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
                And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
    Nah they need to balance it so basically no tank hard counters another so it’s up to the skill of the player and not just “my tank beats yours because I picked it”
        that’s not possible with a game that is heavily reliant on abilities. by the nature of having unique abilities and weapons, different characters will counter others and get countered all the same. a truly balanced game would have to revolve around counter picking for the most optimal play. by nature of a competitive game, players try and win and will look for the most efficient way which is how metas form. if one character is even just a little better than others, a meta will naturally revolve around it
            It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
                Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
                    Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
                        Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                            Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
                i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
        6 v6 cures so many problems with overwatch 2
Oh no, the game that has the unique feature of being able to change character’s mid game will encourage players to change character’s mid game
    I prefer counter-pick more than "pick this meta Tank or lose" situation.
Rock paper scissors is infinitely better than play these two tanks or lose instantly
    You’re a gold player; you can play literally any tank you want and do just fine.
        woah there buddy, no need to be condescending… I’ll have you know I’m in the top 50% of all ranked players… I’m sure you couldn’t say the same…
            You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
                nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
                    Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
                        Still better than you…  probably silver …
                            I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
            >  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
        Rank shaming in 2023 LMAOO
            its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
            Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
                I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
                    No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
yall have some *very* rose tinted glasses on.  the tank experience in 6v6 was 'load into hero select screen where other tank has already locked hog' * n
    Some diabolical revisionist history going ok in this comment section 😭😭
        it's pretty funny, i can vividly remember numerous OW1 tank queue sessions where i was just 'why the actual fuck do i play this game'.  but apparently it was some dreamland of zarya delivering perfect bubbles to rein being healed by ana and sped by lucio, or coordinated winston d.va dives on discord targets.  

it was a shitshow most of the time.  i liked 6v6 overall but am honestly having more fun tanking in OW2, if they tone down orisa a bit it will be fine
    I'd rather have a hog with me to eat some cooldowns than have sleep, anti nade and mag nade hit me when i drop shield.
        Instead the enemy went double shield. Where things like anti and discord could never get through, and you just lost if you didn't have the same broken tank synergy.
    Rose tinted glasses when I played overwatch 1 till the end and lost nearly all motivation in season one of overwatch 2?  Yall still use that argument all the time and think you won
i have no idea what you guys are talking about. 

all 6v6 did was make you have to mirror comps or go double shield. and that always devolved into double shield poke meta. 

it's like i'm the only one that remembered how bad that crap was, and everyone complaining non stop in this sub. it was killing the game and overwatch was becoming irrelevant 

5v5 was a good change, a great change. i'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta 

i'm so glad the devs don't go back to that trash.
    Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

    5v5 was a good change, a great change. I'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta

Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

&#x200B;

Too much power has been put into the support roles imo. If there is to only be 1 tank then all the power and fun needs to go into the tanks otherwise why would anyone want to play the role.
        There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change. 

Clearly you don't understand that your opinion doesn't make something fact.
                There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?
        
>Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

The short space of time of 2 years with 0 updates at the end of OW1?
            These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
        > Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

what are you talking about??

it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

and ow1 was practically irrelevant and dying at the time due to how boring the gameplay was playing the same heroes in mirror comp all the time 

> Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

dive goats and brawl were fucking braindead mirrors like i said. there was barely any strategic "flex tank" switching like you guys claim. 

> Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1
            >  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
            The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
                I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
                clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
                

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
                    Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
                        Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
                    It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
That's why there were so many tanks in ow1 🙄😒
    Queues flex. Gets support everytime.
> You still have the other tank player who can support you and you are not instantly forced to switch.

what if i told you there are still 4 players on your team who can counter
    There are also 4 more enemies to counter you and only you.
What?  You were forced to play the one other tank that was “best” with the other tank or you were flamed for losing the game. And in Some metas you would be losing the game. Tanking in OW1 sucked ass it’s why NO ONE DID IT.
Very true!

My statement is more general. But the fact remains if the tank dies the fight is usually completely loat. Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. Not to mention anti alone is a free excuse to push.

Its why forcing anti is so important to playing against ana. 

But of course Ana can anti anyone for value. Tank is the easiest to anti and most do.

Most anas I play against just spam anti and sleep at the tank ad nauseum. And it works maybe 50% of the time because some tanks play poorly or some other reason.
    > Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. 

No, it doesn't. Do you play Ana? I'm just curious because there's a lot of....knowledge you're kinda skipping over. 

It's situational:

What is the position of you and your team when their tank dies? What is the position of the enemy team? What's the ult statuses (i.e Does their genji have blade? Does their Soldier have visor?) Are the enemy support cooldowns up or did they blow them? Is your team actually coordinating and working together? etc.

Ever since they nerfed Ana where tanks wake up in 3 seconds instead of 5, it made it significantly worse to sleep tanks.
        This is neither a dissertation on ana nor an argument.

Do you play tank? Have you played tank against Ana at higher levels?

From masters to GM anti was frequently used on me as tank, forcing me to wait or play passively or outright guaranteeing my death.

Nade is available every 10 seconds or so. And many fights across all skill levels will involve up to two uses of nade.

Nading the tank to stop a push in part one of a fight and nading a support or dps to secure an elim 10 seconds later is still nading the tank and still giving value.

Many if not most of the Ana's i play against are nading the tank with exceptions, of course (because no ability exists in a vacuum, and I never implied it did) 

Ive played enough ana and enough tank to know she is part of the readon tank is so strenuous right now. She is one of the most played supports for a reason.
Don't understand why they would ever remove experimental
    Because now we get a patch almost every 3 weeks. We get the season's patch, the 2 week patch, and the mid season patch. With how often we get updates, they won't bring back a mode to test features. They should do it to test future changes but we all know they won't
    Not like they actually used it anyway. They put charge cancel on there...4? 3? times and didn't implement it.
    Probably so they could force 5v5 on us. They didn’t make it so it could be tested and they could get feedback, they just implemented it and went “yup that’s how it is now.”
        The real reason I replied to the comment before you
Yep, and then you'll get only dps all game against 2 reins, 2 bastions, and a mercy and remember why you don't play MH.
they literally abandoned ow1. that was the root of the problem.
    I mean honestly that's a pretty good point. Blizzard is run by a bunch of idiots and I do wish I lived in the universe where a competent company had the Overwatch IP.
    People pull out old reason why 2 tank suck forget blizzard literally dont give a shit about the game state for 3 years. If they actually give effort and fix it non of those thing could happen. The rework of orisa in ow"2" have already fix some of the double shield problem. Kiriko suzu help counter alot of tank cc by her own, etc... It can be fixed if blizzard actually give a shit about their game.
>Not only would they have to re-balance the whole game again

They haven't properly done that so far, so that's a non-issue.
    Thats what people fail to understand. Blizzard didn't rework everything for overwatch 2. They made minimal changes and kept most of it the same then tossed us in 5v5. Lazy fucks just made things worse.
It's funny cause 6v6 was worst for 4 player out of 6.
    Not really supports were fine, you could make an argument for it being worse for dps but it was meta dependent.
        Support are way more fun now than they were before.
            Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
They have a save file of last ow1 balance. It would be super easy to go back and just balance the new ones
    Double shield meta again 😍
        How is it double shield when orisa literally got reworked? Ram and Sig wouldnt work that well together
            But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
                I feel sorry for you
                    Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
How is double shield going to be an issue without orisa *having a shield.*
DPS and support queue times are already long. Just the other day I saw DPS and Support queue times both at over 20 minutes. No one wants to play tank right now because tank is miserable
    Yes! Tank que times is 5 seconds for a reason lol
    [deleted]
Getting bad team comps is already a thing tho. Never played OW1 but  can two tanks fundamentally not be salvaged? I've heard some tank synergies were unbelievably annoying like Orisa/Sigma, Orisa/Hog, but I feel like it'd be leagues better than all the pressure being put on one person.
    Exactly! People don't understand that though. Or choose to ignore it
    [deleted]
        I wouldn't say it's pure revisionist. I used to be a tank main, as was a friend of mine, and we tried for a bit in overwatch 2, but eventually gave it up. I haven't really touched tank for about 3 or 4 seasons. I tried once or twice after I dropped it, but it just sucks now, imo. Too much pressure on one player, and you can't enjoy the role like you used to be able to. Not all tank players disappeared, but this one at least did.
            [deleted]
                And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
>Then DPS + Support queue times become long again because no one likes to play Tanks.

Which is ironic because my queue times on support now are way longer than ow1 during its life support period.

I'm currently averaging 7~10mins sup queue in qp no matter when i queue between 9pm~4pm my timezone.
    Because Supports is in the best state right now and many people are still enjoying / learning Illari and also buffed Lifeweaver.
Support que times did not go over 1 minute in 6v6. DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports. 

Your second point makes no sense. Are people going to play tank or not? You can't have it both ways.

The third point also makes no sense. The whole point of role que is to pick teams that synergize well with each other. It would be the same with tanks. Why would people willingly play roles that don't go well with each other?
    > DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports.

DPS queues were minimum 20 minutes long at the end of OW1's life. And I have the screenshots to prove it. Plenty of old clips from streamers showing this too.

We can't go back to that, the game will die again if people have to wait 20 mins for a game.
        Dont forget that DPS queue times were so long that Blizz had to introduce Priority Passes (by playing tank or support) just so you can jump queue.

They HAD to incentivize tank and support just to cut dps queue times. And it was STILL long.
            We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
                Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
        I mean they currently have bots in quickplay. I don't think it could get more dead than it currently is. At least with 6v6 there was enough players to start games without the need of bots
    Lmao, we had 15 minute queues for DPS a the end of OW1’s lifecycle. Everyone has rose-tinted glasses looking back at 6v6. Sure, it had its pros, but we can’t forget about all the cons. Too many people either forget that double shield existed, or are lying to themselves that double shield wasn’t that bad. We are complaining about tank being in a bad place because of rock paper scissors, but at least there is diversity there instead of being forced to play Sigma/Orisa.
        Yeah now it's just being forced to play orisa. So much better.
            Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
                All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
                    You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
    But Competitive Overwatch preferred 5v5 more.

The best thing about 5v5, I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs / timid Reins or Orisa / slow lurking Balls could sod off.
        Except now you have one tank with literally all the pressure and way too many roles to fill in one slot, and if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.
            I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
            > if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
>let's not pretend bad Tank duos also exist

Also why do ppl pretend you will always get good tank duos? In a lot of games when I was not tank, id get Zarya/Hog or Ball Hog or just straight up off-tanks.

Hell when I did tank, I was always relegates to main tanking because my duo always picks off-tank. I had so many hours on Orisa cuz of that. I rarely could play OT unless I instalock one when the match starts.
    [deleted]
        I feel like so many people ignore this aspect - mm was so dogshit for tanks because of hog.

It wasnt utopian, synergy barely existed.
What if they specifically made the queue for off tank. And broke the tanks into 2 roles. Add a few more to both selections. The same could honestly be done for supports.
No it isnt. The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back. Idk why some of you defend 5v5 so bad. We've tried it and it sucks balls.
    > The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back.

Source?
        remember when tank queue in OW1 was so long because everyone wanted to play tank because it was so fun?

this happened in season, uh, *checks notes*, it was season *flips through pages* look - the community has spoken
        Try just searching 6v6 in this sub. Or Twitter. Or YouTube. Or the overwatch forum. Everywhere basically.
        Trust ♪⁠～⁠(⁠´⁠ε⁠｀⁠ ⁠)
    I've played ow since the original beta.

6v6 is imposible to balance, two tanks is stupid and it is not fun at all.
        played for a long ass too, 5v5 is stupid and playing tank is not fun at all.
        Except with any end up with role q until shortly before echo came out, so all that time beforehand was either goats, or no limit
        Yeah cause 5v5 is so balanced rn
        You're in the minority here buddy. Balanced or not people have spoken and they want 6v6 back. The majority of players found it more fun even if it was less balanced.
            How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
                I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
                    I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
                        I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
            I think the 6v6 folks are just louder.  The 5v5 guys are too busy playing Overwatch.

I personally come here to fight against 6v6 because I found it actively torturous and never want to go back to it.
                That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
                    I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
                        I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
                    I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
            6v6 is not coming back. Deal with it.
                We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
    > community has already spoken

Yeah, and they weren't playing tank because it was boring and unfun. A very vocal minority on reddit thinks 6v6 was better, while the people who like 5v5 are busy playing the game with the lowest queue times its ever had.
        Ever had? C'mon man we do not have to lie. People keep saying it's a vocal minority but just look at who's getting down voted and who's not. You can like 5v5. That's fine but like don't act like it's the popular position. Like people are in agreement that 6v6 is better. It just needed some tweaking. With the current state of tanks and supports 6v6 would work much better than it use to. The game would be fun again too!
            Reread my comment. This whole subreddit is a vocal minority. Not even 10% of players use reddit. Even on the other Overwatch sub 5v5 is vastly preferred. But once again you can't argue against the fact that queue times were insanely long in OW1 because nobody wanted to play tank, if you actually played it.
And Dva, Doom, and Winston got nerfed after the beta specifically because of how good they were against supports and because supports complained about it. Supports were balanced to be just as impactful as dps and suddenly support players weren’t having fun, it’s hilarious really lol.
Cassidy’s CC is negligible and doesn’t effect any tank significantly other than doom and sometimes Dva. Mei is shit for tanks even without her CC, her wall needs to go as it’s what’s primarily what makes playing against her miserable. And yes supports were unfavorable, but instead of just buffing supports they also nerfed all the tanks increasing the power swing in favor of the supports and making it so multiple tanks are incapable of dealing with certain dps. Nerfing supports and the tank buster dps removes like 80% of the problems with playing tank
    Cassidy cc also fucks up winston. Want to jump back out? Nope.... and then insta melted by right click.
Mercy needs to go, her movement is too good, her healing is too good, her buffing is too good
    she does 0 damage and low healing she's fine
        Mmhmm “low healing” for a lot of characters her healing is plenty to get a kill on a enemy not being healed. She also is extremely hard to hit for a lot of people because of her movement
    And yet she's maybe the worst support at the moment, bottom 3 at the very least.
More like support players got so used to be babysitted all the time they couldn't cope with the fact they now needed to think about positioning and take duels.

The original DPS passive was busted, sure, but it got removed really fast.
    You do realize the idea that removing a tank means also that supports too are far more greatly exposed than they were before, and saying “focus on your positioning” can only work so well for supports like Zen and Ana who have zero mobility and NEED to rely on their cooldowns to have a chance of getting away even remotely? That’s the entire point I’m making. Removing a tank increased pressure on everyone and going into OW2 and giving supports no additional tools to aid themselves beyond “move around better” only takes you so far. Not every character can Mercy or Lucio zip around in seconds.
        I'm not arguing that supports didn't need new tools to fit in the new sandbox. I'm saying that even when they had said tools, support players still felt underpowered simply because they weren't used to playing in such an active way. Now that they are, most supports are straight up busted.
Tank still has the lowest player base and has so se OW1. I’m literally a flex player and play, Ana, Bap, Brig, and Lucio and all of them had impact and were fun to play depending on the comp, map, and  enemy heroes. Support players just got mad that they were just as squishy as the dps role so they had to play smart. Now we’re back to the brain dead support balance where they can 1 v 1 anyone on the roster because they have the strongest cooldowns and twice the sustain of dps. Dis supports need buffs? Yes, did they need to be power crept into oblivion well also nerfing the role that made them struggle? Absolutely not.
    I mean...of course it's going to have the lowest player base. You need one tank per team per game, thus of course the total number of players is going to be lower; the ratio of need for tanks is just mathematically lower at 1:2:2...? This should come as no surprise. If the tank population surged you would be waiting hours for a game.

It seems more like tank players wanted to be raid bosses to me and got a rude awakening when they realized the absence of a second tank increased pressure on \*everyone\*, including support players, and that it's just unfun to be dove in two seconds by a hog/doomfist and be unable to play the game. Also, if you're losing a 1v1 against a support that's more a reflection on you than it is on the role. Trapping a support should never be an automatic guarantee of a free kill. If you can't finish them off even with the sheer strength advantage...I don't know what to tell you. You should be easily able to kill a Zen/Ana as a [D.va](https://D.va). If you can't... Be better at the game, maybe?

Anyway, supports are going to stay roughly where they are, because they're all relatively balanced amongst each other and the role is finally good. Tanks will I'm sure get some sort of buffs/changed to compensate the role being stressful and more unfun (we see this with hog rework etc).
        That’s… that’s not how statistics work?? 😭
            That’s…that’s not how making an argument works?? 😭
Also I can tell you don’t play tank at high level just by that comment. The only tanks that don’t explode randomly currently are Ram, Orisa, and Zarya.
    What’s your rank?
Support low player base? Lol you obviously never play tank. Us tanks have been getting chain stunned into oblivion for years to the point bliz removed half of our slots because we all quit playing them because its not fun.
    You obviously didn’t read the rest of my comment because I specific stated season 1 and 2 where that was the case lmao
        I did. I just think you're delusional. Supp was hard for 2 ENTIRE SEASONS oh you poor baby. Tank has been terrible for like 4 years now.
            It actually just sounds like you’re a bitter crybaby who took my words out of context. Continue to cope and seethe; tank buffs are not going to make you better at the game lmao
It is more that devs have absolutely no idea how the game is actually played

And you are not wrong. And they fail to realize that is why they are having less and less tanks
"BUT DOUBLE SHIELD THO"

Orisa has no shield. Ram's lasts 4 seconds
    And you don’t think they wouldn’t adjust the tanks accordingly? The reason the tanks are all souped up the way they are (and why the tank matchup / tank diff is so profound) is because there’s only 1 of them. Re-introducing two tanks they will likely gut many characters’ offensive kits - like probably reverting rein to one fire strike, or make it like 70 damage or something, nerfing charge back to entirely committal or even lower damage than it is now *because it isn’t nearly as committal*; make ram shield last longer and reduce punch damage / annihilation uptime; make zarya go back to the 1/1 bubble
        I'd take this any time vs getting targeted with every single CC the enemy has to offer every 8 seconds because there's only 1 tank.
            ... you still would be targeted. Too much CC was the biggest complaint of tank players for the entirety of OW1.
                yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
                And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
It feels like most people that complain so hard about double shield forgot that the double shield meta wasn't nearly as long as they act. The last like 1.5 years of overwatch 1 for example was already without it.
    It’s not even double shield so much as it is that everyone acts like this 1 tank game is so shit like we didn’t all have gripes with everything beforehand. Double shield, flashbang, doomfist as a dps, brig, stuns were crazy; the state of tanks in OW1 got so fucked up that they literally had to force a 2-2-2 role lock to make DPS usable in their esports league (and probably higher ranks too). 

Do you realize how bad it was with multiple tanks? Having that freedom *literally* invalidated… 38 heroes now, Doom was a dps, JQ/Ram/Kiriko/Sojourn/LW/Illari didn’t exist - we would have had 8 tanks and a total roster of 32 with 17 DPS? A specific combination of tanks - Rein/Zarya/Dva just completely invalidated the entire DPS roster in the highest level of play because why would you ever use a 150-250 HP hero when you can use 400-600 that have just as good or better damage?

In Open Queue in OW2 it was still enough of a problem that they nerfed the base health pools of the tanks. 

Reverting to 6v6 would just create new problems. Rn just please nerf orisa and revert turrets, shit is so unfun to play and play against. Orisa literally has minimal mobility and doesn’t have explosive damage but she lives forever and her cooldowns are amazing so it doesn’t matter and I have to play her anyway, and why they wanted a torb/bastion meta is beyond me.
I liked double shield. More often it was a shield and an off tank.
    Bruh if there’s an offtank that’s not double shield 😂
        …Obviously. More often though it was not two big shielded tanks during that era. Sometimes there would be double shield and sometimes one shield one off sometimes two off tanks. But even when there were two shielded characters yes I liked that. People just were too dumb to shoot the shield
        Sigma?

??????????? 

Did you even play overwatch 1?
    The problem is their no fucking off tank role. So more often then not you end up with the 2 mets tank.

You think rein, Winston was fun? Or zarya, dva? It was horrible.
        Rein Winston was an actual fucking blast my guy

You walked over double shield because both your attacks ignored shields
            To play... i'm talking about playing against.
Make an offtank category then, without shield tanks there.
    And now queue times are even worse because so few people wanna play tank already since all the blame falls on them 😂
Orisa. Ball. Ram can punch through shields. Double shield would not be a good comp in ow2
I'm fine with that. It's either they lose their passives or people refuse to play tank.
Because the devs abandoned the game for years to work on “””“pve””””
    [deleted]
“Your team was worse when one of your players was bad…”
    But bad Tanks are very hard to carry.
        Exactly. Now imagine they removed the other tank from the game altogether so you only had one tank. And then THAT was the bad tank.
            With one less Tank, the enemy team has one less peeler and more chanced to be picked or dived.

It can still work if you're an amazing sniper who can pop their heads but how's that going to work in 6v6 if the enemy team runs Double Shields?

As Support, I have more room to do damage as I have only one Tank to heal and my damage won't be blocked by enemy two Tanks.
I don’t see how this matters
And the solution we get instead is multiple support abilities that prevent anything from dying. So instead we have a gigabuffed orisa which doesn't do much except cycle damage reduction cooldowns with a brief 3 second window in which she is killable but instead she gets yoinked away by lifeweaver, suzu'd or immortality field and you have another 20 seconds on cycling cooldowns before it happens again.

Lets be honest the current meta is equally as shit if not more so than double shield.
Incorrect
    Its not, overwatch 1 had more balance issues than overwatch 2, people are just quick to forget.
        Nope
            Wanna expand on your obviously wrong opinion?
                It's not wrong
                    It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
The only solution Blizzard has left is to remove the tank role.

It's their only solution because Blizzard is shit at game balance.
Not nearly as bad as having a bad tank in overwatch 2.
    Depends which role you're playing.

In 6v6, Tank hurts the most when another is being bad because he/she will be bullied by six players, meanwhile DPS + Supports are affected the least.

In 5v5, DPS & Supports would suffer along.
        Doesn't depend on which role you play. A bad tank in overwatch 2 is horrible for everyone in your team, a bad tank in overwatch 1 is more managable.
They'd quickly find out that they do not really like those heroes, and if they end up liking them, good, now we have more tank players.
I really really really am tired of listening to competitive players
    For some reason the game seems to be developed around the two ends of the bell curve and not the huge majority in the middle.
        An item of character broken in competitive may be balanced perfectly for the average level gameplay. But then it gets nerfed do to competitive leaving every one else out to dry
    But that side has more players who have deeper knowledge to this game.
        I really don’t care, I am tired of casual players being f’ed over because competitive players wanna be whiny
            And they represent such a small portion of the community and an even smaller portion of the community if they’re from the top ranks. Listening to like 5-10% of the playerbase is ridiculous
                Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
                    OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
                And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
                    People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
                    I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
            because casual players aren't whiny ? lmao
        Then they can find another game to screw up with their "competitive" opinions.
S1 of OW2 with the DPS speed passive (and support players not wanting to adapt to actually having to think about positioning and dueling, lets be honest) has resulted in support characters being absolutely busted lmao. They are straight up the best duelists in the game, i'll take a 1v1 against Ashe or Bastion any day instead of Baptiste
It doesn’t help that the community parrots whatever the idiot flats says. Wahh wahh zen is such an issue when he’s the easiest character to counter (besides hog but I play hog so whatever). 

I firmly believe Ana is the worst designed character in the game. She destroys every tank except Zarya. Anti-nade makes being a tank awful, and sleep is literally the strongest ability in the game. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been slept and instantly killed because of it.
    > Ana is the worst designed character in the game

Ana is like reworked Hanzo who has many strengths that outweigh her weakness. Support self-heal passive makes her gameplay more forgiving and she has a hidden passive which is her small wonky shape hitbox. Self-heal passive + small hitbox can be huge lifesavers unless she's attacked by Winston / Moira beam; Torb / Sym turret.
Some context: I played a few games of comp yesterday for the first time in a couple months (Diamond OW1/masters OW2 across the board).

Nothing dies, save for one-shots. The sustain is unreal, especially with LW/Mercy comps. I’m watching 4/5 players sit on main and survive via healbotting.

I think it would take a global 10% reduction in healing to make the game playable.
Honestly her pylon is crazy on defense too. There are times where I can’t secure a kill on winston because I need to take out the pylon first and my bubble just goes down.
Oh no better send my off tank.
I don't see why people dont get this, It's simply not possible for ALL tanks to be equally viable unless they are cookie cutter copy and paste designs. 

Not only that but it goes against what overwatch is meant to be if you are picking a single hero for all maps and team comps.
    They didn't say equaly viable but overwatch isn't a 1v1 game. The 4 other player should be able to offset the tank difference to a point it doesn't matter.
[deleted]
    dva has massive armor and mobility. zarya doesn't shutdown dva unless dva wants to. dva's biggest weakness is that she has a huge critbox yet zarya doesn't even crit.
        [deleted]
            zarya has only 15m range with her beam and she is super slow. dva can use the all map and engage/disengage at will. zarya beats dva only in certain brawl maps if dva has to brawl. 

zarya is the brawler. different archetypes yet still dva is strong. if zarya is not high charge or doesnt have bubble available, dva can kill her face to face. It takes almost 8 seconds to demech dva.

dva is 146 dps. lets say she is 50% accurate face to face 75dps. she can crit too.

max charge zarya 130dps (w reload). Let's say she is high charge but not max. 100dps, 100% accuracy.

zarya 475hp

dva 350hp 300 armor

do the math. if there are any healers, dva is easier to heal and her armor increases the effectiveness of heal. zarya is harder to heal due to her slim figure and there is no armor.

this zarya counter dva knowledge is very old and outdated at this point. there are a lot of nuances in the match up.
Then get used to this Meta...
    I actually like it now.

5v5 means I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs can sod off.
        We can agree to disagree.
I prefer more tactical gameplay than this shithow of a game we have rn.
    > I prefer more tactical gameplay

What tactic? Tanks being shieldbots, DPS shoot shields, Supports being healbots.

I'm glad I could do something more than just healing.
        Shieldbots? Did you play for like 4 months during double shield meta and nwver again?

Healers were also just healbots when you don't understand your role.
Yeah the rewritten history on 6v6 being so much better is funny.
    The thing is, 6v6 made sense. 5v5 is wonky as hell. The game fundamentally broken and doesn't function properly. Every patch is a flavor and band aid fix.
ow1 was dead. people didnt wanna que tank in dead abandoned game.
Well, she was released within the first months of overwatch existence so OG to me but that's not relevant.

The game is actually playable when there is less stunning and gameplay preventing abilities like hacking, sleeping, antiheal and doomfist and orissa jav. All these stupid moves need to be removed or changed a lot. 

But Ana..  being in every game and having a sleep dart with a hit box the size of a barn against tanks with the size of a planet with an antiheal grenade with the blast radius of a galaxy and both of these effects lasts wayyyy too long... if I see a single person say skill I will hit the roof.
Double shield was just an example. tank duos were always impossible to balance, if double shield didn't exist, we would just get a dive meta or a rush meta, with no option to play anything else if you wanna win. 

The counter-pick meta is the result of mirrors getting fixed.
You’re correct and so is the guy who replied to you. 

Meta is highly reflective of player experience and a lot of the tank feelings reflect more the strength of supports than the ranks vs each other. 

But Doom and Ball do struggle a bit being so easily disrupted with quick cool downs from a couple hero’s. 

It doesn’t even mean they are weak just other characters may be too unfair
    Agree across the board. Player hears that X hero got buffed->plays against that hero->loses->whines about how overtuned the hero is.

I literally had someone complaining about the Zarya buff yesterday because I was shitting down their throat the one round I played her. They were playing Orisa the whole game. *I didn’t bubble a teammate a single time that round*. Please good sir explain how the Zarya buff had *any* impact on the game whatsoever.

Edit: hey you’re the same person from the other comment chain lol
        i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
            The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
    This is why I wish they would bring back the 6th player and just add a "bruiser" role hero's like doom, ball, hog, Mei, and brig are some chars that could be put into this role. A tanker DPS that can't hit as hard, it would be nice if your team is lacking in one are the person in said bruiser role could now play around that
LITERALLY, the only tank that really struggles IMO is Doomfist and Ball, and that’s because sombra is so bullshit
    She's bullshit but 95% of the mouthbreathers who swap to her can't play her. Like. Sure, she's hacking me all the time, but she's 1-9 with a 30% winrate and is an actual detriment to her team
        This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
    honestly dooms doing good rn 6 sec slam and sticky block buff was acc perfect even he’s doing pretty good
    What rank are you in to say Doom is struggling? He’s one of the most played tanks and a positive win rate in comp right now, at least for diamond through GM. He has the highest win rate too among them except in GM where his win rate is just below Sigma’s.
        Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
            How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
                Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
    Rein is easily beat by orisa, Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers and get out of jail free cards currently in the game+ dam boost bastion can completely counter you with no counter play, JQ is just terrible to play into Orisa, Sigma is ok but your literally not going to be killing anyone unless they're very out of position, Dva can't reasonably kill anything for the same reason as Winston tho she does slightly better against bast. And all of these are destroyed by a zen just placing discord or bastion just existing. While I agree in lower ranks most are still viable, in a setting where most players know what they're doing and have proper CD management and positioning the majority of tanks just become plain unfun and weak to play. Dive tanks do not have the burst to kill anything, and all brawl tanks are weak into Orisa apart from Zaraya. It's not even tanks being the only ones affected by overtuned supports rn dive heros as a whole are just miserable to play into the current meta.
        > Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
    This man does not play reinhardt
True, but also depends on which season. Stuff like Zarya in season 1 for example was played by pretty much every top 500 player in every region as the most played tank.
Was 2 tanks actually better in your opinion?

In my experience, the most the more active tanks, the harder matches are to balance.
Nah, tank duos ruled the roost in OW1. It was the same problem except you needed both tanks players to be on the same wavelength instead of your one tank player to just be good at what they're playing
Yea overall I’d argue it was better feeling for the tanks.

Like yes 2 tanks has problems but it’s nice to have a back up. 

Like now it’s like oh great they have orisa bastion I’m on rein we’ll get fucked I guess.

In 2 tank you could have a dva harass the bastion greater negating the biggest problem faces in horse bastion match up. Don’t swap now and you’re basically fucked.

Previously it was more like an mmo you had your MT and OT.
Okay fair point but I believe the game was objectively more fun with two tanks. I’m a tank main and it was nice to have another tank to help out. I actually loved GOATS. I agree that blizzard needs to balance tanks but I also believe it was lots of fun to play with another tank!
The problem here is not "tanks are meta defining", the problem is "tank feels shit to play"
I’ve been in a flow before where I would know what the other team was going to do. Like I was aware of where everyone was on my team, what the optimal position was to defend and apply pressure, AND I also remember thinking, oh this leaves us open to this over here, so I position myself waiting there and like 2 seconds later a lone DPS walks in and I get the pick. 

Rarely does that happen, cause it feels like my team also needs to play well enough to capitalize off plays like that but when I do get to play like that it’s amazing.
This is why me and my friend dominate in any game if we're together, we have some crazy synergy, but as soon as one thing gets in the way of that or one of us dies or something, we get rolled 

Ex: Rein brig, Rein reaper, reaper cass, Ana Rein (we can both play all of these so these combos work really well)
FR, if they wanted, they could literally make Sym's orbs pierce again. Not just shields but multiple characters. That was such a goofy ability back in the day. 

Many tank players enjoyed the game for 3+ years before COVID, lawsuits, and the content drought really took its toll. Through GOATS, through Double Shield, through countless games of Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony (the true banes of 2CP, the other maps were ok). They still ultimately had fun. 

Meanwhile OW2 tank depression rises before even 1 year.
> Sojourn ult, Orisa ult

those don't ignore shields AFAIK
    Orisa ult does ignore shields. They buffed it during season 2. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and isn’t super consistent but it does ignore them.
    Yes they do.
        after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
            Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
5v5 blows and it's not even close.
Oh man you got downvoted by the very vocal 6v6 lovers. 

I’m sorry man
    Oh no not my internet points!
        For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
            I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
                I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
                    You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                        Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
                How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
> Terrible reply. Opinionated cheer, and delulu~

*6v6 was more fun for MOST tanks.*

*Your argument is not only wrong, but woefully inadequate.*
    I’m the one crying? In this thread? Lol
I'm defining a genre by its defining feature LOL
    How? In tf2, the defining hero shooter, counterswapping cant really happen as there’s so few characters to play that it’s generally not really helpful beyond swapping guns and maybe if one person is absolutely dominating u can focus him, but in other hero shooters like Paladins and Valorant u can’t even swap characters so countering is kind of impossible. Overwatch is the only game counter swapping is a thing, it’s important and i like it but it has nothing to do with the genre its in
    So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Personally, I can't wait to see what the enemy is playing so I can pick a counter. Even better when they see what I'm playing and pick a counter.
        You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
        > So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
            "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
I quite enjoy it, actually.

I like switching to Moira and dominating the Genji that was shitting on us. I like going Torb and making that Tracer switch off - hell, maybe they switch to Pharah and counter my Torb. Then I'm the one that has to switch.

Counter picking is a fun mechanic for some and mostly works as it should when it's DPS and support interactions. It's just unfortunate that it affects tanks so adversely and that's something that needs to be fixed.
>The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.


Oh absolutely, my point was that most tank matchups are at least playable. But out of all cross-class matchups, Damage heroes have the most "anti-Tank" heroes (obviously), and since there are two DPS for every Tank, the dps players are free to pick the hardest counter, and exactly as you said: bully the tank. 

If you're a support being relentlessly dived by a dps, you can swap to Brig, Moira, maybe Bap or Zen if you really want to just take the duels. Most of those swaps aren't "hard" counters (like how Brig used to be able to delete Tracer with a full combo if recall was on CD) in the way Reaper deletes Winston by clicking m1 in his general direction, or how a symettra who doesn't place all her turrets in one spot can completely dogwalk Reinhardt.
    While I don’t think it’s disputable that dps have more anti tank options, I don’t feel they’re nearly as bad to play into as their support counterpart (ana and zen) or THE anti tank, orisa. I’d much rather play into the dps heroes because many of them have drawbacks that, as a tank player, you can capitalize on. Like playing into sym, to burst you down, that means she’s in your effective range. 

The same cannot be said for ana or zen, who require coordinated dives to deal with at high levels, and playing a brawl tank into them is just an instant L. And orisa is orisa, who gets to basically sit there and control your movements.
in my experience bullying the tank is a bad strategy most of the time because of the sheer amount of healing supports can provide. That's why ana nade is so strong, but it's the exception to that rule
    No amount of healing is saving you from discord and a bastion.

And yes, anti is ridiculous, which is why ana was the best hero in the game for like 4 seasons straight. It took 3 consecutive nerfs to move her from best hero to “one of the best” now.
        The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
            Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
>The issue isn’t dps heroes, it’s just everything in the fucking game.

My flaming hot take is that role queue was the game's biggest mistake and hero swapping the game's second biggest mistake.

The 2016 crowd just wanted to hop onto games with friends and go pew pew pew. Instead, now we have to have a carefully designed sports team with roles that don't match the audience's composition (with the MMO holy trinity, way more than 40% of people want to play DPS and way less than 40% want to be healers). This leads to long queue times, which leads to players leaving, which leads to longer queue times, and the game spirals.

Instead of role queue, IMO the proper fix would have been to make the characters more similar to each other to eliminate hard counters, both at the hero level (Pharah vs Junkrat) and at the team composition level (3 support and 3 tank vs 6 DPS). DPS could largely remain as is though Pharah would need a rework, tanks would change to fat DPS, support would either be closer to Zen with weak healing or Mercy with single target strong healing, and the OW2 support passive could be extended to all characters so that you wouldn't need healers as much.

Hero swapping is a much trickier argument. I'd argue that the way the majority of 2016 OW1 players want to play the game is more like how you play Smash Bros - find a character that is fun and play them. The hero swapping never worked the way that Jeff Kaplan and his team thought it would and the rock paper scissors dynamic ended up being the worst part of the game because people just wanted to play who they want to play. Additionally, you could have per hero SR, which would help matchmaking quality. Ever tried to learn a hero but keep having to switch back to your main because you are unable to keep up with your rank? Per hero SR would fix this problem.

Of course there's two problems with removing role queue and hero swapping. The first is that this dev team is way too incompetent to pull this off. First they broke the game with Brig, then when they did role queue they didn't rebalance it for half a year, and then when they did 5v5 they reworked a measly 4 characters. There's no way they could pull off the changes needed to homogenize the cast enough to eliminate hard counters.

The second is that it's not what the current game audience wants. The people who have stuck with OW are the ones who like the unique heroes and the sports team like roles. I would argue that the majority of the game's 2016 player base would prefer my vision, but I also recognize that they are gone and trying to swap out a current player base to get back one that's already left would be a bad move.
The lower the TTK is, the better it becomes to just sit behind a shield and blast away in safety. When you have things like hanzo spam and roadhog hook threatening instant death, why risk playing dive where your supports can be picked off before you even crack the enemy Rein's shield?

Damage needs to come down across the board, and so does healing. The only things that should deal 225+ damage are ults, and damage boosted Widow/Hanzo headshots.
    Cut down the damage and cut down the cc and double shield would basically drop off the map, they did one but not the other.
        They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
What you describe only works on the perspective of Dafran, a GM player. If you are not at that level, of course you won't be able to play against counters. You know why Dafran's Winston only have trouble with hard counters on GM? is because those are player on his level. And if you follow your advice, "git gud", then you'll face people who also, "got gud", which will be countering you at your level.

I have no idea how you can consider what you just said constructive at all.
    you just need to get good, at lower ranks people just don’t know how to punish. Winston has an escape mechanic and a bubble to juggle on a short cooldown

I am said it’s hard, like playing most tanks but not impossible

Also if people are struggling in their level then it means they’re supposed to be at that level until they improve

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
        Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
            What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
                ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
                    if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                        Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                        Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
That comment just shows people have no idea what they’re talking about lol
    They just like to bitch about the game because it’s hard to accept responsibility for your losses/shortcomings
This is true, but the people that don't understand this the most seem to not actually play tank. It is the people that yell at me for "throwing" since I didn't switch off the second the other tank switched to a tank that was better against me.
Sometimes when the whole team counter-swap you, you may indirectly enable someone else in your team. I had games that enemies switch to JQ + Bastion + Reaper against me as monkey, this means none of the enemies could contest my mid-long range DPS.
    Yea, but were you, personally, having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks?
        > having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
Well no you're still limited to 2 or 3 that are otherwise throwing, however they constantly change throughout the match as you and other tank counter pick each other

It's one of the core issues with only having one tank
    It was an issue in OW1 as well. Good luck playing Winston into Hog, even with a second tank.
        Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
            Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
            And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
Nah they need to balance it so basically no tank hard counters another so it’s up to the skill of the player and not just “my tank beats yours because I picked it”
    that’s not possible with a game that is heavily reliant on abilities. by the nature of having unique abilities and weapons, different characters will counter others and get countered all the same. a truly balanced game would have to revolve around counter picking for the most optimal play. by nature of a competitive game, players try and win and will look for the most efficient way which is how metas form. if one character is even just a little better than others, a meta will naturally revolve around it
        It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
            Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
                Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
                    Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                        Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
            i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
    6 v6 cures so many problems with overwatch 2
I prefer counter-pick more than "pick this meta Tank or lose" situation.
You’re a gold player; you can play literally any tank you want and do just fine.
    woah there buddy, no need to be condescending… I’ll have you know I’m in the top 50% of all ranked players… I’m sure you couldn’t say the same…
        You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
            nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
                Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
                    Still better than you…  probably silver …
                        I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
        >  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
    Rank shaming in 2023 LMAOO
        its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
        Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
            I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
                No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
Some diabolical revisionist history going ok in this comment section 😭😭
    it's pretty funny, i can vividly remember numerous OW1 tank queue sessions where i was just 'why the actual fuck do i play this game'.  but apparently it was some dreamland of zarya delivering perfect bubbles to rein being healed by ana and sped by lucio, or coordinated winston d.va dives on discord targets.  

it was a shitshow most of the time.  i liked 6v6 overall but am honestly having more fun tanking in OW2, if they tone down orisa a bit it will be fine
I'd rather have a hog with me to eat some cooldowns than have sleep, anti nade and mag nade hit me when i drop shield.
    Instead the enemy went double shield. Where things like anti and discord could never get through, and you just lost if you didn't have the same broken tank synergy.
Rose tinted glasses when I played overwatch 1 till the end and lost nearly all motivation in season one of overwatch 2?  Yall still use that argument all the time and think you won
Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

    5v5 was a good change, a great change. I'd rather counter pick rather then the mirror comp meta

Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

&#x200B;

Too much power has been put into the support roles imo. If there is to only be 1 tank then all the power and fun needs to go into the tanks otherwise why would anyone want to play the role.
    There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change. 

Clearly you don't understand that your opinion doesn't make something fact.
            There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?
    
>Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

The short space of time of 2 years with 0 updates at the end of OW1?
        These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
    > Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

what are you talking about??

it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

and ow1 was practically irrelevant and dying at the time due to how boring the gameplay was playing the same heroes in mirror comp all the time 

> Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

dive goats and brawl were fucking braindead mirrors like i said. there was barely any strategic "flex tank" switching like you guys claim. 

> Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1
        >  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
        The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
            I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
            clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
            

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
                Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
                    Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
                It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
Queues flex. Gets support everytime.
There are also 4 more enemies to counter you and only you.
> Anti and Sleep together can almost guarantee a tank's death. 

No, it doesn't. Do you play Ana? I'm just curious because there's a lot of....knowledge you're kinda skipping over. 

It's situational:

What is the position of you and your team when their tank dies? What is the position of the enemy team? What's the ult statuses (i.e Does their genji have blade? Does their Soldier have visor?) Are the enemy support cooldowns up or did they blow them? Is your team actually coordinating and working together? etc.

Ever since they nerfed Ana where tanks wake up in 3 seconds instead of 5, it made it significantly worse to sleep tanks.
    This is neither a dissertation on ana nor an argument.

Do you play tank? Have you played tank against Ana at higher levels?

From masters to GM anti was frequently used on me as tank, forcing me to wait or play passively or outright guaranteeing my death.

Nade is available every 10 seconds or so. And many fights across all skill levels will involve up to two uses of nade.

Nading the tank to stop a push in part one of a fight and nading a support or dps to secure an elim 10 seconds later is still nading the tank and still giving value.

Many if not most of the Ana's i play against are nading the tank with exceptions, of course (because no ability exists in a vacuum, and I never implied it did) 

Ive played enough ana and enough tank to know she is part of the readon tank is so strenuous right now. She is one of the most played supports for a reason.
Because now we get a patch almost every 3 weeks. We get the season's patch, the 2 week patch, and the mid season patch. With how often we get updates, they won't bring back a mode to test features. They should do it to test future changes but we all know they won't
Not like they actually used it anyway. They put charge cancel on there...4? 3? times and didn't implement it.
Probably so they could force 5v5 on us. They didn’t make it so it could be tested and they could get feedback, they just implemented it and went “yup that’s how it is now.”
    The real reason I replied to the comment before you
I mean honestly that's a pretty good point. Blizzard is run by a bunch of idiots and I do wish I lived in the universe where a competent company had the Overwatch IP.
People pull out old reason why 2 tank suck forget blizzard literally dont give a shit about the game state for 3 years. If they actually give effort and fix it non of those thing could happen. The rework of orisa in ow"2" have already fix some of the double shield problem. Kiriko suzu help counter alot of tank cc by her own, etc... It can be fixed if blizzard actually give a shit about their game.
Thats what people fail to understand. Blizzard didn't rework everything for overwatch 2. They made minimal changes and kept most of it the same then tossed us in 5v5. Lazy fucks just made things worse.
Not really supports were fine, you could make an argument for it being worse for dps but it was meta dependent.
    Support are way more fun now than they were before.
        Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
Double shield meta again 😍
    How is it double shield when orisa literally got reworked? Ram and Sig wouldnt work that well together
        But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
            I feel sorry for you
                Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
Yes! Tank que times is 5 seconds for a reason lol
[deleted]
Exactly! People don't understand that though. Or choose to ignore it
[deleted]
    I wouldn't say it's pure revisionist. I used to be a tank main, as was a friend of mine, and we tried for a bit in overwatch 2, but eventually gave it up. I haven't really touched tank for about 3 or 4 seasons. I tried once or twice after I dropped it, but it just sucks now, imo. Too much pressure on one player, and you can't enjoy the role like you used to be able to. Not all tank players disappeared, but this one at least did.
        [deleted]
            And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
Because Supports is in the best state right now and many people are still enjoying / learning Illari and also buffed Lifeweaver.
> DPS times did but it's no different than the current 8 minute wait times for supports.

DPS queues were minimum 20 minutes long at the end of OW1's life. And I have the screenshots to prove it. Plenty of old clips from streamers showing this too.

We can't go back to that, the game will die again if people have to wait 20 mins for a game.
    Dont forget that DPS queue times were so long that Blizz had to introduce Priority Passes (by playing tank or support) just so you can jump queue.

They HAD to incentivize tank and support just to cut dps queue times. And it was STILL long.
        We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
            Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
    I mean they currently have bots in quickplay. I don't think it could get more dead than it currently is. At least with 6v6 there was enough players to start games without the need of bots
Lmao, we had 15 minute queues for DPS a the end of OW1’s lifecycle. Everyone has rose-tinted glasses looking back at 6v6. Sure, it had its pros, but we can’t forget about all the cons. Too many people either forget that double shield existed, or are lying to themselves that double shield wasn’t that bad. We are complaining about tank being in a bad place because of rock paper scissors, but at least there is diversity there instead of being forced to play Sigma/Orisa.
    Yeah now it's just being forced to play orisa. So much better.
        Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
            All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
                You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
But Competitive Overwatch preferred 5v5 more.

The best thing about 5v5, I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs / timid Reins or Orisa / slow lurking Balls could sod off.
    Except now you have one tank with literally all the pressure and way too many roles to fill in one slot, and if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.
        I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
        > if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
[deleted]
    I feel like so many people ignore this aspect - mm was so dogshit for tanks because of hog.

It wasnt utopian, synergy barely existed.
> The community has already spoken and they want 6v6 back.

Source?
    remember when tank queue in OW1 was so long because everyone wanted to play tank because it was so fun?

this happened in season, uh, *checks notes*, it was season *flips through pages* look - the community has spoken
    Try just searching 6v6 in this sub. Or Twitter. Or YouTube. Or the overwatch forum. Everywhere basically.
    Trust ♪⁠～⁠(⁠´⁠ε⁠｀⁠ ⁠)
I've played ow since the original beta.

6v6 is imposible to balance, two tanks is stupid and it is not fun at all.
    played for a long ass too, 5v5 is stupid and playing tank is not fun at all.
    Except with any end up with role q until shortly before echo came out, so all that time beforehand was either goats, or no limit
    Yeah cause 5v5 is so balanced rn
    You're in the minority here buddy. Balanced or not people have spoken and they want 6v6 back. The majority of players found it more fun even if it was less balanced.
        How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
            I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
                I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
                    I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
        I think the 6v6 folks are just louder.  The 5v5 guys are too busy playing Overwatch.

I personally come here to fight against 6v6 because I found it actively torturous and never want to go back to it.
            That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
                I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
                    I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
                I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
        6v6 is not coming back. Deal with it.
            We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
> community has already spoken

Yeah, and they weren't playing tank because it was boring and unfun. A very vocal minority on reddit thinks 6v6 was better, while the people who like 5v5 are busy playing the game with the lowest queue times its ever had.
    Ever had? C'mon man we do not have to lie. People keep saying it's a vocal minority but just look at who's getting down voted and who's not. You can like 5v5. That's fine but like don't act like it's the popular position. Like people are in agreement that 6v6 is better. It just needed some tweaking. With the current state of tanks and supports 6v6 would work much better than it use to. The game would be fun again too!
        Reread my comment. This whole subreddit is a vocal minority. Not even 10% of players use reddit. Even on the other Overwatch sub 5v5 is vastly preferred. But once again you can't argue against the fact that queue times were insanely long in OW1 because nobody wanted to play tank, if you actually played it.
Cassidy cc also fucks up winston. Want to jump back out? Nope.... and then insta melted by right click.
she does 0 damage and low healing she's fine
    Mmhmm “low healing” for a lot of characters her healing is plenty to get a kill on a enemy not being healed. She also is extremely hard to hit for a lot of people because of her movement
And yet she's maybe the worst support at the moment, bottom 3 at the very least.
You do realize the idea that removing a tank means also that supports too are far more greatly exposed than they were before, and saying “focus on your positioning” can only work so well for supports like Zen and Ana who have zero mobility and NEED to rely on their cooldowns to have a chance of getting away even remotely? That’s the entire point I’m making. Removing a tank increased pressure on everyone and going into OW2 and giving supports no additional tools to aid themselves beyond “move around better” only takes you so far. Not every character can Mercy or Lucio zip around in seconds.
    I'm not arguing that supports didn't need new tools to fit in the new sandbox. I'm saying that even when they had said tools, support players still felt underpowered simply because they weren't used to playing in such an active way. Now that they are, most supports are straight up busted.
I mean...of course it's going to have the lowest player base. You need one tank per team per game, thus of course the total number of players is going to be lower; the ratio of need for tanks is just mathematically lower at 1:2:2...? This should come as no surprise. If the tank population surged you would be waiting hours for a game.

It seems more like tank players wanted to be raid bosses to me and got a rude awakening when they realized the absence of a second tank increased pressure on \*everyone\*, including support players, and that it's just unfun to be dove in two seconds by a hog/doomfist and be unable to play the game. Also, if you're losing a 1v1 against a support that's more a reflection on you than it is on the role. Trapping a support should never be an automatic guarantee of a free kill. If you can't finish them off even with the sheer strength advantage...I don't know what to tell you. You should be easily able to kill a Zen/Ana as a [D.va](https://D.va). If you can't... Be better at the game, maybe?

Anyway, supports are going to stay roughly where they are, because they're all relatively balanced amongst each other and the role is finally good. Tanks will I'm sure get some sort of buffs/changed to compensate the role being stressful and more unfun (we see this with hog rework etc).
    That’s… that’s not how statistics work?? 😭
        That’s…that’s not how making an argument works?? 😭
What’s your rank?
You obviously didn’t read the rest of my comment because I specific stated season 1 and 2 where that was the case lmao
    I did. I just think you're delusional. Supp was hard for 2 ENTIRE SEASONS oh you poor baby. Tank has been terrible for like 4 years now.
        It actually just sounds like you’re a bitter crybaby who took my words out of context. Continue to cope and seethe; tank buffs are not going to make you better at the game lmao
And you don’t think they wouldn’t adjust the tanks accordingly? The reason the tanks are all souped up the way they are (and why the tank matchup / tank diff is so profound) is because there’s only 1 of them. Re-introducing two tanks they will likely gut many characters’ offensive kits - like probably reverting rein to one fire strike, or make it like 70 damage or something, nerfing charge back to entirely committal or even lower damage than it is now *because it isn’t nearly as committal*; make ram shield last longer and reduce punch damage / annihilation uptime; make zarya go back to the 1/1 bubble
    I'd take this any time vs getting targeted with every single CC the enemy has to offer every 8 seconds because there's only 1 tank.
        ... you still would be targeted. Too much CC was the biggest complaint of tank players for the entirety of OW1.
            yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
            And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
It’s not even double shield so much as it is that everyone acts like this 1 tank game is so shit like we didn’t all have gripes with everything beforehand. Double shield, flashbang, doomfist as a dps, brig, stuns were crazy; the state of tanks in OW1 got so fucked up that they literally had to force a 2-2-2 role lock to make DPS usable in their esports league (and probably higher ranks too). 

Do you realize how bad it was with multiple tanks? Having that freedom *literally* invalidated… 38 heroes now, Doom was a dps, JQ/Ram/Kiriko/Sojourn/LW/Illari didn’t exist - we would have had 8 tanks and a total roster of 32 with 17 DPS? A specific combination of tanks - Rein/Zarya/Dva just completely invalidated the entire DPS roster in the highest level of play because why would you ever use a 150-250 HP hero when you can use 400-600 that have just as good or better damage?

In Open Queue in OW2 it was still enough of a problem that they nerfed the base health pools of the tanks. 

Reverting to 6v6 would just create new problems. Rn just please nerf orisa and revert turrets, shit is so unfun to play and play against. Orisa literally has minimal mobility and doesn’t have explosive damage but she lives forever and her cooldowns are amazing so it doesn’t matter and I have to play her anyway, and why they wanted a torb/bastion meta is beyond me.
Bruh if there’s an offtank that’s not double shield 😂
    …Obviously. More often though it was not two big shielded tanks during that era. Sometimes there would be double shield and sometimes one shield one off sometimes two off tanks. But even when there were two shielded characters yes I liked that. People just were too dumb to shoot the shield
    Sigma?

??????????? 

Did you even play overwatch 1?
The problem is their no fucking off tank role. So more often then not you end up with the 2 mets tank.

You think rein, Winston was fun? Or zarya, dva? It was horrible.
    Rein Winston was an actual fucking blast my guy

You walked over double shield because both your attacks ignored shields
        To play... i'm talking about playing against.
And now queue times are even worse because so few people wanna play tank already since all the blame falls on them 😂
[deleted]
But bad Tanks are very hard to carry.
    Exactly. Now imagine they removed the other tank from the game altogether so you only had one tank. And then THAT was the bad tank.
        With one less Tank, the enemy team has one less peeler and more chanced to be picked or dived.

It can still work if you're an amazing sniper who can pop their heads but how's that going to work in 6v6 if the enemy team runs Double Shields?

As Support, I have more room to do damage as I have only one Tank to heal and my damage won't be blocked by enemy two Tanks.
Its not, overwatch 1 had more balance issues than overwatch 2, people are just quick to forget.
    Nope
        Wanna expand on your obviously wrong opinion?
            It's not wrong
                It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
Depends which role you're playing.

In 6v6, Tank hurts the most when another is being bad because he/she will be bullied by six players, meanwhile DPS + Supports are affected the least.

In 5v5, DPS & Supports would suffer along.
    Doesn't depend on which role you play. A bad tank in overwatch 2 is horrible for everyone in your team, a bad tank in overwatch 1 is more managable.
For some reason the game seems to be developed around the two ends of the bell curve and not the huge majority in the middle.
    An item of character broken in competitive may be balanced perfectly for the average level gameplay. But then it gets nerfed do to competitive leaving every one else out to dry
But that side has more players who have deeper knowledge to this game.
    I really don’t care, I am tired of casual players being f’ed over because competitive players wanna be whiny
        And they represent such a small portion of the community and an even smaller portion of the community if they’re from the top ranks. Listening to like 5-10% of the playerbase is ridiculous
            Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
                OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
            And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
                People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
                I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
        because casual players aren't whiny ? lmao
    Then they can find another game to screw up with their "competitive" opinions.
> Ana is the worst designed character in the game

Ana is like reworked Hanzo who has many strengths that outweigh her weakness. Support self-heal passive makes her gameplay more forgiving and she has a hidden passive which is her small wonky shape hitbox. Self-heal passive + small hitbox can be huge lifesavers unless she's attacked by Winston / Moira beam; Torb / Sym turret.
They didn't say equaly viable but overwatch isn't a 1v1 game. The 4 other player should be able to offset the tank difference to a point it doesn't matter.
dva has massive armor and mobility. zarya doesn't shutdown dva unless dva wants to. dva's biggest weakness is that she has a huge critbox yet zarya doesn't even crit.
    [deleted]
        zarya has only 15m range with her beam and she is super slow. dva can use the all map and engage/disengage at will. zarya beats dva only in certain brawl maps if dva has to brawl. 

zarya is the brawler. different archetypes yet still dva is strong. if zarya is not high charge or doesnt have bubble available, dva can kill her face to face. It takes almost 8 seconds to demech dva.

dva is 146 dps. lets say she is 50% accurate face to face 75dps. she can crit too.

max charge zarya 130dps (w reload). Let's say she is high charge but not max. 100dps, 100% accuracy.

zarya 475hp

dva 350hp 300 armor

do the math. if there are any healers, dva is easier to heal and her armor increases the effectiveness of heal. zarya is harder to heal due to her slim figure and there is no armor.

this zarya counter dva knowledge is very old and outdated at this point. there are a lot of nuances in the match up.
I actually like it now.

5v5 means I don't need to worry about bad co-Tank teammates anymore. Flanking Hogs can sod off.
    We can agree to disagree.
> I prefer more tactical gameplay

What tactic? Tanks being shieldbots, DPS shoot shields, Supports being healbots.

I'm glad I could do something more than just healing.
    Shieldbots? Did you play for like 4 months during double shield meta and nwver again?

Healers were also just healbots when you don't understand your role.
The thing is, 6v6 made sense. 5v5 is wonky as hell. The game fundamentally broken and doesn't function properly. Every patch is a flavor and band aid fix.
Agree across the board. Player hears that X hero got buffed->plays against that hero->loses->whines about how overtuned the hero is.

I literally had someone complaining about the Zarya buff yesterday because I was shitting down their throat the one round I played her. They were playing Orisa the whole game. *I didn’t bubble a teammate a single time that round*. Please good sir explain how the Zarya buff had *any* impact on the game whatsoever.

Edit: hey you’re the same person from the other comment chain lol
    i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
        The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
This is why I wish they would bring back the 6th player and just add a "bruiser" role hero's like doom, ball, hog, Mei, and brig are some chars that could be put into this role. A tanker DPS that can't hit as hard, it would be nice if your team is lacking in one are the person in said bruiser role could now play around that
She's bullshit but 95% of the mouthbreathers who swap to her can't play her. Like. Sure, she's hacking me all the time, but she's 1-9 with a 30% winrate and is an actual detriment to her team
    This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
honestly dooms doing good rn 6 sec slam and sticky block buff was acc perfect even he’s doing pretty good
What rank are you in to say Doom is struggling? He’s one of the most played tanks and a positive win rate in comp right now, at least for diamond through GM. He has the highest win rate too among them except in GM where his win rate is just below Sigma’s.
    Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
        How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
            Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
Rein is easily beat by orisa, Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers and get out of jail free cards currently in the game+ dam boost bastion can completely counter you with no counter play, JQ is just terrible to play into Orisa, Sigma is ok but your literally not going to be killing anyone unless they're very out of position, Dva can't reasonably kill anything for the same reason as Winston tho she does slightly better against bast. And all of these are destroyed by a zen just placing discord or bastion just existing. While I agree in lower ranks most are still viable, in a setting where most players know what they're doing and have proper CD management and positioning the majority of tanks just become plain unfun and weak to play. Dive tanks do not have the burst to kill anything, and all brawl tanks are weak into Orisa apart from Zaraya. It's not even tanks being the only ones affected by overtuned supports rn dive heros as a whole are just miserable to play into the current meta.
    > Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
This man does not play reinhardt
Orisa ult does ignore shields. They buffed it during season 2. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me and isn’t super consistent but it does ignore them.
Yes they do.
    after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
        Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
Oh no not my internet points!
    For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
        I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
            I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
                You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                    Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
            How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
I’m the one crying? In this thread? Lol
How? In tf2, the defining hero shooter, counterswapping cant really happen as there’s so few characters to play that it’s generally not really helpful beyond swapping guns and maybe if one person is absolutely dominating u can focus him, but in other hero shooters like Paladins and Valorant u can’t even swap characters so countering is kind of impossible. Overwatch is the only game counter swapping is a thing, it’s important and i like it but it has nothing to do with the genre its in
So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Personally, I can't wait to see what the enemy is playing so I can pick a counter. Even better when they see what I'm playing and pick a counter.
    You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
    > So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
        "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
While I don’t think it’s disputable that dps have more anti tank options, I don’t feel they’re nearly as bad to play into as their support counterpart (ana and zen) or THE anti tank, orisa. I’d much rather play into the dps heroes because many of them have drawbacks that, as a tank player, you can capitalize on. Like playing into sym, to burst you down, that means she’s in your effective range. 

The same cannot be said for ana or zen, who require coordinated dives to deal with at high levels, and playing a brawl tank into them is just an instant L. And orisa is orisa, who gets to basically sit there and control your movements.
No amount of healing is saving you from discord and a bastion.

And yes, anti is ridiculous, which is why ana was the best hero in the game for like 4 seasons straight. It took 3 consecutive nerfs to move her from best hero to “one of the best” now.
    The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
        Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
Cut down the damage and cut down the cc and double shield would basically drop off the map, they did one but not the other.
    They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
you just need to get good, at lower ranks people just don’t know how to punish. Winston has an escape mechanic and a bubble to juggle on a short cooldown

I am said it’s hard, like playing most tanks but not impossible

Also if people are struggling in their level then it means they’re supposed to be at that level until they improve

if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.
    Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
        What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
            ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
                if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                    Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                    Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
They just like to bitch about the game because it’s hard to accept responsibility for your losses/shortcomings
Yea, but were you, personally, having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks?
    > having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
It was an issue in OW1 as well. Good luck playing Winston into Hog, even with a second tank.
    Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
        Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
        And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
that’s not possible with a game that is heavily reliant on abilities. by the nature of having unique abilities and weapons, different characters will counter others and get countered all the same. a truly balanced game would have to revolve around counter picking for the most optimal play. by nature of a competitive game, players try and win and will look for the most efficient way which is how metas form. if one character is even just a little better than others, a meta will naturally revolve around it
    It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
        Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
            Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
                Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                    Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
        i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
6 v6 cures so many problems with overwatch 2
woah there buddy, no need to be condescending… I’ll have you know I’m in the top 50% of all ranked players… I’m sure you couldn’t say the same…
    You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
        nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
            Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
                Still better than you…  probably silver …
                    I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
    >  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
Rank shaming in 2023 LMAOO
    its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
    Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
        I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
            No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
it's pretty funny, i can vividly remember numerous OW1 tank queue sessions where i was just 'why the actual fuck do i play this game'.  but apparently it was some dreamland of zarya delivering perfect bubbles to rein being healed by ana and sped by lucio, or coordinated winston d.va dives on discord targets.  

it was a shitshow most of the time.  i liked 6v6 overall but am honestly having more fun tanking in OW2, if they tone down orisa a bit it will be fine
Instead the enemy went double shield. Where things like anti and discord could never get through, and you just lost if you didn't have the same broken tank synergy.
There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change. 

Clearly you don't understand that your opinion doesn't make something fact.
        There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?

>Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

The short space of time of 2 years with 0 updates at the end of OW1?
    These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
> Double shield was only ever good for a very short space of time. 

what are you talking about??

it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

and ow1 was practically irrelevant and dying at the time due to how boring the gameplay was playing the same heroes in mirror comp all the time 

> Other metas such as dive, brawl and goats lasted much longer.

dive goats and brawl were fucking braindead mirrors like i said. there was barely any strategic "flex tank" switching like you guys claim. 

> Clearly you don't play tank at all otherwise you wouldn't think this.

clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1
    >  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
    The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
        I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
        clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
        

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
            Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
                Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
            It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
This is neither a dissertation on ana nor an argument.

Do you play tank? Have you played tank against Ana at higher levels?

From masters to GM anti was frequently used on me as tank, forcing me to wait or play passively or outright guaranteeing my death.

Nade is available every 10 seconds or so. And many fights across all skill levels will involve up to two uses of nade.

Nading the tank to stop a push in part one of a fight and nading a support or dps to secure an elim 10 seconds later is still nading the tank and still giving value.

Many if not most of the Ana's i play against are nading the tank with exceptions, of course (because no ability exists in a vacuum, and I never implied it did) 

Ive played enough ana and enough tank to know she is part of the readon tank is so strenuous right now. She is one of the most played supports for a reason.
The real reason I replied to the comment before you
Support are way more fun now than they were before.
    Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
How is it double shield when orisa literally got reworked? Ram and Sig wouldnt work that well together
    But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
        I feel sorry for you
            Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
I wouldn't say it's pure revisionist. I used to be a tank main, as was a friend of mine, and we tried for a bit in overwatch 2, but eventually gave it up. I haven't really touched tank for about 3 or 4 seasons. I tried once or twice after I dropped it, but it just sucks now, imo. Too much pressure on one player, and you can't enjoy the role like you used to be able to. Not all tank players disappeared, but this one at least did.
    [deleted]
        And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
Dont forget that DPS queue times were so long that Blizz had to introduce Priority Passes (by playing tank or support) just so you can jump queue.

They HAD to incentivize tank and support just to cut dps queue times. And it was STILL long.
    We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
        Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
I mean they currently have bots in quickplay. I don't think it could get more dead than it currently is. At least with 6v6 there was enough players to start games without the need of bots
Yeah now it's just being forced to play orisa. So much better.
    Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
        All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
            You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
Except now you have one tank with literally all the pressure and way too many roles to fill in one slot, and if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.
    I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
    > if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
I feel like so many people ignore this aspect - mm was so dogshit for tanks because of hog.

It wasnt utopian, synergy barely existed.
remember when tank queue in OW1 was so long because everyone wanted to play tank because it was so fun?

this happened in season, uh, *checks notes*, it was season *flips through pages* look - the community has spoken
Try just searching 6v6 in this sub. Or Twitter. Or YouTube. Or the overwatch forum. Everywhere basically.
Trust ♪⁠～⁠(⁠´⁠ε⁠｀⁠ ⁠)
played for a long ass too, 5v5 is stupid and playing tank is not fun at all.
Except with any end up with role q until shortly before echo came out, so all that time beforehand was either goats, or no limit
Yeah cause 5v5 is so balanced rn
You're in the minority here buddy. Balanced or not people have spoken and they want 6v6 back. The majority of players found it more fun even if it was less balanced.
    How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
        I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
            I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
                I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
    I think the 6v6 folks are just louder.  The 5v5 guys are too busy playing Overwatch.

I personally come here to fight against 6v6 because I found it actively torturous and never want to go back to it.
        That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
            I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
                I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
            I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
    6v6 is not coming back. Deal with it.
        We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
Ever had? C'mon man we do not have to lie. People keep saying it's a vocal minority but just look at who's getting down voted and who's not. You can like 5v5. That's fine but like don't act like it's the popular position. Like people are in agreement that 6v6 is better. It just needed some tweaking. With the current state of tanks and supports 6v6 would work much better than it use to. The game would be fun again too!
    Reread my comment. This whole subreddit is a vocal minority. Not even 10% of players use reddit. Even on the other Overwatch sub 5v5 is vastly preferred. But once again you can't argue against the fact that queue times were insanely long in OW1 because nobody wanted to play tank, if you actually played it.
Mmhmm “low healing” for a lot of characters her healing is plenty to get a kill on a enemy not being healed. She also is extremely hard to hit for a lot of people because of her movement
I'm not arguing that supports didn't need new tools to fit in the new sandbox. I'm saying that even when they had said tools, support players still felt underpowered simply because they weren't used to playing in such an active way. Now that they are, most supports are straight up busted.
That’s… that’s not how statistics work?? 😭
    That’s…that’s not how making an argument works?? 😭
I did. I just think you're delusional. Supp was hard for 2 ENTIRE SEASONS oh you poor baby. Tank has been terrible for like 4 years now.
    It actually just sounds like you’re a bitter crybaby who took my words out of context. Continue to cope and seethe; tank buffs are not going to make you better at the game lmao
I'd take this any time vs getting targeted with every single CC the enemy has to offer every 8 seconds because there's only 1 tank.
    ... you still would be targeted. Too much CC was the biggest complaint of tank players for the entirety of OW1.
        yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
        And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
…Obviously. More often though it was not two big shielded tanks during that era. Sometimes there would be double shield and sometimes one shield one off sometimes two off tanks. But even when there were two shielded characters yes I liked that. People just were too dumb to shoot the shield
Sigma?

??????????? 

Did you even play overwatch 1?
Rein Winston was an actual fucking blast my guy

You walked over double shield because both your attacks ignored shields
    To play... i'm talking about playing against.
Exactly. Now imagine they removed the other tank from the game altogether so you only had one tank. And then THAT was the bad tank.
    With one less Tank, the enemy team has one less peeler and more chanced to be picked or dived.

It can still work if you're an amazing sniper who can pop their heads but how's that going to work in 6v6 if the enemy team runs Double Shields?

As Support, I have more room to do damage as I have only one Tank to heal and my damage won't be blocked by enemy two Tanks.
Nope
    Wanna expand on your obviously wrong opinion?
        It's not wrong
            It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
Doesn't depend on which role you play. A bad tank in overwatch 2 is horrible for everyone in your team, a bad tank in overwatch 1 is more managable.
An item of character broken in competitive may be balanced perfectly for the average level gameplay. But then it gets nerfed do to competitive leaving every one else out to dry
I really don’t care, I am tired of casual players being f’ed over because competitive players wanna be whiny
    And they represent such a small portion of the community and an even smaller portion of the community if they’re from the top ranks. Listening to like 5-10% of the playerbase is ridiculous
        Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
            OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
        And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
            People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
            I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
    because casual players aren't whiny ? lmao
Then they can find another game to screw up with their "competitive" opinions.

    zarya has only 15m range with her beam and she is super slow. dva can use the all map and engage/disengage at will. zarya beats dva only in certain brawl maps if dva has to brawl. 

zarya is the brawler. different archetypes yet still dva is strong. if zarya is not high charge or doesnt have bubble available, dva can kill her face to face. It takes almost 8 seconds to demech dva.

dva is 146 dps. lets say she is 50% accurate face to face 75dps. she can crit too.

max charge zarya 130dps (w reload). Let's say she is high charge but not max. 100dps, 100% accuracy.

zarya 475hp

dva 350hp 300 armor

do the math. if there are any healers, dva is easier to heal and her armor increases the effectiveness of heal. zarya is harder to heal due to her slim figure and there is no armor.

this zarya counter dva knowledge is very old and outdated at this point. there are a lot of nuances in the match up.
We can agree to disagree.
Shieldbots? Did you play for like 4 months during double shield meta and nwver again?

Healers were also just healbots when you don't understand your role.
i mean the cooldown for bubble was reduced right? it doesnt matter whether you're putting it on yourself or a teammate. so if you were saving them all for yourself you probably always had a bubble ready once her fortify went on cooldown which i do imagine would be frustrating for her
    The CD is only reduced and it's only larger when you bubble an ally, you can see for yourself how the CD meter starts in training range
This can’t be emphasized enough. She’s a counter at high levels of play, she’s basically an AFK 5th in the hands of the overwhelming majority of the player base.
Win rate stats in OW mean next to nothing

Edit: not disagreeing about doom tho, just saying
    How do winrate stats not matter? 
Contrxt of it gets skewed if a character has too high or too low of a play rate, but in general, winrate is about the only thing that matters
        Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
> Winston literally cannot kill a squishy with the current healing numbers

he doesn't have to necessarily solo a squishie, as long as he diverts resources from the tank to the squishie so his team can focus and pick; or you could play him more passively and confirm kills instead
after checking Orisa does (it was changed in season 2) but Sojourn definitely doesn't
    Sojourn Ult *pierces enemies* allowing for cool double headshot collateral kills, but does not pierce shields.
For what it’s worth I think each point they made was the incorrect. As a flex player I could never play DPS in OW1 because of queue times, and everyone wanted to play flex tank. Clearly not an issue anymore.
    I mean, queue times were only one part of it. The main benefit of 5v5 is the way it centers teamfights, increases player agency, and overall let’s you have a bigger impact in your games. 6v6 is just so chaotic in comparison
        I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
            You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
                Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
        How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
You're being sarcastic and hyperbolic but yeah, I do enjoy counter picking someone and it's a non negligible part of the game fun wise for me. It's enjoyable to go from seeing a character dominate your team to completely shutting them down with the right pick.  


They just need to fix how it affects and shuts down tanks.
> So you think most people picked up overwatch thinking, "oh man! I can't wait to COUNTERSWAP."

Yeah - most people pick hero shooters thinking "oh man! I can't wait to learn different hero's!" - now extrapolate. Personally I think ranked should have a pick/ban system but to imply a hero shooter isn't about situational selections implies you don't know what the fuck you're playing lmfao.
    "oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
The sheer damage of bastion in turret form is heavily countered by tanks that have "damage eating" abilities like orisa, sig, or dva
    Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
They cut cc for like 1 season, now it's worse than its ever been.
Absolute horseshit broski. I’m high diamond capped at masters on tank and I agree with everything he’s saying. Using Dafran who is in the literal top 1% of overwatch players on any character makes your statement redundant
    What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
        ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
            if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
                Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
                Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
> having fun getting the shit kicked out of you by their counterpicks

It already happen since OW1. Like I play Pharah, they go hitscan(s) + DVA + Echo, etc. 

Now DVA players complain when enemies switch to beam heroes, Genji mains are like: "First time?"
Dva could just eat hook DMG or zar could bubble the hook
    Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
    And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
It is possible. It’s called you balance around weapons primarily and around abilities secondly, as abilities the majority of the time are what introduces counters. Orisa shouldn’t be able to press 2 buttons and counter half the tanks. Sure there will be obvious counters like phara getting killed by hitscan, and  Zarya’s beam going through Dva’s Dm. but you can definitely reduce the amount of counters by removing gimmicks specifically designed to introduce counters that offer 0 gameplay depth. Nobody wants to play counter watch, soft counters are infinitely more healthy for the game then hard counters
    Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
        Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
            Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
                Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
    i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
You’re *sure*? I’d say it’s a coin flip.
    nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
        Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
            Still better than you…  probably silver …
                I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
>  no need to be condescending…

he wasn't ? He's just saying that the meta matters way less in "lower" ranks, which is true
its not rank shaming lmao.

The meta matters way less in metal ranks than individual play/skill. Who cares if the enemy is player the uber-meta Orisa if they can't rotate cooldowns or hit javelins for shit.

And i know that because i play there myself
Rank shaming? I’m pointing out that “meta” doesn’t matter until Masters or even GM. Gold players can play any tank they’d like
    I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
        No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
    There are people who have played tank since the game came out that have thought 5v5 was a bad change.

I know? That's exactly what i said?
These comments are literally clown material. They compare double shield to goats and say "yup, double shield was shorter. Not a big deal."
>  the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

lmao that was not the reason
The last like one and a half years was road meta not Double shield. Imagine lying to try and defend overwatch 2.

Btw every competitive game gets boring without updates, but you ignore that.
    I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about
    clearly you don't know what your talking about otherwise you would know the key reasons they went to 5v5 was to move away from the mirror comp trash that was killing ow1

Mirror matchups were rare outside of overwatch league. Hell there was so many 1 trick tank players that it was barely a thing at all.

    it was the meta until ow2 dropped. and the devs said balancing the tanks so that double shield wasn't the strongest comp without making those tanks dogshit was to hard and was one of the driving reasons they made ow2 5v5 so that other tanks could shine. there was an uproar of the community complaining about how bad shooting shields was in the game so the devs said they wanted to move away from making shield tanks due to how negatively it was affecting the game, which is also why they removed orisas sheild

Yeah but this was obviously bollocks all along. They never needed to remove a tank did they because they removed Orisa's shield in ow2 anyway. 6v6 would have still worked. 5v5 was a selling point so ow2 would seem different rather than a graphics update.

The devs were just work shy and couldn't be bothered updating ow1 because they were busy fucking about with a pve mode that never released.
    

> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
        Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
            Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
        It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
Well yeah because they have all the busted abilities
But your comment said to go back to the save file before OW2.... back when Orisa had a shield... current Orisa would be pretty broken if she had another tank so if they revert the rework for everyone but her it would still be bad (are we seeing the issues yet?)
    I feel sorry for you
        Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷

    And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
We are only 4 seasons in and the wait times are already at 10 minutes. This is with the 5+ years of knowledge they had to work with. I don't see how this is in any way a better system. Give it a couple years and I'm sure support wait times will hit the peak that dps times did. And again we are only 4 seasons in. 4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles. Not to mention there were way more players back then.
    Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
Orisa just needs tuned. If she wasn’t as strong as she is now, every tank aside from Hog would be viable. Even with Orisa as she is, I haven’t had issues running Sigma or Zarya into her depending on the rest of my team comp.
    All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
        You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
I'm convinced 5v5 supporters are all support mains. That is why they don't have a problem with the current system.
> if that one tank is complete dogwater, then you basically lose.

Same thing in 6v6. If your team has one bad Tank, it's mostly a loss game since it's a 5v6 fight, meanwhile the tryhard Tank will be bullied by 6 enemies (unless the enemy two Tanks are much worse and braindead than your tryhard Tank).
How do you know people who favour 5v5 is in the minority? Any source?
    I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
        I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
            I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

    I don’t disagree with that either. 

People act like the community used 6v6 to okay cool tank synergies. 

It was rarely that. It was like 60% Roadhog and Dva players and the very small amount of people like me who played main tank. Every match was the off tank going on wild flanks while you took everything to the face. It was like having a 3rd Dps really so it was very chaotic. 

And fights used to last super long and you weren’t even sure what was going on and suddenly you were losing. So much visual clutter.
        You’re right on the money. Of course I also miss the rare game where you find a Zarya that hits you with perfect bubbles while you swing your hammer in domination. But the reality was that things like that almost never happened. 

Then on top of that, if you’re a dps player you constantly got annoying games where no one played MT. It also limited what support combos were viable because you needed to heal two tanks. Honestly the game just feels so much better in this mode (as someone who plays all 3 roles regularly)
            Exactly my experience. 

I was sad when they announced 5v5 because it was very satisfying to run a Winston/Dva full dive or a Rein/Zarya into a mirror but it was rare people knew how to play it and they usually didn’t want to. 

Back when we switched over I was sad an era was over but understood it was necessary to move on and create more hero diversity.
    How do you possibly think 6v6 is more chaotic, having off tanks limited the death match style to a huge degree, and it slowed everything down. The team fights are just scrambles now, 6v6 was better in every way
"oh man, I cant wait to play my favorite hero"

come on man it aint that deep lmao
Which leads back to how playing tank is dogshit because you can never play the hero you actually want to. Rein, winston, ball, ram and more are all pretty dogshit rn. Doom would be too if his skill expression wasn’t through the damn roof.
What part do you disagree with?

That you need to get good? if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

Do you disagree?
    ‘You just need to get good’ 

Is complete bullshit. The game and it’s heroes, all of them, was designed with 6 heroes on the field and more importantly designed to have 2 tanks. 

There was barely any changes to any heroes to accommodate for the fact they’ll be 1 tank in overwatch 1.

There are too 500 players saying it’s bullshit and miserable to play tank because the game was not designed to be 1 tank only. So it isn’t just scrubs like me
        if you’re not at skill ceiling i.e t500, you can just improve. If you fail to improve you deserve to be stuck at your current rank.

YOU are not entitled to ranking up until you’re better than your current rank, throw up a tantrum all you want but that’s just fact. We are not going to make you a GM tank player just because you think playing winston is unfair. You need to EARN your rank.

T500 can cry and complain all they want, they have reached skill ceiling, you have not.
            Bro all these collegiate basketball players are upset they can’t beat lebron, like just improve bro. Just be better than Lebron. It’s obviously possible, he’s that good. Just improve 4Head
            Probably the most brain dead response I’ve ever seen to any argument ever.

Who the fuck is talking about ranking up? You mentioned bad players, I’m not a bad player, I’m not a good top 500 player either, I’m a competent player.

Players at all ranks are saying the same thing, what don’t you understand?
Did you play it? Getting hooked meant insta death sometimes. Even for a tank like Winston.
And Kiriko can Suzu literally anything.
Do you know what a hero shooter is? It really seems like you don't if you think it's possible for tanks to all be balanced and never counter each other
    Your reading comprehension clearly needs work.. but that’s ok, that’s what we have highschool for.
        Your understanding of a hero shooter is pretty shit too
            Really? Because the devs agree with me lmao. They’re on record saying that they want the game to be less counter pick heavy, and want it to have less hard counters. Not my fault you have Down syndrome, and can’t properly read, and dissect sentences, and paragraphs lmaooo
i’m not gonna disagree with u completely as u make some valid arguments that i do agree with such as making things less gimmicky for the sake of making counters (like ram punch into shields) but overall, counter picks are always going to be a thing in a game with abilities. it’s inevitable since abilities give characters unique strengths and weaknesses and unless all characters are made the same (that would be like csgo) then there will always be counter picks since some characters will always beat another character’s weakness. imo counter swapping is good and engaging for the game, but not to the point where 1 swap on the other team makes u need to switch. if the 2 heroes are balanced, the one at a disadvantage should at least somewhat be able to play against the counter pick with really good play and only need to swap if they are getting diffed (which will happen since it’s a counter pick)
nah bro I’m sure… it’s pretty hard being better than  half the player base… not like you would know…
    Nah dude, gold is literally just above the 2 lowest ranks in the game. You're closer to the bottom than the top.
        Still better than you…  probably silver …
            I'm currently masters 2 but if you want to then keep kidding yourself.
I guess meta doesn’t matter, but that doesn’t make playing against counters any more fun. Sombra hack still exists, orisa still exists. The players are just worse
    No one really *counters* you in a meaningful way at this rank, unless you’re just turning your brain off & running directly into them

For context I regularly play Rein (who’s in a dogshit state) into Orisa and shit on them because they expect that simply *picking* Orisa is “countering” me. Then they proceed to waste their CDs or get easily baited.
I’m always like…I played the whole time. Where was all this double shield everyone is talking about


> 6v6 would have still worked

ow was dying because of that trash but you're clearly in denial so i might as well not waste my breath any longer 😂

> 5v5 was a selling point 

yeah because they were moving away from what was killing the game. that's a pretty good selling point 😂

at least the game will die now because the devs  keep lying about random crap
    Ow was dying because they abandoned the fucking game for years. Not because people were playing orisa sigma.
        Overwatch lost a ton of people during goats. When double shield came around, there were only diehards left.
    It was absolutely 6vs6 and not because the game didn't get any updates and love for years.
I feel sorry for you
    Overwatch is a game that I play for fun. I'm still having fun so I'm still playing. You clearly are not and are begging for a game that no longer exists... maybe save some pity for yourself 🤷
And yet if you queued flex you would always get support
Ive played since launch in both OW1 and OW2 and am talking about qp queue times. Wait times are at max 3-5 mins for all roles and mininum 1-2 mins.

>4 seasons into overwatch 1 we didn't have anywhere near these wait times for any roles.

Season 4 was in Mar 2017. 2016-2018 was peak OW1 hence a lot of players. The defence role combined with attack in 2018 increasing a lot of players for dmg role. Role Queue was introduced in 2019 hence longer queue times 

I am talking about my experience post 2019 and queue times were long af.
All I run into is orisa. Tank starts losing switches to orisa. This is worse than 3 tanks running the game. Now it's switch to orisa after trying some random tank. You could also tune the tanks for 6v6. Idk why people just assume it's impossible. Shield meta wouldn't even be a thing since rein and sig are the only ones left with shields. Both of which can be melted fairly quickly.
    You want this Orisa in 6v6?! This version of Orisa would be dominant in 6v6. Having another tank shores up her weaknesses and allows her to off-tank and be another dps. Plus, the state of the game currently can be fixed by balancing Orisa. Putting her into 6v6 would require balancing all of the other tanks to work alongside another tank while not allowing Orisa to be oppressive. And Sigma being melted quickly? By who? Idk how you are coming up with these takes because they aren’t set in reality.
I've never met someone in real life who prefers 5v5 over 6v6.
    I was thinking along the line of maybe someone did a poll somewhere to gauge the interest in a more neutral standing
        I’ve had this question before as well and always gotten downvoted by 5v5er’s because they say “well the results are from a time period where the tank meta is ass, so of course people are gonna want 6v6 back”

Can’t win with either side. Blizzard, please add an experimental card for rebalanced 6v6, or a separate permanent queue all together
That's cope. Also the support mains are the only ones enjoying 5v5 so it makes sense that you would. Theres a reason why support que times are 8 minute
    I'm a tank main. I prefer 5v5
        I used to be a tank main. I prefer 6v6. Tanking in 5v5 is less fun than tanking in 6v6.
    I main flex not strictly support.  I play whatever is needed.  And I'd rather play tank in OW2 in its current crappy meta than go back to two tanks.

I've lost way too many fights that were winnable because my other tank was on a different page than me and dragged the rest of the team with them.  Leaving me alone against the enemy team.

And fighting against double tank is worse than playing double tank.
We are?! Haha. That's not going to stop us from calling the devs dumb fucks
yeah but you were only ever on the receiving end of it 50% of the time
And they reduced CC minimally in OW2. Could’ve reduced without removing a tank.

And then they subsequently increased CC by reducing team size by 1 tank.
It's not wrong
    It is, but you can at least attempt to prove otherwise.
Exactly they are such a small % of the community. I really don’t understand why we would balance around a very small % of play styles when a majority of the community isn’t playing that way
    OW League has to rot, for balance to change.
And who should the devs listen to then? People who either don't play competitive or a so low elo that have no understanding of the game?
    People in the middle? The majority of players. A lot of players do understand the game, they just don’t have the skills the pros do so what a pro does and what they do are vastly different
    I get being unhappy with the game, but there's alot of self reporting going on this sub with people basically saying "I'm tired of devs listening to people who know the game better than me!!" 

The classic one being "Bring 6v6 back"
Because there are countless confounding variables that impact win rates and we have very limited public data to stratify them
I don’t disagree with that either.
