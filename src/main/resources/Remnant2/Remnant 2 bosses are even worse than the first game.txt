[[Remnant 2 bosses are even worse than the first game]]


Remnant 2 overall is a fine game, the new archetype system is good and some of the levels look nice (enemies can be pretty generic and bland at times) but the bosses are absolutely awful in solo at least. I'd been keen yo hear people that disagree and see if I'm missing something but most bosses so far just seek to be made artificially hard by adding enemies and not.by making the actual boss a challenge. Then there are some stupid attacks which just seem to be ridiculously spammed such as Sha'hala. One of the worst things about the first game was the bosses and I'm surprised that they've made the vast majority of them in this game even more boring and unfun to play.


I couldn't disagree more. Most of the bosses are so good this time around.
    Yeah we have seed nexus! So creative and fun.
    Most of the bosses in Remnant 1 was good.
        that is if you didnt play the game, most of the bosses in remnant 1 are bottom of the barrel quality, good compared to what? because they are absolute dogwater compared to any other soulslike.
            Compared to Remnant 2, buddy.
        I feel the same way the bosses are pretty good
    Most of the bosses are waves of enemies or just an elite zone with a lot of common enemies that you have already killed before. Pretty bad to me.
        What bosses are just waves of enemies lol? Legion is the only thing that comes to mind but even he handles it pretty well imo
            Seed nexus?
                Not a boss.
                    He has a boss health bar so he is a boss.
                        So a health bar at the top of your screen is the qualifier for boss? Does that mean Annihilation would not be a boss if they hid his health bar?
                            Since there are no real qualifies for a boss we will never stop  argueing.I think since this game is more like a souls like i would category every enemy with a big health over my screen as a boss.
            There are quite a few. But besides that, I just don't like bosses that have shit ton of threats on screen or enemies that you need to take care off besides the boss itself WHILE the boss is also attacking you.
                a few being the key term here. "most of the bosses" absolutely do not fit your description. Just had a look through the list of bosses and it's actually a reasonably small % that do.
                    you mean the adds that don't fight you at all unless you're in the water below and exist exclusively to make sure you don't run out of ammo?
                    Imma support the other dude and add this. EVERY single boss has additional enemies with them that will spawn after you kill them endlessly until you kill the boss. That is the definition of waves. Never ending one after the other.  It is lazy game design. Instead of making the bosses hard on their own, they add all these little enemies to distract you and make the bland boss fights hard. 

The boss themselves would be boring on their own, and that is the problem. And the devs were called out on it and their response was, well they enemies give you ammo. Bruh other games handle ammo drops without just spawning in enemies for you to kill.  It is annoying, I never felt like I did anything when i beat a boss, unlike with fromsoft games. I was just relieved it was over.
            Dullain is that, the slug on the ceiling also fills the boss room with enemies you've seen
            the first 2 bosses for me. bloat king and nightweaver.
                Neither of those bosses are "just waves of enemies" though, which is what the guy I replied to was saying. Bloat King's minions can be completely ignored since they live in the pit and are too slow to even attack you if you fall in and actually try to get out. Nightweaver does spawn minions that you'll have to deal with regularly, but they're not dangerous and they die extremely easily. They never really come out when the boss is attacking either, so it's not like it's a struggle to manage them all at the same time.
    And thats why?
        Do you mind rephrasing this question?
            No i just wanna why do you have this opinion.
                Well, part of it is because I don't just classify anything with a boss bar at the top of my screen a boss, or any tough encounter as a boss. If you go approach things like Root Nexus or the Fae Council as a boss, of course you're going to think that this game's bosses fucking suck. This applies to Aberration type enemies, which are almost all optional and are just regular ass enemies with more health and modifiers. But if you reframe any of these things as what they actually are, and approach them accordingly, then suddenly everything tends to feel much better.

Then, we have the actual boss encounters. Usually these entail fog walls, introductory cutscenes, material drops to craft new mods and weapons, and mechanics/attacks unique to that boss. These have generally been a stellar improvement over the last game. Annihilation, Red Prince, Sha'Hala, Tal Ratha, Kaeula's Shadow, Custodian's Eye, Corrupted Ravager, and Faelin/Faerin are just the first set of bosses that come to mind that I think are really good. We've got some stinkers like Bloat King or Abomination, and some mediocre ones like Gwendil and Astropath, sure. But the number of good bosses vastly outnumbers the crappy ones, and the same absolutely could not have been said about Remnant 1.
                    Oh I dunno about the last sentiment there. Of the "good" ones you mentioned, my current run only gave me the Corrupt Ravager and Kaeula's Shadow. The former is the definition of average and the latter was a tedious fight. Not difficult, but the way the fight arena is designed, you are left in a relatively narrow area to actually engage the enemy in, making it mostly a dull encounter. 

However, other fights come to mind as well like the Defiler and the Nightweaver which are just tedious fights. The Nightweaver particularly is simply frustrating more than fun. A two stage fight with the first stage being piss easy, while the second stage has a tiny arena, instakill areas near walls and a boss attack that WILL nearly kill you in one hit while being fast quick to repeat. It's less of a challenge and more of a nuisance. There are outright bad ones, tedious ones and the only truly memorable boss (for good reasons) was the Labyrinth Sentinel because it was different. 

Remnant 1 wasn't known for good bosses, but this game definitely won't be known for that either.
                        Sorry you feel this way. I disagree. Ravager, Kaeula's Shadow, and Nightweaver are all bosses I really enjoyed. I'm always happy to face them. Defiler is not good, but he's an aberration, not a boss.

Please don't get the wrong idea by me asking this, but what difficulty did/do you play on?
                            Played on the two middle ones (I honestly don't remember what this game called them - to me it's normal and hard). The bosses just felt annoying to beat. Most bosses I'm encountering seem to be that way. Often they don't pose as much challenge in and of themselves as due to the game making it really frustrating. 

Because the nightweaver was the last one I killed off (that was today), it's fresh in my memory. So for example in that one, the second phase is just clunky. The arena to fight in is very compact and walled. The boss is fast and has a fair amount of health. It's attack patterns are very simple to understand, but one mistake can lead to having to redo everything. Took several tries for me to kill it, mostly fighting with close quarters awkwardness and avoidance of instakill wall grabs. 

Most of the memorable bosses from this game are memorable to me because of this. Some set of mechanics that frustrates. Ones like the corrupt ravager are fine, but don't stand out because they are just decent game design. Nothing remarkable, but well functioning. It's why I mentioned the Labyrinth boss. It was actually something different. Not difficult, but a change of pace. It had something to remember in it, that wasn't frustration. 

Now don't get me wrong - much of this is also down to taste. However various quality markers can also be objective and I just don't think the boss design in this game ever really goes beyond "alright", but often falls beneath that.
I've been enjoying them.
Shoot I'm loving the boss designs. The ads in fights are good to have to drop ammo as well. I don't want to have to use ammo crates all the time scrap is rough enough already trying out new weapons. Way more memorable fights than the 1st one imo.
    Again u can buy Munition items also u lose ammo by shooting at mobs anyway and not all drop ammo that's just an excuse if the boss takes long U deal more dmg and shoot more ammo on mobs then the boss
        if youre using more ammo on mobs than gained from the ammo pick ups maybe youre not ready for the boss....
            LMFAO I was about to say the same, he needs to upgrade those guns, sounds like he not doing any damage. Throwing wet towels at them.
                LMAO I was about to say the same bot comment too ignoring the other things he said! XD
                I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
            I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
                Got over 40k scrap and over 50 ammo boxes... hardly ever use em. Only have em for multi-player when there isn't a gunslinger in the party to share ammo pickups. I'll still stick with my previous statement and not resort to calling someone trash like some middle schooler who feels insulted.
                    Nah lol u lost the argument U saying like I do no dmg calling me trash too it's just an excuse to say ah they drop ammo and sounds like the most noob statement ever and I don't think I shoot on the boss 3x more than on mobs but now I'm farther remnant 2 has not many mobs like remnant 1 especially the monkey who shoot lightning and jump to pillars no way U kill them for ammo and BTW it's waay faster to use ammo box than reloading 2 guns the box reloads both if U didn't know atleast on the 1 game I have unlimited ammo weapon anyway so I will never go out of ammo so mobs have a use but u don't get it anyway programmed bot
                        Awe thats sweet I have myself a reddit pen pal though I couldn't make out what they were trying to get across due to the horrible grammer  ❤️ 💋
                            Hey, so while I actually agree that guy is a Clown, if you’re going to rag someone about grammar , spell the word correctly.
                    Maybe try not playing on Survival mode then?
Boring and unfun is just a lie. The bosses in this game are absolutely incredible. Sha'Hala, Faelin, all of them.

The only one in which I'm not keen on is The Custodian's Eye - 70% of that battle is fine, but the rest can eat ass.
    You’re tripping, dude.
    No, it’s really not good. Optimization is awful this time around too
    It ain't a lie if it is an opinion and it's fine to disagree but I find the vast majority pretty boring. The huntress was great, Ravager good and there are some that are decent but then you have Sha'hala which is awful, the one with all thr Slugs, Legion is pretty boring even though it is pretty easy, last boss second phase is terribly designed in a visual sense.
I really can't see how people.enjoy some of.the bosses. The Ravager and Shroud were cool but then you have bosses like Bloat King and Sha'hala and yeh sure I can beat them but they are just boring imo.
    Bloat king sucks you are correct lol
    Going through it now and so far mostly only been on yaesha. Got through a bunch of optional bosses and story ones there. Gotta say, kinda hate them all. Most of the time if feels like I'm fighting with the design rather than the boss. Really annoying arena layouts, constant enemy spawns behind if there's ads (meaning the fight takes eons), enemies always in your face meaning telegraphed attacks are impossible to actually see while you're shooting. 

Just... The level design and gameplay in general seems really well improved over the first game, but bosses are incredibly tedious so far. Maybe they will improve in the later missions, but genuinely detest them at the moment.
I'm really enjoying the bosses in this one, feels like less constant add spam and more dark souls style learn the patterns and dodge the hits. I'm solo too
The few "bosses" I've encountered so far have been like the terrible event/bosses from the first game but worse. The Spiral Staircase in the Chimney with one-shot purple bs, the Root Nexus and Legion. All terrible. Throwing never-ending mobs at the player while they shoot a static object isn't a fun boss nor is good design. The DLC's from the first game proved they could create good bosses without just throwing non-stop adds at you. I'm really hoping they get better because these first few have put me off quite a bit.
    Spiral staircase can be beaten if you shoot the purple crystals. It’s a zone you need to stay in and just run past mobs or use a high dmg weapon to one shot mob crit points. Nexus, the mobs don’t keep spawning if you kill them first. The nexus spawns them in every 15% health from what I’ve seen. Defiled had minions trait  so I’m unsure about that after nexus and I haven’t fought legion yet despite two campaign runs and three adventure runs. Every boss has a trick. Just figure it out.
        I loved the Chimney. Once I figured it out I switched to shotguns and ran and sprayed. Finally got my timing down only to go too fast and realize that you can run into the lower arcs and they will kill you, too.

I thought it was a nice change of pace.
        I shot the crystals well in advance. The Staircase wasn't difficult it was just tedious. Kinda like the Cubes boss. Haven't had the best luck with my first campaign roll. Most of the bosses have been gimmicky. Gimmick bosses aren't inherently bad but they are much worse when you add 1 shot death. I have fought a few decent ones. Best one so far was probably Custodians Eye.
            Custodian eye was a blast. I’m sorry you had a bad roll that can make things tough and yes absolutely being one shot is probably my most hated thing ever and unfortunately there is a lot of that in this game.
Agreed. Bosses in general in this game are just about every boss having multiple instakills, AOEs, and countless adds.
Remnant 2 was fail for me. Someone here said "its easy, don´t worry." It was mistake to belive thats. I can beat bosses, its ok to die sometimes, but thing like The Spiral Staircase or even worse "trap Labyrinths" feel like unfair Mario.

Its ok when ppl enjoy it, but i have not so fast reflex and don´t like it..i can´t return this game anymore :(
    Sorry to say, but that really just sounds like a skill issue to me. I absolutely SUCK at soulslikes, yet I'm having little difficulty with most of the fights.

Besides apoc. Apoc difficulty is a pain.
        maybe...but i have not big problem on the fights even in most bosses. My issue is trap labyrinths or place like "The Spiral Starcase".   


Anyway i don´t play anymore. Eldenring is much much better, it have not such "jump and run á la unfair Mario"
            you can shoot most of the crystals from up top before you start the event.
            The Spiral Staircase I actually found to be one of the easiest sections. Same as the labyrinth.   
ESPECIALLY when you actually find out the different mechanics, like shooting the crystals while you run through the staircase.
skill diff
    I finished the game dude, it ain't a skill difference, it's boredom and lazy design.
I personally love remnant 2 bosses. they remind me of Ninja Gaiden bosses, which are the only true way to make a boss in a game to me :D  


Edit: I only wonder if they kept the concept of different loot from boss kills depending on HOW you slay them. This was a really nice touch in Remnant: From the Ashes but so far I feel like they might have removed this from the second one. Any1 knows?
    There is still alt kills. Mostly world bosses that I’ve noticed so far but huntress has one as well as do a few others.
    The bosses that spawn an ungodly amount of ads are the definition of unfair.
    How are they similar to ninja gaiden? 
Most rem 2 bosses were underwhelming and pretty easy
They really enjoyed the N64 Mario block boss??? Damnnnn doesn't take much to please these folk then :/
    Glad you chose one out of the many. Feel like you have been cheated than you can uninstall.
        I've beaten the game tho so I wouldn't mind lol
        Rofl
I think that some of the bosses is just spam attacking. It is not that difficult, just annoying to fight them.
I don’t disagree, some of the boss fights from the first game we’re exceptional(I mean unforgettably good) some of the boss from the second one are not. Some are good, twisted chantry boss was incredible, tal rasha felt good, others just feel like spam (looking at you Hala spectral gaurdian of laser and particle spam). I haven’t beat all of them yet but there hasn’t been any I’ve hated. I don’t think anything will compare to how you felt when you killed those first bosses in the original sadly, hard to top something that good.
    I actually did enjoy many Remnant boss fights I guess if I think back but there were some awful ones. My favourite was probably the rat slaver guy on the molerat.
The bosses are much better in 2 than in the first one imo
I get the impression the boss have been timed for coop. They are still perfectly doable solo however with some patience.
    They were not tuned for coop. They were tuned to be played solo first, then we adjusted values for coop.
        The bosses feel great to me. Good job.
        Boss fights generally have felt easier in solo play with a reasonable increase in health, imo, during coop.
        BS
        Huge bosses that encumbrance and collision dont affect while the player character is, sure is edgy cant wait for the other clones. when will there actually be original boss design?
        Cap
        Did u tune the performance to be used for dlss first and then native in a later patch when u decided to gaf?
Agreed, one that stands out for me is the labyrinth sentinel that was trash af
Cn someone tell me why it is that the boss heals itself with green orbs when i heal myself and how i can stop that
    Do they have the empathy trait? If so every time you heal with your relic the boss heals for about 30% of its health. Use healing items/or medic abilities. Medic class can be bought from Wallace after getting the doctors pin from the medic in Ward 13. Health pool is very helpful vs a empathetic boss.
        It was Kaeula and i just healed myself when the tentacles came out after that never had empathy bosses but now i know what to look ouf for.
Sha Hala is kicking my as a level 7 medic
    You can spam shield if you have high cooldown on ability and just tank  his beams and projectiles. Also a mod that shields you. Hug the back wall and crouch behind it only dodging his horizontal beam. Or use the labyrinth SMG. His black hole is telegraphed pretty well and when he moves it depending on if you overdrive the core or not it doesn’t move across the whole stage.
Bloat king with handler is the only fight I think that isn’t well done (thus far for me)
    Came here to complain about this specifically. Absolutely hostile design to that spec and it happens to be the first boss I've faced. Really left me feeling pretty negative about the game. The dog \*literally\* cannot attack the boss. Absurd.
        It’s the only one I’ve found.  I’m going through the second storylines on adventure and that boss is the only one I say this about.  It’s an inconvenience to be sure, and very annoying, but the rest of the fights are pretty great across the board
        I know this is an old thread, but I just started the game tonight and Bloat King is my first boss and it feels pretty ridiculous. I was wondering if I was missing something or just doing something wrong, but it appears I'm not alone in this struggle as a solo Handler. I'll keep at it, but it wiped me out a handful of times pretty quick and I started to wonder if I'm not supposed to fight it yet...
            Hang in there. Once I got past it the game opened up a lot more. Don't be afraid to reroll if you're simply having a straight up bad time though.

    Inb4 Red Prince with empathy trait
I think they're a bit better than 1. There's certainly way less add spam as a general rule. There's still adds but way more 1 on 1 fights and the adds are usually way less.

I do agree there are several very poorly designed fights but 75 percent are pretty good.

It's not Sekiro or anything but it's pretty good.
I do not know if this is the right sub but i wanted to know if someone got the blu glowing item at the farm in ward 13 the one by the watertanks?
    I believe you have to go to a door in the labyrinth while wearing a specific armor, ring, and weapon equipped. It's almost impossible to find out without watching a video on it.
        Is it even worth it?
fr. I'd much rather play mw instead of this game. 2 playthroughs done and yup, its bad
Wait till you see how silly the final boss is it'll make every boss before it look easy with how messy and unfun the developers make it. The boss will make you feel like your playing a dark souls game at sl1 on steroids.
Most of the bosses I like but those bosses with AOE stuff coming out of ground when you have to aim through sights are bullshit design.
You can either shoot the boss of just dodge the constant spam on ground.
Disagree with OP! 

Mostly play solo, not the youngest of gamers and the only Boss i had any real trouble with was the final boss Apocalypse. Not to say i didn't die a couple times to some of the others before learning their mechanics, but if you expect to kill every boss first up without dyeing, you're playing the wrong game. I did use challenger though for the free rez (every 10mins) and that helped me get through many boss fights.

As for the first Remnant, Riphide was the worse for me.
    MFing Riptide! I spanked that game on more play throughs that I can remember and he was a DPS check I never passed. It always felt like it was the burning status killing him and never felt good or like an accomplishment.
bruh you know the feeling when you play a souls game and the boss just beats ur ass. like you lost a fight in real life. these bosees aint it...
It does feel like no matter what boss you're fighting it's the same. Patterns change sometimes but every fight is big boss tons of minions. No matter what
Tbh I only play solo and I feel that the game is too easy lmao
The adds in the fights are to replenish ammo just because you are terribad at the game and think all bosses should be tank and spank.
I agree, I enjoyed the bosses of the first game. But playing this on nightmare against bosses that go immune for large periods of time and regen, or playing against bosses that always seem to have a hitbox going on and no time to actually shoot back isn't fun. again it could be the difficulty but I beat remnant 1 on nightmare the first time so....
it's not about skill, reaction time, clever gameplay, etc.  It's about clunky mechanics and uninspired boss battles that just add overly long recovery animations instead of spending any time developing something worth while.  


case and point: the cube boss battle is fantastic.  very difficult, has nothing to do with spamming bullets into a wad of meat, and there are no unforgiving ragdoll animations that feel more like developmental bugs than "difficult gameplay"  


every other boss has 2 moves that do a fuck load of damage and make your character spend 45 seconds rubbing his knee like peter fucking griffin.  ah yes, the old "can't fire my gun or dodge because i'm busy slowly getting myself back to my feet" mechanic.  totally worth $60 lol  


the game is fun for what it is, but stop kidding yourselves about souls-likes.  they fucking suck lol
I don’t think I’ve had fun fighting a single boss in this game. They just aren’t well made.
Some bosses spawn mobs depending on damage done so if youre getting overwhelmed by mobs thats probably the case. Played through on veteran and the only issue I had was with spawning stuff behind me sometimes.
I liked almost all the bosses but sometimes they come at you back to back to back when I want some relaxing dungeon crawl between them.
Agreed, just got to Faerin and this....thing has every boss fight sin included in it.  
The boss uses feints, you cant dodge multiple attacks in a row and his laser beams appear out of thin air and fires before you can see them. They just went the Elden Ring route and gave up lol
you gotta be brain damaged to slash through endless waves of weak and boring ennemies in boring levels
Am i misremembering? Im pretty sure alot of remnant 1 bosses, especially early game ones were bullet sponges that spawned adds nonstop. Ive played through remnant 2 twice and the only ones i remember that did that was that tree and the guy stuck in that tree. There were bosses that spawned adds but only a limited amount
some of them are so fking overloaded
Didn't play the first game, so idk if my opinion counts here, but my brother and I found the bosses in this game to be extremely enjoyable to fight for the most part. We particularly found the cube boss in the labyrinth to be a nice breath of fresh air
The first boss I fought was barghest he was tanky way to fast to dodge and the ads would stun lock me midnight plus he spawned with a modifier on normal difficulty that made him regain health while he had minions like WTF this is the first world
they are unique and good but shitty designed diff wise game is designed for co op i dont reccomend anyone to buy this game if you are going to play alone
I wholeheartedly disagree. The first game's bosses were essentially just elite mobs with adds. Bullet sponges if you will. 

This game forces you to learn the bosses mechanics for every fight, and a lot of people don't know this yet, but a lot of the bosses change during the fight, depending on player strategy and timing. Take the ravager, for example. There are 3 separate ending to that fight, all depending on decisions made by the player before AND during the fight. Each ending rewards a different material for vastly different rewards.

This adds EXCELLENT replayabliity and variance to each fight. 

My only major gripe is that bosses are a bit on the easy side. Most attacks are too telegraphed to be a threat, but this is coming from a seasoned Soulsborne player from all the way back to the original demons souls. So I may just have reached my peak dodge roll potential lol.

I also haven't played the game on the final difficulty yet, but I cannot wait for the challenge to increase dramatically.
    Yeh it looks like I just played all the worst bosses on my first playthrough and didnt really optomise my class levelling. I've since come to enjoy the game but still dislike the bosses who inspired this post. I do like many of the bosses though. My only gripe now is I feel most of the enemies are dull and drab in design outside of Yaesha. N'Erud in particular, is drab and boring in enemy design outside of the underground areas with spacecrabs; the other enemies outside of the two world bosses are painfully bland and generic looking. Lucky the gameplay is fun.
        Agreed that there are a few cleverly disguised reskins to help with the illusion of variety. However, for a game that was a day one release on Xbox game pass, imo, it's been the most complete work put out on the platform to date. And with a road map that looks like the cross country map in a goofy movie, I've got big hopes for this title. 

Devs have never been sneaker with their loot either, I went a full 12 hours before finding my first armor set, and that was a eureka moment. Made me realize just how outside of the box I was going to need to think before I would ever complete my collection.
Oh yes nothing more fair and fun than Rubik's cube, one shot kill attack, how about the penetrator, very original design, seriously, some of the boss with one shot kills can gft
Yeah some of these bosses are fucking bullshit solo. Totally unbalanced, and they need to learn from fromsoft. If there are guaranteed hits no matter your evasion timing, something is wrong.
Yeah we have seed nexus! So creative and fun.
Most of the bosses in Remnant 1 was good.
    that is if you didnt play the game, most of the bosses in remnant 1 are bottom of the barrel quality, good compared to what? because they are absolute dogwater compared to any other soulslike.
        Compared to Remnant 2, buddy.
    I feel the same way the bosses are pretty good
Most of the bosses are waves of enemies or just an elite zone with a lot of common enemies that you have already killed before. Pretty bad to me.
    What bosses are just waves of enemies lol? Legion is the only thing that comes to mind but even he handles it pretty well imo
        Seed nexus?
            Not a boss.
                He has a boss health bar so he is a boss.
                    So a health bar at the top of your screen is the qualifier for boss? Does that mean Annihilation would not be a boss if they hid his health bar?
                        Since there are no real qualifies for a boss we will never stop  argueing.I think since this game is more like a souls like i would category every enemy with a big health over my screen as a boss.
        There are quite a few. But besides that, I just don't like bosses that have shit ton of threats on screen or enemies that you need to take care off besides the boss itself WHILE the boss is also attacking you.
            a few being the key term here. "most of the bosses" absolutely do not fit your description. Just had a look through the list of bosses and it's actually a reasonably small % that do.
                you mean the adds that don't fight you at all unless you're in the water below and exist exclusively to make sure you don't run out of ammo?
                Imma support the other dude and add this. EVERY single boss has additional enemies with them that will spawn after you kill them endlessly until you kill the boss. That is the definition of waves. Never ending one after the other.  It is lazy game design. Instead of making the bosses hard on their own, they add all these little enemies to distract you and make the bland boss fights hard. 

The boss themselves would be boring on their own, and that is the problem. And the devs were called out on it and their response was, well they enemies give you ammo. Bruh other games handle ammo drops without just spawning in enemies for you to kill.  It is annoying, I never felt like I did anything when i beat a boss, unlike with fromsoft games. I was just relieved it was over.
        Dullain is that, the slug on the ceiling also fills the boss room with enemies you've seen
        the first 2 bosses for me. bloat king and nightweaver.
            Neither of those bosses are "just waves of enemies" though, which is what the guy I replied to was saying. Bloat King's minions can be completely ignored since they live in the pit and are too slow to even attack you if you fall in and actually try to get out. Nightweaver does spawn minions that you'll have to deal with regularly, but they're not dangerous and they die extremely easily. They never really come out when the boss is attacking either, so it's not like it's a struggle to manage them all at the same time.
And thats why?
    Do you mind rephrasing this question?
        No i just wanna why do you have this opinion.
            Well, part of it is because I don't just classify anything with a boss bar at the top of my screen a boss, or any tough encounter as a boss. If you go approach things like Root Nexus or the Fae Council as a boss, of course you're going to think that this game's bosses fucking suck. This applies to Aberration type enemies, which are almost all optional and are just regular ass enemies with more health and modifiers. But if you reframe any of these things as what they actually are, and approach them accordingly, then suddenly everything tends to feel much better.

Then, we have the actual boss encounters. Usually these entail fog walls, introductory cutscenes, material drops to craft new mods and weapons, and mechanics/attacks unique to that boss. These have generally been a stellar improvement over the last game. Annihilation, Red Prince, Sha'Hala, Tal Ratha, Kaeula's Shadow, Custodian's Eye, Corrupted Ravager, and Faelin/Faerin are just the first set of bosses that come to mind that I think are really good. We've got some stinkers like Bloat King or Abomination, and some mediocre ones like Gwendil and Astropath, sure. But the number of good bosses vastly outnumbers the crappy ones, and the same absolutely could not have been said about Remnant 1.
                Oh I dunno about the last sentiment there. Of the "good" ones you mentioned, my current run only gave me the Corrupt Ravager and Kaeula's Shadow. The former is the definition of average and the latter was a tedious fight. Not difficult, but the way the fight arena is designed, you are left in a relatively narrow area to actually engage the enemy in, making it mostly a dull encounter. 

However, other fights come to mind as well like the Defiler and the Nightweaver which are just tedious fights. The Nightweaver particularly is simply frustrating more than fun. A two stage fight with the first stage being piss easy, while the second stage has a tiny arena, instakill areas near walls and a boss attack that WILL nearly kill you in one hit while being fast quick to repeat. It's less of a challenge and more of a nuisance. There are outright bad ones, tedious ones and the only truly memorable boss (for good reasons) was the Labyrinth Sentinel because it was different. 

Remnant 1 wasn't known for good bosses, but this game definitely won't be known for that either.
                    Sorry you feel this way. I disagree. Ravager, Kaeula's Shadow, and Nightweaver are all bosses I really enjoyed. I'm always happy to face them. Defiler is not good, but he's an aberration, not a boss.

Please don't get the wrong idea by me asking this, but what difficulty did/do you play on?
                        Played on the two middle ones (I honestly don't remember what this game called them - to me it's normal and hard). The bosses just felt annoying to beat. Most bosses I'm encountering seem to be that way. Often they don't pose as much challenge in and of themselves as due to the game making it really frustrating. 

Because the nightweaver was the last one I killed off (that was today), it's fresh in my memory. So for example in that one, the second phase is just clunky. The arena to fight in is very compact and walled. The boss is fast and has a fair amount of health. It's attack patterns are very simple to understand, but one mistake can lead to having to redo everything. Took several tries for me to kill it, mostly fighting with close quarters awkwardness and avoidance of instakill wall grabs. 

Most of the memorable bosses from this game are memorable to me because of this. Some set of mechanics that frustrates. Ones like the corrupt ravager are fine, but don't stand out because they are just decent game design. Nothing remarkable, but well functioning. It's why I mentioned the Labyrinth boss. It was actually something different. Not difficult, but a change of pace. It had something to remember in it, that wasn't frustration. 

Now don't get me wrong - much of this is also down to taste. However various quality markers can also be objective and I just don't think the boss design in this game ever really goes beyond "alright", but often falls beneath that.
Again u can buy Munition items also u lose ammo by shooting at mobs anyway and not all drop ammo that's just an excuse if the boss takes long U deal more dmg and shoot more ammo on mobs then the boss
    if youre using more ammo on mobs than gained from the ammo pick ups maybe youre not ready for the boss....
        LMFAO I was about to say the same, he needs to upgrade those guns, sounds like he not doing any damage. Throwing wet towels at them.
            LMAO I was about to say the same bot comment too ignoring the other things he said! XD
            I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
        I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
            Got over 40k scrap and over 50 ammo boxes... hardly ever use em. Only have em for multi-player when there isn't a gunslinger in the party to share ammo pickups. I'll still stick with my previous statement and not resort to calling someone trash like some middle schooler who feels insulted.
                Nah lol u lost the argument U saying like I do no dmg calling me trash too it's just an excuse to say ah they drop ammo and sounds like the most noob statement ever and I don't think I shoot on the boss 3x more than on mobs but now I'm farther remnant 2 has not many mobs like remnant 1 especially the monkey who shoot lightning and jump to pillars no way U kill them for ammo and BTW it's waay faster to use ammo box than reloading 2 guns the box reloads both if U didn't know atleast on the 1 game I have unlimited ammo weapon anyway so I will never go out of ammo so mobs have a use but u don't get it anyway programmed bot
                    Awe thats sweet I have myself a reddit pen pal though I couldn't make out what they were trying to get across due to the horrible grammer  ❤️ 💋
                        Hey, so while I actually agree that guy is a Clown, if you’re going to rag someone about grammar , spell the word correctly.
                Maybe try not playing on Survival mode then?
You’re tripping, dude.
No, it’s really not good. Optimization is awful this time around too
It ain't a lie if it is an opinion and it's fine to disagree but I find the vast majority pretty boring. The huntress was great, Ravager good and there are some that are decent but then you have Sha'hala which is awful, the one with all thr Slugs, Legion is pretty boring even though it is pretty easy, last boss second phase is terribly designed in a visual sense.
Bloat king sucks you are correct lol
Going through it now and so far mostly only been on yaesha. Got through a bunch of optional bosses and story ones there. Gotta say, kinda hate them all. Most of the time if feels like I'm fighting with the design rather than the boss. Really annoying arena layouts, constant enemy spawns behind if there's ads (meaning the fight takes eons), enemies always in your face meaning telegraphed attacks are impossible to actually see while you're shooting. 

Just... The level design and gameplay in general seems really well improved over the first game, but bosses are incredibly tedious so far. Maybe they will improve in the later missions, but genuinely detest them at the moment.
Spiral staircase can be beaten if you shoot the purple crystals. It’s a zone you need to stay in and just run past mobs or use a high dmg weapon to one shot mob crit points. Nexus, the mobs don’t keep spawning if you kill them first. The nexus spawns them in every 15% health from what I’ve seen. Defiled had minions trait  so I’m unsure about that after nexus and I haven’t fought legion yet despite two campaign runs and three adventure runs. Every boss has a trick. Just figure it out.
    I loved the Chimney. Once I figured it out I switched to shotguns and ran and sprayed. Finally got my timing down only to go too fast and realize that you can run into the lower arcs and they will kill you, too.

I thought it was a nice change of pace.
    I shot the crystals well in advance. The Staircase wasn't difficult it was just tedious. Kinda like the Cubes boss. Haven't had the best luck with my first campaign roll. Most of the bosses have been gimmicky. Gimmick bosses aren't inherently bad but they are much worse when you add 1 shot death. I have fought a few decent ones. Best one so far was probably Custodians Eye.
        Custodian eye was a blast. I’m sorry you had a bad roll that can make things tough and yes absolutely being one shot is probably my most hated thing ever and unfortunately there is a lot of that in this game.
Sorry to say, but that really just sounds like a skill issue to me. I absolutely SUCK at soulslikes, yet I'm having little difficulty with most of the fights.

Besides apoc. Apoc difficulty is a pain.
    maybe...but i have not big problem on the fights even in most bosses. My issue is trap labyrinths or place like "The Spiral Starcase".   


Anyway i don´t play anymore. Eldenring is much much better, it have not such "jump and run á la unfair Mario"
        you can shoot most of the crystals from up top before you start the event.
        The Spiral Staircase I actually found to be one of the easiest sections. Same as the labyrinth.   
ESPECIALLY when you actually find out the different mechanics, like shooting the crystals while you run through the staircase.
I finished the game dude, it ain't a skill difference, it's boredom and lazy design.
There is still alt kills. Mostly world bosses that I’ve noticed so far but huntress has one as well as do a few others.
The bosses that spawn an ungodly amount of ads are the definition of unfair.
How are they similar to ninja gaiden? 
Most rem 2 bosses were underwhelming and pretty easy
Glad you chose one out of the many. Feel like you have been cheated than you can uninstall.
    I've beaten the game tho so I wouldn't mind lol
    Rofl
I actually did enjoy many Remnant boss fights I guess if I think back but there were some awful ones. My favourite was probably the rat slaver guy on the molerat.
They were not tuned for coop. They were tuned to be played solo first, then we adjusted values for coop.
    The bosses feel great to me. Good job.
    Boss fights generally have felt easier in solo play with a reasonable increase in health, imo, during coop.
    BS
    Huge bosses that encumbrance and collision dont affect while the player character is, sure is edgy cant wait for the other clones. when will there actually be original boss design?
    Cap
    Did u tune the performance to be used for dlss first and then native in a later patch when u decided to gaf?
Do they have the empathy trait? If so every time you heal with your relic the boss heals for about 30% of its health. Use healing items/or medic abilities. Medic class can be bought from Wallace after getting the doctors pin from the medic in Ward 13. Health pool is very helpful vs a empathetic boss.
    It was Kaeula and i just healed myself when the tentacles came out after that never had empathy bosses but now i know what to look ouf for.
You can spam shield if you have high cooldown on ability and just tank  his beams and projectiles. Also a mod that shields you. Hug the back wall and crouch behind it only dodging his horizontal beam. Or use the labyrinth SMG. His black hole is telegraphed pretty well and when he moves it depending on if you overdrive the core or not it doesn’t move across the whole stage.
Came here to complain about this specifically. Absolutely hostile design to that spec and it happens to be the first boss I've faced. Really left me feeling pretty negative about the game. The dog \*literally\* cannot attack the boss. Absurd.
    It’s the only one I’ve found.  I’m going through the second storylines on adventure and that boss is the only one I say this about.  It’s an inconvenience to be sure, and very annoying, but the rest of the fights are pretty great across the board
    I know this is an old thread, but I just started the game tonight and Bloat King is my first boss and it feels pretty ridiculous. I was wondering if I was missing something or just doing something wrong, but it appears I'm not alone in this struggle as a solo Handler. I'll keep at it, but it wiped me out a handful of times pretty quick and I started to wonder if I'm not supposed to fight it yet...
        Hang in there. Once I got past it the game opened up a lot more. Don't be afraid to reroll if you're simply having a straight up bad time though.
Inb4 Red Prince with empathy trait
I believe you have to go to a door in the labyrinth while wearing a specific armor, ring, and weapon equipped. It's almost impossible to find out without watching a video on it.
    Is it even worth it?
MFing Riptide! I spanked that game on more play throughs that I can remember and he was a DPS check I never passed. It always felt like it was the burning status killing him and never felt good or like an accomplishment.
Yeh it looks like I just played all the worst bosses on my first playthrough and didnt really optomise my class levelling. I've since come to enjoy the game but still dislike the bosses who inspired this post. I do like many of the bosses though. My only gripe now is I feel most of the enemies are dull and drab in design outside of Yaesha. N'Erud in particular, is drab and boring in enemy design outside of the underground areas with spacecrabs; the other enemies outside of the two world bosses are painfully bland and generic looking. Lucky the gameplay is fun.
    Agreed that there are a few cleverly disguised reskins to help with the illusion of variety. However, for a game that was a day one release on Xbox game pass, imo, it's been the most complete work put out on the platform to date. And with a road map that looks like the cross country map in a goofy movie, I've got big hopes for this title. 

Devs have never been sneaker with their loot either, I went a full 12 hours before finding my first armor set, and that was a eureka moment. Made me realize just how outside of the box I was going to need to think before I would ever complete my collection.
that is if you didnt play the game, most of the bosses in remnant 1 are bottom of the barrel quality, good compared to what? because they are absolute dogwater compared to any other soulslike.
    Compared to Remnant 2, buddy.
I feel the same way the bosses are pretty good
What bosses are just waves of enemies lol? Legion is the only thing that comes to mind but even he handles it pretty well imo
    Seed nexus?
        Not a boss.
            He has a boss health bar so he is a boss.
                So a health bar at the top of your screen is the qualifier for boss? Does that mean Annihilation would not be a boss if they hid his health bar?
                    Since there are no real qualifies for a boss we will never stop  argueing.I think since this game is more like a souls like i would category every enemy with a big health over my screen as a boss.
    There are quite a few. But besides that, I just don't like bosses that have shit ton of threats on screen or enemies that you need to take care off besides the boss itself WHILE the boss is also attacking you.
        a few being the key term here. "most of the bosses" absolutely do not fit your description. Just had a look through the list of bosses and it's actually a reasonably small % that do.
            you mean the adds that don't fight you at all unless you're in the water below and exist exclusively to make sure you don't run out of ammo?
            Imma support the other dude and add this. EVERY single boss has additional enemies with them that will spawn after you kill them endlessly until you kill the boss. That is the definition of waves. Never ending one after the other.  It is lazy game design. Instead of making the bosses hard on their own, they add all these little enemies to distract you and make the bland boss fights hard.

Then, we have the actual boss encounters. Usually these entail fog walls, introductory cutscenes, material drops to craft new mods and weapons, and mechanics/attacks unique to that boss. These have generally been a stellar improvement over the last game. Annihilation, Red Prince, Sha'Hala, Tal Ratha, Kaeula's Shadow, Custodian's Eye, Corrupted Ravager, and Faelin/Faerin are just the first set of bosses that come to mind that I think are really good. We've got some stinkers like Bloat King or Abomination, and some mediocre ones like Gwendil and Astropath, sure. But the number of good bosses vastly outnumbers the crappy ones, and the same absolutely could not have been said about Remnant 1.
        Oh I dunno about the last sentiment there. Of the "good" ones you mentioned, my current run only gave me the Corrupt Ravager and Kaeula's Shadow. The former is the definition of average and the latter was a tedious fight. Not difficult, but the way the fight arena is designed, you are left in a relatively narrow area to actually engage the enemy in, making it mostly a dull encounter. 

However, other fights come to mind as well like the Defiler and the Nightweaver which are just tedious fights. The Nightweaver particularly is simply frustrating more than fun. A two stage fight with the first stage being piss easy, while the second stage has a tiny arena, instakill areas near walls and a boss attack that WILL nearly kill you in one hit while being fast quick to repeat. It's less of a challenge and more of a nuisance. There are outright bad ones, tedious ones and the only truly memorable boss (for good reasons) was the Labyrinth Sentinel because it was different. 

Remnant 1 wasn't known for good bosses, but this game definitely won't be known for that either.
            Sorry you feel this way. I disagree. Ravager, Kaeula's Shadow, and Nightweaver are all bosses I really enjoyed. I'm always happy to face them. Defiler is not good, but he's an aberration, not a boss.

Please don't get the wrong idea by me asking this, but what difficulty did/do you play on?
                Played on the two middle ones (I honestly don't remember what this game called them - to me it's normal and hard). The bosses just felt annoying to beat. Most bosses I'm encountering seem to be that way. Often they don't pose as much challenge in and of themselves as due to the game making it really frustrating. 

Because the nightweaver was the last one I killed off (that was today), it's fresh in my memory. So for example in that one, the second phase is just clunky. The arena to fight in is very compact and walled. The boss is fast and has a fair amount of health. It's attack patterns are very simple to understand, but one mistake can lead to having to redo everything. Took several tries for me to kill it, mostly fighting with close quarters awkwardness and avoidance of instakill wall grabs. 

Most of the memorable bosses from this game are memorable to me because of this. Some set of mechanics that frustrates. Ones like the corrupt ravager are fine, but don't stand out because they are just decent game design. Nothing remarkable, but well functioning. It's why I mentioned the Labyrinth boss. It was actually something different. Not difficult, but a change of pace. It had something to remember in it, that wasn't frustration. 

Now don't get me wrong - much of this is also down to taste. However various quality markers can also be objective and I just don't think the boss design in this game ever really goes beyond "alright", but often falls beneath that.
LMFAO I was about to say the same, he needs to upgrade those guns, sounds like he not doing any damage. Throwing wet towels at them.
    LMAO I was about to say the same bot comment too ignoring the other things he said! XD
    I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
I wasn't even playing remnant 2 then lol but against ammo box item U have nothing to say against it just like the guys in the YouTube comment as if I'm killing mobs for ammo it's to survive and focus on the boss

If u have no money for ammo boxes U are trash anyway XD
    Got over 40k scrap and over 50 ammo boxes... hardly ever use em. Only have em for multi-player when there isn't a gunslinger in the party to share ammo pickups. I'll still stick with my previous statement and not resort to calling someone trash like some middle schooler who feels insulted.
        Nah lol u lost the argument U saying like I do no dmg calling me trash too it's just an excuse to say ah they drop ammo and sounds like the most noob statement ever and I don't think I shoot on the boss 3x more than on mobs but now I'm farther remnant 2 has not many mobs like remnant 1 especially the monkey who shoot lightning and jump to pillars no way U kill them for ammo and BTW it's waay faster to use ammo box than reloading 2 guns the box reloads both if U didn't know atleast on the 1 game I have unlimited ammo weapon anyway so I will never go out of ammo so mobs have a use but u don't get it anyway programmed bot
            Awe thats sweet I have myself a reddit pen pal though I couldn't make out what they were trying to get across due to the horrible grammer  ❤️ 💋
                Hey, so while I actually agree that guy is a Clown, if you’re going to rag someone about grammar , spell the word correctly.
        Maybe try not playing on Survival mode then?
Custodian eye was a blast. I’m sorry you had a bad roll that can make things tough and yes absolutely being one shot is probably my most hated thing ever and unfortunately there is a lot of that in this game.
you can shoot most of the crystals from up top before you start the event.
The Spiral Staircase I actually found to be one of the easiest sections. Same as the labyrinth.   
ESPECIALLY when you actually find out the different mechanics, like shooting the crystals while you run through the staircase.
Hang in there. Once I got past it the game opened up a lot more. Don't be afraid to reroll if you're simply having a straight up bad time though.
Not a boss.
    He has a boss health bar so he is a boss.
        So a health bar at the top of your screen is the qualifier for boss? Does that mean Annihilation would not be a boss if they hid his health bar?
            Since there are no real qualifies for a boss we will never stop  argueing.I think since this game is more like a souls like i would category every enemy with a big health over my screen as a boss.
a few being the key term here. "most of the bosses" absolutely do not fit your description. Just had a look through the list of bosses and it's actually a reasonably small % that do.
    you mean the adds that don't fight you at all unless you're in the water below and exist exclusively to make sure you don't run out of ammo?
    Imma support the other dude and add this. EVERY single boss has additional enemies with them that will spawn after you kill them endlessly until you kill the boss. That is the definition of waves. Never ending one after the other.  It is lazy game design. Instead of making the bosses hard on their own, they add all these little enemies to distract you and make the bland boss fights hard. 

The boss themselves would be boring on their own, and that is the problem. And the devs were called out on it and their response was, well they enemies give you ammo. Bruh other games handle ammo drops without just spawning in enemies for you to kill.  It is annoying, I never felt like I did anything when i beat a boss, unlike with fromsoft games. I was just relieved it was over.
Neither of those bosses are "just waves of enemies" though, which is what the guy I replied to was saying. Bloat King's minions can be completely ignored since they live in the pit and are too slow to even attack you if you fall in and actually try to get out. Nightweaver does spawn minions that you'll have to deal with regularly, but they're not dangerous and they die extremely easily. They never really come out when the boss is attacking either, so it's not like it's a struggle to manage them all at the same time.
Well, part of it is because I don't just classify anything with a boss bar at the top of my screen a boss, or any tough encounter as a boss. If you go approach things like Root Nexus or the Fae Council as a boss, of course you're going to think that this game's bosses fucking suck. This applies to Aberration type enemies, which are almost all optional and are just regular ass enemies with more health and modifiers. But if you reframe any of these things as what they actually are, and approach them accordingly, then suddenly everything tends to feel much better.
