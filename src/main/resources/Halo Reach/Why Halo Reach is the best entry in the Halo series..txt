[[Why Halo Reach is the best entry in the Halo series.]]


I have been a huge Halo fan ever since Combat Evolved came out and I have played every Halo FPS extensively. The following are reasons why I believe Halo Reach to be the best Halo of them all. Remember, these are just my opinions.

1. **Reach has the best campaign from beginning to end**. 
While the original Combat Evolved had the best story, and Halo 3 had the best individual levels (The Ark, The Covenant), the Halo Reach campaign is consistently great. There are no equivalents to "The Library" or "Cortana" in Reach, and each level is diverse and offers something new. The story is not a masterpiece, but it was decent enough for me and set the events of the campaign along well. I also think some of the high points of the campaign can stand toe to toe with any other Halo title.
1. **The best iteration of the Covenant in a Halo game**
Whether you were a fan of the flood or not, you can't deny that the best enemies in every Halo game were the many races of the Covenant. Fighting an army of Brutes in Halo 3 was fun, but I truly wanted to kill Elites, who returned in Reach alongside Brutes and every other Covenant species. More so in Reach than any other game, the Covenant appear blood thirsty and ruthless. The mixing and matching of different enemy types leads to hours upon hours of fun gameplay.

1. **The best sandbox in a Halo game.** Every weapon in Halo Reach feels like it fits a niche and can be powerful if used correctly.   To me, weapons like the Pistol, DMR, Needler, Plasma Pistol, and Shotgun had their best iterations in Reach. Grenades also felt powerful. Additionally Reach was the most customizable Halo in terms of tweaking features etc. When I play Halo 2 and 3 in the MCC, I start to miss Reach's sandbox more and more. 
1. **Most stuff jam-packed into one game**. Halo Reach shipped with Campaign (4-player on-line coop), multiplayer suite, firefight (RIP), forge (forge world!!), theatre, and a way to tweak every aspect of every feature. Not only did Reach have a ton of content, it was all fucking awesome stuff, unlike most of Spartan Ops. I've put more than 200-250 hours in Reach and there is still something new for me to try. 

I could think up of a lot more, but what do you think? 


For me?

Reach had a nice amount of content, great weapons and art style.
Campaign was boring and uninteresting. 

It's pretty good.

Also, unpopular opinion... Powerhouse is a fantastic map.
    Powerhouse is a fantastic map. It was well designed and had many different levels of verticality. One of the best in reach.
        Yup, I just always remember hearing bad shit about it.

To me it was Reach's version of High Ground.
            Personally, I was a huge fan of Asylum, which was the forge remake of Sanctuary.

I also liked to play Boardwalk. Powerhouse was also pretty good. 
 Id have to disagree for the following reasons: 1. Halo Odst had the best campaign experience while h2 had the best story. With the mystery of Odst, beautiful lighting, amazing music and challenging gameplay Reach isn't even close to that. Also the deep story of h2 of how the Arbiter discovers everything he knows was a lie, and then he has to fight against his own people so sentient life in the universe can still exist, is just amazing storytelling. 2. I'd have to say for covenant they were close except that they botched the brutes. The brutes in h3 would literally charge at you knock you back 10 ft then beat the shit out of you, while in h3 they are barely aggressive. They were fairly lacking. 3. H3 had the best sandbox out of every Halo. Reach vehicles were like frickin tissue paper. A few dmr shots would take a banshee out of the air and a sniper could wreck frickin tanks. The plasma repeater was worthless. The exception being that reach did have the best air vehicle, the falcon. 4. The gray pieces on forgeworld were really bland 5. bloom was frickin stupid. 6. Armor abilities were horrible. Jet pack just destroyed map movement. Armor lock would make you invincible for a bit which was awful for gameplay despite looking cool..... Etc
It seems to be an unpopular opinion but I hated reach. It was the worst of the series imo. Too much bloom, no BR, armor abilities, sprint, etc. It didn't feel like halo at all, everything felt really...sloppy?Reach was the beginning of the end. The only thing it had that I enjoyed was forge. Most of this is towards the multiplayer side of things though, I enjoyed the campaign.
1) Disagree, Reach's story did not appeal to me, the characters were all incredibly uninteresting and bland save for Jorge, and the first half of the game was very mediocre. The opening level was uninteresting, the night time mission tried to recreate the sneaking idea of Truth and Reconciliation but failed as you can't actually kill enemies with the sniper without alerting them to you, and Tip of the Spear's opening cutscene made you believe you were going to partake in this giant epic vehicle battle only to have a standard infantry mission ending, minor vehicle play with a small areas and a rail shooter segment.

2) Agreed

3) Disagree, while Reach had good weapons, I found myself questioning why they even bothered adding others, like including the Plasma Repeater as a substitute when they had the Plasma Rifle still, the Focus Rifle which was absolutely useless and replaced the Beam Rifle, and the Spiker which became incredibly weak with dualwielding removed. The DMRs also did a shit ton of vehicle damage for whatever reason, and with the new vehicle health implemented, vehicles were torn up within seconds by 3-4 guys shooting at it with DMRs. The increased accuracy and range also made cross map shooting more prevalent, discouraging players from moving around the map as they'd get lit up before they make it anywhere and instead would have base to base shoot outs. No shield bleed through was also incredibly dumb, and with sprint involved spawned the frustrating double beatdown. Armor Lock further made vehicles obsolete and just slowed down gameplay in non BTB matches.

4) Forge World was sick as shit I will agree, but it really didn't help that the color pallete for forge pieces were all a bland ugly gray. The multiplayer shipped with an incredibly small amount of non-Forged maps, all of which were ripped straight from the campaign. 

You can like Reach, you can think it's the best entry in the series, that's your preference. However I disagree with you on some of the things you mentioned and in my opinion, it was the worst entry. Though I will say that custom games were great in Reach, I agree with you about the customization being fantastic, the file browser actually worked and was great, and I liked certain assets from Reach a great deal like the Falcon and Grenade Launcher. 
    H:R maps weren't ripped from campaign, it's that multiplayer maps were implemented in campaign. They were designed from the begining as multiplayer maps, not as campaign  locations.

Armor abilities and bloom ruins it for me. Yes I know bloom is in CE.
1. I have to say the exact opposite. Halo 1 I thought had the best campaign, with many more interesting environments. Examples would be: PoA-Intense, close quarter combat inside of a ship under attack. Assault on the control room-Big, open map with a snowy environment with fun vehicle play and the sniper and rockets are a blast to use. 343 Guilty Spark- Dense, swampy area with a "spooky" atmosphere, where you meet the flood for the first time. There are more, but you get the point. And the characters were kind of cliche. The "super edgy" guy with a fucking skull on his mask, acting all hardcore, the wise guy sniper dude, the bitch with an attitude, the gentle giant, you get it. Plus, no Sergeant Johnson, big downside. Duel wielding was also removed, which was pretty stupid, considering it could have flowed real nice with some of the possible weapon combos.

2. Highly opinion based, you can't simply state, for every halo fan, that you'd rather choose skirmishers and brutes for enemies over the menacing flood. That, and you were able to kill elites AND brutes, alongside the flood in Halo 2, which is a very close tie for the "funnest" halo campaign IMO. 

3. Meh, found myself almost never using half the weapons, just a DMR and a power weapon if I was given one, if not, then usually a plasma pistol. 

4. Halo 3 had 4 player coop, multiplayer, and theater. Same as reach. Forge, too, but just not quite as advanced, but a lot of fun game modes were perfected on halo 3, that weren't possible with halo reach, and vice versa. Forge mode was pretty sick, but the constant grey coloring kind of hurt my eyes after awhile.

I am not disagreeing with you, saying Reach is a bad game, because by many means, it isn't. The environments weren't terrible, and the space battle was pretty sweet, too. You're points just aren't that solid, that, and you can't just simply state, fan or not, floodâ‰ to covenant races, because that's just plain silly.
    I have not felt a single game since H:CE where I actually felt I was in a race against time and felt actual dread trying to get to my objective.

That map.....Trust and Betrayal.

I don't know why it's a mirrored map but damn man I felt so much dread trying to beat that stage as quickly as I could because of the events that transpired. The atmosphere was amazing on that map.
Actually, ODST has the best Campaign
In my opinion, ODST's campaign would rank up there because it is definitely the most atmospheric and it was musically different enough to distinguish itself without being so abstract that the music no longer fit in the Halo aesthetic. Halo CE definitely had the best campaign though. 

You are told that you are playing a game and you fight aliens, your only job is to protect cortana. Then twists and turns and you go from simply protecting cortana to pretty much saving a small section of the galaxy. The way the flood was introduced was phenomenal. I haven't been scared like that since first playing the game a decade ago. The structure of levels was spot on, and it had a few of those levels that are truly legendary among gamers. 

The silent cartographer and the Library both have gone down in history as pretty much the definitive Halo levels. The silent cartographer managed to strike a perfect medium of free roam and on tracks, it was open enough that you felt that you were making the decisions to explore wherever you wanted, but in reality it was exactly where the game wanted you to go. The Library has been hailed as one of the toughest missions to date, with only a few surpassing it in difficulty. If I think back to the few times I played through Reach, none of the levels really stood out to me. There was no level that was particularly hard or fun to play through. And really, that's why I didn't play Reach more. There was no challenge in it.  
I like all the main Halo games a lot, but for me, Reach is one of the bottom ones. The content was great, but the story, scale, and mechanics brought it down for me. 

I'd rate them Halo 2>Halo 4 (sue me)>Halo 3>Halo:CE>Halo:Reach>Halo 3:ODST
I didn't like the campaign and thought it was lackluster as hell. I don't even remember anything besides the last stand, the elites in the beginning and the sniper shot.

 *2-
 I agree the Elites looked menacing and strong in Reach

3. I didn't see any of that but I only used the DMR. 

4. I didn't use much of that stuff. 

I will say though that Reach had one of the greatest weapons in any game. That damn sticky lock on launcher is the greatest weapon I've ever used in any Halo. Just shooting that thing at a warthog driving by, watching it chase then stick ot a wheel and twirling around then finally detonating was the greatest thing ever. It actually renewed my enjoyment of Reach at the end there.
    You're thinking of the sticky detonator, which was in halo 4, not reach, IIRC.
        No. I remember it being reach. That bare bones coag map. It was in the middle of the rocks. I remember because people would get on those damn elite warthog things and somehow get no scope snipes like candy.

You mean this?
                Yeah haha. That thing is amazing. 
I got Reach on day one and played it all the way to Halo 4's launch. I have to agree, it's my favorite Halo and most likely my favorite video game period. I have too many good memories playing with friends on Reach to count. All the full custom games, hours of matchmaking, forge battles and creations. We made multiple clans and made even more friends from it. Not to mention Reach has the best armor customization by far. I know some aren't a fan of this Halo, but for me all the memories make it the best.  
Powerhouse is a fantastic map. It was well designed and had many different levels of verticality. One of the best in reach.
