[[I think it was such a cool idea for bungie to have the main villain of halo reach be barely talked about by the characters and this piece of story for halo reach being partially hidden away.]]





He's also the only Field Marshall
    And Bungie still cared enough to give him unique stats and even unique AI in how he uses/switches his weapons.
        Isn't he one of the only elites in Reach to dual wield Plasma Rifles, or am i misremembering?
            I think some rangers (the jet pack ones) do as well
                Ok, so it looks like the zealots at the end of the game are the ones that [dual wield plasma rifles](https://youtu.be/cBG60IbG4D0?t=1809). The field marshal uses a fuel rod gun. I couldn't find anything else with other elites dual wielding except for [these elite ultra's](https://youtu.be/Uz1aPijTP8c?t=23).
                    There is also a Silver Field Marshal on ONI Sword Base that acts as a BOB (which are usually Gold Rangers) and dual wields Plasma Rifles.
                        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA)

Wow, that's interesting! I never knew about this.
                    theres some elites on Sword Base that also dual wield on certain difficulties
            He‚Äôs the only enemy who has two weapons and can swap between them - he has a Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword.
            Pretty sure rangers and ultras can too. Fuzzy on officers
        No shit, really?!
...I never even *noticed* this guy. Reach had a recurring boss enemy?
    He only appears a few times, he appears at the end of winter contingency, he‚Äôs the one that snipes kat, and you fight him at the end of pillar of autumn after his men kill Emile.
        Yeah, I just saw an elite and figured I'd catch up and end them soon lol
            Fun fact, he is the only ‚Äúfield marshal‚Äù elite that appears throughout the entire campaign, as far as I‚Äôm aware. If you test it without the noob combo on heroic or legendary, his shield strength is ridiculous
                The last Elite that appears in 6's *death scene* is *also* a field Marshall, but I doubt he has any importance since his screentime is like 0.5 seconds long and *you can't even tell he's a field marshall unless you mod the game.*
                    Or look at his armor.

It has been confirmed that he stalks Noble Team for the entire game.

He is the Elite that got away in Winter Contingency, the one who shot Kat, his squad was the one that took out Emile and he was the final "boss" of the game (not including Lone Wolf)

He is definitely important. He is the enemy that gets the most screen time throughout the game and he killed one member of Noble Team and his actions led to the death of another.
                        ... I know. Re-read my comment.

The original post and the person I responded to are talking about the Field Marshall that appears in Winter Contingency and *dies* in Pillar of Autumn.

I'm talking about *another* field marshall that appears in Noble 6's death scene, which happens in Lone Wolf, which takes place after Pillar of Autumn, which is when the Field Marshall that killed Kat dies by the hand of Noble 6. 

Re-read my original comment with this context in mind.
                            Which-wich Witch!
                        He didn‚Äôt take out Emile. He was there, but it was just an ordinary zealot, which Emile managed to turn around and stab before dying
                            Reread the comment.
                        I‚Äôm pretty sure the elite you‚Äôre talking about in the end that kills noble 6 is what we now know as ‚Äúthe arbiter‚Äù he was the main elite in charge of the invasion of reach and eventually chased the pillar of autumn to the first halo
                        Where is this confirmed? One of the books or comics?
                    Ah gotcha, I more so meant the only one that appears in the campaign GAMEPLAY really, but that‚Äôs cool! I don‚Äôt think I ever really noticed. It‚Äôs pretty cool/interesting that they are showing the higher ranking elites getting Spartan kills
                That part on LASO was‚Ä¶ interesting.
                    Interesting it putting it lightly.
                There's also a white field marshal on sword base legendary I'm pretty sure
                This is how I wish they would have handled bosses in infinite. The bullet sponge shit really annoys me because it doesn't fit the rules of gameplay and is just difficult to be difficult. At least the badass elite is reach still has to follow the normal gameplay rules.
        Doesn‚Äôt a Jackel snipe kat? With a needle rifle ?


Edit: you‚Äôre right just rewatched cut scene
            Could also swear it was a jackal
                I mean unless they updated it in MCC, because my brain was not happy when I googled it and it was the elite lmao
                    Tempted to boot up my 360 now.
                        This could just be a false memory. I watched another video from 11 years ago and it was the elite. I‚Äôm losing my sanity
                            Ever look into the halo Mandela effect? I guess we found another example of it.
                            WAIT THIS WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A JACKAL TOO
                                Don‚Äôt do this to me, I already feel crazy üòÇ
                                Jackal snipers are the meme
        How do you know he's the one who snipes Kat? I don't remember seeing an elite at all.
            https://youtu.be/Nl6VJyvI398

It's kinda hard to see but I think it's an elite
                Lol I couldn't see it at all. But I'm sure if you pause a high rez video it's there.
                    Yeah I had to pause and zoom in. I'm not 100% sure it's this exact elite but it doesn't look like a jackal
    It's the Elite Field Marshall with the Fuel Rod Gun and Sword.
I kinda just thought each Zealot was a different Zealot. Anybody know his name?
    There are a fairly large number of Zealots. 

But at any one time there‚Äôs only ever one Field Marshal on screen, and until we fight the very last enemy that we fight on foot (and indeed one with special, unique AI) we never kill one.

Combine that with the fact that these things are extremely high ranking (like even the CSO would only have the one) is why it seems really likely OP is right
        These guys are the equivalent of Covenant Fleetmasters, so that makes sense
        Considering they're referred to as field marshals, a rank so high in human militaries that you can only attain it posthumously, it certainly makes sense that to be anything near equivalent, covenant field marshals must be unbelievably rare
            Youre incorrect that it's a rank only obtained posthumously,partially because the rank itself is used in quite different manners depending on the country,some just literally giving it to their presidents,and partially because there has been living generals promoted to Feild Marshall.

Unless you're talking specifically about halo lore,in which case this is irrelevant.
    Wiki says unnamed. Let's call him Jim.
        I want to call him Chester.
            I'm down with Chester.

Forevermore shall he be known as Chester.
                Wort wort wort for your fellow Chester
            I elect filbur
                Jimchester Filbur Parnabis 14th
            Jim'Chesteree
        Ah yes, the Covenant's ultimate counter to John Halo: Jim Halo.
        Why is Jim treating the Spartan poorly?
        Since we have Craig the Infinite, I think Smokey is an apt name for the elite.
    The Zealots are but the Field Marshal is a single individual as we know. While it wasn‚Äôt confirmed at the time, it was figured the FM was the same individual considering how very rare and unique the rank was and it was severely doubted Noble encountered not 1 but 3 FM‚Äôs.
    They can fill a variety of roles, but there are a number of zealots that have the same or similar roles.
    Nah but his division of zealots was known I think. I don't remember their name though
    [removed]
    Wasn‚Äôt the arbiter pursuing the POA at reach?
        IIRC, yes. But he was a fleet master at the time, and pursued the PoA *from* Reach, upon seeing it attempting to flee. Thel 'Vadam and the Fleet of Particular Justice were the main Reach-breaking force. From reading some comments + wiki, assumption is Field Marshall = Troop/Ground Commander, while Fleet Master = Naval/Space Commander.

Or, sorry if I'm misinterpreting your comment.
            It would have been so cool if this elite WAS the Arbiter
Wait, was he also the one that charged and tried to stab noble 6 in winter contigency?
    The exact one Carter let get away, ended up being responsible for Noble Team's downfall, either directly or indirectly. Killing him might've saved them or severely hurt the Covenant's war effort. Not that I think Reach could've been saved in the end.

If you remember, Halsey chastised him for doing that and called him a puppet for following procedure instead of taking the initiative.
        Noble team also did a lot of things wrong like kat fixing tech without night vision on and taking elevators in a city about to be glassed in a building about to fall, but it fits the spartans III so well.
            Eh, that line about light is more just to give her some room and have him stop looking over her shoulder. Spartans actually have the ability to see in low light. As for the elevator, there's no time to take the stairs, they're hundreds of stories high. There also didn't look to be any stairs but that point is moot.

Edit: I‚Äôd also like to add that night vision would‚Äôve made it harder to see as there is plenty of light in that scene.

Their faceplates can also enhance what they‚Äôre looking at.
                If they can see in the dark then carter shouldnt have told noble six to turn on night vision and say "cant see a thing" lol
                    Yep this peice of lore has always been bullshit to me because in the games, we use flashlights for dark places.
                        Gameplay != lore. Visors are supposed to be able to adjust according to light levels but we'll still get our screens flash banged by an explosion. It's not bullshit, just one of the many examples where gameplay doesn't follow lore.
                            I mean I assume the visors are a bit like current day nvgs in that it takes them a second to adjust so you can still get affected by sudden light changes
                            An example of lore making up bullshit.
                        Tbf most of these places arnt just low light that are almost no light
            It's a lot easier to figure out which wires are which when you can see the colors, versus highlighting them all nice and green.
        That would be overly simplistic for a war story, especially one where the "good guys" are doomed from the beginning.

Noble Team are the Spartans that represent Reach; they were fated to die.
            Reach is still doomed regardless, but killing him might‚Äôve held it off or allowed some to escape, like Jun.
                That would've been bad writing, plain and simple.

That Jun is the only one that lives is making it so that the death toll is not *too* exaggerrated. It's more feasible to say that there were heavy casualties, but some managed to slip through.

The presence of this Elite wouldn't have mattered either way to the survivability of these Spartans; they would have died to something or somebody else. 

That's how stacked the odds were against Reach. It's just a cool little easter egg for those who want to notice, which is likely why this Field Marshall has little to zero presence in the campaign, or even has a name.
        Makes sense. I feel like killing him definitely would have changed a lot. Kat would have survived and been able to help the cause and emile would‚Äôve been able to survive too probably
             Butterfly effect.
    Yep!
        Feels good to know we get to kill him after all that and what he did to Kat
    I don‚Äôt think so, actually. The field marhall runs away before that and then, from the looks of it, a different zealot jumps on 6 and tries to stab him.
That elite as the main villain is very discrete and easy to not recognize but really adds to the story line
    In some ways, he‚Äôs like your counterpart.

You don‚Äôt talk much, as Six you‚Äôre only really visible because we play as them. It‚Äôs a war on a planetary scale after all, and the warriors are fighting as best they can where they are needed.

I only realized that this guy was almost certainly the same guy throughout the campaign a couple years after playing Reach for the first time. Yet it still made my favorite game even better.

And, that final level where the last enemy you kill on foot before your last stand, one of the hardest in the whole game, all the bittersweeter.

This bastard has been chasing you through the fall and now he‚Äôs personally trying to stop you from saving the Autumn. Like Hell he will!
    Discrete is an understatement lmao. I only found about this *today*, and I played Reach's campaign on release 12 years ago...
        Me reading this topic: TIL Reach had a main villain at all.
            The main villain is the Covenant. OP is high.
                Maybe antagonist is a better word
It was the same group of Zealots to, or spartan hunter groups. This guy is one of if not the only Field Marshal ranked Elites in the game as well. He‚Äôs the one who makes it out of winter contingency alive at the final firefight‚Ä¶ you can count the bodies and their armor configurations. He snipes Kat, he knew you would be running to the bomb shelter and set up to take the shot. His group gets Emile in the end and then he waits for you at the very end before using the mini-mac / rail gun / mass driver. 

There‚Äôs a few other higher ranking elites like the two duel wielding elites on ONI Swordbase but I could be wrong, I‚Äôve long forgotten how the higher ranking elites work but either way this guy gets the most screen time by far. 

Anyhow I loved this aspect of Reach. It‚Äôs super underrated. Nobody even talks about these guys much at all. The BOB elites spying on Spartans and the UNSC‚Äôs combat effectiveness. So many little details that were just awesome.
    BOB elites were Silent Shadow before Silent Shadow, wish they made them as such.
        Someone will mod it as such I‚Äôm sure.
    Yep, he and his Zealot Brothers were apart of the Devoted Sentries (a group tasked with hunting down Forerunner Artifacts) and unlike the majority of the Covenant forces, Field Marshals served the Ministry of Fervent Intercession rather then the Ministry of Resolution.

Also Field Marshalls are extremely rare and few in number the fact that there's only 2 during Reach's campaign (3 if you count BOB on Sword Base) shows how high ranking and important they are, I assume there's only one Field Marshal per fleet and the one in Lone Wolf arrived with the Fleet of Particular Justice.
        Wow yeah thanks for the knowledge by the way. That‚Äôs dope stuff. I knew they were pretty darn rare but I forgot the rarity versus an entire battle group haha. I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be more than a handful per group. Stuffs crazy.
What‚Äôs interesting is they released a Canon Fodder a few months ago, telling us more about certain enemies from the games (That last Brute Chieftain in Infinite, the Jackal Snipers in Halo 2), but they didn‚Äôt bring up this guy and his merry men! 

Would‚Äôve been neat to learn about him, at the very least his name!
    Honestly I bet 343 don‚Äôt even know what this thread is about‚Ä¶
Fun fact about the fight at the end: He has unique AI in how he switches his weapons for the range the player is at!

I just love this little part of Reach. It‚Äôs already my favorite game of all time but this that I learned years after I played for the first time just cemented it.

Throughout the whole game, you‚Äôre being stalked by this highest of ranks elite. He nearly kills you after the first mission, and even if you hunt down and all kill the rest of his zealots, this bastard can‚Äôt be touched. Considering his rank, he‚Äôs one the bastards who is personally responsible for making Reach fall.

As things get worse and worse, him a forgotten elite most assume was killed with the other zealots, he takes a single shot, being as hyper-lethal as you are. . . And this time, he gets a Spartan. . . .

But it‚Äôs not the end. 

Then this bastard is part of the elite team that kills Emile, and is what stands in the way of the Autumn and freedom. The Autumn and Installation 04. Between, as we know, the universe‚Äôs survival or it‚Äôs end.

And like hell we‚Äôre going to let this split jaw stop us!

Then his unique fight, where he‚Äôs one of the toughest enemies in the whole game. Depending on the difficulty he can shrug off a Spartan laser, and with his sword and fuel rod he can fight on par at any range.

But he should have remembered, that despite how he might try, Spartans never die.

In the end, he still helped Reach fall. He helped his side win, and his actions are even what kills Six.

But he wasn‚Äôt able to save his side, nor win the war. Because we beat him in the rematch, showed what happens in a fair fight.

Our body and armor, all burned and turned to glass, just like his. But his faith died with him, Six‚Äôs courage lives on
    >In the end, he still helped Reach fall. He helped his side win, and his actions are even what kills Six.

Six is just waiting for the evac Pelican.
        In his cave‚Ä¶
    ‚Ä¶ fuck yeah dude
I‚Äôd love a Modern Halo game where you play as the Covenant.
    This franchise was ripe with spin off potential but all we got were new galaxy ending mega threats everytime
    This franchise was ripe with spin off potential post reach but all we got were new galaxy ending mega threats everytime
    Not happening since Halo is a T rated series now. Unless you aren't facing humans, then I guess it could still work.
Isn't there a little side objective on tip of the spear where you can kill one of his guys?
    Yes if you do the skip it's really easy to catch up to the running zealot
Whoa this is so cool. I found this on the wiki regarding him and his crew: https://www.halopedia.org/Devoted_Sentries
Idk man the bosses in the 343 era games are kind of over the top.  Monologues just kind of drag on and on.  Gameplay they are bullet sponges especially in halo infinite.  I appreciated the intensity of these elites and always thought it was done pretty well.
    That's because most "bosses" in Bungie Halo games aren't actually bosses, not in the traditional sense. The only actual boss fights are in Halo 2 and 3, which are against Scarabs(if you consider a boss), Regret, and Tartarus.

The "fight" against Regret is just boarding his hover chair and beating him to death. Tartarus though is an actual fight. In fact, he's almost definitely the hardest and most bullet sponge boss in Halo.

Edit: Forgot about the fight against Guilty Spark in Halo 3.

Edit 2: Somehow forgot another boos fight against the Heretic. I have no idea how I‚Äôm forgetting these things.
        Don't forget Guilty Spark. He is the only proper boss in H3 outside of scarabs which are debatable
            Oh yeah. Can't believe I forgot about that.
                Also the Heretic Leader in Halo 2
        Heritic boss is a boss fight.
            How the fuck am I forgetting these things!?
    These boss fights in infinite seem weird and out of place
I've always thought about the villain in halo reach to not be one single guy, but as The Covenant as an unstoppable force
    That's because it is
he‚Äôs kinda hot
    Elite: **chokes Six** 

Six: **punches Elite** 

Elite/Six: ‚ÄòHarder.‚Äô 

Elite/Six: ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô
    Yep. My fave design!
Yeah I love this guy
They had the idea of you being hunted in Halo Infinites campaign before it got slimmed down. There are various references to Jega rdomnai stalking you throughout the game and I believe there was meant to be an alien style mission dedicated to being chased down by him and his boys but it never happened. Shame as he was my favourite character from Infinite easily
Makes me wish 343 gave him a name and a small backstory. This guy ambushed noble at the very start of the game and was the main guy behind Kat and Emile's deaths, as well as probably indirectly contributing to Carter's death, though this would just be speculation.

With such a reputation, I'd at least like to know who he was.
    What chills me is that this guy saw who was splicing wires and fixing shit in Winter Contingency. 

He knew who to go for.
    He's basically the Covenant equivalent of us, so in theory even his record is top secret and redacted in the Covy info network.
    His name is Jim
Probably because a major theme of Reach is how (relatively) insignificant you, your allies, and even individual enemies are alone. Every action an individual accomplishes is dwarfed by the bigger picture of the war. You save a few thousand lives, but can't save them all alone. You kill a few thousand covenant, but can't kill them all alone. It's wonderful storytelling that I just didn't appreciate fully as a kid.
Oh my God, *you're right*. Every time, there he is. I've seen that Elite a thousand times and never even knew he was the same bastard that killed our friends.
The amount of times ive played this game & never put that together
...who?
Is this also the same Elite Noble 6 punches in the face too? I never knew that there was a boss in the game
    No, that guy wasn‚Äôt.
Today I learned. Never realized it was the same character throughout. Thanks for posting and for all the explanations in the thread!
I didn‚Äôt even realize he and his zealots were the main antagonists of the game and also were the same elites you‚Äôd see since the beginning! I learn something everyday!
...Yup true
He's not really the "main villain". He's the "main villain" in the same sense that the Black Elite from Halo CE shows up at the end on that elevator (he's the main villain in the novelization and only shows up in-game one time).

The main villain in Reach is the Covenant as a monolithic organization. You could argue that this guy is basically the physical manifestation of that (even though he's not the Arbiter). A dangerous Covenant species that is zealous in his belief that he will either burn Humanity's best defenders or be sent along on his Great Journey, trying. But you literally only see this guy in-game about 3 times and no one talks about him.

And in the end, you kill him. OP is smoking something if they think this guy is the main villain lmao
    To be fair:

This guy is one of the ranking officers of the whole operation to destroy Reach. Considering anyone else his equivalent rank was killed when the Long Night of Solace was sent to oblivion, this elite is certainly the highest ranking officer who commanded for the whole campaign.

And, he probably was the top officer of specifically the ground campaign
        > Considering anyone else his equivalent rank was killed when the Long Night of Solace was sent to oblivion

The main fleet offensive didn't even arrive until the end of Long Night of Solace. If I remember correctly, the book Fall of Reach, when the 150ish Covenant ships show up, is the same moment as the end of Long Night of Solace, where you're falling into orbit and Dot is repeatedly reporting multiple Covenant ships detected moments after you blew up the one, single carrier. That's when Thel's fleet arrived and Thel definitely outranked this Field Marshall, at the time.
            Indeed, everyone who arrived in the Fleet of Particular Justice missed a decent part of the campaign though
Since the first Field Marshal was from the Fleet of Valiant Prudence, directly under Supreme Commander Rho Barutamee (as a Devoted Sentry), the 2nd Field Marshal (that shows up at Noble 6's death) likely came with one of the other fleets that arrived after Jorge's death. Who knows, he may have even been serving under Thel Vadam, in the Fleet of Particular Justice. The thought of that is so cool.

Funny story, I was the guy who wrote the original trivia post on halopedia about the same Field Marshal appearing 3 times in the game. I was like 14 yrs old at the time. And for the longest time nobody ever corrected my run-on sentences and poor grammar lmao. It was my little contribution to the Halo Universe and I always felt a connection to this Field Marshal because of it. 

Somebody else later added to that trivia post that the elite who killed Noble 6 was a separate Field Marshal. They also probably fixed my grammar.
I DIDNT KNOW THIS WHAT
I agree. Sadly those thing get appreciated only after a few years.
If infinite barely talk about a villain, 343  get bombed with insult.
The main villain is the covenant in general, the mass wave and inevitable loss for humanity
The main villain of the story is actually Bungie for not sticking to the timeline and events from a book they approved like 10 years before this
It's crazy how he never had an official name
Considering his rank, and that the fleet that attacked reach followed the autumn to the first ring. It‚Äôs probably safe to say this guy was a personal friend of our favorite arbiter while he was still the fleet master
    It‚Äôs possible, but this Zealot came with the Devoted Sentries, and not with Thel‚Äôs fleet.

Definitely them both being high ranking Zealots adds to that possibility though.
I enjoy how unfortunately and terribly Reach is. Not the xenos, of course, but often times on the battlefield you're facing stronger and smarter opponents than you are. Your Intel is usually not up to par no matter how advanced it is, especially during a surprise offensive you start off behind the 8-ball and the soldiers who make and made sacrifices every day typically are never heard about. Sacrificing their lives for civilians that won't ever get to thank or know who they are.

Edit: spelling and some grammar
Made the covenant feel more alien to me, they same way the decided to remove the covies from speaking English
Please don‚Äôt say that, 343 will get ideas and make Infinites story even harder to follow
If you want to be more technical and deep the villain is the future Arbiter.  

I always think it‚Äôs odd and kinda cool replaying Halo CE and Reach that he is there just out of sight.
 I figured there were multiple field marshals with the same colour of armour  since a lot of the elites have the same armour as well
I never thought of it like this. This the guy that made the badass scene in winter contingency, snipped Kat, and if I remember correctly also killed Emile ?
Wasn‚Äôt the last ‚Äúboss‚Äù in Halo:Reach Thel Va‚Äôdam (The Arbiter)? I thought the left handed sword was a reference
    No, Thel was in orbit at the time.
Amazing piece of lore, I had no idea about this. Thanks mate!
Technically, the main villain of Halo Reach was Thel Vadamee (the future  Arbiter). He was in charge of the invasion fleet that showed up after Jorge blew himself up.
Bungie understood some things are best left a mystery. 343i doesn't understand the concept of "less is more" (unless it's the store am I right gamers? üòé) so they have a ton of things completely explained in books etc. While having an answer can be satisfying, it's not as compelling as a mystery.
Man I miss when bungie was still making halo.
I wish that will be sick
And Bungie still cared enough to give him unique stats and even unique AI in how he uses/switches his weapons.
    Isn't he one of the only elites in Reach to dual wield Plasma Rifles, or am i misremembering?
        I think some rangers (the jet pack ones) do as well
            Ok, so it looks like the zealots at the end of the game are the ones that [dual wield plasma rifles](https://youtu.be/cBG60IbG4D0?t=1809). The field marshal uses a fuel rod gun. I couldn't find anything else with other elites dual wielding except for [these elite ultra's](https://youtu.be/Uz1aPijTP8c?t=23).
                There is also a Silver Field Marshal on ONI Sword Base that acts as a BOB (which are usually Gold Rangers) and dual wields Plasma Rifles.
                    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA)

Wow, that's interesting! I never knew about this.
                theres some elites on Sword Base that also dual wield on certain difficulties
        He‚Äôs the only enemy who has two weapons and can swap between them - he has a Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword.
        Pretty sure rangers and ultras can too. Fuzzy on officers
    No shit, really?!
He only appears a few times, he appears at the end of winter contingency, he‚Äôs the one that snipes kat, and you fight him at the end of pillar of autumn after his men kill Emile.
    Yeah, I just saw an elite and figured I'd catch up and end them soon lol
        Fun fact, he is the only ‚Äúfield marshal‚Äù elite that appears throughout the entire campaign, as far as I‚Äôm aware. If you test it without the noob combo on heroic or legendary, his shield strength is ridiculous
            The last Elite that appears in 6's *death scene* is *also* a field Marshall, but I doubt he has any importance since his screentime is like 0.5 seconds long and *you can't even tell he's a field marshall unless you mod the game.*
                Or look at his armor.

It has been confirmed that he stalks Noble Team for the entire game.

He is the Elite that got away in Winter Contingency, the one who shot Kat, his squad was the one that took out Emile and he was the final "boss" of the game (not including Lone Wolf)

He is definitely important. He is the enemy that gets the most screen time throughout the game and he killed one member of Noble Team and his actions led to the death of another.
                    ... I know. Re-read my comment.

The original post and the person I responded to are talking about the Field Marshall that appears in Winter Contingency and *dies* in Pillar of Autumn.

I'm talking about *another* field marshall that appears in Noble 6's death scene, which happens in Lone Wolf, which takes place after Pillar of Autumn, which is when the Field Marshall that killed Kat dies by the hand of Noble 6. 

Re-read my original comment with this context in mind.
                        Which-wich Witch!
                    He didn‚Äôt take out Emile. He was there, but it was just an ordinary zealot, which Emile managed to turn around and stab before dying
                        Reread the comment.
                    I‚Äôm pretty sure the elite you‚Äôre talking about in the end that kills noble 6 is what we now know as ‚Äúthe arbiter‚Äù he was the main elite in charge of the invasion of reach and eventually chased the pillar of autumn to the first halo
                    Where is this confirmed? One of the books or comics?
                Ah gotcha, I more so meant the only one that appears in the campaign GAMEPLAY really, but that‚Äôs cool! I don‚Äôt think I ever really noticed. It‚Äôs pretty cool/interesting that they are showing the higher ranking elites getting Spartan kills
            That part on LASO was‚Ä¶ interesting.
                Interesting it putting it lightly.
            There's also a white field marshal on sword base legendary I'm pretty sure
            This is how I wish they would have handled bosses in infinite. The bullet sponge shit really annoys me because it doesn't fit the rules of gameplay and is just difficult to be difficult. At least the badass elite is reach still has to follow the normal gameplay rules.
    Doesn‚Äôt a Jackel snipe kat? With a needle rifle ?


Edit: you‚Äôre right just rewatched cut scene
        Could also swear it was a jackal
            I mean unless they updated it in MCC, because my brain was not happy when I googled it and it was the elite lmao
                Tempted to boot up my 360 now.
                    This could just be a false memory. I watched another video from 11 years ago and it was the elite. I‚Äôm losing my sanity
                        Ever look into the halo Mandela effect? I guess we found another example of it.
                        WAIT THIS WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A JACKAL TOO
                            Don‚Äôt do this to me, I already feel crazy üòÇ
                            Jackal snipers are the meme
    How do you know he's the one who snipes Kat? I don't remember seeing an elite at all.
        https://youtu.be/Nl6VJyvI398

It's kinda hard to see but I think it's an elite
            Lol I couldn't see it at all. But I'm sure if you pause a high rez video it's there.
                Yeah I had to pause and zoom in. I'm not 100% sure it's this exact elite but it doesn't look like a jackal
It's the Elite Field Marshall with the Fuel Rod Gun and Sword.
There are a fairly large number of Zealots. 

But at any one time there‚Äôs only ever one Field Marshal on screen, and until we fight the very last enemy that we fight on foot (and indeed one with special, unique AI) we never kill one.

Combine that with the fact that these things are extremely high ranking (like even the CSO would only have the one) is why it seems really likely OP is right
    These guys are the equivalent of Covenant Fleetmasters, so that makes sense
    Considering they're referred to as field marshals, a rank so high in human militaries that you can only attain it posthumously, it certainly makes sense that to be anything near equivalent, covenant field marshals must be unbelievably rare
        Youre incorrect that it's a rank only obtained posthumously,partially because the rank itself is used in quite different manners depending on the country,some just literally giving it to their presidents,and partially because there has been living generals promoted to Feild Marshall.

Unless you're talking specifically about halo lore,in which case this is irrelevant.
Wiki says unnamed. Let's call him Jim.
    I want to call him Chester.
        I'm down with Chester.

Forevermore shall he be known as Chester.
            Wort wort wort for your fellow Chester
        I elect filbur
            Jimchester Filbur Parnabis 14th
        Jim'Chesteree
    Ah yes, the Covenant's ultimate counter to John Halo: Jim Halo.
    Why is Jim treating the Spartan poorly?
    Since we have Craig the Infinite, I think Smokey is an apt name for the elite.
The Zealots are but the Field Marshal is a single individual as we know. While it wasn‚Äôt confirmed at the time, it was figured the FM was the same individual considering how very rare and unique the rank was and it was severely doubted Noble encountered not 1 but 3 FM‚Äôs.
They can fill a variety of roles, but there are a number of zealots that have the same or similar roles.
Nah but his division of zealots was known I think. I don't remember their name though
[removed]
Wasn‚Äôt the arbiter pursuing the POA at reach?
    IIRC, yes. But he was a fleet master at the time, and pursued the PoA *from* Reach, upon seeing it attempting to flee. Thel 'Vadam and the Fleet of Particular Justice were the main Reach-breaking force. From reading some comments + wiki, assumption is Field Marshall = Troop/Ground Commander, while Fleet Master = Naval/Space Commander.

Or, sorry if I'm misinterpreting your comment.
        It would have been so cool if this elite WAS the Arbiter
The exact one Carter let get away, ended up being responsible for Noble Team's downfall, either directly or indirectly. Killing him might've saved them or severely hurt the Covenant's war effort. Not that I think Reach could've been saved in the end.

If you remember, Halsey chastised him for doing that and called him a puppet for following procedure instead of taking the initiative.
    Noble team also did a lot of things wrong like kat fixing tech without night vision on and taking elevators in a city about to be glassed in a building about to fall, but it fits the spartans III so well.
        Eh, that line about light is more just to give her some room and have him stop looking over her shoulder. Spartans actually have the ability to see in low light. As for the elevator, there's no time to take the stairs, they're hundreds of stories high. There also didn't look to be any stairs but that point is moot.

Edit: I‚Äôd also like to add that night vision would‚Äôve made it harder to see as there is plenty of light in that scene.

Their faceplates can also enhance what they‚Äôre looking at.
            If they can see in the dark then carter shouldnt have told noble six to turn on night vision and say "cant see a thing" lol
                Yep this peice of lore has always been bullshit to me because in the games, we use flashlights for dark places.
                    Gameplay != lore. Visors are supposed to be able to adjust according to light levels but we'll still get our screens flash banged by an explosion. It's not bullshit, just one of the many examples where gameplay doesn't follow lore.
                        I mean I assume the visors are a bit like current day nvgs in that it takes them a second to adjust so you can still get affected by sudden light changes
                        An example of lore making up bullshit.
                    Tbf most of these places arnt just low light that are almost no light
        It's a lot easier to figure out which wires are which when you can see the colors, versus highlighting them all nice and green.
    That would be overly simplistic for a war story, especially one where the "good guys" are doomed from the beginning.

Noble Team are the Spartans that represent Reach; they were fated to die.
        Reach is still doomed regardless, but killing him might‚Äôve held it off or allowed some to escape, like Jun.
            That would've been bad writing, plain and simple.

That Jun is the only one that lives is making it so that the death toll is not *too* exaggerrated. It's more feasible to say that there were heavy casualties, but some managed to slip through.

The presence of this Elite wouldn't have mattered either way to the survivability of these Spartans; they would have died to something or somebody else. 

That's how stacked the odds were against Reach. It's just a cool little easter egg for those who want to notice, which is likely why this Field Marshall has little to zero presence in the campaign, or even has a name.
    Makes sense. I feel like killing him definitely would have changed a lot. Kat would have survived and been able to help the cause and emile would‚Äôve been able to survive too probably
         Butterfly effect.
Yep!
    Feels good to know we get to kill him after all that and what he did to Kat
I don‚Äôt think so, actually. The field marhall runs away before that and then, from the looks of it, a different zealot jumps on 6 and tries to stab him.
In some ways, he‚Äôs like your counterpart.

You don‚Äôt talk much, as Six you‚Äôre only really visible because we play as them. It‚Äôs a war on a planetary scale after all, and the warriors are fighting as best they can where they are needed.

I only realized that this guy was almost certainly the same guy throughout the campaign a couple years after playing Reach for the first time. Yet it still made my favorite game even better.

And, that final level where the last enemy you kill on foot before your last stand, one of the hardest in the whole game, all the bittersweeter.

This bastard has been chasing you through the fall and now he‚Äôs personally trying to stop you from saving the Autumn. Like Hell he will!
Discrete is an understatement lmao. I only found about this *today*, and I played Reach's campaign on release 12 years ago...
    Me reading this topic: TIL Reach had a main villain at all.
        The main villain is the Covenant. OP is high.
            Maybe antagonist is a better word
BOB elites were Silent Shadow before Silent Shadow, wish they made them as such.
    Someone will mod it as such I‚Äôm sure.
Yep, he and his Zealot Brothers were apart of the Devoted Sentries (a group tasked with hunting down Forerunner Artifacts) and unlike the majority of the Covenant forces, Field Marshals served the Ministry of Fervent Intercession rather then the Ministry of Resolution.

Also Field Marshalls are extremely rare and few in number the fact that there's only 2 during Reach's campaign (3 if you count BOB on Sword Base) shows how high ranking and important they are, I assume there's only one Field Marshal per fleet and the one in Lone Wolf arrived with the Fleet of Particular Justice.
    Wow yeah thanks for the knowledge by the way. That‚Äôs dope stuff. I knew they were pretty darn rare but I forgot the rarity versus an entire battle group haha. I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be more than a handful per group. Stuffs crazy.
Honestly I bet 343 don‚Äôt even know what this thread is about‚Ä¶
>In the end, he still helped Reach fall. He helped his side win, and his actions are even what kills Six.

Six is just waiting for the evac Pelican.
    In his cave‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ fuck yeah dude
This franchise was ripe with spin off potential but all we got were new galaxy ending mega threats everytime
This franchise was ripe with spin off potential post reach but all we got were new galaxy ending mega threats everytime
Not happening since Halo is a T rated series now. Unless you aren't facing humans, then I guess it could still work.
Yes if you do the skip it's really easy to catch up to the running zealot
That's because most "bosses" in Bungie Halo games aren't actually bosses, not in the traditional sense. The only actual boss fights are in Halo 2 and 3, which are against Scarabs(if you consider a boss), Regret, and Tartarus.

The "fight" against Regret is just boarding his hover chair and beating him to death. Tartarus though is an actual fight. In fact, he's almost definitely the hardest and most bullet sponge boss in Halo.

Edit: Forgot about the fight against Guilty Spark in Halo 3.

Edit 2: Somehow forgot another boos fight against the Heretic. I have no idea how I‚Äôm forgetting these things.
    Don't forget Guilty Spark. He is the only proper boss in H3 outside of scarabs which are debatable
        Oh yeah. Can't believe I forgot about that.
            Also the Heretic Leader in Halo 2
    Heritic boss is a boss fight.
        How the fuck am I forgetting these things!?
These boss fights in infinite seem weird and out of place
That's because it is
Elite: **chokes Six** 

Six: **punches Elite** 

Elite/Six: ‚ÄòHarder.‚Äô 

Elite/Six: ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô
Yep. My fave design!
What chills me is that this guy saw who was splicing wires and fixing shit in Winter Contingency. 

He knew who to go for.
He's basically the Covenant equivalent of us, so in theory even his record is top secret and redacted in the Covy info network.
His name is Jim
No, that guy wasn‚Äôt.
To be fair:

This guy is one of the ranking officers of the whole operation to destroy Reach. Considering anyone else his equivalent rank was killed when the Long Night of Solace was sent to oblivion, this elite is certainly the highest ranking officer who commanded for the whole campaign.

And, he probably was the top officer of specifically the ground campaign
    > Considering anyone else his equivalent rank was killed when the Long Night of Solace was sent to oblivion

The main fleet offensive didn't even arrive until the end of Long Night of Solace. If I remember correctly, the book Fall of Reach, when the 150ish Covenant ships show up, is the same moment as the end of Long Night of Solace, where you're falling into orbit and Dot is repeatedly reporting multiple Covenant ships detected moments after you blew up the one, single carrier. That's when Thel's fleet arrived and Thel definitely outranked this Field Marshall, at the time.
        Indeed, everyone who arrived in the Fleet of Particular Justice missed a decent part of the campaign though
It‚Äôs possible, but this Zealot came with the Devoted Sentries, and not with Thel‚Äôs fleet.

Definitely them both being high ranking Zealots adds to that possibility though.
No, Thel was in orbit at the time.
Isn't he one of the only elites in Reach to dual wield Plasma Rifles, or am i misremembering?
    I think some rangers (the jet pack ones) do as well
        Ok, so it looks like the zealots at the end of the game are the ones that [dual wield plasma rifles](https://youtu.be/cBG60IbG4D0?t=1809). The field marshal uses a fuel rod gun. I couldn't find anything else with other elites dual wielding except for [these elite ultra's](https://youtu.be/Uz1aPijTP8c?t=23).
            There is also a Silver Field Marshal on ONI Sword Base that acts as a BOB (which are usually Gold Rangers) and dual wields Plasma Rifles.
                [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBc0JV3VxVA)

Wow, that's interesting! I never knew about this.
            theres some elites on Sword Base that also dual wield on certain difficulties
    He‚Äôs the only enemy who has two weapons and can swap between them - he has a Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword.
    Pretty sure rangers and ultras can too. Fuzzy on officers
No shit, really?!
Yeah, I just saw an elite and figured I'd catch up and end them soon lol

    Ok, so it looks like the zealots at the end of the game are the ones that [dual wield plasma rifles](https://youtu.be/cBG60IbG4D0?t=1809). The field marshal uses a fuel rod gun. I couldn't find anything else with other elites dual wielding except for [these elite ultra's](https://youtu.be/Uz1aPijTP8c?t=23).
        There is also a Silver Field Marshal on ONI Sword Base that acts as a BOB (which are usually Gold Rangers) and dual wields Plasma Rifles.

Wow, that's interesting! I never knew about this.
        theres some elites on Sword Base that also dual wield on certain difficulties
He‚Äôs the only enemy who has two weapons and can swap between them - he has a Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword.
Pretty sure rangers and ultras can too. Fuzzy on officers
Fun fact, he is the only ‚Äúfield marshal‚Äù elite that appears throughout the entire campaign, as far as I‚Äôm aware. If you test it without the noob combo on heroic or legendary, his shield strength is ridiculous
    The last Elite that appears in 6's *death scene* is *also* a field Marshall, but I doubt he has any importance since his screentime is like 0.5 seconds long and *you can't even tell he's a field marshall unless you mod the game.*
        Or look at his armor.

It has been confirmed that he stalks Noble Team for the entire game.

He is the Elite that got away in Winter Contingency, the one who shot Kat, his squad was the one that took out Emile and he was the final "boss" of the game (not including Lone Wolf)

He is definitely important. He is the enemy that gets the most screen time throughout the game and he killed one member of Noble Team and his actions led to the death of another.
            ... I know. Re-read my comment.

The original post and the person I responded to are talking about the Field Marshall that appears in Winter Contingency and *dies* in Pillar of Autumn.

I'm talking about *another* field marshall that appears in Noble 6's death scene, which happens in Lone Wolf, which takes place after Pillar of Autumn, which is when the Field Marshall that killed Kat dies by the hand of Noble 6. 

Re-read my original comment with this context in mind.
                Which-wich Witch!
            He didn‚Äôt take out Emile. He was there, but it was just an ordinary zealot, which Emile managed to turn around and stab before dying
                Reread the comment.
            I‚Äôm pretty sure the elite you‚Äôre talking about in the end that kills noble 6 is what we now know as ‚Äúthe arbiter‚Äù he was the main elite in charge of the invasion of reach and eventually chased the pillar of autumn to the first halo
            Where is this confirmed? One of the books or comics?
        Ah gotcha, I more so meant the only one that appears in the campaign GAMEPLAY really, but that‚Äôs cool! I don‚Äôt think I ever really noticed. It‚Äôs pretty cool/interesting that they are showing the higher ranking elites getting Spartan kills
    That part on LASO was‚Ä¶ interesting.
        Interesting it putting it lightly.
    There's also a white field marshal on sword base legendary I'm pretty sure
    This is how I wish they would have handled bosses in infinite. The bullet sponge shit really annoys me because it doesn't fit the rules of gameplay and is just difficult to be difficult. At least the badass elite is reach still has to follow the normal gameplay rules.
Could also swear it was a jackal
    I mean unless they updated it in MCC, because my brain was not happy when I googled it and it was the elite lmao
        Tempted to boot up my 360 now.
            This could just be a false memory. I watched another video from 11 years ago and it was the elite. I‚Äôm losing my sanity
                Ever look into the halo Mandela effect? I guess we found another example of it.
                WAIT THIS WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A JACKAL TOO
                    Don‚Äôt do this to me, I already feel crazy üòÇ
                    Jackal snipers are the meme
https://youtu.be/Nl6VJyvI398

It's kinda hard to see but I think it's an elite
    Lol I couldn't see it at all. But I'm sure if you pause a high rez video it's there.
        Yeah I had to pause and zoom in. I'm not 100% sure it's this exact elite but it doesn't look like a jackal
Youre incorrect that it's a rank only obtained posthumously,partially because the rank itself is used in quite different manners depending on the country,some just literally giving it to their presidents,and partially because there has been living generals promoted to Feild Marshall.

Unless you're talking specifically about halo lore,in which case this is irrelevant.
I'm down with Chester.

Forevermore shall he be known as Chester.

It would have been so cool if this elite WAS the Arbiter
Eh, that line about light is more just to give her some room and have him stop looking over her shoulder. Spartans actually have the ability to see in low light. As for the elevator, there's no time to take the stairs, they're hundreds of stories high. There also didn't look to be any stairs but that point is moot.

Edit: I‚Äôd also like to add that night vision would‚Äôve made it harder to see as there is plenty of light in that scene.

Their faceplates can also enhance what they‚Äôre looking at.
    If they can see in the dark then carter shouldnt have told noble six to turn on night vision and say "cant see a thing" lol
        Yep this peice of lore has always been bullshit to me because in the games, we use flashlights for dark places.
            Gameplay != lore. Visors are supposed to be able to adjust according to light levels but we'll still get our screens flash banged by an explosion. It's not bullshit, just one of the many examples where gameplay doesn't follow lore.
                I mean I assume the visors are a bit like current day nvgs in that it takes them a second to adjust so you can still get affected by sudden light changes
                An example of lore making up bullshit.
            Tbf most of these places arnt just low light that are almost no light
It's a lot easier to figure out which wires are which when you can see the colors, versus highlighting them all nice and green.
Reach is still doomed regardless, but killing him might‚Äôve held it off or allowed some to escape, like Jun.
    That would've been bad writing, plain and simple.

That Jun is the only one that lives is making it so that the death toll is not *too* exaggerrated. It's more feasible to say that there were heavy casualties, but some managed to slip through.

The presence of this Elite wouldn't have mattered either way to the survivability of these Spartans; they would have died to something or somebody else. 

That's how stacked the odds were against Reach. It's just a cool little easter egg for those who want to notice, which is likely why this Field Marshall has little to zero presence in the campaign, or even has a name.
 Butterfly effect.
The main villain is the Covenant. OP is high.
    Maybe antagonist is a better word
Oh yeah. Can't believe I forgot about that.
    Also the Heretic Leader in Halo 2
How the fuck am I forgetting these things!?
