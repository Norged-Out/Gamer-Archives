[[What weapons do you love (because the way it looks, functionality or any other reason) but are terrible in-game]]





Basically all of Reach's weapons look really cool but are so underpowered I have to wonder when the fun police raided them.

For me personally, I loved the ODST SMG, it just had a nice sound, was silenced and had a scope but it was pretty rare so you couldn't really use it that much, and it was nearly always outperformed by the Assault Rifle which was so much easier to find ammo for as well.
    This, almost every non-power weapon in reach feels overshadowed by the DMR and the needle rifle.  


and you find the ODST SMG on every supply cache in mombasa streets, i used that gun a lot
        Like even some power weapons felt garbage in Reach. The Spartan Laser just felt like a laser pointer compared to the one in 3 and 4, and the Concussion rifle that is so lethal in the hands of an Elite or Brute but basically does nothing when you get hold of it...

And I know the Supply caches always have it, and I grab it when I can, but most of the time I won't have acess to one.
            Lately the focus rifle has grown on me I somehow god really good with it, and its a more forgiving sniper rifle if not a good way to tell someone to fuck off out of the sight lines
                The focus rifle was also a lot easier to use close range for me compared to the human sniper rifle. Kinda use it like a sentinel beam when not scoped in.
            I always thought that because of the time the elites had better shields than we did and they were a stronger force on reach
    There is a playlist in MCC where all the precision weapons are treated as power weapons. Is an amazing how different the game is with less precision weapons.
    If you have the MCC on PC, Reach Mythic Overhall buffs all the bad weapons. Every single weapon has a place, crouching removes bloom too so the plasma repeater takes its rightful place as a weapon on terror
    For some of them, oh yea, but there were a good bit of weapons that slapped hard. 

I got a ton of kills with the grenade launcher, concussion rifle, and plasma launcher.
    I feel like that game should have had regular SMGs and m6c magnums laying around with only your starting special forces ODST weapons being customized. That way you could gather ammunition from the field but there was a little incentive for holding on to your upgraded equipment.
CE Needler... Man I love the needler but yikes.

Also Reach's Plasma Launcher and Focus Rifle. Both of them can work but they are easily among the weakest in their respective roles.

The Launcher is slow and easy to avoid, and sometimes the lock-on calls in sick. You're better off with the rocket or grenade launcher or laser or fuel rod gun. Same with the Focus Rifle, the sniper is a better sniper and weapons like the DMR and Needle Rifle outclass it in mid-to-close range.

Again both of them work if you're short on options but if you have options its hard to pick those two unless you happen to REALLY like them.
    Tbf the focus rifle it's just a reskin of the sentinel beam, it looks good though
        The focus rifle overheats faster which makes it not as effective for close quarters. I liked the sentinel beam better tbh.
            It’s not supposed to be close quarters. Also keep in mind it’s stronger against flesh and armor than it is shields. Unshielded opponents die quick to it
        I like to refer to focus rifle as the Kamehameha rifle
    Reach plasma launcher was more an anti vehicle weapon, but I remember on the beta it did absolutely shred Spartans. All in all I prefer his evolution jn h5, the plasma caster.
    Explain the CE needler? Is it cause the firerate and the projectiles are slow?

I felt that every iteration of the needler afterwards until 4 wasnt as good.
        im assuming it has to do with the fact that the CE needler has a slow projectile travel and there’s sometimes a delay before the super combine activates on an enemy
            My counter argument: Setting off grenade chains and hitting someone with multiple supercombines is **really** funny.
        Too easy to dodge the needles in MP.

It's pretty good in campaign though.
        Okay I was exaggerating a touch for the needler, it's not bad but I still think its the worst weapon in CE by default (all the other guns are better).

The problem is slow firing and slow projectile speed plus low damage outside of supercombines. It isn't very common and it has AWFUL ammo efficiency.

It takes the same ammo and time to take down a single grunt as it does to take down an elite. And it barely works against jackals and hunters. And its a waste to use its ammo on weak enemies like flood forms and grunts.

Yeah its fun!! Very fun! I love the needler (and all alien weapons if it wasn't obvious from my comment up there). But its fun kinda comes at the cost of effectiveness. It's really only good for elites and nothing else.

On easier difficulties, go nuts. On harder ones, why would you pick up a needler over anything else?
            I always used the needler as to deal with elites since you dont waste ammo needing to break shield to super combine. 





Honestly your secondary should cover the needler's weaknesses, there's no shortage of plasma pistols/rifles to get around jackals and deal with grunts.
                As I mentioned in my parent comment (in reference to the Reach guns but still), none of these weapons are Bad they are just the worst options. **Your worst choice can still be good**, there is just better options.

Yeah the needler *works*, and using a secondary to cover your primary's weaknesses is Halo Combat 101.

But why use the needler -which is only good against elites- with a plasma pistol secondary... When you could just use a magnum with a plasma pistol secondary? Magnum kills elites, and also grunts, jackals, hunters, and every flood form, and carries more ammo.

...Unless you just like the needler better. Which is all the reason you need! We play games because they're fun! Efficiency is great and all but I must stress again: your worst option can still be good and viable.
    Almost every weapon in CE's sandbox next to the Magnum lol
Halo 3 SMG.

I love duel wielding them.

Halo 2 Magnum

I love duel wielding them.

Halo 3 Maulers

I love duel wielding them.
    Upvote because the Mauler was mentioned
        Mauler very fun.  Two is like 5 times the carnage a normal shotgun can cause.
            I always had fun with dual mini shotguns, just like using snakeshot revolvers in cod. I love the aesthetic of dual wield boomsticks
                You should check out Marathon 2 and Infinity. 

Once you get the WSTE-M5s (waste ‘em) I never use anything else.
            Ode to the WSTE-M5
                I love that gun in D2.  Best shotgun in it and Marathon.
                    Yes!! The Bungie 30th event was great. Had me hooked on Destiny for awhile again haha.
                        Same.  It was great for a while.
    First I hear about the Mauler being terrible! Every time I see someone with one on MCC I keep my distance.
        Very similar to the infinite shotgun(the bullfrog?)

They were the only gun I enjoyed dual-wielding
    Halo 3 maulers were so fun
    Oh man, going from CE pistol to H2 pistol was a shock when it came out. So underpowered, so disappointed.
    Forgot about the duel wield smgs
        No.
    It would be nice if they did dual wielding in a way that felt good, I was always frustrated by the way your bullets turn into silly putty once you pick up two guns.

Like a severe accuracy reduction but no damage reduction to turn your automatics into near shotguns levels of CQB efficacy would be sick, and maybe make it so if you crouch and stand still they regain all their accuracy for some interesting tactical trade-offs. Also you should be able to double holster them instead of dropping one.

The potential to outplay and shred a vehicle while close range dual wielding would feel great, but without accuracy they would still fill a utility role and be inferior to single-wielding in most 1v1 combat
        That... sounds very un-Halo.  Even more un-Halo than what 343 is doing.  Congratulations on that.

Also, where are you getting this damage reduction thing from?  I don't think that is a thing.
            I’ve seen people quote exact values before but I’m unable to find them now and I don’t know if they were accurate then. Just a lot of forums of people discussing how they feel to use. Obviously when the reticule isn’t giving you information it can be hard to tell what’s fewer shots hitting due to accuracy reduction and what’s fewer damage per hit due to damage reduction. It feels very similar if you aren’t familiar with engaging at a variety of distances.

[This wiki](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Dual_Wielding) acknowledges there’s a reduction in damage and accuracy, but also says the two guns still give more firepower than single-wielding. As it doesn’t give any hard numbers we should assume it comes from a fairly experienced players personal experience and judgement.

It does say there was no damage reduction in halo 2 which I didn’t know

I see what you mean about movement and crouch increasing accuracy being very un-halo

I did see somebody say 5 shots to kill halo 3 pistol and 8 shots duel wielding halo 3 pistol. If you’re firing both at the same time that’s a *time* difference of one shot(since with dual you’re firing twice simultaneously 4 units of time to get to 8hits compared to 5 units of time to get to 5 hits). So it’s important how significant the accuracy decrease is, if it makes you miss one shot it’s the same time to kill if you miss two shots it’s a slower time to kill(and missed shots here isn’t a measure of skill but of effective distance)
            They definitely lower the damage of guns if you dual wield them. Smgs would absolutely shred everything otherwise. They ended up having to lower the damage for balance reasons which kinda sucks but I guess they felt they had to. Also according to lore Smgs shouldn’t even have recoil in the hands of a Spartan but whatever.
        Technically Spartans should have no recoil from smgs due to their armor helping stabilize the weapon.
            Maybe if they are holding it with two hands or against their shoulder, but the recoil from one-handing an smg is a lot of shake and slip within the hand and grip and small hand motions, it makes less sense to me for the armor to stabilize that
                Lore wise it is supposed to. They can flip tanks with their armor. Their armor would have no problem stabilizing small arms fire. Maybe a rocket launcher is a bit different or a minigun. Not even sure the warthog fully stabilized the minigun. In fact the suit would help them aim too if I remember right.
                    Aaah, that makes sense
    I think, just to be assholes, they should have made the swords dual wielding.
The SMG from halo 2 and 3. The side mags was so cool looking and dual wielding always made me feel like a badass
    Dual-wielding them in 2 makes them worth using. A lot of smaller weapons you can do that with tended to somewhat suck by themselves.
The spiker is a vibe and I miss it
    Agreed. Something about having two battleaxe sized blades on the bottom of a gun really appeals to me
        One of the reasons I love the Mangler so much. Infinite's very own Saber-toothed Gun
            Yes it's basically a mauler without the spread. I'm so glad it's back to a 1 shot+melee again it makes me think of Halo 3.
            too bad it's so slow to fire
                I mean, it *is* a revolver. I don't expect it to have a hair trigger or incredibly high ROF.
                    Yea but it could be boosted by 10-20%. Right now it's so slow, it makes the weapon uncompetitive. Its damage output over time is dwarfed by virtually everything else except the plasma pistol.
                        It's a three shot kill, or one with melee. It feels fine where it is.
                            I think it's pretty unforgiving. You miss a single one of those shots, and you're going to lose to every other gun in the game, even if they miss a few too.
    I’m honestly disappointed it’s not in infinite because the Banished spiker seen in cutscenes in HW2 looked sick.
Ravager, kinda.

It looks awesome as hell and something that can punch through walls, but it's weak. However, if used with its charge up ability and then it's spam fire it can chew through a lot of stuff, ammo management would be the issue and I guess timing.
    I find it funny that the upgraded version in the campaign is worse than the default ravager
        Exactly, feels like a full rod cannon but weaker
    The ravager is very, very far from terrible.

I would argue it’s better than the infinite AR which is already a good weapon
        True to that, it feels underpowered at first but in firefight it slaps, that's where I realized it's true potential
    Nah, eavager is broken: one burst and the entire shields are stripped, you can then follow up with a melee or swap for a kinetic and finish the kill. The supercharge shot on a direct hit will damage till half HP (orange bar) and DoT, while not really effective outside some niche scenarios (someone corner camping or some nades left over in the ground), is still a valuable tool. Also, if somebody didn't know, the DOT for some reason will hurt the spartan inside a vehicle.
        Adding on to this: It's two bursts to kill if all shots hit. Don't know why you're downvoted, you're right.
            I feel like I see complaints about both the Ravager and Commando almost daily around here and it's entirely because the person complaining doesn't know how to use the weapons in question.
        I like to supercharge when pushing ground or peeking corners in btb, makes them hide, gets you some area control, and allows ally’s to follow up easily
        It's solid in Husky Raid but not much else.
    I've actually developed a new appreciation for the Ravager in the last week or two. I've had tons of success with it in 1v1, 1v2, and even 1v3 engagements. Usually can get away with a kill or two in larger groups before going down or having to retreat.

Now at release is a different story. Gun was straight busted back then, entirely useless.
Halo 2 magnum. Weak af, but fast fire rate make brain go *brrrrrrrrr*
The SMG. They did so little damage in 2 and 3 they almost weren’t worth picking up unless you dual wielded, but then you couldn’t throw grenades without dropping one. But damn was it cool to dual wield
The sniper rifle. I know it’s good I’m just bad at it. It looks so awesome
Concussion rifle. When I’m holding it it’s like the gun equivalent of a pillow fight. When a sangheili ultra has it it may as well be a mini SpankR
I loved the repeater wit bottomless clip because it was basically a mini gun
    It was also funny because if you hold down the trigger long enough, the reticle continues to bloom until it reaches maximum size before looping back around to its starting size, yet continuing to grow and grow. Then when you vent it, the reticle will rapidly shrink in the same fashion.

It's strictly a visual glitch but still somewhat amusing.
most of the bungie weapons that had some sort of visual indicator of its ammo or overheating besides of the HUD, even the spiker got his cannon red hot once you were shooting it for too long
    i miss this to be honest
        Cindershot has a decent system for this with its on-weapon display.
Halo 3 fire grenades
    Fire is a very underused weapon type in Halo, it was really cool to use the flamethrower against the Flood, too bad the *projector* part of defoliant projector got worse since WWII
Aut of my memory: AR in CE on legendary, you could drop an entire mag over an elite and still need to melee him.
Concussion rifle in both reach h4, especially in h4.
The sword on kegendary when not fighting the flood... every game.
Silenced smg in odst on legendary, an entire mag to strip a brute from his armor, let's not even discuss if an engineer was around. Sadly is also my preferisco gun in the franchise.
Last but not least, the h2 magnum: it was less of a problem when dual wielded with a plasma pistol, but it was a very rare weapon in the game,  therefore going for a br plus PP was more optimal.
I love the aesthetic of the forerunner weapons in 4. But every time I pick one up I am reminded why I don't pick them up.
    God those pickup animations were on another level
    The supresser being trash hurts me so much. Just turn it into an anti vehicle saw with a super wide bloom with generous bullet ricochet.

Also the scattershot, just give it the boltshot charge turning it into a busted one-shot kill with replusion, but eats the whole clip. Charging it on an expended clip lowers the damage and knock back accordingly.

Others are okay for how they were managed in 4 or fixed in 5.
Why couldn't the plasma carbine look like the repeater. 

343 plasma weapons have abandoned the original design language too long
    I feel like it wanted to incorporate some plasma repeater, but went more towards the carbine, same with the storm rifle. They are going with the original design language, I feel, just not the right one
NEEDLE RIFLE it looks so cool
Why do so many people think the Plasma Repeater is underpowered/bad? I can be quite effective with it!
    They don't burst fire. I've always felt it better in bursts
        Oh, definitely
Halo 3 mauler is leagues better looking than infinite's mangler
    Mauler mentioned, commented upvoted
Best way to use the Plasma Repeater is to treat it like a magnum that can't headshot. You're supposed to use the Plasma Pistol, either by peppering or charging a shot, to eliminate the enemy's shields, then you're supposed to finish them with the repeater, which kills an unshielded opponent in less than a second. 
    Huh, really?

I didn’t think plasma weapons could drain health that fast
        The Plasma Rifle and Plasma Pistol traditionally do a lot of shield damage and low health damage. The Plasma Repeater flipping the script was a confusing paradigm shift but can work well in phase 1 of Invasion. 
            Damn! That makes a lot of sense I always felt like I wasn’t able to make anything happen with the starting elite load outs in invasion
                Yeah, it's basically the Covenant's equivalent to the AR in Reach. I'm pretty sure the shield/health damage numbers are similar, if not identical.
CE Assault Rifle. Weak damage wise, but love the firing sounds!
    Weak? It had the highest DPS in the game
The sniper rifle. I also have an affinity for the plasma pistol
    But the sniper rifle is really good…
        Yes the sniper rifle is god tier however I’m not great with it
Concussion rifle, does good as a weapon but compared to other explosive power weapons it was dog shit
    It was a pretty underwhelming weapon but *god* did I love sending Warthogs into endless barrel rolls with it.
The Pulse Carbine should have just been the Plasma Repeater IMO.
Halo 2 Magnum. While definitely a step-down from the legendary Halo CE one, it looked more realistically-sized for Marines and is a decent dual-wielding Grunt head popper.

If the ammo pool for it was way larger I would dare run dual Halo 2 Magnums through Sacred Icon and Quarantine Zone.
Skewer. It’s dope but I find it incredibly hard to use. But that’s probably a me issue.
Plasma pistol. I liked to dual weild them in the halo three campaign but without overcharging for a headshot, they're bootyhole. But it sounds and looks cool blasting away with them.
Plasma repeater was pretty good in campaign, but multi-player is dominated by precision and power weapons
Ooh, alright let’s see:

\-Halo Reach concussion rifle, cool design but I wish it had even more of a punch. I try to not use it unless I’m out of options.

\-Halo Reach grenade launcher, grenade launchers are really fun in other games but I wish it had more of a punch or damage spread in Reach.  
\-Halo 3 mauler- the sound is SO satisfying but ammo is hard to come by and there’s usually better alternative.
Bring. Back. The. Spartan. Laser.
    The halo 3 spartan Laser
For me the ravaged, easily my favorite halo infinite weapon design just not worth picking up.
Man, Plasma Repeater should have just been an LMG style weapon for the Covenant. It would have probably been way more effective and it's a shame because it's a damn great looking gun. Same with the Concussion Rifle in Reach, it's really bad but looks SO cool.
Plasma repeater would have made a fun Nerf revolver, but alas I doubt we will see any new Halo blasters any time soon
I love Infinite’s Hydra. But it’s a fucking magnum with a rocket attached. One entire cylinder of ROCKETS to kill a brute when the BR takes one burst to the head to kill. Awful for a launcher. 

Same with the Railgun from 4, it’s awful to play with but a sick looking gun. I hate guns that have hold-charges and then auto-release. It doesn’t even have a scope.
The Spikers, Plasma Repeater, Halo 3 SMG, Halo 3 Assault Rifle, Halo 3 ODST SMG, the Mauler, and the Focus Rifle are favorites of mine. I hate how the meta is pretty much just precision weapons with power weapons playing second fiddle to weapons like the BR and DMR.

Give me more options to have fun with that just headshot weapons.
I havent played infinite for some time but i loved the pulse carabine, it had a certain range where shots tracked perfectly and with only two burst you destroyed shields, so you could just have your secondary up before popping their shields
Scarab gun. Other wise, id say H2 needler. Dueling those was always fun. And the sound was insane if the shots were staggered.
Covenant Carbine all the way
I love the way the plasma rifle looks and sounds so much that I'll use it in every game it's in even though it's usually pretty shit (except against Flood).
Spiker only works when you dual wield it; two spikers shred and out range and out dps the smgs.
I hated the plasma repeater. The og plasma rifle is so much more nostalgic and a cooler weapon overall.
Halo 3 brute shot and spartan need to return. 
I need my laser pointer of doom back
man the repeater was such a fun weapon when you just didn't give a damn... taking down sweaty dmr tryhards in a successful ambush always felt nice.
Halo Reach Plasma Rifle. Decent but no reason to use it over the Reach Plasma Pistol especially because it's rarer than usual in that game.
Plasma rifle. 

You’re better off (tactically) with an overcharged plasma pistol, but I got that Sangheili in me and wanna give em a chance.
Halo 3 Mauler.

It’s not necessarily bad, but it wouldn’t do the Infinite sandbox the most amount of favours either. It was essentially the Shotgun, but one-handed. We already have the Bulldog & a Double-Barrel on the way, so the Mauler would be more or less obsolete, unless appropriately balanced, or dual-wielding was reimplemented.
Halo 2 pistol and shotgun. They’re so much weaker than their counterparts in other games. But I insist on using them every time. I just like a shotgun and a pistol sidearm
Do the spiker and brute shot deal more melee damage? Across Halo 2- Reach
    Brute shot definitely a lot of damage when stacked with a damage from one round. It was basically a shotgun round and melee follow up combo. At least in 3. Don’t think it was in Reach.
Definitely ravager
Plasma rifle is my favorite across the series, combining it with the brute plasma rifle is really satisfying in h2...outside of legendary.
The Plasma Rifle in any Halo that isn’t CE. It was genuinely great in CE, being a very reliable all-rounder in the campaign. Then Bungie decided to hard lock plasma weapons into the shield stripper role (which the plasma pistol is way better at because of the overcharge) and make them suck at actually killing anything. The sound design and aesthetic of the weapon did improve in every with every iteration though, and I miss having that design in the game (the Storm Rifle and Pulse Carbine just don’t hit as hard visually). I just miss the CE version’s effectiveness.
Halo ce: Needler. In campaign it can be useful against elites in tight corridors and flood, so it's not as bad as some of the weapons in the later games, but it sucks in multiplayer. Despite that though I still love how unique the Needler's functionality is and has the most interesting supercombine in the series.

Halo 2: Shotgun. I loved everything about the shotgun in H1, and I like the graphical improvements made to it in h2, but they massacred the weapon's animations and effectiveness. This thing has like less than half the range of the energy sword and in campaign is not worth using on higher difficulties, but the second an enemy uses the Shotgun it becomes a ohk tool of destruction at like 20 meters. Good for shutting down sword users in multiplayer though, but overall it's a massive downgrade from the previous version of the Shotgun.

Halo 3: Spiker. This gun looks cool and has a good reload animation, but as far as effectiveness and mechanics go I find it to be very lacking for a gun that's supposed to fire big ass spikes. It's single wielded DPS is much worse than the AR and SMG despite having far slower projectiles, and doesn't do anything interesting mechanically. Overall this gun is only good when pairing it with either an SMG or Plasma Rifle, but can be easily countered by simply strafing to the left or right thanks to that projectile speed.

Halo 3 odst: ^^^^

Halo Reach: this game is a perfect example of why weapon balance is very important despite what people like to say, but to answer OP's question I'll have to also go with the Plasma Repeater. Cool design, good animations, first weapon in the series with the manual venting mechanic, but it functions as a worst AR and it exist only because of invasion to balance out the statistical advantages the elites had over the Spartans. Dispite being a Plasma weapon it doesn't even deal increased shield damage. 

Halo 4: Can't think of one ATM. The guns that I like are also the ones that are the most effective.

Halo 5: post patch SMG. While I love the original design for the smg I also like it's appearance in H5, but as far as performance goes this gun got hit pretty hard by the 2016 (I think?) balance patch. It wasn't worth picking up over keeping the AR.

Halo Infinite: Disruptor. This gun needs its damage over time back, without it it doesn't stand out much from the Shock Rifle. The campaign version and the variant still have the DOT though. Overall though this game has my favorite sandbox in the series and if it wasn't for that change I probably wouldn't list any of the guns from Infinite.
I’m gonna go with something different and say the Banished Banshee autocannons. As a career halo pilot, I was disappointed, the only time I felt successful in the Banshee was in Firefight where you can at least survive for more than a couple seconds and the shots will handle grunts and jackals while your bomb is recharging

Now for handhelds, the Focus Rifle is one of my favorite weapons but gameplay wise is not very fun to use
I always like the Halo 2 Magnum, it was pretty rubbish all things considered but I liked the firing sound and design. The Halo CE Assault Rifle is a similar case for me.
outside of 5, the plasma rifle. It just shoots too slow and doesn't deal very much damage. % made it a reliable shield stripper and made it good to kill with in a pinch
Bruteshot is my favorite halo weapon, full stop
Looking at a picture of this thing the plasma repeater looks like the worst thing in the world to hold
Halo 2 Battle Rifle, Halo 1 Assault Rifle, Covenant Carbine from halo 3, DMR from Reach. The Shock rifle and Commando Rifle from Infinite.
I love shredding crowds of enemies with dual wield spikers in 3.
Just give me back my plasma rifle and I'll start playing Infinite, simple as.
The Halo 4 and 5 energy swords.  I love their angular beauty.  Better IMO than the earlier games curved design.
    The Halo 5 energy sword was really good in game though
Halo CE Magnum
I'd take a Plasma Repeater and Spiker over a Focus Rifle any day. Now THAT gun felt terrible.
Reach Grenade Launcher. Loved banking nades around corners and detonating them on unsuspecting players. Strong and fun. Also loved the explosive effects it gave off. Wish we’d see a return.
I love the mauler, but I don’t think it is terrible in game.
The Energy Sword in Halo Infinite when its out of gas. I don't know why, but it just feels good to punch things with
 Define terrible? I loved deployables but the green healing one was super fucking broken. Bubble shield felt very unique and depending on the player could be turned against the user
The second Pic melee is literally damn good dual this and I am one man one army
Uncommon choice but the halo 5 binary rifle.

The long, *one shot* kill always felt extremely satisfying to use. The controller vibrated with it, giving it a very tactile and responsive feeling.
The wraith in the books is honestly terrifying. It glasses wherever it lands, literally vaporizes anyone that was standing close to the impact, melts and fuzes to the ground any vehicle caught in the immediate blast, and causes 2nd degree burns to anyone standing within throwing distance. 

But in game it's basically just a big fuel rod gun.
i'm a big fan of all the Promethean weapons from 4. and, of course, the Magnum from CE.
The Focus Rifle. It's a fun laser gun but who actually snipes with it
Man i love using the plasma repeater in halo reach firefight
the calcine disruptor is the coolest looking gun in halo infinite. but the disruptor is terrible .
Some things people sleep on with the plasma repeater is that it actually gave you a circle to help you lead your shots. Reach is the only game to do this.
The Pulse Carbine looks cool but is notorious for being cheeks unless whoever you're shooting at is far away with no cover
    Have you tried pre-firing their peeking?
The only gun I truly think is bad / useless is the M6C in Halo 2. 

Okay for grunts - but should always be replaced with the BR.
Energy sword, looks sick but sucks...u can't even scope in with it or shoot from medium range with it. Only can melee and you can do that without a gun already, no point, literally useless, L creation by Bungie, 343, mc studios all of em
In halo 1, The assault rifle always looks so cool to me but is generally one of the less useful weapons.  Like the pistol is essentially the dmr in halo 1 and happens to be the most useful
The suppressor from halo 4 is an utterly pointless weapon. Its got some of the best animations in the entire series though.
Shotguns and their variants mostly suck, which is really sad.
The repeater is better against flesh than shields. Better to use on anything other than elites. When you do, it shreds. The Reach spiker is kinda the opposite. Better with shields for some reason. If you had both guns, and used the spiker on elites until their shields were out, or on jackal shield gauntlets, and used repeater on them next, or used it on any unshielded opponents, you’ll see just how strong they can be

P.s. keep in mind the repeater is the first weapon we can manually vent. It was a big deal that wasn’t added back until infinite
This, almost every non-power weapon in reach feels overshadowed by the DMR and the needle rifle.  


and you find the ODST SMG on every supply cache in mombasa streets, i used that gun a lot
    Like even some power weapons felt garbage in Reach. The Spartan Laser just felt like a laser pointer compared to the one in 3 and 4, and the Concussion rifle that is so lethal in the hands of an Elite or Brute but basically does nothing when you get hold of it...

And I know the Supply caches always have it, and I grab it when I can, but most of the time I won't have acess to one.
        Lately the focus rifle has grown on me I somehow god really good with it, and its a more forgiving sniper rifle if not a good way to tell someone to fuck off out of the sight lines
            The focus rifle was also a lot easier to use close range for me compared to the human sniper rifle. Kinda use it like a sentinel beam when not scoped in.
        I always thought that because of the time the elites had better shields than we did and they were a stronger force on reach
There is a playlist in MCC where all the precision weapons are treated as power weapons. Is an amazing how different the game is with less precision weapons.
If you have the MCC on PC, Reach Mythic Overhall buffs all the bad weapons. Every single weapon has a place, crouching removes bloom too so the plasma repeater takes its rightful place as a weapon on terror
For some of them, oh yea, but there were a good bit of weapons that slapped hard. 

I got a ton of kills with the grenade launcher, concussion rifle, and plasma launcher.
I feel like that game should have had regular SMGs and m6c magnums laying around with only your starting special forces ODST weapons being customized. That way you could gather ammunition from the field but there was a little incentive for holding on to your upgraded equipment.
Tbf the focus rifle it's just a reskin of the sentinel beam, it looks good though
    The focus rifle overheats faster which makes it not as effective for close quarters. I liked the sentinel beam better tbh.
        It’s not supposed to be close quarters. Also keep in mind it’s stronger against flesh and armor than it is shields. Unshielded opponents die quick to it
    I like to refer to focus rifle as the Kamehameha rifle
Reach plasma launcher was more an anti vehicle weapon, but I remember on the beta it did absolutely shred Spartans. All in all I prefer his evolution jn h5, the plasma caster.
Explain the CE needler? Is it cause the firerate and the projectiles are slow?

I felt that every iteration of the needler afterwards until 4 wasnt as good.
    im assuming it has to do with the fact that the CE needler has a slow projectile travel and there’s sometimes a delay before the super combine activates on an enemy
        My counter argument: Setting off grenade chains and hitting someone with multiple supercombines is **really** funny.
    Too easy to dodge the needles in MP.

It's pretty good in campaign though.
    Okay I was exaggerating a touch for the needler, it's not bad but I still think its the worst weapon in CE by default (all the other guns are better).

The problem is slow firing and slow projectile speed plus low damage outside of supercombines. It isn't very common and it has AWFUL ammo efficiency.

It takes the same ammo and time to take down a single grunt as it does to take down an elite. And it barely works against jackals and hunters. And its a waste to use its ammo on weak enemies like flood forms and grunts.

Yeah its fun!! Very fun! I love the needler (and all alien weapons if it wasn't obvious from my comment up there). But its fun kinda comes at the cost of effectiveness. It's really only good for elites and nothing else.

On easier difficulties, go nuts. On harder ones, why would you pick up a needler over anything else?
        I always used the needler as to deal with elites since you dont waste ammo needing to break shield to super combine. 





Honestly your secondary should cover the needler's weaknesses, there's no shortage of plasma pistols/rifles to get around jackals and deal with grunts.
            As I mentioned in my parent comment (in reference to the Reach guns but still), none of these weapons are Bad they are just the worst options. **Your worst choice can still be good**, there is just better options.

Yeah the needler *works*, and using a secondary to cover your primary's weaknesses is Halo Combat 101.

But why use the needler -which is only good against elites- with a plasma pistol secondary... When you could just use a magnum with a plasma pistol secondary? Magnum kills elites, and also grunts, jackals, hunters, and every flood form, and carries more ammo.

...Unless you just like the needler better. Which is all the reason you need! We play games because they're fun! Efficiency is great and all but I must stress again: your worst option can still be good and viable.
Almost every weapon in CE's sandbox next to the Magnum lol
Upvote because the Mauler was mentioned
    Mauler very fun.  Two is like 5 times the carnage a normal shotgun can cause.
        I always had fun with dual mini shotguns, just like using snakeshot revolvers in cod. I love the aesthetic of dual wield boomsticks
            You should check out Marathon 2 and Infinity. 

Once you get the WSTE-M5s (waste ‘em) I never use anything else.
        Ode to the WSTE-M5
            I love that gun in D2.  Best shotgun in it and Marathon.
                Yes!! The Bungie 30th event was great. Had me hooked on Destiny for awhile again haha.
                    Same.  It was great for a while.
First I hear about the Mauler being terrible! Every time I see someone with one on MCC I keep my distance.
    Very similar to the infinite shotgun(the bullfrog?)

They were the only gun I enjoyed dual-wielding
Halo 3 maulers were so fun
Oh man, going from CE pistol to H2 pistol was a shock when it came out. So underpowered, so disappointed.
Forgot about the duel wield smgs
    No.
It would be nice if they did dual wielding in a way that felt good, I was always frustrated by the way your bullets turn into silly putty once you pick up two guns.

Like a severe accuracy reduction but no damage reduction to turn your automatics into near shotguns levels of CQB efficacy would be sick, and maybe make it so if you crouch and stand still they regain all their accuracy for some interesting tactical trade-offs. Also you should be able to double holster them instead of dropping one.

The potential to outplay and shred a vehicle while close range dual wielding would feel great, but without accuracy they would still fill a utility role and be inferior to single-wielding in most 1v1 combat
    That... sounds very un-Halo.  Even more un-Halo than what 343 is doing.  Congratulations on that.

Also, where are you getting this damage reduction thing from?  I don't think that is a thing.
        I’ve seen people quote exact values before but I’m unable to find them now and I don’t know if they were accurate then. Just a lot of forums of people discussing how they feel to use. Obviously when the reticule isn’t giving you information it can be hard to tell what’s fewer shots hitting due to accuracy reduction and what’s fewer damage per hit due to damage reduction. It feels very similar if you aren’t familiar with engaging at a variety of distances.

[This wiki](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Dual_Wielding) acknowledges there’s a reduction in damage and accuracy, but also says the two guns still give more firepower than single-wielding. As it doesn’t give any hard numbers we should assume it comes from a fairly experienced players personal experience and judgement.

It does say there was no damage reduction in halo 2 which I didn’t know

I see what you mean about movement and crouch increasing accuracy being very un-halo

I did see somebody say 5 shots to kill halo 3 pistol and 8 shots duel wielding halo 3 pistol. If you’re firing both at the same time that’s a *time* difference of one shot(since with dual you’re firing twice simultaneously 4 units of time to get to 8hits compared to 5 units of time to get to 5 hits). So it’s important how significant the accuracy decrease is, if it makes you miss one shot it’s the same time to kill if you miss two shots it’s a slower time to kill(and missed shots here isn’t a measure of skill but of effective distance)
        They definitely lower the damage of guns if you dual wield them. Smgs would absolutely shred everything otherwise. They ended up having to lower the damage for balance reasons which kinda sucks but I guess they felt they had to. Also according to lore Smgs shouldn’t even have recoil in the hands of a Spartan but whatever.
    Technically Spartans should have no recoil from smgs due to their armor helping stabilize the weapon.
        Maybe if they are holding it with two hands or against their shoulder, but the recoil from one-handing an smg is a lot of shake and slip within the hand and grip and small hand motions, it makes less sense to me for the armor to stabilize that
            Lore wise it is supposed to. They can flip tanks with their armor. Their armor would have no problem stabilizing small arms fire. Maybe a rocket launcher is a bit different or a minigun. Not even sure the warthog fully stabilized the minigun. In fact the suit would help them aim too if I remember right.
                Aaah, that makes sense
I think, just to be assholes, they should have made the swords dual wielding.
Dual-wielding them in 2 makes them worth using. A lot of smaller weapons you can do that with tended to somewhat suck by themselves.
Agreed. Something about having two battleaxe sized blades on the bottom of a gun really appeals to me
    One of the reasons I love the Mangler so much. Infinite's very own Saber-toothed Gun
        Yes it's basically a mauler without the spread. I'm so glad it's back to a 1 shot+melee again it makes me think of Halo 3.
        too bad it's so slow to fire
            I mean, it *is* a revolver. I don't expect it to have a hair trigger or incredibly high ROF.
                Yea but it could be boosted by 10-20%. Right now it's so slow, it makes the weapon uncompetitive. Its damage output over time is dwarfed by virtually everything else except the plasma pistol.
                    It's a three shot kill, or one with melee. It feels fine where it is.
                        I think it's pretty unforgiving. You miss a single one of those shots, and you're going to lose to every other gun in the game, even if they miss a few too.
I’m honestly disappointed it’s not in infinite because the Banished spiker seen in cutscenes in HW2 looked sick.
I find it funny that the upgraded version in the campaign is worse than the default ravager
    Exactly, feels like a full rod cannon but weaker
The ravager is very, very far from terrible.

I would argue it’s better than the infinite AR which is already a good weapon
    True to that, it feels underpowered at first but in firefight it slaps, that's where I realized it's true potential
Nah, eavager is broken: one burst and the entire shields are stripped, you can then follow up with a melee or swap for a kinetic and finish the kill. The supercharge shot on a direct hit will damage till half HP (orange bar) and DoT, while not really effective outside some niche scenarios (someone corner camping or some nades left over in the ground), is still a valuable tool. Also, if somebody didn't know, the DOT for some reason will hurt the spartan inside a vehicle.
    Adding on to this: It's two bursts to kill if all shots hit. Don't know why you're downvoted, you're right.
        I feel like I see complaints about both the Ravager and Commando almost daily around here and it's entirely because the person complaining doesn't know how to use the weapons in question.
    I like to supercharge when pushing ground or peeking corners in btb, makes them hide, gets you some area control, and allows ally’s to follow up easily
    It's solid in Husky Raid but not much else.
I've actually developed a new appreciation for the Ravager in the last week or two. I've had tons of success with it in 1v1, 1v2, and even 1v3 engagements. Usually can get away with a kill or two in larger groups before going down or having to retreat.

Now at release is a different story. Gun was straight busted back then, entirely useless.
It was also funny because if you hold down the trigger long enough, the reticle continues to bloom until it reaches maximum size before looping back around to its starting size, yet continuing to grow and grow. Then when you vent it, the reticle will rapidly shrink in the same fashion.

It's strictly a visual glitch but still somewhat amusing.
i miss this to be honest
    Cindershot has a decent system for this with its on-weapon display.
Fire is a very underused weapon type in Halo, it was really cool to use the flamethrower against the Flood, too bad the *projector* part of defoliant projector got worse since WWII
God those pickup animations were on another level
The supresser being trash hurts me so much. Just turn it into an anti vehicle saw with a super wide bloom with generous bullet ricochet.

Also the scattershot, just give it the boltshot charge turning it into a busted one-shot kill with replusion, but eats the whole clip. Charging it on an expended clip lowers the damage and knock back accordingly.

Others are okay for how they were managed in 4 or fixed in 5.
I feel like it wanted to incorporate some plasma repeater, but went more towards the carbine, same with the storm rifle. They are going with the original design language, I feel, just not the right one
They don't burst fire. I've always felt it better in bursts
    Oh, definitely
Mauler mentioned, commented upvoted
Huh, really?

I didn’t think plasma weapons could drain health that fast
    The Plasma Rifle and Plasma Pistol traditionally do a lot of shield damage and low health damage. The Plasma Repeater flipping the script was a confusing paradigm shift but can work well in phase 1 of Invasion. 
        Damn! That makes a lot of sense I always felt like I wasn’t able to make anything happen with the starting elite load outs in invasion
            Yeah, it's basically the Covenant's equivalent to the AR in Reach. I'm pretty sure the shield/health damage numbers are similar, if not identical.
Weak? It had the highest DPS in the game
But the sniper rifle is really good…
    Yes the sniper rifle is god tier however I’m not great with it
It was a pretty underwhelming weapon but *god* did I love sending Warthogs into endless barrel rolls with it.
The halo 3 spartan Laser
Brute shot definitely a lot of damage when stacked with a damage from one round. It was basically a shotgun round and melee follow up combo. At least in 3. Don’t think it was in Reach.
The Halo 5 energy sword was really good in game though
Have you tried pre-firing their peeking?
Like even some power weapons felt garbage in Reach. The Spartan Laser just felt like a laser pointer compared to the one in 3 and 4, and the Concussion rifle that is so lethal in the hands of an Elite or Brute but basically does nothing when you get hold of it...

Damn! That makes a lot of sense I always felt like I wasn’t able to make anything happen with the starting elite load outs in invasion
    Yeah, it's basically the Covenant's equivalent to the AR in Reach. I'm pretty sure the shield/health damage numbers are similar, if not identical.
The focus rifle was also a lot easier to use close range for me compared to the human sniper rifle. Kinda use it like a sentinel beam when not scoped in.
As I mentioned in my parent comment (in reference to the Reach guns but still), none of these weapons are Bad they are just the worst options. **Your worst choice can still be good**, there is just better options.

Yeah the needler *works*, and using a secondary to cover your primary's weaknesses is Halo Combat 101.

But why use the needler -which is only good against elites- with a plasma pistol secondary... When you could just use a magnum with a plasma pistol secondary? Magnum kills elites, and also grunts, jackals, hunters, and every flood form, and carries more ammo.

...Unless you just like the needler better. Which is all the reason you need! We play games because they're fun! Efficiency is great and all but I must stress again: your worst option can still be good and viable.
You should check out Marathon 2 and Infinity. 

Once you get the WSTE-M5s (waste ‘em) I never use anything else.
I love that gun in D2.  Best shotgun in it and Marathon.
    Yes!! The Bungie 30th event was great. Had me hooked on Destiny for awhile again haha.
        Same.  It was great for a while.
Lore wise it is supposed to. They can flip tanks with their armor. Their armor would have no problem stabilizing small arms fire. Maybe a rocket launcher is a bit different or a minigun. Not even sure the warthog fully stabilized the minigun. In fact the suit would help them aim too if I remember right.
    Aaah, that makes sense
I mean, it *is* a revolver. I don't expect it to have a hair trigger or incredibly high ROF.
    Yea but it could be boosted by 10-20%. Right now it's so slow, it makes the weapon uncompetitive. Its damage output over time is dwarfed by virtually everything else except the plasma pistol.
        It's a three shot kill, or one with melee. It feels fine where it is.
            I think it's pretty unforgiving. You miss a single one of those shots, and you're going to lose to every other gun in the game, even if they miss a few too.
