[[My Spartan in Halo Reach's campaign.]]





When you get tossed away by Jorge, floating towards Reach and you hear “slip-space rupture detected.” Straight chills every time.
    That is the moment we all knew that, no matter what, the only thing left to do was to try and escape Reach alive.
Still one of the best Halo games imo, seeing my Spartan in the campagin was amazing for teenage me.
    I wish they would expand this feature to other Halo games. I want to be able to play as my multiplayer Spartan in every *Halo* campaign from *Halo: Combat Evolved* to *Halo: Infinite.* Just give us that option to toggle custom Spartans on and off in Campaign. Even *in Halo: CE* and *Halo 2* where we'd only be able to change Master Chief's armor color, I'd still like to see it.
Looks like I need to download mcc again for another reach run.
Reach spartans looks so much better than the MKV core in infinite…

What a game
Reach was my favorite Halo game, just such a good story
Reach had the best color pallet for our Spartans.
The mood of this campaign was absolutely fantastic, I'd love to see our Infinite spartans have some cinematic/story involvement.
