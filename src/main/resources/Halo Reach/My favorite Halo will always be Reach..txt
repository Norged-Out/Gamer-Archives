[[My favorite Halo will always be Reach.]]





Reach was actually the best halo. Best armour customization, my favourite multiplayer time, and the campaign was really good.
    FACTS.
    God... I remember the Reach Edition Game Informer issue, watching the trailers. But that youtube video, Carn√†ge Carniv√†le, I must have watched it 50 times. And boy did it deliver, some of the most fun I've had in multiplayer ever. Invasion, headhunter, infected, incredible custom games, and oh my god some of the fantastic times I had on firefight. The Machinima's, the armor lock rage videos, rating your friends armor, playing the breathtaking campaign. Halo Reach was a beautiful parting gift from bungie, a little rough around the edges sometimes but a solid cornerstone of my mid-late teenage years. Burn Bright, Burn Blue.
    I still prefer the BR over DMR but yeah reach was great... bungie has fallen short in terms of story telling. Destiny 2's "show don't tell" practices are nearly next to 0. Yes, they tell lore from weapons and "books". I can't deny this. Their writing in text form, is amazing

But the cutscenes feel like they were written by middle schoolers who took inspiration from YA books.
    It is actually wild that no other Halo has come close with armor customization. Sure, Halo Infinite has more to offer but considering every armor is locked behind a battle pass and armor no longer has meaning to it since you don‚Äôt complete challenges for it, it just feels empty
    Balance wise tho?‚ò†Ô∏è
    Armor customization doesn't matter in a multiplayer game. Literally doesn't matter at all. You can't beat halo 2, it was genre defining and the most compelling multiplayer experience for years. Halo 2 is the GOAT.
        Your opinion doesn't make his and many others wrong, you can prefer halo 2 and others can prefer which ever halo they enjoyed
            Armor customization is pointless.
                Yeah but, objectively speaking, Halo Reach has more to do‚Ä¶
                    Objectively speaking halo 2 had the greatest multiplayer FPS experience of all time.
                        thats literally your opinion, quit trying to treat your opinion like its fact you absolute tool.
                            he's fighting just like 6 lmao
                                bro is gonna be hiding in the cave
                            Are you actually taking any of this seriously? C'mon dude
                                are *you*? you're the guy who's trying to enforce your opinion like it's a fact. we're all laughing at you big guy
                                    Why is you in those asterisks? You obviously don't know how to use them. And dude are you 13?
                                Don't try to hit the reset button cause you're losing karma you tool.
                                    Oh my goodness gracious that's truly terrible.
                        Okay yeah but that‚Äôs subjective.
                            But I said objective.
                                and you were wrong
                                    No I'm not.
                Pointless to *you*. It‚Äôs my favorite part of any multiplayer game. The most important thing on my list. Also, Reach is just the best Halo game period.
                    No it's not even close halo 2 was near perfect multiplayer,  and if you just wanna customize go play fashion souls or mod BG3.
                just like, your opinion, man
                    The dude does not abide this comment.
                Your vibe rn: https://imgflip.com/i/8iq66n
                    I'm not telling you not to have fun, it's just literally pointless.
                        The point is to have fun, is what we are saying. Some people do not player multiplayer, at all. Consider that with what youve said previously... See where we are going with this?
                            Yeah, that's it's pointless and you agree with me.
                                One of the comments of all time.
                                    I'm glad we are on the same page now.
        Someone give this man a dictionary. Your opinion is subjective not objective
            I'm sorry that you guys take this so seriously, I guess a guy can't have fun around here.
        I wouldn't call instigating as having fun, but some people just wanna see it burn I guess
            Yes because that's what I was doing.
        Armor customization absolutely matters and I‚Äôm tired of pretending it doesn‚Äôt
            I bet you have never pretended. It is pointless though, sorry bud
Reach was the best game, the only reason I play the new games is because it reminds me of Reach.
    Now this is my type of thinking
Peak Halo for sure
    Ehhhh, I donno. The multiplayer wasn't great, and the community fell off for Black Ops by the time Bungie fixed most of the issues people had (like DMR bloom).

I enjoyed the campaign at the time as it was something different than we had in the trilogy but on replay it hasn't aged super well, at least not as well as the big 3. Most of it feels flat or affectless rather than somber imo and some of the VA work... is not good (Carter).
        Respect your opinion; firmly stand that halo reach was peak gaming.


Storywise- I enjoyed the campaign which I played split screen with my brother. Black Ops is a fine game but it didn‚Äôt have the interaction of a squad that I felt from reach. 


Multiplayer was so much fun- I played local with my friends until I got Xbox gold. Custom games was the best and I love big team battle. All the maps being made in forge was a blast (idk I thought whoa this is possible?)


Customization - based.
        Oof. This is proof that just because you think it doesn't mean you gotta say it. 

Multiplayer was absolutely peak. Idk what you're on about this "community leaving for black ops business". That multiplayer was buzzing for like a year straight. 

I mean bro... The numbers are Google-able. In fact Reach got MORE popular once Black ops was out (18th of Nov)

Nov 16: 592,997

Nov 17: 581,158

Nov 18: 566,492

Nov 19: 657,482

Nov 20: 744,015

Nov 21: 694,535

Nov 22: 604,976

Nov 23: 659,385

Nov 24: 713,895

Nov 25: 715,135

Nov 26: 777,063

Nov 27: 791,518
            Numbers can be wonderful
            Yeah there‚Äôs a couple of events called Black Friday and Christmas that occur in November and December.

I‚Äôm not referring to just after the immediate release but over the course of the year. Obviously.

Also a snapshot of 2 weeks of numbers is meaningless.
                Listen bud. I knew to look for the numbers. Let's not play games here about who has the evidence and proper citations.
                    ‚ÄúOut of my ass‚Äù isn‚Äôt a source. Cherry-picking data generally isn‚Äôt seen as good evidence either.

Reach fell not only to Black Ops, but the 2 year old MW2 over the course of 2011. It barely beat out BF3 which came out at the end of 2011.

Halo 3 topped not just 2007 for XBL, but 2008 and 2009 as well.

Reach didn‚Äôt even top Blops the year it came out.

A large part of that is due to the fact CoD had not yet become the juggernaut it did during the MW series, but let‚Äôs not pretend Reach had the same longevity as the original 3.
                        What are we even talking about now? You have no point. 

Stay on topic. You said the community fell off for Black ops. Not who was first or whatever the fuck else you're blabbing about. 

There were plenty of people still playing Reach.
                            Yeah my point is pretty clear as I stated it in my initial comment, not my fault you‚Äôre not keeping up.

Reach MP was not nearly as popular nor did it have as much longevity as previous Halo titles, in favor of the CoD series which absorbed a vast majority of the fps mp marketshare Halo had.

You posted 2 weeks of numbers and want to pretend like thats enough to show that it in fact did not fall off, while mischaracterization my argument as ‚Äúit immediately dropped off a cliff after Blops dropped.‚Äù

Pretty telling you don‚Äôt want to share the granular source data you have.
                        What you‚Äôre doing, other than looking like a muppet, is drawing an illusory correlation between the Halo:Reach player base, the Infinity Ward MW2 player base, and the Treyarch BO player base. You have zero data that even points to players of *both* games picking one over the other. You can‚Äôt even remain consistent in your own flawed logic, your argument that Black Ops launch figures (typically the sharpest of all player counts) being arguably lower than Reach‚Äôs player count in the same period is a meaningless figure makes no sense when you literally believe that the two figures are representative of an overlap of community members - which was an asinine thought to have to begin with.
                            Blops launch figures werent lower than Reach‚Äôs? They beat out Reach for the year and the game launched a month later.

Let‚Äôs not pretend there want a heavy overlap between two of the biggest FPS‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a reason as one went down, the other went up.
                                I said your argument was fallacious and the relationship between the player bases is superfluous. No one cares.
                                    It‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs willful ignorance to pretend otherwise üòÇ
        Terrible take
            Sorry if you grew up on it.

Failed to hit the highs of the OG trilogy and mp strayed too far.

It‚Äôs good but not the best.
Hate the new armors they added in MCC. Reach is goated though.
    remember when the "goofiest" piece of armor was a pilot helmet with no visor and a skull for a face? 

now we have cat ears
        Haunted helmet went HARD
        The cat ears unironically look less goofy than the shit for Chimera, of the many obnoxious armor effects
        I absolutely hate how stupid half the new armor looks. Doesn't help with immersion at all.
            Yeah I‚Äôve seen the new armour and I haven‚Äôt played infinite yet or MCC, (yes I‚Äôm still stuck on reach :P ) the only goofy armour I like is the cat ears
                Reach is the GOAT of Halo
                    YES , MY FAVOURITE JANk MESS
            Immersion begins and ends with my Spartan lmfao IMO the reach battlepass was the best for immersion (especially with cross core now), followed by the Rakshasa release pass. I am heavily enthralled by my ODST build I have been itching for since OG Halo 2 lol Being a Marine/ODST in multiplayer is a dream come true! 

Just wish we could use these Spartans in campaign. This OG Halo 117 clone stuff is doo doo, Reach Campaign did it right!
        Combat Active Tracking  Electronic Activated Radios.

C.A.T. E.A.R
        Will accept no disrespect to cat ears thanks
            For real though, I really don‚Äôt see why there‚Äôs so much dissent for them. For a community that so lovingly embraces bullshit like ‚ÄúArby N the Chief‚Äù or the absurdity of ‚ÄúRed Vs Blue‚Äù, cat ears feel like such a natural splash of comedic baloney for Halo. I can guarantee you if they had been added in the Bungie era that Donut would‚Äôve somehow ended up wearing them because he thinks they‚Äôre some required standard issue component to his armor.
            You will accept the rightful disrespect to cat ears
                Say you‚Äôre sorry or I will ban you
                    You are not sorry and neither am I
                        That‚Äôs it buster
                            Oh yea well my dad works for Microsoft and he's going to ban your account
            Fuck the cat ears.
                Bammed
                Gladly!
        Goofy non canon helmets in halo is one of the worst things about the series, that's a hill I'll die on.
        On one hand, some of the armors pieces in infinite completely clash with the tone and feel of the rest of the series. On the other hand, Cat Ears :3
        y'all are STILL complaining about the cat ears its hilarious lmao
        Holy shit shut up about this!
            those mfs always like "we used to be a country" but they've been mad since you could make spartans pink tbh.
    I hate the new armors, and the loss of the credit system. Game doesn't feel the same, before I felt cool picking and crafting my spartan, and everything look militaristic.
        You can still do that
            Yeah but the immersion died when I saw these over the top armors. I miss how it used to be
                you can literally disable them in MCC

you can ignore them otherwise

you're just looking for a reason to complain.
                    You know it's hard to see my favorite childhood game ruined by another company. 
What can I disable? All custom armor
The thing I don't like is shooting at a freaking cat spartan, shit is stupid. All the original Spartans from reach had some lore behind them as to why they were in the game. Now it's like over the top samurai helms like in the picture above. The only good thing 343 did was update forge. They ruined the cred system. They ruined the armor customization, and they added battle passes. 

Now before you say is just how people look what does it matter to you. Call of duty did the same thing, they went from a military shooter to Now I'm fighting groot, and Nicki Minaj. When I want to play a militaristic shooter I want the immersion to be all about the military. Like when mw 2019 came out, before all the insane updates. But I get it, the stupid shit sells. So we will never go back.
                        you guys still being mad about the cat ears will never not be funny

you can still play the old games, you wanna stay nostalgiablind you totally can
                            Its not the cat ears specifically, but its what pushed the line of what was okay for spartan armor. It is the single thing we can point to that begins the decline of militaristic spartan armor, and its decline of the game studio whoring itself out for money.
                                right, anyways there's a good mix of both in-game for people who like both.
    360 reach was goat. I get my fix from MCC reach now, but it just isn't the same. Not entirely.
Reach is the final Halo Game. And is Top Tier.
 Everything after is a knock-off. The updates to MCC are meh... the ODST armor to your Halo 3 Spartan was dope. The gladiator and other shit are weird. I don't know why 343 insists on having content that isn't friendly to the already existing lore. Even in infinite the Armour are weird as fuck. I don't get it.
    Because people buy it
        Buy it?
            Pay for cat ear cosmetics etc
                yea infinite. i guess i misread acemckickass's post, but i thought he was talking about MCC additional armor not the mtx from infinite.
                That would probably be the only I would by in halo lol
                everything in mcc was earned not able to be bought though?
                    The comment I responded to was talking about Infinite too, idk, I haven't played MCC since before they introduced the season passes
    Gladiator..... So a spartan...
        Spartans Armour are labeled Mjolnir series which indicates its actually Viking. But also. The set a style for lore Armour and it doesn't look like that crazy shit.
    You're complaining about 343 not being friendly to established lore while riding Halo Reach?
        How did Reach go against established lore?
            Isn't it well known that it went against the original Fall of Reach book so much that it had to be rereleased so the story could fit with the game?
                This is from another comment on a post about the canonicity of FoR and H:R, so not sure how accurate it is, but 

No, not at all. This is a horrible misconception which I can't believe still gets brought up. *The Fall of Reach* got re-published in 2010 and a few changes were made to the text. None of these changes had anything to do with *Halo: Reach*. They fixed math errors, contradictions within the book (someone saluting with a hand they just had blown off in the previous scene), and some scientific inaccuracies (regarding stars that actually exist, for example).
                    As someone who read FoR, I'd love to see the old and updated texts side by side so I can see what changed.
                It‚Äôs best to apply tiers of canonicity when it comes to things like this. The original source material format (video games, in Halo‚Äôs case) will override prior content from other formats (like books).
    Infinite is a good halo game
        i mean yeah it‚Äôs fun but they tried with it way too late and the prices for cosmetics are still atrocious
            Totally agree on that end. The microtransactions are a huge problem I have with the game, however- one of the few.
    Ok tbh Infinite is a good game
I miss the modes too. I really enjoyed the generator defense. It was so fun having objectives and the load outs actually made sense in that mode. I also miss playing as elites in all halo games. Halo 2 and reach are what I think of when I think halo.
    Invasion will always be my favorite game mode
The general armor design for all the pieces of armor and characters.Just look so cool and Awesome in reach cool helmet by the way in the picture op never seen that one I think
    They added a bunch of new armor to Reach in MCC. Most of it is goofy but some is pretty cool
Shame we haven‚Äôt gotten another Halo game since :/
    Well... I've seen a lot of good stuff about Halo Wars 2 lol.

But I agree with the premise.  When I finally was able to play Halo 4 for the first time through MCC... it just felt off.  Like, it kinda felt like Halo again when you got to that first big grassy field, but when I played through the second time, I realized that was just the devs gaslighting our nostalgia.  We hardly get any huge open fields, and when we do it's the most fun part of the game.  (Y'know, when you actually have the ammo for the guns that you like to use.)

The armor designs felt off.  Chiefs armor visor looked so crisp, but looking at the armor designs for Spartan 4s makes me think their armor is made out of plastic and the gel-layer looks like bubble wrap.  I don't see what makes a Spartan 4 anything more than an ODST+.  I remember Halsey grafting carbon to Spartan 2 bones.  Spartan 3s were basically bred for suicide missions with basically "Diet-Version Active Camo."

Spartan 4s are just... really well trained?  I mean, Chief vs a Brute hand-to-hand, it's a fair fight.  But it took a handful of ODSTs to take down a Brute hand to hand, and one them nearly bit the dust from doing so.  And now Buck, one of those ODST marines who needed 4 other men to take down a brute is just... now a Spartan because he trained more?  It doesn't feel right.
        I‚Äôm not knocking Halo Wars but it‚Äôs an entirely different game with Halo assets.

Yeah Spartan 4‚Äôs are a joke in comparison to earlier Spartans, I think you‚Äôll enjoy this realistic fight scene:

 https://youtu.be/K2N-RKj0QWw?si=MC53U5y8RghE_VMP

And yeah, 343 stories are undercooked and poorly executed. Interesting how a company named after a bad guy has tanked the series‚Ä¶
            The monitor may be an antagonist but it's not technically a bad guy.  It's job is to make sure the flood don't overrun the galaxy. If the arbiters fleet hadn't glassed that one city on Earth with the flood in it in Halo 3 the humans would have been wiped out. They weren't handling the flood very well.
            well to be completely fair i think most of the poor choices were made by microsoft more than 343 there are definitely some talented devs there as seen with some of the campaign but you are right still doesn‚Äôt compare to classic halo
                Microsoft was also in charge for the first 4 Halo games
                    yeah i know that but they weren‚Äôt as obsessed with money as they are now and they had better leads
        That sounds like you‚Äôre describing Halo 5 though aren‚Äôt you? Ammo problems and weird looking Spartans running around sound like that game.
            Never played past 4
100%, it's literally the best halo and probably the best fps game imo
What is that helmet and how do you get it?
    It's called the Forsaken Dragon helm but I forget which series it was in.
You're goddamn right.
What helmet is this?
    MCC addition, not OG armor
    The Forsaken Dragon helm.
I aim to please
I wish they remastered this one if only for the cut scenes
Warhalo: 40Reach
He is a salamander ready to save humanity.
    Damn right!
        Heck yeah brother!
I always think of this video when i see anything halo reach. (nsfw)
 https://youtu.be/sXasCjUTNpE?si=5gcUfYONQVoCdkCp
    I knew exactly what this was before clicking on it xD
    Wtf did I just watch. Lol
There's something special about making Six whatever you want.
Best game of all time in my opinion
custom games goated
    Any reach firefight mods I should know about? :-)
Same best game, peak of the franchise.
This is the correct answer
finally someone that understands me
I was like 10 when it came out, but my friend and I‚Äôs Dad took us to the midnight release.
Ready...doesn't even.... FUCKING.... DESCRIBE IT!!!!!! (Proceeds to bite boner and snort game disc)
Look I think the new armor is ugly too but we gotta stop with the ‚Äúerm it‚Äôs not lore friendly!!!‚Äù shit. A decade ago we were running around with katanas on our backs and flaming skulls for heads, Halo has had goofy armor choices since Halo 3.
It was great and remember Spartans don‚Äôt die they just go MIA
Reachs cinematic shots and angles were so good in the cutscenes, really made you feel like a soldier on the ground, and my god, the soundtrack is god tier
Is your favorite bridge the London bridge?
Literally just got done playing reach with some guys who never have, I agree. Reach will always be my favorite
AGREED! LOVE MULTI PLAYER
I liked reach. Plus i got to beta test it was pretty cool.
Remember Reach
Idk anything about this game but that armor looks cool
    I live for compliments like this xD
The actual GOAT.
You look like you are about to fight buzz lightyear.
How is it on mcc?
    Great!
Same!!!
I miss playing reach when it first launched. Mcc reach ain‚Äôt the same. Being apart of that community at launch and on was nuts. It felt like halo.
Agreed
It was made with care, with gameplay taking priority
I miss reach üò• I want to go back
Damn strait, the swan song.
Mine too.
True and real
Armor credit system was fucking insanely amazing and we didnt even realize it back then

Back before every cosmetic on the planet costed money.
halo reach was the first game I ever played, and it‚Äôs still my favorite game I‚Äôve ever played
    And also the music is just 10/10
        Funnily enough the composer, Martin O'Donnell, is actually running in Nevada to become House Representative!
So you show armor that's not really from reach.
    This is called an overreaction.  I show one HELM that wasn't from OG reach.  Does that change my opinion about it being my favorite Halo?  No.
The new mcc armors do not belong in any halo game
Wait they added new armor to Reach?
    Just a few helmets, a water bottle for the utility slot, and they added the robot arm to every version of chest-piece.  Part of an update a few years ago.  All the new armor was really given to Halo 3 in that update but just the H3 helmets from that update were also given to Reach, and I'm pretty happy about it.  A lot of the new armor is meh but I really like the 'modernized-for-Spartans' Knight helmet I currently have equipped.
What have you done with my armor
    Just a few... modifications.
What in the Gundam
Eh the bloom, some annoying armor abilities, and lack of a ranked mode still puts it below 2 and 3 for me.

Still better than any 343 game.
Halo 4 is underrated the multi player was amazing
    Halo 4:  Ruined the DMR's ammo reserve & removed the Grenade Launcher

Halo Reach: DMR all day, every day, every mission and has Grenade Launcher.
        The class system was awesome tho and CTF was so fun
How the hell do I customize 6 in the campaign. I swear to god I‚Äôve looked everywhere for like an option but I can‚Äôt find it
    I think you do your customisation from the career menu, been a while since I‚Äôve looked at Reach‚Äôs menuing tho.

But yeah I‚Äôm 87% sure the Spartan you use for multiplayer is Your Actual Six
Neat but why do you have a helium tank in your chest armor
‚ÄúRemember Reach?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could I forget?‚Äù
Hell yea it is and that's my color combo too!
Best forge world, took forge in general to a whole new level! The custom games were also outstanding, community was thriving so bungie was making player made maps into the multiplayer rotation.
nice dark angel cosplay.
My Xbox got the red ring of death right after the title screen. I fixed it twice over the course of 3 months , played tf out of reach, and eventually bought a ps3
Take me back to invasion on Spire ü§§
Is that a modded helmet?
    No
Halo 2>HaloReach. Definitely not a bad game but Halo 2 is the GOAT when it comes to Halo
For me, it goes Halo CE, Reach, ODST, then 4 mostly because It was my first Halo game.
Have you ever played Halo 3?
Reach had some of the best customization, and probably the best multiplayer.. But halo 3 was \*\*\*PEAK\*\*\* Halo for me personally.. Being there thru it all... \*Finishing the Fight\*  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZGGIdpfEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZGGIdpfEM)  


This trailer/website was the PEAK hype. And still gives me chills..
Because bungee knew how to pull the player into the roll of a Spartan by giving you the role as thus the Spartan of the story.
Thank you for changing my life reach
emile getting taking by the flood is my fav!
I say this all the time, too, and I get asked why. 
I always say, "The fact that you're Spartans, but you're not the Legendary Master Chief. No Spartan will ever be Master Chief. It makes sense for us to not survive."
MCC did good putting new customizable in reach
    Personnaly I strongly disagree, all of those new custom don't match the original aesthetic at all.
I mean, why tf we can now see knights and Roman soldiers in a SF game like Halo.

The armors look cool, but for another game like Skyrim or idk

For me, those new custom killed the visual experience of Reach and 3 MP
        you can turn them off
            Except there‚Äôs a bug where holograms still have the new armors, and the post-game carnage report always shows them. Being able to turn them off would be awesome, if it actually worked.
            I do it on Reach but I'm screwed on H3 because I want weapon skins and shield & sword for my back
        I can understand in a sense of them being impractical. They're Spartans in Mjolnir armor. Both of which are based on ancient warriors and mythology. So it doesn't bother me too much if any armor were decorated in a manner that reflects that.
            I can agree on this point but some are really awkward like "skull and hood" or idk how this shit is called or even the helmet on H2A Gundam-like with literally the game logo on the head
                Haven't played in a bit, so I'm sure there are plenty i have yet to see.
        Do you dislike Hayabusa from Halo 3?
            Yeah I don't really like it, but considering the fact it was a secret armor I can eventually "accept" it, but imo, nonsense in this world
    Especially because being a Knight is so my thing, that update was just perfect.

Now if we could get like 5 more firefight maps before they claim they've "finished the fight" for MCC...
        I want one set on an XBOX 360 mother board

A tribute to the console that gave us Reach
Reach was peak. Hate the 343 armor with a passion though. I wish they would have never added that dogshit
I didn't think that was warframe, what are you talking about
This is a joke right?
My favorite halo is destiny
I know you guys aren‚Äôt ready to hear this, but Halo 2 is the best campaign.
    Halo 2 is easily the weakest of the bungie campaigns imo. I dont really have problems with the plot or characters but the gameplay especially in the last half is extremely rushed and the brutes are not fun enemies to fight.
Fuck is that helmet?ü§¢
I had 100% of the armory in the original reach and I don‚Äôt know what that helmet is. Is that a MCC thing? Cause not gonna lie it looks real bad lol.
FACTS.
God... I remember the Reach Edition Game Informer issue, watching the trailers. But that youtube video, Carn√†ge Carniv√†le, I must have watched it 50 times. And boy did it deliver, some of the most fun I've had in multiplayer ever. Invasion, headhunter, infected, incredible custom games, and oh my god some of the fantastic times I had on firefight. The Machinima's, the armor lock rage videos, rating your friends armor, playing the breathtaking campaign. Halo Reach was a beautiful parting gift from bungie, a little rough around the edges sometimes but a solid cornerstone of my mid-late teenage years. Burn Bright, Burn Blue.
I still prefer the BR over DMR but yeah reach was great... bungie has fallen short in terms of story telling. Destiny 2's "show don't tell" practices are nearly next to 0. Yes, they tell lore from weapons and "books". I can't deny this. Their writing in text form, is amazing

But the cutscenes feel like they were written by middle schoolers who took inspiration from YA books.
It is actually wild that no other Halo has come close with armor customization. Sure, Halo Infinite has more to offer but considering every armor is locked behind a battle pass and armor no longer has meaning to it since you don‚Äôt complete challenges for it, it just feels empty
Balance wise tho?‚ò†Ô∏è
Armor customization doesn't matter in a multiplayer game. Literally doesn't matter at all. You can't beat halo 2, it was genre defining and the most compelling multiplayer experience for years. Halo 2 is the GOAT.
    Your opinion doesn't make his and many others wrong, you can prefer halo 2 and others can prefer which ever halo they enjoyed
        Armor customization is pointless.
            Yeah but, objectively speaking, Halo Reach has more to do‚Ä¶
                Objectively speaking halo 2 had the greatest multiplayer FPS experience of all time.
                    thats literally your opinion, quit trying to treat your opinion like its fact you absolute tool.
                        he's fighting just like 6 lmao
                            bro is gonna be hiding in the cave
                        Are you actually taking any of this seriously? C'mon dude
                            are *you*? you're the guy who's trying to enforce your opinion like it's a fact. we're all laughing at you big guy
                                Why is you in those asterisks? You obviously don't know how to use them. And dude are you 13?
                            Don't try to hit the reset button cause you're losing karma you tool.
                                Oh my goodness gracious that's truly terrible.
                    Okay yeah but that‚Äôs subjective.
                        But I said objective.
                            and you were wrong
                                No I'm not.
            Pointless to *you*. It‚Äôs my favorite part of any multiplayer game. The most important thing on my list. Also, Reach is just the best Halo game period.
                No it's not even close halo 2 was near perfect multiplayer,  and if you just wanna customize go play fashion souls or mod BG3.
            just like, your opinion, man
                The dude does not abide this comment.
            Your vibe rn: https://imgflip.com/i/8iq66n
                I'm not telling you not to have fun, it's just literally pointless.
                    The point is to have fun, is what we are saying. Some people do not player multiplayer, at all. Consider that with what youve said previously... See where we are going with this?
                        Yeah, that's it's pointless and you agree with me.
                            One of the comments of all time.
                                I'm glad we are on the same page now.
    Someone give this man a dictionary. Your opinion is subjective not objective
        I'm sorry that you guys take this so seriously, I guess a guy can't have fun around here.
    I wouldn't call instigating as having fun, but some people just wanna see it burn I guess
        Yes because that's what I was doing.
    Armor customization absolutely matters and I‚Äôm tired of pretending it doesn‚Äôt
        I bet you have never pretended. It is pointless though, sorry bud
Now this is my type of thinking
Ehhhh, I donno. The multiplayer wasn't great, and the community fell off for Black Ops by the time Bungie fixed most of the issues people had (like DMR bloom).

I enjoyed the campaign at the time as it was something different than we had in the trilogy but on replay it hasn't aged super well, at least not as well as the big 3. Most of it feels flat or affectless rather than somber imo and some of the VA work... is not good (Carter).
    Respect your opinion; firmly stand that halo reach was peak gaming.


Storywise- I enjoyed the campaign which I played split screen with my brother. Black Ops is a fine game but it didn‚Äôt have the interaction of a squad that I felt from reach. 


Multiplayer was so much fun- I played local with my friends until I got Xbox gold. Custom games was the best and I love big team battle. All the maps being made in forge was a blast (idk I thought whoa this is possible?)


Customization - based.
    Oof. This is proof that just because you think it doesn't mean you gotta say it. 

Multiplayer was absolutely peak. Idk what you're on about this "community leaving for black ops business". That multiplayer was buzzing for like a year straight. 

I mean bro... The numbers are Google-able. In fact Reach got MORE popular once Black ops was out (18th of Nov)

Nov 16: 592,997

Nov 17: 581,158

Nov 18: 566,492

Nov 19: 657,482

Nov 20: 744,015

Nov 21: 694,535

Nov 22: 604,976

Nov 23: 659,385

Nov 24: 713,895

Nov 25: 715,135

Nov 26: 777,063

Nov 27: 791,518
        Numbers can be wonderful
        Yeah there‚Äôs a couple of events called Black Friday and Christmas that occur in November and December.

I‚Äôm not referring to just after the immediate release but over the course of the year. Obviously.

Also a snapshot of 2 weeks of numbers is meaningless.
            Listen bud. I knew to look for the numbers. Let's not play games here about who has the evidence and proper citations.
                ‚ÄúOut of my ass‚Äù isn‚Äôt a source. Cherry-picking data generally isn‚Äôt seen as good evidence either.

Reach fell not only to Black Ops, but the 2 year old MW2 over the course of 2011. It barely beat out BF3 which came out at the end of 2011.

Halo 3 topped not just 2007 for XBL, but 2008 and 2009 as well.

Reach didn‚Äôt even top Blops the year it came out.

A large part of that is due to the fact CoD had not yet become the juggernaut it did during the MW series, but let‚Äôs not pretend Reach had the same longevity as the original 3.
                    What are we even talking about now? You have no point. 

Stay on topic. You said the community fell off for Black ops. Not who was first or whatever the fuck else you're blabbing about. 

There were plenty of people still playing Reach.
                        Yeah my point is pretty clear as I stated it in my initial comment, not my fault you‚Äôre not keeping up.

Reach MP was not nearly as popular nor did it have as much longevity as previous Halo titles, in favor of the CoD series which absorbed a vast majority of the fps mp marketshare Halo had.

You posted 2 weeks of numbers and want to pretend like thats enough to show that it in fact did not fall off, while mischaracterization my argument as ‚Äúit immediately dropped off a cliff after Blops dropped.‚Äù

Pretty telling you don‚Äôt want to share the granular source data you have.
                    What you‚Äôre doing, other than looking like a muppet, is drawing an illusory correlation between the Halo:Reach player base, the Infinity Ward MW2 player base, and the Treyarch BO player base. You have zero data that even points to players of *both* games picking one over the other. You can‚Äôt even remain consistent in your own flawed logic, your argument that Black Ops launch figures (typically the sharpest of all player counts) being arguably lower than Reach‚Äôs player count in the same period is a meaningless figure makes no sense when you literally believe that the two figures are representative of an overlap of community members - which was an asinine thought to have to begin with.
                        Blops launch figures werent lower than Reach‚Äôs? They beat out Reach for the year and the game launched a month later.

Let‚Äôs not pretend there want a heavy overlap between two of the biggest FPS‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a reason as one went down, the other went up.
                            I said your argument was fallacious and the relationship between the player bases is superfluous. No one cares.
                                It‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs willful ignorance to pretend otherwise üòÇ
    Terrible take
        Sorry if you grew up on it.

Failed to hit the highs of the OG trilogy and mp strayed too far.

It‚Äôs good but not the best.
remember when the "goofiest" piece of armor was a pilot helmet with no visor and a skull for a face? 

now we have cat ears
    Haunted helmet went HARD
    The cat ears unironically look less goofy than the shit for Chimera, of the many obnoxious armor effects
    I absolutely hate how stupid half the new armor looks. Doesn't help with immersion at all.
        Yeah I‚Äôve seen the new armour and I haven‚Äôt played infinite yet or MCC, (yes I‚Äôm still stuck on reach :P ) the only goofy armour I like is the cat ears
            Reach is the GOAT of Halo
                YES , MY FAVOURITE JANk MESS
        Immersion begins and ends with my Spartan lmfao IMO the reach battlepass was the best for immersion (especially with cross core now), followed by the Rakshasa release pass. I am heavily enthralled by my ODST build I have been itching for since OG Halo 2 lol Being a Marine/ODST in multiplayer is a dream come true! 

Just wish we could use these Spartans in campaign. This OG Halo 117 clone stuff is doo doo, Reach Campaign did it right!
    Combat Active Tracking  Electronic Activated Radios.

C.A.T. E.A.R
    Will accept no disrespect to cat ears thanks
        For real though, I really don‚Äôt see why there‚Äôs so much dissent for them. For a community that so lovingly embraces bullshit like ‚ÄúArby N the Chief‚Äù or the absurdity of ‚ÄúRed Vs Blue‚Äù, cat ears feel like such a natural splash of comedic baloney for Halo. I can guarantee you if they had been added in the Bungie era that Donut would‚Äôve somehow ended up wearing them because he thinks they‚Äôre some required standard issue component to his armor.
        You will accept the rightful disrespect to cat ears
            Say you‚Äôre sorry or I will ban you
                You are not sorry and neither am I
                    That‚Äôs it buster
                        Oh yea well my dad works for Microsoft and he's going to ban your account
        Fuck the cat ears.
            Bammed
            Gladly!
    Goofy non canon helmets in halo is one of the worst things about the series, that's a hill I'll die on.
    On one hand, some of the armors pieces in infinite completely clash with the tone and feel of the rest of the series. On the other hand, Cat Ears :3
    y'all are STILL complaining about the cat ears its hilarious lmao
    Holy shit shut up about this!
        those mfs always like "we used to be a country" but they've been mad since you could make spartans pink tbh.
I hate the new armors, and the loss of the credit system. Game doesn't feel the same, before I felt cool picking and crafting my spartan, and everything look militaristic.
    You can still do that
        Yeah but the immersion died when I saw these over the top armors. I miss how it used to be
            you can literally disable them in MCC

you can ignore them otherwise

you're just looking for a reason to complain.
                You know it's hard to see my favorite childhood game ruined by another company. 
What can I disable? All custom armor
The thing I don't like is shooting at a freaking cat spartan, shit is stupid. All the original Spartans from reach had some lore behind them as to why they were in the game. Now it's like over the top samurai helms like in the picture above. The only good thing 343 did was update forge. They ruined the cred system. They ruined the armor customization, and they added battle passes. 

Now before you say is just how people look what does it matter to you. Call of duty did the same thing, they went from a military shooter to Now I'm fighting groot, and Nicki Minaj. When I want to play a militaristic shooter I want the immersion to be all about the military. Like when mw 2019 came out, before all the insane updates. But I get it, the stupid shit sells. So we will never go back.
                    you guys still being mad about the cat ears will never not be funny

you can still play the old games, you wanna stay nostalgiablind you totally can
                        Its not the cat ears specifically, but its what pushed the line of what was okay for spartan armor. It is the single thing we can point to that begins the decline of militaristic spartan armor, and its decline of the game studio whoring itself out for money.
                            right, anyways there's a good mix of both in-game for people who like both.
360 reach was goat. I get my fix from MCC reach now, but it just isn't the same. Not entirely.
Because people buy it
    Buy it?
        Pay for cat ear cosmetics etc
            yea infinite. i guess i misread acemckickass's post, but i thought he was talking about MCC additional armor not the mtx from infinite.
            That would probably be the only I would by in halo lol
            everything in mcc was earned not able to be bought though?
                The comment I responded to was talking about Infinite too, idk, I haven't played MCC since before they introduced the season passes
Gladiator..... So a spartan...
    Spartans Armour are labeled Mjolnir series which indicates its actually Viking. But also. The set a style for lore Armour and it doesn't look like that crazy shit.
You're complaining about 343 not being friendly to established lore while riding Halo Reach?
    How did Reach go against established lore?
        Isn't it well known that it went against the original Fall of Reach book so much that it had to be rereleased so the story could fit with the game?
            This is from another comment on a post about the canonicity of FoR and H:R, so not sure how accurate it is, but 

No, not at all. This is a horrible misconception which I can't believe still gets brought up. *The Fall of Reach* got re-published in 2010 and a few changes were made to the text. None of these changes had anything to do with *Halo: Reach*. They fixed math errors, contradictions within the book (someone saluting with a hand they just had blown off in the previous scene), and some scientific inaccuracies (regarding stars that actually exist, for example).
                As someone who read FoR, I'd love to see the old and updated texts side by side so I can see what changed.
            It‚Äôs best to apply tiers of canonicity when it comes to things like this. The original source material format (video games, in Halo‚Äôs case) will override prior content from other formats (like books).
Infinite is a good halo game
    i mean yeah it‚Äôs fun but they tried with it way too late and the prices for cosmetics are still atrocious
        Totally agree on that end. The microtransactions are a huge problem I have with the game, however- one of the few.
Ok tbh Infinite is a good game
Invasion will always be my favorite game mode
They added a bunch of new armor to Reach in MCC. Most of it is goofy but some is pretty cool
Well... I've seen a lot of good stuff about Halo Wars 2 lol.

But I agree with the premise.  When I finally was able to play Halo 4 for the first time through MCC... it just felt off.  Like, it kinda felt like Halo again when you got to that first big grassy field, but when I played through the second time, I realized that was just the devs gaslighting our nostalgia.  We hardly get any huge open fields, and when we do it's the most fun part of the game.  (Y'know, when you actually have the ammo for the guns that you like to use.)

The armor designs felt off.  Chiefs armor visor looked so crisp, but looking at the armor designs for Spartan 4s makes me think their armor is made out of plastic and the gel-layer looks like bubble wrap.  I don't see what makes a Spartan 4 anything more than an ODST+.  I remember Halsey grafting carbon to Spartan 2 bones.  Spartan 3s were basically bred for suicide missions with basically "Diet-Version Active Camo."

Spartan 4s are just... really well trained?  I mean, Chief vs a Brute hand-to-hand, it's a fair fight.  But it took a handful of ODSTs to take down a Brute hand to hand, and one them nearly bit the dust from doing so.  And now Buck, one of those ODST marines who needed 4 other men to take down a brute is just... now a Spartan because he trained more?  It doesn't feel right.
    I‚Äôm not knocking Halo Wars but it‚Äôs an entirely different game with Halo assets.

Yeah Spartan 4‚Äôs are a joke in comparison to earlier Spartans, I think you‚Äôll enjoy this realistic fight scene:

 https://youtu.be/K2N-RKj0QWw?si=MC53U5y8RghE_VMP

And yeah, 343 stories are undercooked and poorly executed. Interesting how a company named after a bad guy has tanked the series‚Ä¶
        The monitor may be an antagonist but it's not technically a bad guy.  It's job is to make sure the flood don't overrun the galaxy. If the arbiters fleet hadn't glassed that one city on Earth with the flood in it in Halo 3 the humans would have been wiped out. They weren't handling the flood very well.
        well to be completely fair i think most of the poor choices were made by microsoft more than 343 there are definitely some talented devs there as seen with some of the campaign but you are right still doesn‚Äôt compare to classic halo
            Microsoft was also in charge for the first 4 Halo games
                yeah i know that but they weren‚Äôt as obsessed with money as they are now and they had better leads
    That sounds like you‚Äôre describing Halo 5 though aren‚Äôt you? Ammo problems and weird looking Spartans running around sound like that game.
        Never played past 4
It's called the Forsaken Dragon helm but I forget which series it was in.
MCC addition, not OG armor
The Forsaken Dragon helm.
Damn right!
    Heck yeah brother!
I knew exactly what this was before clicking on it xD
Wtf did I just watch. Lol
Any reach firefight mods I should know about? :-)
I live for compliments like this xD
Great!
And also the music is just 10/10
    Funnily enough the composer, Martin O'Donnell, is actually running in Nevada to become House Representative!
This is called an overreaction.  I show one HELM that wasn't from OG reach.  Does that change my opinion about it being my favorite Halo?  No.
Just a few helmets, a water bottle for the utility slot, and they added the robot arm to every version of chest-piece.  Part of an update a few years ago.  All the new armor was really given to Halo 3 in that update but just the H3 helmets from that update were also given to Reach, and I'm pretty happy about it.  A lot of the new armor is meh but I really like the 'modernized-for-Spartans' Knight helmet I currently have equipped.
Just a few... modifications.
Halo 4:  Ruined the DMR's ammo reserve & removed the Grenade Launcher

Halo Reach: DMR all day, every day, every mission and has Grenade Launcher.
    The class system was awesome tho and CTF was so fun
I think you do your customisation from the career menu, been a while since I‚Äôve looked at Reach‚Äôs menuing tho.

But yeah I‚Äôm 87% sure the Spartan you use for multiplayer is Your Actual Six
No
Personnaly I strongly disagree, all of those new custom don't match the original aesthetic at all.
I mean, why tf we can now see knights and Roman soldiers in a SF game like Halo.

The armors look cool, but for another game like Skyrim or idk

For me, those new custom killed the visual experience of Reach and 3 MP
    you can turn them off
        Except there‚Äôs a bug where holograms still have the new armors, and the post-game carnage report always shows them. Being able to turn them off would be awesome, if it actually worked.
        I do it on Reach but I'm screwed on H3 because I want weapon skins and shield & sword for my back
    I can understand in a sense of them being impractical. They're Spartans in Mjolnir armor. Both of which are based on ancient warriors and mythology. So it doesn't bother me too much if any armor were decorated in a manner that reflects that.
        I can agree on this point but some are really awkward like "skull and hood" or idk how this shit is called or even the helmet on H2A Gundam-like with literally the game logo on the head
            Haven't played in a bit, so I'm sure there are plenty i have yet to see.
    Do you dislike Hayabusa from Halo 3?
        Yeah I don't really like it, but considering the fact it was a secret armor I can eventually "accept" it, but imo, nonsense in this world
Especially because being a Knight is so my thing, that update was just perfect.

Now if we could get like 5 more firefight maps before they claim they've "finished the fight" for MCC...
    I want one set on an XBOX 360 mother board

A tribute to the console that gave us Reach
Halo 2 is easily the weakest of the bungie campaigns imo. I dont really have problems with the plot or characters but the gameplay especially in the last half is extremely rushed and the brutes are not fun enemies to fight.
Your opinion doesn't make his and many others wrong, you can prefer halo 2 and others can prefer which ever halo they enjoyed
    Armor customization is pointless.
        Yeah but, objectively speaking, Halo Reach has more to do‚Ä¶
            Objectively speaking halo 2 had the greatest multiplayer FPS experience of all time.
                thats literally your opinion, quit trying to treat your opinion like its fact you absolute tool.
                    he's fighting just like 6 lmao
                        bro is gonna be hiding in the cave
                    Are you actually taking any of this seriously? C'mon dude
                        are *you*? you're the guy who's trying to enforce your opinion like it's a fact. we're all laughing at you big guy
                            Why is you in those asterisks? You obviously don't know how to use them. And dude are you 13?
                        Don't try to hit the reset button cause you're losing karma you tool.
                            Oh my goodness gracious that's truly terrible.
                Okay yeah but that‚Äôs subjective.
                    But I said objective.
                        and you were wrong
                            No I'm not.
        Pointless to *you*. It‚Äôs my favorite part of any multiplayer game. The most important thing on my list. Also, Reach is just the best Halo game period.
            No it's not even close halo 2 was near perfect multiplayer,  and if you just wanna customize go play fashion souls or mod BG3.
        just like, your opinion, man
            The dude does not abide this comment.
        Your vibe rn: https://imgflip.com/i/8iq66n
            I'm not telling you not to have fun, it's just literally pointless.
                The point is to have fun, is what we are saying. Some people do not player multiplayer, at all. Consider that with what youve said previously... See where we are going with this?
                    Yeah, that's it's pointless and you agree with me.
                        One of the comments of all time.
                            I'm glad we are on the same page now.
Someone give this man a dictionary. Your opinion is subjective not objective
    I'm sorry that you guys take this so seriously, I guess a guy can't have fun around here.
I wouldn't call instigating as having fun, but some people just wanna see it burn I guess
    Yes because that's what I was doing.
Armor customization absolutely matters and I‚Äôm tired of pretending it doesn‚Äôt
    I bet you have never pretended. It is pointless though, sorry bud
Respect your opinion; firmly stand that halo reach was peak gaming.


Storywise- I enjoyed the campaign which I played split screen with my brother. Black Ops is a fine game but it didn‚Äôt have the interaction of a squad that I felt from reach. 


Multiplayer was so much fun- I played local with my friends until I got Xbox gold. Custom games was the best and I love big team battle. All the maps being made in forge was a blast (idk I thought whoa this is possible?)


Customization - based.
Oof. This is proof that just because you think it doesn't mean you gotta say it. 

Multiplayer was absolutely peak. Idk what you're on about this "community leaving for black ops business". That multiplayer was buzzing for like a year straight. 

I mean bro... The numbers are Google-able. In fact Reach got MORE popular once Black ops was out (18th of Nov)

Nov 16: 592,997

Nov 17: 581,158

Nov 18: 566,492

    Numbers can be wonderful
    Yeah there‚Äôs a couple of events called Black Friday and Christmas that occur in November and December.

I‚Äôm not referring to just after the immediate release but over the course of the year. Obviously.

Also a snapshot of 2 weeks of numbers is meaningless.
        Listen bud. I knew to look for the numbers. Let's not play games here about who has the evidence and proper citations.
            ‚ÄúOut of my ass‚Äù isn‚Äôt a source. Cherry-picking data generally isn‚Äôt seen as good evidence either.

Reach fell not only to Black Ops, but the 2 year old MW2 over the course of 2011. It barely beat out BF3 which came out at the end of 2011.

Halo 3 topped not just 2007 for XBL, but 2008 and 2009 as well.

Reach didn‚Äôt even top Blops the year it came out.

A large part of that is due to the fact CoD had not yet become the juggernaut it did during the MW series, but let‚Äôs not pretend Reach had the same longevity as the original 3.
                What are we even talking about now? You have no point. 

Stay on topic. You said the community fell off for Black ops. Not who was first or whatever the fuck else you're blabbing about. 

There were plenty of people still playing Reach.
                    Yeah my point is pretty clear as I stated it in my initial comment, not my fault you‚Äôre not keeping up.

Reach MP was not nearly as popular nor did it have as much longevity as previous Halo titles, in favor of the CoD series which absorbed a vast majority of the fps mp marketshare Halo had.

You posted 2 weeks of numbers and want to pretend like thats enough to show that it in fact did not fall off, while mischaracterization my argument as ‚Äúit immediately dropped off a cliff after Blops dropped.‚Äù

Pretty telling you don‚Äôt want to share the granular source data you have.
                What you‚Äôre doing, other than looking like a muppet, is drawing an illusory correlation between the Halo:Reach player base, the Infinity Ward MW2 player base, and the Treyarch BO player base. You have zero data that even points to players of *both* games picking one over the other. You can‚Äôt even remain consistent in your own flawed logic, your argument that Black Ops launch figures (typically the sharpest of all player counts) being arguably lower than Reach‚Äôs player count in the same period is a meaningless figure makes no sense when you literally believe that the two figures are representative of an overlap of community members - which was an asinine thought to have to begin with.
                    Blops launch figures werent lower than Reach‚Äôs? They beat out Reach for the year and the game launched a month later.

Let‚Äôs not pretend there want a heavy overlap between two of the biggest FPS‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a reason as one went down, the other went up.
                        I said your argument was fallacious and the relationship between the player bases is superfluous. No one cares.
                            It‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs willful ignorance to pretend otherwise üòÇ
Terrible take
    Sorry if you grew up on it.

Failed to hit the highs of the OG trilogy and mp strayed too far.

It‚Äôs good but not the best.
Haunted helmet went HARD
The cat ears unironically look less goofy than the shit for Chimera, of the many obnoxious armor effects
I absolutely hate how stupid half the new armor looks. Doesn't help with immersion at all.
    Yeah I‚Äôve seen the new armour and I haven‚Äôt played infinite yet or MCC, (yes I‚Äôm still stuck on reach :P ) the only goofy armour I like is the cat ears
        Reach is the GOAT of Halo
            YES , MY FAVOURITE JANk MESS
    Immersion begins and ends with my Spartan lmfao IMO the reach battlepass was the best for immersion (especially with cross core now), followed by the Rakshasa release pass. I am heavily enthralled by my ODST build I have been itching for since OG Halo 2 lol Being a Marine/ODST in multiplayer is a dream come true! 

Just wish we could use these Spartans in campaign. This OG Halo 117 clone stuff is doo doo, Reach Campaign did it right!
Combat Active Tracking  Electronic Activated Radios.

C.A.T. E.A.R
Will accept no disrespect to cat ears thanks
    For real though, I really don‚Äôt see why there‚Äôs so much dissent for them. For a community that so lovingly embraces bullshit like ‚ÄúArby N the Chief‚Äù or the absurdity of ‚ÄúRed Vs Blue‚Äù, cat ears feel like such a natural splash of comedic baloney for Halo. I can guarantee you if they had been added in the Bungie era that Donut would‚Äôve somehow ended up wearing them because he thinks they‚Äôre some required standard issue component to his armor.
    You will accept the rightful disrespect to cat ears
        Say you‚Äôre sorry or I will ban you
            You are not sorry and neither am I
                That‚Äôs it buster
                    Oh yea well my dad works for Microsoft and he's going to ban your account
    Fuck the cat ears.
        Bammed
        Gladly!
Goofy non canon helmets in halo is one of the worst things about the series, that's a hill I'll die on.
On one hand, some of the armors pieces in infinite completely clash with the tone and feel of the rest of the series. On the other hand, Cat Ears :3
y'all are STILL complaining about the cat ears its hilarious lmao
Holy shit shut up about this!
    those mfs always like "we used to be a country" but they've been mad since you could make spartans pink tbh.
You can still do that
    Yeah but the immersion died when I saw these over the top armors. I miss how it used to be
        you can literally disable them in MCC

you can ignore them otherwise

you're just looking for a reason to complain.
            You know it's hard to see my favorite childhood game ruined by another company. 
What can I disable? All custom armor
The thing I don't like is shooting at a freaking cat spartan, shit is stupid. All the original Spartans from reach had some lore behind them as to why they were in the game. Now it's like over the top samurai helms like in the picture above. The only good thing 343 did was update forge. They ruined the cred system. They ruined the armor customization, and they added battle passes. 

Now before you say is just how people look what does it matter to you. Call of duty did the same thing, they went from a military shooter to Now I'm fighting groot, and Nicki Minaj. When I want to play a militaristic shooter I want the immersion to be all about the military. Like when mw 2019 came out, before all the insane updates. But I get it, the stupid shit sells. So we will never go back.
                you guys still being mad about the cat ears will never not be funny

you can still play the old games, you wanna stay nostalgiablind you totally can
                    Its not the cat ears specifically, but its what pushed the line of what was okay for spartan armor. It is the single thing we can point to that begins the decline of militaristic spartan armor, and its decline of the game studio whoring itself out for money.
                        right, anyways there's a good mix of both in-game for people who like both.
Buy it?
    Pay for cat ear cosmetics etc
        yea infinite. i guess i misread acemckickass's post, but i thought he was talking about MCC additional armor not the mtx from infinite.
        That would probably be the only I would by in halo lol
        everything in mcc was earned not able to be bought though?
            The comment I responded to was talking about Infinite too, idk, I haven't played MCC since before they introduced the season passes
Spartans Armour are labeled Mjolnir series which indicates its actually Viking. But also. The set a style for lore Armour and it doesn't look like that crazy shit.
How did Reach go against established lore?
    Isn't it well known that it went against the original Fall of Reach book so much that it had to be rereleased so the story could fit with the game?
        This is from another comment on a post about the canonicity of FoR and H:R, so not sure how accurate it is, but 

No, not at all. This is a horrible misconception which I can't believe still gets brought up. *The Fall of Reach* got re-published in 2010 and a few changes were made to the text. None of these changes had anything to do with *Halo: Reach*. They fixed math errors, contradictions within the book (someone saluting with a hand they just had blown off in the previous scene), and some scientific inaccuracies (regarding stars that actually exist, for example).
            As someone who read FoR, I'd love to see the old and updated texts side by side so I can see what changed.
        It‚Äôs best to apply tiers of canonicity when it comes to things like this. The original source material format (video games, in Halo‚Äôs case) will override prior content from other formats (like books).
i mean yeah it‚Äôs fun but they tried with it way too late and the prices for cosmetics are still atrocious
    Totally agree on that end. The microtransactions are a huge problem I have with the game, however- one of the few.
I‚Äôm not knocking Halo Wars but it‚Äôs an entirely different game with Halo assets.

Yeah Spartan 4‚Äôs are a joke in comparison to earlier Spartans, I think you‚Äôll enjoy this realistic fight scene:

 https://youtu.be/K2N-RKj0QWw?si=MC53U5y8RghE_VMP

And yeah, 343 stories are undercooked and poorly executed. Interesting how a company named after a bad guy has tanked the series‚Ä¶
    The monitor may be an antagonist but it's not technically a bad guy.  It's job is to make sure the flood don't overrun the galaxy. If the arbiters fleet hadn't glassed that one city on Earth with the flood in it in Halo 3 the humans would have been wiped out. They weren't handling the flood very well.
    well to be completely fair i think most of the poor choices were made by microsoft more than 343 there are definitely some talented devs there as seen with some of the campaign but you are right still doesn‚Äôt compare to classic halo
        Microsoft was also in charge for the first 4 Halo games
            yeah i know that but they weren‚Äôt as obsessed with money as they are now and they had better leads
That sounds like you‚Äôre describing Halo 5 though aren‚Äôt you? Ammo problems and weird looking Spartans running around sound like that game.
    Never played past 4
Heck yeah brother!
Funnily enough the composer, Martin O'Donnell, is actually running in Nevada to become House Representative!
The class system was awesome tho and CTF was so fun
you can turn them off
    Except there‚Äôs a bug where holograms still have the new armors, and the post-game carnage report always shows them. Being able to turn them off would be awesome, if it actually worked.
    I do it on Reach but I'm screwed on H3 because I want weapon skins and shield & sword for my back
I can understand in a sense of them being impractical. They're Spartans in Mjolnir armor. Both of which are based on ancient warriors and mythology. So it doesn't bother me too much if any armor were decorated in a manner that reflects that.
    I can agree on this point but some are really awkward like "skull and hood" or idk how this shit is called or even the helmet on H2A Gundam-like with literally the game logo on the head
        Haven't played in a bit, so I'm sure there are plenty i have yet to see.
Do you dislike Hayabusa from Halo 3?
    Yeah I don't really like it, but considering the fact it was a secret armor I can eventually "accept" it, but imo, nonsense in this world
I want one set on an XBOX 360 mother board

A tribute to the console that gave us Reach
Armor customization is pointless.
    Yeah but, objectively speaking, Halo Reach has more to do‚Ä¶
        Objectively speaking halo 2 had the greatest multiplayer FPS experience of all time.
            thats literally your opinion, quit trying to treat your opinion like its fact you absolute tool.
                he's fighting just like 6 lmao
                    bro is gonna be hiding in the cave
                Are you actually taking any of this seriously? C'mon dude

            he's fighting just like 6 lmao
                bro is gonna be hiding in the cave
            Are you actually taking any of this seriously? C'mon dude
                are *you*? you're the guy who's trying to enforce your opinion like it's a fact. we're all laughing at you big guy
                    Why is you in those asterisks? You obviously don't know how to use them. And dude are you 13?
                Don't try to hit the reset button cause you're losing karma you tool.
                    Oh my goodness gracious that's truly terrible.
        Okay yeah but that‚Äôs subjective.
            But I said objective.
                and you were wrong
                    No I'm not.
Pointless to *you*. It‚Äôs my favorite part of any multiplayer game. The most important thing on my list. Also, Reach is just the best Halo game period.
    No it's not even close halo 2 was near perfect multiplayer,  and if you just wanna customize go play fashion souls or mod BG3.
just like, your opinion, man
    The dude does not abide this comment.
Your vibe rn: https://imgflip.com/i/8iq66n
    I'm not telling you not to have fun, it's just literally pointless.
        The point is to have fun, is what we are saying. Some people do not player multiplayer, at all. Consider that with what youve said previously... See where we are going with this?
            Yeah, that's it's pointless and you agree with me.
                One of the comments of all time.
                    I'm glad we are on the same page now.
Listen bud. I knew to look for the numbers. Let's not play games here about who has the evidence and proper citations.
    ‚ÄúOut of my ass‚Äù isn‚Äôt a source. Cherry-picking data generally isn‚Äôt seen as good evidence either.

Reach fell not only to Black Ops, but the 2 year old MW2 over the course of 2011. It barely beat out BF3 which came out at the end of 2011.

Halo 3 topped not just 2007 for XBL, but 2008 and 2009 as well.

Reach didn‚Äôt even top Blops the year it came out.

A large part of that is due to the fact CoD had not yet become the juggernaut it did during the MW series, but let‚Äôs not pretend Reach had the same longevity as the original 3.
        What are we even talking about now? You have no point. 

Stay on topic. You said the community fell off for Black ops. Not who was first or whatever the fuck else you're blabbing about. 

There were plenty of people still playing Reach.
            Yeah my point is pretty clear as I stated it in my initial comment, not my fault you‚Äôre not keeping up.

Reach MP was not nearly as popular nor did it have as much longevity as previous Halo titles, in favor of the CoD series which absorbed a vast majority of the fps mp marketshare Halo had.

You posted 2 weeks of numbers and want to pretend like thats enough to show that it in fact did not fall off, while mischaracterization my argument as ‚Äúit immediately dropped off a cliff after Blops dropped.‚Äù

Pretty telling you don‚Äôt want to share the granular source data you have.
        What you‚Äôre doing, other than looking like a muppet, is drawing an illusory correlation between the Halo:Reach player base, the Infinity Ward MW2 player base, and the Treyarch BO player base. You have zero data that even points to players of *both* games picking one over the other. You can‚Äôt even remain consistent in your own flawed logic, your argument that Black Ops launch figures (typically the sharpest of all player counts) being arguably lower than Reach‚Äôs player count in the same period is a meaningless figure makes no sense when you literally believe that the two figures are representative of an overlap of community members - which was an asinine thought to have to begin with.
            Blops launch figures werent lower than Reach‚Äôs? They beat out Reach for the year and the game launched a month later.

Let‚Äôs not pretend there want a heavy overlap between two of the biggest FPS‚Äôs. There‚Äôs a reason as one went down, the other went up.
                I said your argument was fallacious and the relationship between the player bases is superfluous. No one cares.
                    It‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs willful ignorance to pretend otherwise üòÇ
Reach is the GOAT of Halo
    YES , MY FAVOURITE JANk MESS
Say you‚Äôre sorry or I will ban you
    You are not sorry and neither am I
        That‚Äôs it buster
            Oh yea well my dad works for Microsoft and he's going to ban your account
Bammed
Gladly!
you can literally disable them in MCC

you can ignore them otherwise

you're just looking for a reason to complain.
    You know it's hard to see my favorite childhood game ruined by another company. 
What can I disable? All custom armor
The thing I don't like is shooting at a freaking cat spartan, shit is stupid. All the original Spartans from reach had some lore behind them as to why they were in the game. Now it's like over the top samurai helms like in the picture above. The only good thing 343 did was update forge. They ruined the cred system. They ruined the armor customization, and they added battle passes. 

Now before you say is just how people look what does it matter to you. Call of duty did the same thing, they went from a military shooter to Now I'm fighting groot, and Nicki Minaj. When I want to play a militaristic shooter I want the immersion to be all about the military. Like when mw 2019 came out, before all the insane updates. But I get it, the stupid shit sells. So we will never go back.
        you guys still being mad about the cat ears will never not be funny

you can still play the old games, you wanna stay nostalgiablind you totally can
            Its not the cat ears specifically, but its what pushed the line of what was okay for spartan armor. It is the single thing we can point to that begins the decline of militaristic spartan armor, and its decline of the game studio whoring itself out for money.
                right, anyways there's a good mix of both in-game for people who like both.
yea infinite. i guess i misread acemckickass's post, but i thought he was talking about MCC additional armor not the mtx from infinite.
That would probably be the only I would by in halo lol
everything in mcc was earned not able to be bought though?
    The comment I responded to was talking about Infinite too, idk, I haven't played MCC since before they introduced the season passes
This is from another comment on a post about the canonicity of FoR and H:R, so not sure how accurate it is, but 

No, not at all. This is a horrible misconception which I can't believe still gets brought up. *The Fall of Reach* got re-published in 2010 and a few changes were made to the text. None of these changes had anything to do with *Halo: Reach*. They fixed math errors, contradictions within the book (someone saluting with a hand they just had blown off in the previous scene), and some scientific inaccuracies (regarding stars that actually exist, for example).
    As someone who read FoR, I'd love to see the old and updated texts side by side so I can see what changed.
It‚Äôs best to apply tiers of canonicity when it comes to things like this. The original source material format (video games, in Halo‚Äôs case) will override prior content from other formats (like books).
Microsoft was also in charge for the first 4 Halo games
    yeah i know that but they weren‚Äôt as obsessed with money as they are now and they had better leads
Haven't played in a bit, so I'm sure there are plenty i have yet to see.
