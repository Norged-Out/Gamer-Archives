I'd love to recreate this Spartan right now but the new unlock system is ass.

'Least I got Recon right off the bat. I preordered for that shit when OG Reach released.
    What don't you like about the new system? I thought it made the grind much faster. IIRC the old system had you noot only collecting points, but needing ranks to unlock certain rewards. This new one has you unlocking things in a linear fashion which simplifies things, and it seems to go pretty quick. I also might just care about cosmetics less than I used to.
        It doesn't really incentivize that well. You can't pick and choose what you can unlock, campaign is worthless in MCC when it wasn't in OG reach, and I just don't have the amount of time in a day for most of the week to just play for hours so I can grind. It took me since releaseto get to the end of Tier 1, but I'm seeing people that are already brigadier generals.
            I agree with not being able to pick and choose but at the same time, I remember having to save up a ton or credits to get certain things which meant you weren't getting anything else in the meantime. They've definitely made it easier.
                I can see where you're coming from. Just not a fan of tiered unlocks in a game where having the most free time means you have almost everything a week later versus having credits, some nifty achievements and a little time (I don't remember it taking me very long to hit Lt. Colonel) to pretty much get what I wanted.

[EDIT] I also read somewhere that it would take roughly 100 hours of multiplayer time to unlock everything. That's... a lot, especially if you're trying to get everything unlocked before CE drops.
                    Yeah. I have to concur, this is still better than the last system just due to the abbreviated amount of grinding, but not getting anything for offline/single player play, combined with a total lack of choice in what you get, make it very much a chore. Especially so since most of us unlocked most of this stuff already ten years ago.
        I just want the ODST pieces and a few other miscellaneous bits for shoulders and stuff. There’s literally nothing I like for almost 2 whole tiers. The fact that I can’t even grind this silly shit out in campaign like I could in OG Reach is absurd.
            That part I definitely agree with. Pretty lame you have to strictly stick to multiplayer to earn stuff we've already unlocked.

    nice, got the bulky look going
[Here's my old spartan](https://spartans.svc.halowaypoint.com/players/DarkBlue%20matter/Reach/spartans/fullbody?target=large)
    I forgot about the mechanical arm, haven't seen one yet
        Always been a fan of the robotic prostethic ever since I first saw Kat. Looking forward to get it on pc but I still have a long way to grind

    Nice
I don't have the tacpad, FJ/PARA knees or the TACTICAL/HARDCASE yet so i can't fully recreate my original Spartan, but here she is right now.

Mine is pretty similar, but with EOD helmet, basicly I just went for max armour, but without looking so bulky as to slow movement(jorges chestplate is awesome, but it just seemed to big in the custom Armour for example)

I have no idea why vanity dosent allow you to use the helm attachments
    Mk v all the way

    I always liked that gunner chest/shoulder, but I also like keeping a lower profile.
How do you get these clean full profile images?
    They're from the old version, check my other post there's a link where you can search your old Xbox live name to get it
[Always loved the ~~CQB~~ Air Assault helmet!](https://spartans.svc.halowaypoint.com/players/Tinned%20Bread/Reach/spartans/fullbody?target=large)
    I believe that’s Air Assault
        You are correct and I am stupid - appreciate the correction!
            Hey I got my CQC and CQB helmets mixed up so don’t feel bad about it. I’m surprised to find someone who actually likes air assault other than myself.

Not sure why I liked the JFO helmet so much. Maybe I just didn’t see it too often.
    Uniqueness is always good
[Here’s me](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/undead-artyom/screenshot/14109258)
    Is that from original reach?
        Yes, I just wasted a lot of time on it back in the day

[This'll be a pain to get this time](https://spartans.svc.halowaypoint.com/players/QS%20Sabotage/Reach/spartans/fullbody?target=large) Not shown is the blue tacpad on the left arm
[My Spartan](https://halo.bungie.net/stats/reach/playermodel.ashx?rpis=EH4K3T1CSSs04CnkW01wuQ==) from back in the day, shame its all end of the unlock line gear lol
Always liked the Grenadier knees, but hated how they were attached to the kneecaps instead of the top of the shin armor like how Jorge's were. Thought it looked stupid to have these giant floating metal kneecaps, so I went back to FJ/PARA
    Got a picture?
        [This](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5064/5605611099_041a93be65_b.jpg) screenshot shows it pretty well, especially compared to the way the PARA knees fit on Jun. Note: Not my screenshot, just something I found from some googling around.
