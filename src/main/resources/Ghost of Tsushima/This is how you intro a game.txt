[[This is how you intro a game]]





Definitely üòç so much love for this game.
    I just wish the storytelling was a bit better in the side missions in particular. Other than that, the game is great. I‚Äôd tweak the AI to be more a aware of what‚Äôs 2ft above them, but that‚Äôs just nitpicking. The game is incredibly fun, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to enjoy AC:Valhalla less for having played this game first.
        Definitely. Just having a bit more of a closeups and some canned animations would‚Äôve gone a long way to make sidequests feel more like stories and less like checkmarks.
I just got chills watching this again!!
    Dude seriously. I'm actually refusing to rewatch on here so I can feel that magic again when I start a new game. Serious gave major chills, absolutely gorgeous.
        don't worry! just started ng+ yesterday and still had chills and inexplicably tears spring to my eyes
            What is the new game + then? Its different to the 1st one is it?
                New Game+ is what you would do after you‚Äôve already beat the game once, it unlocks new difficulties, gear, etc. I recommend only doing it once you 100% absolutely everything in the game however
                Late comment, but yes it is different. This is where it starts on NG+.
                    Wish I could play komada beach on ng+ though the beach fighting was epic.
            I had the same feeling + the tears, it's impressive how this game is an artwork. 

The other game that had this type of intro was Zelda Breath of the Wild, and it also has the same effect on me.
    Oh yes, this and unlocking ghost stance, major chills.
        Oh man, that moment.... after I completed that quest I had to put the controller down and take a few minutes because I was so blown away.
        Did that yesterday was one of best moments Ive had gaming without doubt. Would be even better if it had the kill bill sound effects though.
        Ooh I‚Äôve been trying to go slowly playing this game cause it‚Äôs so fun and I haven‚Äôt gotten to that yet that should be awesome
    Lmao I was about to say the same thing. I get goosebumps every time I see this.
The most epic and beautiful intro i have ever seen.
This scene brings me joy and sadness. I completed the game yesterday and it cought me off guard. Literally bought a ps4 and new tv to quit pc just for this game.
    Well dude, you're in luck. You got around 10 amazing ps4 exclusive to play, depending on what you like.

Horizon Zero Dawn

Bloodborne

The Last of Us pt 1 & 2

Spiderman

God of War

Shadow of the Colossus

Persona 5

Uncharted

Detroit become Human
        I‚Äôd add Days Gone and Metal Gear Solid as well
            MGS isn't PS4 exclusive
        Horizon Zero Dawn isn't exclusive anymore, it's released for PC.
        Never played Detroit become human, what's it like if you don't mind me asking?
            the gameplay itself is fairly bare bones. imagine a series of quicktime events propped up by a very well written story. its definitely worth getting for the story itself as its pretty engaging and it's got a lot of replayability value
                I'll definitely have to check it out
                    [deleted]
                        Will do
            If you've ever played a telltale game it's like that except every single aspect is somehow done infinitely better and with a way bigger budget.
            Think choose your own adventure.
        Shadow of the colossus... ah, i see, you're a man of culture aswell
    You can still enjoy both
        Absolutely! Gotta finish BL3+2 still.
    Go buy and play death stranding please
    >to quit pc just for this game.

Dude seriously?
        Well I'm exaggerating but yeah. Was getting bored (classic wow, dont judge- nostalgia) so it wasn't a big deal. But I haven't played console since ps2/first gen xbox so it was a big change holding a controller again. Now I need a new game to fill the void. Any suggestions? Haven't tried legends yet, not sure if I'd be an anchor. I'm not bad but I don't think I'd last on lethal..
            The PS4 exclusives are the greatest generation of games ever in my opinion. God of War, Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us I/II, and although it was love or hate my favorite game of the year was Death Stranding.
                Ty I was just looking at GoW and the last of us. They look pretty sick
                    GOW is hands down one of the best games I've played. The story is fantastic.
                        The story and details come together so beautifully! I don't think there's another game I played that months after I finished it gave me so many "ohhh how did I not see that before"-moments when watching Balrog (the producer) talk on different interviews/podcasts
                Plus one to Death Stranding, secured a spot in my favorite games of all time
            New game+ Legends isn‚Äôt lethal, you‚Äôd do just fine.
            Horizon Zero Dawn.
            I recommend God of War. Great Graphics, great fighting mecanics and a amazing story.
                Don‚Äôt forget the amazing soundtrack
                    True! The nordic chorus is epic!
                        The music that plays when you cremate Faye still gives me goosebumps
                Thank you
My mouth dropped the first time I saw this
The music is out of this world
To quote Travis Scott, "I get those goosebumps every time"
    *ITS LIT!*
Get chills every time
Even NG+ starting you back off again during this whole cutscene made me in a "OHHHHHHH shit" moment
    Yeah, it was the perfect place to drop you into a NG+. And I loved the Echoes Between Worlds quest description. Just the right amount of cheek.
        I will say I miss the beach charge but alas
            I can understand that. But given that up to this scene is essentially (very-well done) tutorials for the game systems, this is the perfect place to drop a returning player.
I spent a month playing this game every single night for several hours until I got platinum, and finished 2 weeks ago. I've been feeling withdrawals and got a little depressed that there was nothing left to do. I started NG+ within an hour of the update installing. As soon as this scene started I got full body chills and almost cried of happiness. I know that might sound absurd, but I really loved this game and I'm so excited to take the journey again.
    Mot absurd at all. When something is done beautifully, its totally understandable to have these feelings. Its like people seeing colour for the first time, it makes you realise just how beautiful the world is, and if you've never seen it before, it will move you immediately to tears.
        The game is amazing and hits in so many levels. There was so much effort pit into it-the world feels immersive, the music is fantastic and feels perfect to add the drama, the voice acting, the story, the characters, all that topped off with awesome combat mechanics, and now added content. I don‚Äôt care what sucker punches next game is-im getting it.
This legit gives me chills. Such a good intro
The reach-down and letting the grass brush against Jin's hand, is such a great move. Love seeing it.
    >reach

I love how if you slow down to a walk through pampas grass Jin puts his hand out to touch the grass. That little animation detail does so much to immerse the player.
I bought GOT right after release with almost no idea what i was really getting into. I liked it at first, then i got to this. Instantly fell in love. I almost pissed myself with happiness when i started NG+ and it put me right back in this spot. Fucking hell what an intro man.
    Seems to echo my experience as well. I also got this game on a whim not expecting much. The opening scene was good and the following gameplay was decent but I was still skeptical until I saw this opening scene with the music and I was hooked.
Fuck. Yes.
Every time I watch this I get goosebumps, one of the best intro ever!!
Goosebumps
This game definitely raised the bar on so many levels.
Got chills when I first played and again when I started the NG+... bravo
Goosebumps!

The first time I saw this, I was absolutely blown away and just sitting there with my jaw on the floor! Certainly one of the best game intros I've personally experienced.
I swear to god I‚Äôve never had such chills in my life during any game intro as this and when they ran down the hill during the opening and I realized I was playing
Started playing it today. Jaw dropping intro.
And the music!  Total vibe üëåüëåüëå
My favorite game for sure.
Such a gorgeous game, gives me chills every time
No lie....I nearly cried it was so perfect.
chills every single time.. gosh this game is so epic!!
I just finished the legends update and now I'm getting back to my first story playthrough and I cannot believe how amazing this game is!

Sucker Punch just continues to amaze me.
Such an impressive opening sequence, the sights, the music, set the tone so well for the game. Easily one of my favorite and most memorable games of this generation.
Then there are people who stop galloping as soon as they have control and i slightly get annoyed. :D
Starring new game+ on lethal+ and got to experience this beautiful into once again,such a good game
I remember thinking ‚Äúwow did this really just happen?‚Äù
This was the moment I fell in love.
Started up New game plus this weekend, it starts exactly at that intro and I gave me the same level of hype and emotions that I did during my first playthrough.
100%
Goosebumps.  Every. Single. Time.
This brings me happiness. Thankfully new game + has allowed me to experience this great game all over again.
I knew this was going to be amazing once that happened. I was hooked.
I have friends at work who haven't played and I'm trying to persuade them to get it. There's so much i want to tell them but at the same time i want to keep it a surprise. I want them to experience this without knowing it's coming, so it can literally drop their jaw the same way it did mine.
Just started my New Game+ and forgot how beautiful the game is
got chills even tho i play the shit out of this game every day
Chills every time
Omg I know.... Sucker punch man, they sucker punched me lol
Goosebumps everytime.
Literally gives me chills holy shit
Goosebumps. Everytime.
Just finished this game today and my first platinum trophy ever (mostly play on PC).  That final mission, you know the one, got to me in a way very few games are able to.  What a brilliant game.  Can't wait to dive into Legends tomorrow night!  Love horde modes.
I got chills the first time I played it and got chills again starting New Game+.
It really is a work of art.
Best intro ever
Gave me chills when I played it. Gave me chills again watching it right now.
I am loving this game! I spent most of my holidays playing & started NG+ yesterday. This scene is definitely goosebump material.
That scene still gives me goose bumps
Literally felt this yesterday starting ng+. Combine this on a good ass monitor and 3D audio *chefs kiss
This intro scene is absolutely phenomenal, another reason why I love this game so much
I bought this on a complete whim a few days after it came out and after making it to this scene I was amazed. I knew it would become one of my all time favorite games‚Äîand it did!
This game is so dope. Really enjoying new game plus and legends.
Sucker Punch rocks! Epic intro... luv luv luv this game!
This is how to become  one of the most loved games
This gave me such chills and I didn't even realize there was audio and still got goosebumps
why is no one talking about how he turned left and didnt go through the 2 trees on the lake? Did most people not do that?
still gives me chills.
    Every single time
Gives me chills every time
GOTY.

Only Cyberpunk might outdo it
    Cyberpunk missed this year's cutoff for goty
        Geoff Keighley actually said a month ago that the game awards deadline might actually extend from November 15th to 23rd. So, cyberpunk might actually be a contender for game of the year
    I wish but people are still sucking TLOU2‚Äôs depressing dick
        People like different things man. I love Ghost but its tied up between Tlou 2 and Outer Wilds for my goty choices personally.

Edit: Yall really salty over the idea that people like different things lol?
            Cool
            Wasn't Outer Wilds from 2019?
                It was, I do my goty based on when I play and finish them.
                    Ah, I think most of these people are arguing about the Golden Joysticks or The Game Awards, not their personal fave
                        Sure but I dont think it would be absurd if Tlou2 won. Its divisive sure but I think that makes it all the more intriguing as a piece of art.
        So you didnt like tlou 2, as much as i like got , id still give goty to tlou 2, to each there own i guess
            Cool
        i‚Äôll replay Ghost of Tsushima about 10 times before i finish my tlou2 play through. Stopped like a third way through. Haven‚Äôt touched it since.
            Agreed my man. Agreed. I finished TLOU2 because I was curious where it would go and I tell ya, I would not trudge through that shit again. I wish I could do a level select to explore different levels again (level design was amazing) but that‚Äôs about it. The story was an unfulfilling mess for me. GoT on the other hand was a godamn beautiful journey from beginning to end. Already enjoying my New Game +
                It didn‚Äôt work for me because they put the characters in situations to try to make a story. Joel and Tommy wouldn‚Äôt be all soft and kind to strangers like that no matter how long he‚Äôs been living happily. As well as ellie leaving the good ending she could‚Äôve had just to not go through with it in the end. An intense, sad pretty grey ending story does not equal GOTY. Now a beautiful, colorful, breathing open world Island with countless side activities and shrines, the smoothest and most rewarding sword combat I‚Äôve ever played, beautiful armor detail and customization, great, memorable characters and a gripping story about having to separate yourself from everything you‚Äôve ever known and at the same time the only family you have left to save your island? now THAT is a GOTY.
                    Ah shit. I didn‚Äôt even mention that f*cking soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack. The song that plays in the cutscene before and leading into the final boss fight (iykyk) is fucking beyond fantastic.
                        Right. Was there anything really mew in TLOU2? Great game-great graphics (these days almost a given) and good story. GOT Has all that and more IMO. When I add up each game as a sum of all it‚Äôs parts-I got to give it to GOT, the underdog not the naughty dog :-)
                    I‚Äôm with ya there hundo-p. GoT definitely deserves to be GOTY. Will it be able to persevere through the ‚Äúsad=quality‚Äù circle jerk that even seeps into film and television awards? I really hope so.
        Lmao tlou2 sucked ass
So I dropped acid the day I bought the game. Was peaking as I was playing the intro. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how awesome it looked. For the next few hours I played but honestly it felt more like I was watching a Kurosawa film.
There's something hilarious about right after riding into the field 90% of players turn around to go get the stealth assassination ability. I wish the next mission was in front of you so you don't look dumb just turning back, or who knows maybe Jin just wanted to look cool for a minute.
This is when I knew it was gonna be breath of the Wild quality for me.
This is really good but my all time favourite is still assassin creed 2 when both brothers are on top of clock tower and that music hits
Bummed the multi player is not open world style. Would've been cool to ride with your clan....
GOTY
    Definitely
wish this game was on pc
I just got it but my PS4 keeps overheating üòÇ. My PS5 can't come soon enough.
So like... it‚Äôs just horse ass?
But it‚Äôs sooo awkward though Jin goes ‚Äúokay Luna I‚Äôll join you in a lil bit I just gotta do something‚Äù and then it cuts to this
I love this damn game. Online has been a blast so far too!!
I wish I could erase my memory and replay this game again. Would anyone like to volunteer to hit me on the head hard enough?
STILL GET FUCKING CHILLS! THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!!!
And this is how you end it (spoilers): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmvp\_00u5AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmvp_00u5AI)

What an amazing production!
    Hard to believe that this game was better than most movies.
Doing Kurosawa Lethal+ for my new game+

Hard as hell as a wrong move in a standoff means death, but so rewarding when it goes right
Guys, is your audio clipping too during some parts of the game ?
Just got chills watching this again, all of save files got deleted when I was super close to the platinum for this, can't wait to replay it on ps5
Im definitely going to have to replay this now
F****** love the intro
Was epic, but i feel like they should have gone full on Kojima and had you galloping for a good few minutes as the credit roll
The only other time a game filled me with awe and wonder as it opened was in Breath of the Wild
I can‚Äôt wait for the PS5 to come out so I can do my NG+ play through
This is probably one of the few games that when i played the intro, it gave me the feelings of when you first play Chrono Trigger or Skyrim, seriously a beautiful and amazing game.
Would love to play but gamers are still divided and exclusives suck. Looks so good
Yes. Yes it is. Here's your karma... Without honor.
Good vid over all. I would say for when you move the camera you gotta go slower rather than the quick movements.
Loved it! In my first playthrough I rode straight to the water and my horse jumped over a log or rock iirc and landed just as the music needed it just felt epic
This intro is so amazing!
I love this intro
It's such a beautiful game. It works perfectly as a final exclusive to really extract the maximum out of the hardware. The clean look and vibrant colours really pull you in.
I remember being so shook at this part that I stopped the horse lol
I just started new game plus and this intro scene made me smile like a maniac and had me fired up for my second go around. 
I feel like posting my new game+ lethal exploits on YouTube since I love this game so much
Got chills when "SUCKER PUNCH PRESENTS" showed up when I was playing this and literally said, "HOLY SHIT, that's how you do it!"
Man, I started NG+ last night and forgot about this. The intro is soooo good.
Yeah it's legit my favorite title screen opening, you feel so immersed in this moment it's just beautiful, the score the lighting, the wind it all just uh, Bravo sucker punch.
So excited to NG+ this on PS5
Like a streamer once said, this is how you sell a game.
Damn,I gotta do a new game plus now
Is fapping to this an acceptable reaction?
Chilling
This intro will always give me goosebumps, it's just exquisite. *chef's kiss *
Yo why is it Xbox green tinted I thought ghost what an exclusive. Lol
    *Yo why is it Xbox*

*Green tinted I thought ghost what*

*An exclusive. Lol*

You did not have to  
Make this annoying spam bot  
But did anyway
        This was definitely on purpose
On NG+, it's night time on this scene.
Best intro ever When I first saw this I knew it was special
I just ordered a 4K tv that‚Äôs coming in a week or two and this video has me wanting to restart the game just so I can experience it again in all it‚Äôs glory
Sucker Punch has set the bar so high with this game it's ridiculous, Infamous series was cool and all but this is like their showup to any gamer that doubted them as a studio.
I've never felt so badass in a game intro, my jaw hit the floor
    *I've never felt so*

*Badass in a game into,*

when the intro is so good it makes you tear up
There were so many moments in this game where I audibly laughed or just smiled at how awesome a moment was. This was one of them.

I absolutely love the music from the final battle and the new music from legends. Ended a Masterpiece
This is pitch perfect but I missed the grass touching in this vid. I saw so many people kinda not being able to feel the full impact cos they starting moving the controller. I was so awestruck I didn't move a thing and then he touch the grass and in that moment I couldn't help but tear up and I wanted to kill every single Mongol in the game.
So many chills!
This fucking music is so amazing
I cry evrytim üíßüëÅüëÑüëÅüíß
I keep getting goosebumps and chills all over watching this. Waiting for the patch fix and play NG+ soon/
As Max said ‚Äúthis shot is what we call a system seller‚Äù
Goosebumps everytime i see this intro...
Fuck YES, this gameüíØ
This game came out only a few months ago, after beating twice (once from hard, the next on lethal) I stopped playing for a bit. Watching this vid brought back nostalgia, which is weird cause, ya know, IT CAME OUT ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO
Total r/frisson
My only issue with the game is the horse animations. After RDR, they just don‚Äôt look right to me.
This game completelyyyyy blew my expectations out of the water. Game of the year, hands down.
This blew me away for sure
Not just the intro, but the starting of the game as well. Camera looking up to the samurai banners while you select your gaming experience, and then pans out to show the komoda beach battleground. One of the best starts.
The team incharge of graphics level design and animation are absolute megachads. This game is so beautiful.
In the words of CoryxKenshin himself
I had shivers playing it for the first time. Absolute masterpiece
This and ac2 were great intros
I gasped when I first played this. It's so stunning
This is the greatest intro of all time! Still makes the hairs on my arms stand straight up

Top tier intros for sure
Took me back to this magical gaming moment in Red Dead Redemption, when you finally enter Mexico after a brutal battle..

https://youtu.be/ufZ1uchM9AA
The satisfaction. üëç
"IKUZO, NOBU!"
I just wish the storytelling was a bit better in the side missions in particular. Other than that, the game is great. I‚Äôd tweak the AI to be more a aware of what‚Äôs 2ft above them, but that‚Äôs just nitpicking. The game is incredibly fun, and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to enjoy AC:Valhalla less for having played this game first.
    Definitely. Just having a bit more of a closeups and some canned animations would‚Äôve gone a long way to make sidequests feel more like stories and less like checkmarks.
Dude seriously. I'm actually refusing to rewatch on here so I can feel that magic again when I start a new game. Serious gave major chills, absolutely gorgeous.
    don't worry! just started ng+ yesterday and still had chills and inexplicably tears spring to my eyes
        What is the new game + then? Its different to the 1st one is it?
            New Game+ is what you would do after you‚Äôve already beat the game once, it unlocks new difficulties, gear, etc. I recommend only doing it once you 100% absolutely everything in the game however
            Late comment, but yes it is different. This is where it starts on NG+.
                Wish I could play komada beach on ng+ though the beach fighting was epic.
        I had the same feeling + the tears, it's impressive how this game is an artwork. 

The other game that had this type of intro was Zelda Breath of the Wild, and it also has the same effect on me.
Oh yes, this and unlocking ghost stance, major chills.
    Oh man, that moment.... after I completed that quest I had to put the controller down and take a few minutes because I was so blown away.
    Did that yesterday was one of best moments Ive had gaming without doubt. Would be even better if it had the kill bill sound effects though.
    Ooh I‚Äôve been trying to go slowly playing this game cause it‚Äôs so fun and I haven‚Äôt gotten to that yet that should be awesome
Lmao I was about to say the same thing. I get goosebumps every time I see this.
Well dude, you're in luck. You got around 10 amazing ps4 exclusive to play, depending on what you like.

Horizon Zero Dawn

        Think choose your own adventure.
    Shadow of the colossus... ah, i see, you're a man of culture aswell
You can still enjoy both
    Absolutely! Gotta finish BL3+2 still.
Go buy and play death stranding please
>to quit pc just for this game.

Dude seriously?
    Well I'm exaggerating but yeah. Was getting bored (classic wow, dont judge- nostalgia) so it wasn't a big deal.

                GOW is hands down one of the best games I've played. The story is fantastic.
                    The story and details come together so beautifully! I don't think there's another game I played that months after I finished it gave me so many "ohhh how did I not see that before"-moments when watching Balrog (the producer) talk on different interviews/podcasts
            Plus one to Death Stranding, secured a spot in my favorite games of all time
        New game+ Legends isn‚Äôt lethal, you‚Äôd do just fine.
        Horizon Zero Dawn.
        I recommend God of War. Great Graphics, great fighting mecanics and a amazing story.
            Don‚Äôt forget the amazing soundtrack
                True! The nordic chorus is epic!
                    The music that plays when you cremate Faye still gives me goosebumps
            Thank you
*ITS LIT!*
Yeah, it was the perfect place to drop you into a NG+. And I loved the Echoes Between Worlds quest description. Just the right amount of cheek.
    I will say I miss the beach charge but alas
        I can understand that. But given that up to this scene is essentially (very-well done) tutorials for the game systems, this is the perfect place to drop a returning player.
Mot absurd at all. When something is done beautifully, its totally understandable to have these feelings. Its like people seeing colour for the first time, it makes you realise just how beautiful the world is, and if you've never seen it before, it will move you immediately to tears.
    The game is amazing and hits in so many levels. There was so much effort pit into it-the world feels immersive, the music is fantastic and feels perfect to add the drama, the voice acting, the story, the characters, all that topped off with awesome combat mechanics, and now added content. I don‚Äôt care what sucker punches next game is-im getting it.
>reach

I love how if you slow down to a walk through pampas grass Jin puts his hand out to touch the grass. That little animation detail does so much to immerse the player.
Seems to echo my experience as well. I also got this game on a whim not expecting much. The opening scene was good and the following gameplay was decent but I was still skeptical until I saw this opening scene with the music and I was hooked.
Every single time
Cyberpunk missed this year's cutoff for goty
    Geoff Keighley actually said a month ago that the game awards deadline might actually extend from November 15th to 23rd. So, cyberpunk might actually be a contender for game of the year
I wish but people are still sucking TLOU2‚Äôs depressing dick
    People like different things man. I love Ghost but its tied up between Tlou 2 and Outer Wilds for my goty choices personally.

Edit: Yall really salty over the idea that people like different things lol?
        Cool
        Wasn't Outer Wilds from 2019?
            It was, I do my goty based on when I play and finish them.
                Ah, I think most of these people are arguing about the Golden Joysticks or The Game Awards, not their personal fave
                    Sure but I dont think it would be absurd if Tlou2 won. Its divisive sure but I think that makes it all the more intriguing as a piece of art.
    So you didnt like tlou 2, as much as i like got , id still give goty to tlou 2, to each there own i guess
        Cool
    i‚Äôll replay Ghost of Tsushima about 10 times before i finish my tlou2 play through. Stopped like a third way through. Haven‚Äôt touched it since.
        Agreed my man. Agreed. I finished TLOU2 because I was curious where it would go and I tell ya, I would not trudge through that shit again. I wish I could do a level select to explore different levels again (level design was amazing) but that‚Äôs about it. The story was an unfulfilling mess for me. GoT on the other hand was a godamn beautiful journey from beginning to end. Already enjoying my New Game +
            It didn‚Äôt work for me because they put the characters in situations to try to make a story. Joel and Tommy wouldn‚Äôt be all soft and kind to strangers like that no matter how long he‚Äôs been living happily. As well as ellie leaving the good ending she could‚Äôve had just to not go through with it in the end. An intense, sad pretty grey ending story does not equal GOTY. Now a beautiful, colorful, breathing open world Island with countless side activities and shrines, the smoothest and most rewarding sword combat I‚Äôve ever played, beautiful armor detail and customization, great, memorable characters and a gripping story about having to separate yourself from everything you‚Äôve ever known and at the same time the only family you have left to save your island? now THAT is a GOTY.
                Ah shit. I didn‚Äôt even mention that f*cking soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack. The song that plays in the cutscene before and leading into the final boss fight (iykyk) is fucking beyond fantastic.
                    Right. Was there anything really mew in TLOU2? Great game-great graphics (these days almost a given) and good story. GOT Has all that and more IMO. When I add up each game as a sum of all it‚Äôs parts-I got to give it to GOT, the underdog not the naughty dog :-)
                I‚Äôm with ya there hundo-p. GoT definitely deserves to be GOTY. Will it be able to persevere through the ‚Äúsad=quality‚Äù circle jerk that even seeps into film and television awards? I really hope so.
    Lmao tlou2 sucked ass
Definitely
Hard to believe that this game was better than most movies.
*Yo why is it Xbox*

*Green tinted I thought ghost what*

*An exclusive. Lol*

Definitely. Just having a bit more of a closeups and some canned animations would‚Äôve gone a long way to make sidequests feel more like stories and less like checkmarks.
don't worry! just started ng+ yesterday and still had chills and inexplicably tears spring to my eyes
    What is the new game + then? Its different to the 1st one is it?
        New Game+ is what you would do after you‚Äôve already beat the game once, it unlocks new difficulties, gear, etc. I recommend only doing it once you 100% absolutely everything in the game however
        Late comment, but yes it is different. This is where it starts on NG+.
            Wish I could play komada beach on ng+ though the beach fighting was epic.
    I had the same feeling + the tears, it's impressive how this game is an artwork. 

The other game that had this type of intro was Zelda Breath of the Wild, and it also has the same effect on me.
Oh man, that moment.... after I completed that quest I had to put the controller down and take a few minutes because I was so blown away.
Did that yesterday was one of best moments Ive had gaming without doubt. Would be even better if it had the kill bill sound effects though.
Ooh I‚Äôve been trying to go slowly playing this game cause it‚Äôs so fun and I haven‚Äôt gotten to that yet that should be awesome
I‚Äôd add Days Gone and Metal Gear Solid as well
    MGS isn't PS4 exclusive
Horizon Zero Dawn isn't exclusive anymore, it's released for PC.
Never played Detroit become human, what's it like if you don't mind me asking?
    the gameplay itself is fairly bare bones. imagine a series of quicktime events propped up by a very well written story. its definitely worth getting for the story itself as its pretty engaging and it's got a lot of replayability value
        I'll definitely have to check it out
            [deleted]
                Will do
    If you've ever played a telltale game it's like that except every single aspect is somehow done infinitely better and with a way bigger budget.
    Think choose your own adventure.
Shadow of the colossus... ah, i see, you're a man of culture aswell
Absolutely! Gotta finish BL3+2 still.
Well I'm exaggerating but yeah. Was getting bored (classic wow, dont judge- nostalgia) so it wasn't a big deal. But I haven't played console since ps2/first gen xbox so it was a big change holding a controller again. Now I need a new game to fill the void. Any suggestions? Haven't tried legends yet, not sure if I'd be an anchor. I'm not bad but I don't think I'd last on lethal..
    The PS4 exclusives are the greatest generation of games ever in my opinion. God of War, Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us I/II, and although it was love or hate my favorite game of the year was Death Stranding.
        Ty I was just looking at GoW and the last of us. They look pretty sick
            GOW is hands down one of the best games I've played. The story is fantastic.
                The story and details come together so beautifully! I don't think there's another game I played that months after I finished it gave me so many "ohhh how did I not see that before"-moments when watching Balrog (the producer) talk on different interviews/podcasts
        Plus one to Death Stranding, secured a spot in my favorite games of all time
