[[Did anyone else find the part when Jin unlocks the “ghost stance” super epic like I did]]


First time playing through this has been my favorite part up to now.


The whole battle for Yarikawa is one of my favourite gaming "missions" of my life... The build up to it was so great to end in the way of the Commander's slaughter to the Ghost Stance was just mind blowing the first time around. Really well done Sucker Punch
    Yes when he chops the head off of the leader there was just something about the whole scene, like for the first time he was truly unleashed
        And the way the enemies were scrambling away from you in terror for the first time, you really felt the transition to the GHOST! Epic moment
        By this point my Jin was quite powerful; I had searched all of the map, done all the stand-off straw hat fights, got the legendary defenders armour, two mythic abilities and the poison darts.

I thought I had made Jin late-game powerful and godly. So yes, when that ghost stance happened (I was on hard mode and it was stylish to get up to that point with the power creep), i audibly went “wtf! Oh my god. JIN YOU ARE A GOD!”

It was epic.
            When you unlock all of the mythics and all resolve points, you will be comboing the mythics, killing bosses without dropping a sweat
                I know, I platted the game in the first week and I ran the Iyo raid the first week it came out. Highly recommend those if you haven’t done them.
                    I haven't play those since my ki is 35 and no Legendarys
            Awesome! Lol
That's  at Yarikawa, right?

My favorite  build for this game is the Fear build.  Trinkets and armor to maximize chance  of fear and panic in Mongols. And pop ghost stance to slay those gripped in fear.

I cackled every time.
    At the end of my first playthrough that's what my build was as well. Felt like I spent more time chasing down fleeing enemies than I did actually fighting lol.
        Same, my build went from a stereotypical samurai at the beginning to the ghost build

Both are insanely fun

                Wait, really?  The game's weather changes to follow Jin's decisions?  I noticed a lot of storms in my playthrough but just figured it was different environments as I went north.  

Is there any way you can see where you are on the "Ghost meter" like in the Star Wars KOTOR games or RDR2?
    How good! Hit ghost stance and wipe a few. A few more get terrified. Easy kills....recharge ghost stance.
    Lmao the build I’m going with is basically a glass cannon, maximize damage and stand off streak and chain assassination but focus less on defense, it’s great
    This build didn’t even sound interesting to me until I had all of the tools to pull it off and then you are right man. So satisfying
    Fear/Flame Ghost build ftw
One of my favorite gaming moments ever!!!
I had goosebumps. Both times.
    Such an awesome scene!
I’ll probably remember the Battle of Yarikawa on my deathbed dude, that shit was LOTR-tier
    That’s honestly a perfect way to describe that whole mission
Probably my favorite scene from the game.
yeah its super cool and ghost stance itself is incredibly cool, its just pity that it becomes double adged sword after some time, since you literally cant have nice weather once you unlock it. You use ghost stance - there is storm, you have full ghost stance - weather is constantly stormy, reverthing back after 10min even after you use flute. So the only way to keep nice weather is to keep ghost stance not full, which can only be done by getting yourself hit by enemy.

Its even worse in ng+ where you have stormy weather since begining.
    Yeah one feature that would be nice is the ability to set the weather. Clear, cloudy, thunderstorm, raining, or just dynamic. While the effect on the weather is an awesome feature, it drives me away from playing as a ghost sometimes.
        The flute changes the weather depending on what song you play
            Yeah I know but the issue is the weather changing again 5 minutes later. We should be able to set it permanently so it doesn’t change
            Why would you comment this. This thread literally discusses those options and it’s clear the post youre responding to knows this.


“The sky is blue and grass is green, FYI in case you didn’t know”
    I never noticed this but I was also getting annoyed at the constant storms even with flute usage.
        yep once ghost stance is unlocked it doesnt matter how much you flute, with full ghost meter stormy weather will start after every fast travel or after some time even after using flute. Pretty stupid decision imo, give you option to control weather and than make core combat mechanic that takes that option away.
            honestly this explains a lot — I heard storms get more commonplace towards the end of the day but I was wondering why they’re taking place every couple of minutes , probably because I have ghost mode ready.
            What the heck, I had no idea. Not a fan either.
The whole siege of yarikawa mission is just amazing. I remember the first time I ve played it. I was like screaming at my screen at 7 a.m. For the ghost! Yarikawa!
“Invaders, look at your general. Run! Or this will be your fate!” Top 3 best quotes of the whole game.
Just got there last night! Super Epic!
    Me too
the Ghost of yarikawa quest was such a  life changing event. as a big fan of samurai flicks I was waiting for some amputation's and decapitations up to that point. its also the fact that while bracing for the Mongols to breach the village you hear the people calling you "the Ghost" as you walk past. Just a overall badass moment in the game.
    Yeah, i really like how the game actually makes you feel like the ghost with the character interactions and the combat. None of that skyrim shit where you are the most powerful hero to walk the earth but everyone still treats you like a punk.
I had to put the controller down and take a few minutes to calm down. Been a long time since I’ve been that affected by a game. The epic soundtrack definitely helps.
That's probably my favourite part of the entire game.. I had goosebumps. everything just aligned perfectly.
amazing setting, amazing music, boss fight and then NEW COOL ANIMATIONS + NEW GAMEPLAY MECHANIC + GREAT STORY BEAT all at the same time. oh and seeing them cower and run as Jin rallies the men. God I loved it.
    Like a scene from a movie!
Tbh I was so caught off guard that I was unlocking a new crazy “power” this late in the game. I’m assembling the blowgun now, which I also didn’t expect. This game rules!!!
I love that scene even on my second playthrough it's still fun to strike them with fear
It’s super epic every time I use it and with the charm of ghostly fury, forget about it.
Top 5 best gaming moment for me of all time. I was so hyped when the screen turned, and Jin started speaking. So in awe I don't even think I attacked the enemy for a good 4-5 seconds lol
Just did it this afternoon and I agree. It’s on that same level as Braithwaite Manor in RDR2
This is actually probably my favorite moment in any video game. The build up is amazing. The whole time we are fighting a superior force and on the back foot. The battle is falling back and we are on our last line of defense. Now we have to face this badass commander? Tough battle and then at the end it says slaughter. Damn that charge was amazing. All of our allies join in. It was so cool!
I hyped myself up for that fight and then I’m the end when I chopped the guys head of I started freaking out cause it was so cool
Loved that whole segment; from being a straight-up badass with the debut of the Ghost stance, and Jin's pep talk to the villagers afterwards, that more or less went:

"But we're not warriors!"

"You just beat those mongols; fuck yeah, you're warriors!!"
I wish tales were replayable but then I just settled for having a separate save file just for The Ghost of Yarikawa
It's probably one of my favorite moments in the game, along with the scene of Jin terrorizing the Mongols at the gate.
It was my second favorite moment in ghost of tsushima
    What was your favourite?
        Probably either the khan's death or the final duel
It’s so epic. That whole Yarikawa part is definitely my favorite part. I’ve played it in its entirety 3 times now and I still get so excited hearing the music during that whole sequence.
    When he screamed get to the gate I was going crazy!!
And the repercussions of it are felt throughout most of the game after that point. From both sides.
    I loved how Kahn was talking about it after the scene
I lost my mind. Will never forget that moment as long as I live. Absolutely incredible
    I couldn’t believe when he lobbed of his head. As much violence as there is it was so epic to see him chop off a head.
        For sure that was cool! Chasing the Mongols out while Jin yells RUN COWARDS was just so memorable for me. That moment where he really understands the power of the Ghost
massive turning point in generating the myth of the ghost
The ghost stance cut scene is so badass!
I didn’t expect that at all but it had perfect execution. The timing, atmosphere, they couldn’t have picked a better time to reveal that ability.
yes it literally gave me chills. and i was wearing the sakai armor with the helmet covering his eyes and it made it that much more badass. probably my favorite tale in the game.
    It was just so amazing. It just so powerful
I was confused when the "slaughter" prompt came up and then lost it once I realized what was happening haha
It's my favorite gaming moment of all time. At that moment, I felt god damn invincible. The point where you're like like, shit not again are we going to lose once again and then Jin is like, not this time, not this damn time.
I know this sounds super corny, but for the first time in a long time I felt invigorated while playing a game. 

I was so salty at the mongols and I was uptight because my uncle kept saying I was dishonorable. Even before unlocking the stance I was feeling like a God of wrath, but once I saw that stance I almost nutted.
I sat on the “press square to slaughter” screen for a good 15 mins contemplating whether I wanted to lose all my honour with a single button press.
The best moment in the game IMO.
YES! That was so freaking epic. Such an awesome way to introduce something new to the game.
I hopped on my couch out of hype when chopped off the leader’s head, so uh yeah...I thought it was awesome.
The legendary Battle of Yarikawa. Completed twice still get the same badass feels even when I know what's gonna happen next. Also the music adds even more feels to the part.
This is my first play through, no joke today I finished the Yarikawa quest and Ghost stance is easily one of my favourite features. Super useful in tight situations and it’s a good payoff for consecutively taking no damage while killing/killing a leader.
Second best quest after the six blades of Kojiro
I believe this is the first complete decapitation in the game? and the way Jin just FLEXES on them when by all right's they had him outnumbered.  


yeah realllly epic!
I love the fact how there was no spoilers for it. The slaughter completely caught of guard. And it was the moment you knew that Jin has finally excepted "The Ghost".
    I love how it all seemed lost, then it was as if Jin knew what he needed to do, send a message as brutally as possible to the mongols and to his people that he was in fact “the ghost”
Dude I just unlocked it less than an hour ago, and found it the most satisfying and epic moments of the game (so far). I fuckin love this game and it's one of my top 5 favorite games ever.
    Same here!! I can’t stop playing once I start
        Are you going for Platinum? I'm 58 hours in now, and almost done with Act II. I've liberated all of Izuhara, and just fully upgraded the sakai katana. I'm currently 35% done with main trophies and I can't wait to earn my first ever Platinum Trophy :)
            I’m going to try
Yeah definitely. It's like in Avatar the last airbender when Aang enters the avatar state for the first time
Yes, there was something cinematic about it in the truest sense of things, sending us back to the classic Kurosawa feel through the music and dynamism. Though I enjoyed the moments from the aftermath of it all even more, when Jin shouted that bit about "who killed these Mongols?!", when I paused a bit through my blood-rushing experience and wondered if Jin meant it in an arrogant way. But nah... he was just breathing the same godly power he used to send fear in the hearts of the Mongols who witnessed his unleash into the very hearts of the folks of Yarikawa, hoisting a flag of unity at the heart of Tsushima itself.
honestly I was NOT ready for him to go god damn Super Saiyan on the Mongol Commander, I loved it, he just became so ANGRY that he tore clean through a Mongol with such ferocity unseen from any warrior let alone any Samurai they had encountered that it sent them all packing as he began to pick off the straglers at the rear as they run to the gates..

it's honestly a great and just all around spectacular moment in the story, truly begining to solidify Jin's decent into The Ghost and showing us all the rage he has held down since the invasion began, bringing forth all the strength he has left in a last ditch effort to slaughter the Mongol's and save the village..

SuckerPunch worked so hard on the story and I just cannot praise it enough for it's amazing portrayal of the invasion of Tsushima and making a twist explination as to the real reason why they failed to take it and invade mainland Japan
Does anyone else actually dislike ghost stance? The combat is so fun that it ruins it if you can one hit kill enemies through their block. 

It was an awesome scene in the game though I’ll give you that
[deleted]
    Was it the moment when the doc shuts the pain inhibitors?
        [deleted]
            Damn that moment was cool af tho it was ruined for me cuz I died alot lmao.
I’m not sure .... do you have a clip?
Yes 🙌🏻 I was blown away
i’ve just played that part and it was so COOL!!!!! i’m loving the game thus far
it was the first time i've got an adrenaline rush from a video game that resembled adrenaline from physical activity
    It kinda of felt like an original God Of War moment... like a real holy shit did that just happen
Honestly I was so confused about what happened that I stood in the ghost stance for a bit longer than I should have and it started to look a little awkward lmao
Nope, I forgot about it until now. 


JK, I literally had no idea it was coming and about went super saiyan in real life when it first happened. 

Not sure there has ever been a moment in a video game that provoked such an adrenaline rush.
I was turned on
Oh my god. When I first saw him stab the mongol chief's back and then proceed to BEHEAD HIM in front of the other Mongols I nerdgasmed. One the most thrilling moments of any video game I've played.
Yes. It was fucking insane lol.
Ghost Stance and Sakai Armor were staples once I acquired them. With the Inari mask. Did a lot of archery and stealth too. Whole game I only touched my kunai for tools and mostly to stagger the harder enemies. Haven't gotten into my new game+ yet but I'm excited to mix it up and try a different style of play.
Best moment in the game for me
I found it terrifying actually.
I always save this mission for last before finishing the second act. I feel so powerful going right into the castle sequence from Yarikawa
i had a massive “what the f***” moment it was fantastic and one of the most memorable moments i’ve ever had playing a video game. complete surprise i had no idea it was coming.
Fucking loved the whole questline for the siege of Yarikawa
That's my favorite part of the story
My jaw dropped I swear to god
I have completed this game 4 times but still I find Yarikawa mission one of my all time favourite missions ever. Its just so amazing.
yyyyyyYYYYEEESSSSSSS
I did too. The battle of Yarikawa is my favorite part.
The tsushuma suite II  shurai  playing the background simply nails it . The music has given me hope in several distressful times . 

FOR YARIKAWA , FOR THE GHOST !
Best mission in the game it was so fucking awesome I felt like the biggest badass. Easily one of my all time favourite missions only beat by some real gems from RDR2
Super epic indeed !
Hell yeah
I love how this game introduces new mechanics such as the ghost stance. Spectacular presentation.
Yes!! It was one of my moment fort when I played ng+ it culminated in me beating temuge in lethal + with no Charmes in the hot spring suit. Such a great story
I really like it but what's missing is dismemberment in this game there isn't many dismemberment
I think there's no other impact from this game...
I cried when the battle ended. Such an epic plot.
hands down coolest gamer moment of 2020
One of my top video game moments of my life, if not the very top of the list. Having the game on japanese dub is a huge plus. Hearing everything goes down with japanese voicing their battle cries was so godamn amazing.
After beating and getting platinum for this, every other game I've played since just feels so underwhelming... Like Valhalla after beating Ghost... Absolute trash... Ghost is truly a work of art
Whole game was fucking epic!!!  But yes when I got the Ghost Stance I was super amped!!!
The entire game is epic
The specific moment where you finally learn the ghost stance to finish off your arsenal, then run into battle screaming “For Yarikawa” is definitely one of the most insane scenes in gaming and it will remain that way
You don’t just witness Jin’s epic Ghost Stance, you feel it!  [GHOST STANCE REACTIONS](https://youtu.be/ZIHVWqCBCY0)
My favorite part of the game
I cannot wait for you to keep playing...

It somehow gets even better from there
    I can’t wait
I had kensei armor on so I rampaged down the ramp throwing kunai and dance of wrath. I got ghost stance 2 or 3 times without ever going hand to hand. It felt awesome.
I felt like Jack and rose on the front the of the titanic.  "I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD"
Did anyone else find that epic moment that was made to be epic, epic like me alone did?
That’s like the entire point of unlocking the stance
No. You're the only one who found that super epic.
No not really. I wasn’t disappointed but I thought it was gonna be more cinematic
At the end of the mission when he's all like "I saved your town" I never laughed so hard in my life
No

Yes, everyone did, its epic, its honestly so cool-
I was playing it for hours one night and I got to that mission at like 3am and I was in the zone and I’m pretty sure I did it flawless because of how epic it was.
Yeah at first I thought, wow that was brutal then I saw them all running and I stated throwing kunai and I chased them back to the catapults.
This was my favorite moment of the whole game
Yes.
The real question is: didn't anyone find it epic! Because just wow how they intruduced it was insane.
Yes when he chops the head off of the leader there was just something about the whole scene, like for the first time he was truly unleashed
    And the way the enemies were scrambling away from you in terror for the first time, you really felt the transition to the GHOST! Epic moment
    By this point my Jin was quite powerful; I had searched all of the map, done all the stand-off straw hat fights, got the legendary defenders armour, two mythic abilities and the poison darts.

I thought I had made Jin late-game powerful and godly. So yes, when that ghost stance happened (I was on hard mode and it was stylish to get up to that point with the power creep), i audibly went “wtf! Oh my god. JIN YOU ARE A GOD!”

It was epic.
        When you unlock all of the mythics and all resolve points, you will be comboing the mythics, killing bosses without dropping a sweat
            I know, I platted the game in the first week and I ran the Iyo raid the first week it came out. Highly recommend those if you haven’t done them.
                I haven't play those since my ki is 35 and no Legendarys
        Awesome! Lol
At the end of my first playthrough that's what my build was as well. Felt like I spent more time chasing down fleeing enemies than I did actually fighting lol.
    Same, my build went from a stereotypical samurai at the beginning to the ghost build

Both are insanely fun
        [deleted]
            Wait, really?  The game's weather changes to follow Jin's decisions?  I noticed a lot of storms in my playthrough but just figured it was different environments as I went north.  

Is there any way you can see where you are on the "Ghost meter" like in the Star Wars KOTOR games or RDR2?
How good! Hit ghost stance and wipe a few. A few more get terrified. Easy kills....recharge ghost stance.
