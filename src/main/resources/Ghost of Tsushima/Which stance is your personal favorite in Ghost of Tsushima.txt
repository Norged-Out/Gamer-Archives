[[Which stance is your personal favorite in Ghost of Tsushima]]


In my opinion, I believe the the water stance is the best for most opponents. In my time playing the game I have beaten it two or three times, in this time I have mainly used water stance because of the overpowered quick heavy attacks. I believe that the water stance is the best stance in the game. What is your favorite stance in Ghost of Tsushima?


For me, it's Wind Stance, and it has nothing to do with gameplay utility. It's entirely because the heavy attacks look so cool, and punting dudes across a field will always be funny to me.
    Yep. Wind imo because I also be punting mongols across the screen lol. Plus it also puts a lot of stagger damage, usually

Someone went on top of a watch tower, waited for Mongols to climb up, and he kicked them clear off the tower, one at a time, like he was skeet shooting LOL. Couldn't stop laughing.
        I saw that one! Had a good laugh.
        Bro it’s 4 am in the Monday morning I’m grumpy because of work and I still laughed my ass off that video, thank you sir
    Here here. I also prefer the default pose of Wind Stance over any of the others.
        I like it because Jin seems to always drop into that stance after attacking, even when using the other stances
The stab of the stone stance has a lot of utility but I always feel like I have to use water stance to get past shields fast.
Water stance for me. Every other enemy is easy to maneuver around, but it’s difficult to get a hit in on shield enemies without using ghost weapons, so definitely water stance.
I like moon stance just for it's spinning attack and being able to get a few people at once even though it's usually Impractical to use. I like to use the wrong stance for whatever enemy I'm fighting just for lols and added difficulty.
Stone Stance is the most balanced, with it's quick Heavy Attacks and precise thrust finishers. Sheild Guys can be taken care of with Jump Kicks followed by staggering Stone Stance Heavy Attacks.
For me it’s the shield stance and I feel that’s a lot of other peoples favorite stance as well. But the basic stance you get when you first start the game is a solid stance all around; im sure you could get through the whole game just using said stance!
idk I didn't wanna worry about switching so I only used stone
    How-..... What difficulty did you play on?
        hard. I'm a sekiro dweeb so I got pretty good at timing parries and all that. most of the time I mainly had trouble with shield enemies so I just used ghost weapons for them
Buffalo stance.
    So don’t you get fresh with me
wind stance looks dope asfuck
Wind by far looks the best

Water because of the sheer amount of axe or spear wielding enemies
Stone Stance, bc the impalling charged triangle attack can 1hk most enemies regardless of their weapon.
    Yeah that’s what I mainly use against bosses, no matter what weapon style the use. Anything to get them staggered and then the stone triple stab deals really nice damage
Water stance for that flurry attack. I forgot what it’s called.
That flurry attack with water stance is so damn stylish to finish groups off with
I use stone most.  Stance is irrelevant when you wear Sarugami.
Water stance. You get so many hits with the charged heavy hits, and the shield users are the most annoying to fight without proper tools imo
For me, it's stone stance because once you max it, the triangle strikes are just so powerful.
I usually use water because its fun to strike that fast with the hold triangle attack, but I also like the stab with stone stance. Overall though, water is my favorite.
Stone stance because I feel like samurai
Ghost Stance because it's so dramatic and *terrifyingly* delicious.
Gunslinger
Water, the fluidity of it is just what makes it good overall
Stone stance
Water downpour is awesome
Moon
[i have recently embraced the full force of 2 kicks to the fucking face with moon stance](https://youtu.be/-t1HR6q0Yj0)
Personally my favorite is the Moon Stance, just cause you keep getting your ass kicked by Brutes then once you get the Moon Stance you get your revenge
Yep. Wind imo because I also be punting mongols across the screen lol. Plus it also puts a lot of stagger damage, usually
