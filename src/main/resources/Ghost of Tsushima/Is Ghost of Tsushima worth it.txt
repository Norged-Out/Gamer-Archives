[[Is Ghost of Tsushima worth it]]


So GoT is on sale right now but I'm currently playing God of War 2018 for the first time and planning to buy Ragnorok when I'm done so should I buy Ghost of Tsushima right now to keep it in my collection or is it not worth it. Edit: thanks for the comments (the most i've ever gotten in a post) i've decided to buy the game!! wish mel uck


 **Ghost of Tsushima** directors cut is on ps+ i believe but i may be wrong
    i don't have ps plus :(
        It‚Äôs probably cheaper to just get PS+ for a 2 months and play it if money is a problem.
            honestly if u end up playing atleast 2 games a year that are on the service you get your moneys worth out of year long psplus extra tier sub.
                Is extra or premium better?
                    The middle tier is the best. Don't bother with the most expensive one.
            If he does that he needs to add Returnal to the playlist. Amazing game.
             Yearly option is significantly cheaper tho.
                Yearly is not cheaper than 2 months. 

The comment you replied to assumed OP's ONLY intention is to play GoT.
                    Then op should just buy the game
            Depends, I finished GoT and play online sometimes, but to be fair their online game ends up being more of the same
            With the price of games now a days for me in Canada is the price of 1 game so it‚Äôs worth it.
        Just buy PS Plus Extra for 1 month. It will most likely be cheaper & you will get a bunch more games than just GoT. If you don't end up liking GoT then there's a bunch more games on there that will make the subscription worth it.

But to answer your original question, Yes GoT is definitely worth it. I'm playing it now after I just beat God of War Ragnarok (AMAZING game btw) and the graphics/fighting style is so good.
        Get ps+. Try it out for a month or two.  So many great games on there that I may not buy another disc again.
        Also you can upgrade to ps+ for however long your current membership is and you only have to pay accordingly.. just don‚Äôt forget to turn off auto renewal
        It's cheaper to get that instead of ghost of Tsushima tbh and your progress is saved if you ever actually buy it
        Worth ps plus just to complete got,gow and star wars,horizon etc üëçüèº
I just finished it 3 days ago and it was beautiful
    "GET OUT OF HERE, DEWEY! YOU DON'T WANT THIS! IT TURNS ALL YOUR BAD FEELINGS INTO GOOD ONES... ITS A NIGHTMARE!"
        wow this film isn't referenced enough
everyone go out and watch walk hard, it's brilliant
        YOU DONT WANT NO PART OF THIS SHIT
            I think I kind of want it
        "Think I wanna try me some of that, kakane..."
        ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs non-habit forming!‚Äô
            It makes sex even **better**!
        Ha
         Not once did you pay for drugs!!!
        Can ya dumb it down a bit doc? We ain‚Äôt scientist.
Is one of the best games on PS4/PS5 worth it? You shouldn't be on Reddit, you should be playing the game.
    Eh I tried to get Into it but I couldn‚Äôt. Which I was surprised about because it‚Äôs usually my type of game. 

Everyone is different tho. No doubt the game is good.
        No, I know what you mean. Like I don't care at all for the new God of War games, but I recognize they are good.
            Yeah idk if it‚Äôs me getting older (going from teens to twenties) but I‚Äôve noticed it takes a really impressive game (to me particularly) to make me want to grind it. Currently searching for a game like that cause I miss the grind I used to be able to do but I just can‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm confused
                For sure, loved those new GOW games myself but respect you knowing different strokes for different folks. Hope you get that game you love soon bruv
                Man I‚Äôm going through that same issue right now. I keep buying all these new single player open world RPG games because I used to love them and was a main reason I got a PS5 but now I can‚Äôt finish one. I play it for an hour or two and then get off it to go play a fast paced multiplayer game with friends, basically never touching the game again until I delete it for space for the next game that I can waste my money on.
                    I swear it‚Äôs an endless cycle. You just describes how I‚Äôve been the last like 3 years üòÇüò≠
                When I went from my teens to my early to mid twenties, I went through the same thing. It was really hard for me to find a game I liked and it had to be really good. I went from playing all the time, to playing pretty rarely and pretty much in little binges on the rare occasion I found an amazing game. Then when I got to around 30, I started getting less picky again and enjoying games a bit more again, but definitely leaning more towards story driven than I used to when I was younger. IDK, I'm just saying it might come back around for you. Maybe I got a bit desensitized to games or something, and the break helped me appreciate them again.
                    I totally understand that, when I do get into a game that I‚Äôm really enjoying I think it makes it better because of how long it‚Äôs been since I found a game like that. 

The story is definitely becoming much more important to me as I get older I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm hoping once I get a little older it will come back again and I can delve into more games like I used to. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who as gone through this!
                I was just like you. And this helped. I‚Äôm probably butchering the comment but I read something like this

‚ÄúThe problem isn‚Äôt games, but us. We think playing video games is doing every side mission and gathering every collectible we can along the way AND THEN doing the main missions. We just don‚Äôt have enough time for that anymore. Side missions and collectibles are added on top of the campaign.‚Äù
                    That is so true. Video games have gotten so long and so packed I just don‚Äôt have the time to sit down and grind it all out like I could when I was young. Kinda sucks but I think it makes the games I REALLY get into much more enjoyable in a way.
                If you're into open world games, I'd suggest:

* Elden Ring
* Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West
* Days Gone
* Assassin's Creed Unity / Syndicate / Origins
* Arkahm Knight
                    I‚Äôve been meaning to check out elden ring, but I have played syndicate (my favorite assassins creed game of all time) and I didn‚Äôt play origins but I did play valhalla and I LOVE that one. Origins is definitely text on my list for assassins creed. 

Now that you mention Arkahm knight it reminds me of the older games and I honestly might need to try them out again. 

I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and that‚Äôs been pretty fun so far in all honesty. But it‚Äôs not the same as something like Spider-Man lol
                        Syndicate was super fun. I loved the way they recreated Victorian London; the rope launcher was reminiscent of Arkham Knight, which IMO is the ultimate Batman simulator. The 1989 Batmobile DLC made the end game even better.

Origins on the other hand had an exceptionally compelling story. If you do end up getting the game, I'd recommend the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC because it allows Bayek to be upgraded to level 45 at the start of the game, making it feel more like the earlier AC titles. Alexandria is probably may favorite on the map.

If you haven't played through Unity yet, that's an equally excellent game. The outfits, weapons, lighting, parkour, and environmental design of Paris during the French Revolution is impeccable. I wish it didn't have such a rocky launch.

Have you tried out any of the Dark Souls games or Bloodborne / Sekiro before?
                            I haven‚Äôt tried sekiro yet, but I have tried dark souls, I just haven‚Äôt sat down to play like I should lol it‚Äôs a pretty fun game and I know I‚Äôd enjoy that one. I forgot I HAVE played unity and really need to get back into it, that game started so rough but it‚Äôs so much better than when it launched
                I'm 33 and loved playing The Callisto Protocol, and nobody really seems to like it...probably because it's considered a Dead Space wannabe, I dunno.

Or maybe I'm just angry about my brokerage account tanking and really needed to smash some space zombies in the face lol.
                    Is it much different from the first game? Been wanting to check the first one out but heard it‚Äôs just a walking sim lol.
        Out of curiosity, what similar games do you usually enjoy? No judgement and I promise I will not post a follow up question.
            I couldn't get into it either and I typically really enjoy games like that. Tbh part of it was probably that it made me feel really motion sick for some reason.
                It wasn‚Äôt even that for me (though I can understand it) I can even explain why it just didn‚Äôt feel that fun to me. I think it‚Äôs less of the game and more of just me
            I mean almost any open world game, I‚Äôm not picky when it comes to game. I‚Äôll play anything from swords and shields to guns and bombs to puzzles and mind games. 

Recently I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and assassins creed Valhalla with some for honor when my pals on online (rarely lol, I need more ps4 play buddies)
        I‚Äôm the same, though I think my problem was I just finished Spider-Man Miles Morales so it was jarring to go from a fast paced, high maneuverability game to something more slow paced and methodical. 

I plan on giving it another go later cause i do want to experience the story.
        Was pretty much the opposite for me lol - I got really into it, which was surprising because it‚Äôs not really my type of game. Open world games usually aren‚Äôt my thing - I don‚Äôt have the time/patience for all the walking between objectives these days.
    Agreed with this. It really should have won game of the year that year instead of LOU2 :( but I'm biased toward Japanese lore games haha. It was beautiful and heartbreaking.
    well i'm kinda at school sooo....
        Yeah, I wasnt really being literal. But you should definitely buy it if you like that type of game. I loved it and played through it twice.
i got my ps5 a month ago and just finished ghost of tsushima, i loved it!

i just got a month of ps extra for 14 bucks tho, didnt buy it - but probably will at some point.
It was the first game I played on my PS5. If you like story focused games, this is a masterclass imo. A lot of side content is rinse and repeat and it can get boring after a long grind, but once you go back to the main story it becomes amazing again. 

8/10 highly recommend
    I Second the comment toward repetitiveness. Amazing game, I loved every second of it. But after a while it does become ‚ÄúGo here, fight this. Go Here fight that. Follow this person to there, fight someone else.‚Äù 

The one on one duels are sensational tho
        Some of the story side quests were awesome and just as good as the main quest, but all the random side activities like the shrines, haiku, foxes, birds, bamboo poles, enemy camps, etc. got really damn repetitive. It was the first game I got platinum on, so I still did it all, but that stuff was a slog.
Dude, it is 1000% worth it. The story, graphics, replayability, everything. Buy it ASAP.
It didnt hook me like I wanted it to. It is beautiful though
I found it boring and very repetitive.
Beautiful game, but gets repetitive very quickly
It is very much worth it
The question is offensive.........GO PUT YOUR ASS IN THE COUCH, BUY THE GAME AND BEHOLD THIS VISUAL MASTERPIECE!!!!
[removed]
    [removed]
        Enjoy. One of the cleanest looking graphics, combat and UI.
I do agree it‚Äôs a beautiful game, but shallow. Open world and side content are boring.
    Yeah, it‚Äôs very repetitive and the story isn‚Äôt exactly anything to write home about. Like 2/3rds of the way through the game I realized I wasn‚Äôt even having fun anymore and stopped playing it. I played Sekiro next, which to me was a more enjoyable sword combat game in every way possible.
        Sekiro has the best sword combat in any game ever IMO.
            It is so fucking good. I enjoyed it the first time a played it a lot, but couldn‚Äôt fucking beat the final boss for so long. Finally mastered it after literally weeks of trying, and then started NG+‚Ä¶ It is SO MUCH FUN once you have truly mastered the combat. Felt like such a badass beating bosses first try that took me a long time previously.
                It took me forever to figure out. I went in as a huge fan of the souls games and Bloodborne, but I‚Äôve always been pretty shit at video games and Sekiro removed all the crutches I learned to lean on in the other FromSoft games - no option to choose an easier playstyle, no way to over-level, no carefully selecting the best armor to protect me from a tough boss, no grinding for weapon upgrade materials, etc. I also never really used parries in any of the other games, so it was a rude awakening discovering the entire combat system was built around the mechanic I had always ignored lol. All that really contributed to making it one of my favorite games though - it forced me to actually master the mechanics, and every boss I beat after that felt like something I could truly take credit for instead of something that I was only able to do after taking a bunch of steps to make the game easier. Like you said, it makes you deal fucking badass.
I‚Äôm a big martial arts buff, so this game was a spiritual experience for me. Maybe not the greatest game I ever played, but definitely one of my favorites. Easy to platinum too.

If you like martial arts, ninja, or Japanese culture, the main story is well worth your time. Also, play on 4K cause this game is GORGEOUS!
Depends, do you like the very copy and paste ubisoft  open world formula? If so you'll enjoy Tsushima. 

I found it tiresomely boring as I'm pretty over that formula and Tsushima did little to shake things up (at least in the early game).
    Thank you. I feel like ont of the only people who doesn't swear by this game. I finished it but it was a struggle towards the end.

Originally I thought I would complete multiple playthroughs by the end I was surprised I finished one.
I asked myself this same question about a week ago when I got done with RE4. It really is an amazing game. Super awesome, great story, fantastic gameplay and controls.
WORTH IT. 
I never replay games but I‚Äôm replaying it now for the Director‚Äôs Cut. It is even better than I remember, and I loved it the first time around.
Yes! You can get the directors cut for so cheap these days, the cheapness is a crime for how good it is.
So so good. The story is serviceable, not fantastic, but it‚Äôs more than made up for by the world and gameplay.
Sword combat feels amazing and the world is beautiful. I think you could take a break with it between god of war games.
It's a fantastic game, I did get a bit fatigued by the end though and I didn't thoroughly explore the areas of act 2 and 3 the same way I did for act 1. However, I still had an AMAZING experience.
Definitely worth it. It‚Äôs long, and if you‚Äôre tryna do everything it can get repetitive at times, but it‚Äôs visually stunning and the story is great.
I stopped playing because of the insane about of motion blur that's in the game even though it runs at 60 fps on PS5. I could only enjoy the beauty when standing still.
This question doesn't even make sense.
It's astonishingly beautiful to look at but the gameplay is like a 7/10 maybe. It's highly repetitive.
You can get it through the ps plus prescription for the price of 2 games yearly. Just fyi
3 letters, Y E S
Playing both games on Hard mode is ridiculous üò≠
A B S O F U C K I N G L U T E L Y ! ! !
I tried playing this game i really did but I FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BORING
It gets boring soon doing the same thing everytime , the graphics is stunning tho
I didn't like it and yes I do realise that I'm in the minority. It just didn't click for me for some reason. It looks great but at the same time the activities are all kind of bland and unrewarding.

I lost count of the number of times I was asked to follow footprints in the mud. Like a ridiculous amount of missions and side missions will have you following footprints in the mud.

At times it all felt very cut and paste. But like I said, I know I'm in the minority and that the majority of people who have played this game rave about it.

I'm not usually picky or overly critical of video games as I find the vast majority always have some redeeming features. But not ghost of tsushima at least not for me.
It's one of the few games I actually beat. *I have a massive backlog and bounce around games a lot*
It gets old, quickly. That‚Äôs my opinion. Open world fatigue is something special in this game
If you aren't going to play it now you should wait. Games don't go on sale just once, and they almost always eventually hit a better sale. I enjoyed it quite a bit, it's a standard open world game like Horizon or Days Gone, but the combat is really well designed.
This question insults your intelligence. It's a masterfully crafted work of art and worth full $60 price for the vanilla version. Do yourself a favor and buy the complete edition no matter the already discounted price. The team won and honorary award for their research in the history. Get it, how many raving reviews do you need to google to be convinced???? Reddit really going to tip your scales??? FFS!!
    Not everyone has the same opinion with these big triple a games.

What insults their intelligence is the inability to make a decision by themselves.
        >What insults their intelligence is the inability to make a decision by themselves.

How is creating a reddit post to have people tell them to buy it deciding for themselves?
            Its not. Thats my point.
    While I agree more people should just watch reviews etc, why buy the more expensive version lmao. Just because you like it doesn‚Äôt mean everyone should. Dumb comment
        It's not a matter of personal opinion. This work is truly quality and it's beyond subjectivity. If you can't respect that. It's simply lost on you.
            Well it is subjective because while it's not a bad game I did not enjoy it that much.
            Winning awards doesn‚Äôt make something objectively art. I mean, how often do you buy films just because they won an Oscar?  
  
I can agree that GoT looks gorgeous but at its core it‚Äôs just a really nice AC2. If those types of games aren‚Äôt for you then this is a subjectivity ‚Äúbad‚Äù game.
            Saying something like this makes your earlier opinion meaningless.
    This. Listen to this person.
        Props bro/sis
You wont be disappointed!
100% YES.
You should get Ghost of Tsushima ASAP! It‚Äôs an amazing game. The open world is so beautiful.
Its a good game but extremely overrated. I‚Äôd give it a 7/10 on number scale. Average to good which Is better than being aggressively average. The best thing about the game Is the presentation, everything else is very derivative and kinda boring.
Skip side quests and only go for exploring/main story and you will get a fantastic and unique experience. Combat is truly amazing and diverse without ever being complicated, and the world is just plain beautiful.
Unpopular opinion but I found GoT very boring.
Yep. It's worth it. Better play Ragnorok after GoW then do GoT. I had a feeling that might have GoT2 in the future.
I would buy it a second time with no remorse its fantastic!
For the aesthetic yes, the story was good but by no means a masterpiece.
I'm going to go against the grain here and say it's not that great. Don't get me wrong it's not bad but it's no GOTY or GOAT.

It's visually very pretty. The game play is OK but not particularly unique or polished for the style of game. I also didn't enjoy the story that much.

If it was this of God of War I would pick GOW everytime.
Absolutely worth it. It's a gorgeous and brilliant open world action game. I couldn't get enough of it until I platinumed on PS4. Now I have the director's cut for PS5 and want to go through it all over again.
Absolutely worth it. Awesome game.
It's 100% worth it. It's in my top 5 favourite games of all time. 

I replayed the entire game twice (bought it in 2021), and the story of this game is just great, and to me it is the best art direction I've seen of the PS4 era. 

You will not regret playing this masterpiece.
I personally couldn't get into it. But I'm in the extreme minority when I say that haha
    Heh, that's how I feel when I tell people I gave up on Red Dead Redemption after the first mission.
        Same with the witcher for me. I must have tried starting that game like 6 different times because of all the rave reviews it got. Never made it past like 3 hours haha, it's just a me thing. Or maybe because I'm just getting older lol
            aw man i‚Äôm sorry to hear that. i just finished the witcher not long ago and i really loved it. the story is great and there‚Äôs a lot of decision-making that affects the story
Personally I hated this game and it broke my interest in ps exclusives. It‚Äôs very repetitive and the world is so uninteresting. The story is just whatever. A game I can‚Äôt understand the hype for at all. My recommendation is against but it seems you‚Äôve already purchased it so I hope it‚Äôs a game you really enjoy.
I was disappointed by it. I got through probably 60% of the game and a ton of side stuff before I got burnt out on it. Really beautiful game and obviously a ton of production value and care went into it. But at the end of the day it just felt like a pretty generic open world game.
I found it boring to be honest

It just didn‚Äôt really click with me
god of war 4 and ghost of tsushima are the best ps4 exclusives by far
By far one of my favorite games of all time. It's loved by the APAC countries for actually nailing the samurai aesthetic. Must buy on PS5.
Game doesn‚Äôt break any new ground. It felt like it wanted to be an assassins creed killer, but its stealth was barely there and climbing was a joke. The open world, while pretty, was lifeless, with little more to do than ‚Äúclear camp, find fox/bird, repeat.‚Äù Sword combat was fun, though, and the graphics, while not ground breaking fidelity, have some stellar art direction. .  

Where the game really shines is how much it is a love letter to Japanese culture and samurai films. It‚Äôs the success here that makes the mediocre parts of the game feel less so, and makes the game greater than the sum of its parts.
Meh
Not worth what? U not really telling us with the value u see. Worth your time? Worth the price? Whats the price? Like cmon
Three words. Hell yeah
    ![gif](giphy|l41YtZOb9EUABnuqA)
Look at the game. Looks cool? You got your anwser no need to complicate anything.
Absolutely!
100% WORTH IT!
Abso-fuckin-lutely
Y E S
It's my favorite PS4 game
YES honestly I thought ¬£70 for the DC was a lot when it came out but damn what a game. Graphics beautiful, sound great, gameplay perfect and the story was fantastic cannot recommend it enough and then try legends mode out
Worth
GoT is one of the only games I replay consistently. I can just roam the open world without any actual objectives for hours. It would be worth getting it at full price, so getting on sale is even better.
It's I million percent worth it  I brought a ps5 last week just to check out a few games iv been dien to play and this was a great great addition to what I was trying out ghost is just a whole  different  level of gaming and  story adventure  perfect  man I love it
Hell to the yes
Yes it is!
Yes, it's a brilliant game.
Fuck yes
Best single player story I‚Äôve played in a while
Simple answer, yes.
Absolutely, yes. It‚Äôs one of only two games I‚Äôve ever platinum‚Äôd. (The other is Control, which I‚Äôd also highly recommend.)
Super game!
100% worth it in every way.
Yes!
Yes , I‚Äôm not even reading the post, it‚Äôs an amazing game
Yes
Yes
It‚Äôs one of the best games I‚Äôve played and I played it on the ps4. It‚Äôs phenomenal. Buy that shit. Play that shit. Become the ghost.
Yes
Get it, its worth it. Even if just to have in the collection for it bit. It‚Äôs such a great game
The multiplayer is excellent too
Yes, it's worth it
No questions asked go for it. The game sucks you in in the opener very fast
100%
Ghost of Tsushima is a fantastic game and looks beautiful.
I don‚Äôt want to up-sell it, but personally GoT is easily in my top 5 favorite video games of all time.
A resounding yes! Of course, highly recommend
My favorite game on PS5. I‚Äôm a new PS owner I played GOW:Rag, TLOU pt 1, Ratchet n Clank, HFW(didn‚Äôt play more than 12 hrs), gt7, miles morales, Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost is my favorite game. Love the story the visuals the combat.  With the exception of Ratchet n Clank I found the other games extremely overrated tho TLOU had the best story for sure
I've been playing it lately, fantastic visual great story both main quest and sides. Worth it if you ask me
Didn‚Äôt even read anything but the title. YES.
100000000000% worth it and anyone that tells you otherwise can shut the fuck up.
Personally I kind of hated it, slow, boring, bad looking graphics

I though oh cool a samurai game, that will be so fun, it was the opposite
It‚Äôs absolutely worth it just for the base game. Beautiful story, beautiful open world, fun combat and memorable characters.
100% in the masterpiece category
    Oof
Are bears Catholic? Does the pope poop in the woods?
No, terrible game. Lol, unpolished turd. Better off getting the masterpiece that is Forsaken.
    Thought it was called foreskin?
        Autocorrect
I recommend playing got before ragnarok.   I replayed gow 2018 right before ragnarok released, and honestly,  it was too much of the same type of game play.   Although I enjoyed it, I wished I hadn't replayed 18 beforehand
The game is hands down a yes, worth it. I would get it on PSPlus. Itl be cheaper and you may realise there are a bunch of games you can power through in a matter of 1-2 months.
I was skeptical on it and ended up loving it highly recommended
Yes absolutely it's is one of my top 5 games fs
Do bears take a crap in the woods? 

Yes, it is that simple of an answer. It's amazing.
It‚Äôs one of those games that grows on you. Once you start playing it you fall in love. Personally it left a mark on me and it‚Äôs definitely a game I will revisit
r/ghostoftsushima
Ghost of Tsushima was an amazing experience. I put in about 50hrs to beat the main story and still want to go back to complete the side quests. It is totally worth it.
What a great game and inviorment
Yes
The simple answer is yes,  stunning story,graphics and gameplay. One of my all time favs
Does a bear shit in the woods?
Ghost is the only reason I bought a PlayStation. God bless
I refuse to finish it because I will be sad when it's over. I really enjoy it.
    This is a very real problem for me.  So many games I stop at the end because I don‚Äôt want them to be over then I never finish them.  I don‚Äôt recommend getting in this habit.
        I plan on finishing it, just after all the side quests.
Enjoy, it's a hell of a game
I platinumed it and I still go back and play more every now and then. I can‚Äôt wait for the sequel (there better be a sequel, even if it‚Äôs not about Jin)
Yes!!!!!
Replayed it like 5 times
Worth worth worth
Just buy it.
It's one of the best games I've ever played
1000%. Loved it.
Yes
Is that a real question?
Hell yeah. GoTs is the best.
Yes
Ive beat it twice. Does that answer your question? üòÇ
I really dont get these attention loving OPs with these over the top questions.
Yes. It‚Äôs worth it and it‚Äôs amazing.
Yes, it is. If you can, get the upgraded PS5 version.
Get that shit. Your loss of you do not
Best sword combat system in any game I have every played
Yes yes and yes
Absolutely. I'm on a second playthrough and... I hate the unskippable cutscenes though.
My only platinum trophy is Ghost! Top 5 best games I‚Äôve playedü§òGorgeous graphics too!
Literally just finished it a few hours ago it was absolutely incredible 100% worth every penny
I got it for Christmas and finished it recently. Can confidently say it‚Äôs up there in the top 5 games I‚Äôve ever played. Beautiful map/graphics, and very very satisfying and fun combat. Get it bro.
For me it was 20% gameplay 80% staring at the beautiful scenery. Get the game ASAP.
Do you mean GOAT of Tsushima? Heck yea it's worth it
Yes
GoT>>>GoW. In my opinion.
100% worth it. Incredible game.
Game is fantastic. Actual work of art. Can be difficult but the challenge is fun and worth it. So the answer is yes, buy that shiz!
Played it twice. 

Imagine a modern Assassin's Creed game in Feudal Japan but with good stealth
üíØ for sure . One of the best games last gen. 2020 GOTY imo.
One of the best games ever, seriously.
It‚Äôs worth it !
Yes
Yes it‚Äôs worth it
Definitely worth it, it‚Äôs absolutely great, you did the best choice mate, fully complete the game it‚Äôs amazing üëåüèª
Oh fuck yeah. Game is incredible for sure
It‚Äôs worth it at full price.
110% full price or more. Worth it.
i enjoyed it more than Both god of war games tbh.
One of the most amazing single player experiences I‚Äôve had. Incredible storytelling with pacing that makes you feel like you‚Äôre Jin Sakai himself. The mechanics are interesting and fun to learn. Accessible while remaining challenging. And the most amazing / satisfying unlocking sequence of ‚Äúrage‚Äù mode I‚Äôve ever had in a video game. 10/10. A perfect game in my book with little that needs improving on.
It‚Äôs worth it for full price so yeah
It‚Äôs worth it at full price and perhaps then some
One of the best Action adventure games ever built, the graphics and gameplay specially the combat is mesmerising the learning curve is great.

Masterpiece
It‚Äôs an amazing game and a beautiful experience. Yes. Go in and commit.
you won‚Äôt regret playing it. not even a little. I guarantee it
God of war is better game but ghost of tsushima isn't far behind...
It's like God of war is 10/10 and ghost of tsushima is 9 or 9.5/10 ...+ Ghost of tsushima has better replayability
One of few games worth full price.
100%. A must have for anyone with a PlayStation. One of my favorite open world games in recent memory.
You will literally spend half of your time in photo mode because of how beautiful it is.
YES.

- My personal favorite melee combat (I love sword combat what can I say)
- Very unique and satisfying art style and direction. A VERY stylish game 
- The world is beautiful and the characters hold weight. The world feels real too, the negatives of war are apparent in every corner of the Island
Idk what other people are saying but I have played thousands of games for over 14 years & I‚Äôll tell you this game is in my top 10 it is so so good
Yes. Best game of that generation
Hands down one of the most beautiful games ever made. It was an experience.
It is absolutely worth it at full price let alone for free on plus. I played it twice, the combat is so satisfying and in performance mode it looks great.
Absolutely. Such a beautiful game. Great gameplay. Cool weapons and fight tatctics. Decent looting (I wish there was more variety but)
First game I truly platinum‚Äôd. It‚Äôs so pretty and the combat is unmatched
yes.. good game and even by today's standards it's beautiful
It's amazing to read so many comments written by casual gamers, players who only play mainstream titles, people who have played two games in their lives, people who started playing a few years ago, people with questionable tastes, people who like easy, empty, generic games etc... In short, you can see from these comments that many people do not understand much about video games. Change hobbies instead of praising the usual mass-made games, mainstream games, games for casual gamers and stop asking for remastered and remakes thus ruining the video game market. Also if the video games market (especially that of triple A) is so disgusting is thanks to people like you because you have also favored miscotransactions, dlc and more that are now normal.
Hell yeah. One of my favorite games of all time. It‚Äôs beautiful, fun and will most likely make you cry (I did‚Ä¶ three times)
It could be one the best games ever!
Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best narrative based open world games out there. Whether you enjoy its theme, the fact that it‚Äôs open World, and whether you have a samurai fantasy is gonna decide how much you enjoy it.
Yes it‚Äôs better than assassins creed
Nah, winner of multiple gaming awards, very high critic score and player scores. Wildly appreciated for its cinematography and immersion. Clearly its shit‚Ä¶ (!)
I really don't care much for it as i thought I would once I played two months ago for an hour that I played it & I never come back to it ever since I did enjoy the killing that's about it.
It‚Äôs totally worth it. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt get it right now. It‚Äôll probably be on sale again soon enough. Maybe right after you finish Ragnarok ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Best game of 2019
Yes.
YES. It is such a refined experience it‚Äôs mature, grounded and such a beautiful yet haunting experience. Teaches you a lot about Japanese and Mongolian culture from the times, myths, traditions and combat. Honestly I don‚Äôt have enough words to express what it was like to experience it for the first time
A B S O L U T E L Y ! Don‚Äôt miss it out!
YES. I fucking cried, laughed, screamed, and literally applauded throughout the duration of the game. Such a good game, on my top 5 for sure!
It's a top 5 game of all time for me
It‚Äôs amazing. Jump on it asap
Y E S
Yes!
Abso-fucking-lutely

Edit: to the downvoter, your taste is trash, that game is great
No, play roblox instead
No, a game that is talked about daily on Reddit as being a masterpiece is not worth it.
Skip Ragnorok, unless you need a sleep aid.
It‚Äôs a really beautiful game but the open world is mostly little shrines and or cosmetics. 

The combat feels really fun once you get it down and on lethal the gameplay is intense and realistic. 

Overall it took me three attempts to fully get into the game but once I got into it I had a lot of fun. 

I‚Äôd give it a 4/5, worth checking out on a sale price for sure.
I liked GoT more than GOW, to me it would be worth it. PS Extra is $15 a month and you can get the directors cut of Ghosts along with other games to try
It‚Äôs a 123gb. I have a metered connection ü•≤
    123GB!!!????
        On ps5 yes
Just get ps + extra. It works out cheaper
I got it in a bundle for my ps5, u played for a bit. I was just looking at it randomly before this. Maybe I should puck it up again. Was pretty fun, just got hit with elden ring haa
Even though the formula is nothing to extraordinary or groundbreaking, I really, really enjoyed the story and how it was delivered. Even though you can get sidetracked at points and doing other sort of filler activities, they pretty much al have a connection to the story (outside of cosmetics) in some way that feels nice to do. Not including story elements though, the game itself is still about the best looking game I have played, even 2 years afterwards. The art direction is easily my favorite that I have played, and the gameplay is very engaging and fun as well. If it was on sale and a friend of mine was asking this question I would very much so suggest picking it up
It is absolutely worth it if you like either open world games or japanese history/culture in general. The combat is very enjoyable and the art direction is out of this world.

If you don't like either of those things, you'll still have a long game with a fun gameplay and lots of screenshot-worthy moments
I have a question about the Directors Cut upgrade for GoT. I own a physical copy of the PS4 version but I‚Äôd like to play the PS5 version with the Directors Cut, what would be the upgrade path for me with a physical PS4 copy played on PS5? Haven‚Äôt started the game because of the upgrade and since they‚Äôre on sale I figured now would be a good time.
    Just put the disc in your ps5 the buy the upgrade and you‚Äôre set up
Was the Japanese dub ever fixed?
I really enjoyed it. It‚Äôs also free (or was) on the ps collection so I played it a few months ago.
I enjoyed it but I played it after playing Sifu which had amazing combat so the combat in Ghost seemed not as engaging.
It is a very aesthetically pleasing game. I personally do not enjoy playing ‚Äúmovie games‚Äù but it was very beautiful for the few hours I played it.
I really like it. I still haven‚Äôt finished it yet, I‚Äôm a little worn out on the whole open world thing but the side missions feel meaningful and it‚Äôs a fresh take for sure.
  

In my opinion, it is always worth trying a game if you have the opportunity to do so, also your experience will be different from mine and other people‚Äôs experience so, I recommend you try Ghost of Tsushima despite my opinion and personal experience. I liked GOT, but I didn't find anything so exceptional. Personally I consider it a good game, but except for the setting, the art direction, the combat system and the idea of wind driving I consider it a totally forgettable game and that after the first act bored me occasionally and did I feel the repetitiveness of what I was doing because of the missions and side activities of the open world. For me, the boredom and repetitiveness of what I am doing is rarely a problem in video games, for example, I do not get bored farming on Warframe or other games, face the same boss again and again on souls or other games etc. also a few days after finishing GOT I started Death Stranding and I played it for a month for about 162 hours without ever getting bored and without feeling the repetitiveness, this is to make you understand that I have no problem with games where you do the same things and that they can become repetitive. This is my personal and subjective opinion of the experience I had with the basic version of GOT played at the release on PS4 Pro.
Play it on ps+ extra?
It was absolutely worth it!! Buy it and set aside at least 6 hours for you‚Äôre first session
10000000% worth it! Great game! Good online mode along with the in-depth story mode
It's %100 worth it.
One of, if not the most beautiful game I've played. Definitely worth it. üëå
Yes. It's twenty bucks and includes DLC.
Waiting for ps5 greatest hits
Did you hear what I said? It gives you a boner!
Yes
It's worth it. 

And the Multi-player is actually ok.
AB-SO-LUTELY
Yes, easy GOTY.
Heavily discounted... Sure why not... It's just an average samurai game nothing special
Yes
Thats treasure.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is the Best game.
Finished it like a month ago and it cracked my top 10 games of all time. It‚Äôs so good!
Yes
Like yes it's worth it it's a fucking masterpiece but the real question is is the emotional damage worth it
Yes
I personally loved it.
I bought it sealed for $7.00 usd from a pawn shop lol. Still haven‚Äôt played it.
Hell yeah, it's one game I enjoyed getting Platinum for.
Yes.
It‚Äôs fine
Yes.
Definitely worth it!
Yes yes yes and more yes
It‚Äôs a phenomenal game bro. My advice finish Gow series keep GOT in ur library.
Great game, one of my platinums. Buy and enjoy. üëçüïπÔ∏è
Yes
All I can say is this game got me into Japanese scenery and folk culture. After completing this game, I really wanted to go and visit historic villages of Japan and study more about Shint≈ç
    Have you visited Japan yet?
        Not yet, it‚Äôs still on my to-do list
YESSSSSSSS
Yes.  Play once regular.  Then play again in Kurosawa mode
Finish GoW 2018, get GoT, then play Rognorok. Its a lot to play both GoW back to back IMO. The ending of GoW 2018 deserves some time to breathe. Ghost is a very beautiful and fantastic game.
Fantastic game.
For SURE cop it. Enjoy man.

Also, Ragnar√∂k improves on GoW 2018 (an already fantastic game) in every single aspect.
One of few games I literally was addicted to. Platinumed in like 3 weeks because I couldn‚Äôt stop playing. Masterpiece.
I generally don't buy stuff just because it's on sale, particularly if I'm in the middle of a game already. Inevitably by the time I'm ready to play it, I will be able to get it cheaper than it is right now anyway. Then again, I tend to play stuff *way* after it's been released - I'm playing Bioshock 2 right now, and then I'm moving on to Firewatch and Just Cause 4...

I'm holding off on Ragnarok and Tsushima until I get a PS5, which probably won't be until next year anyway...
Ghost of tsushika most beautiful game I've ever played and the combat is really good, beaten the game about 5 times, extremely good.
I got sad because I finished I was playing normal like taking my time because I enjoyed it so much, I I've still have in my head the music from the grocery store bam bam bam mm bam bam bamm, if you know you lol
Get PS Plus Extra. Tons of games for 15/month. Ghost of Tsushima is on there.
Just play it or don't.
100% yes.
If you want an assassins creed game with soul yes. If you want to break up your time with GoW because playing it back to back might make it feel a bit samey. If it means anything if they release ghost of Tsushima on PC I'll buy it again in a heartbeat.
"Is a game with 4.8 on Google and 83 on Metacritic a good game?"

No, of course not! /s
We‚Äôll I think so anywayü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
Especially the director‚Äôs cut edition
Yes it is, you can get it with the Ps+extra
First hundred hours are Great and end game is super sick
It‚Äôs quite a shallow game in every aspects: quests, side activities, story, characters, gameplay mechanics. It‚Äôs literally an Assassin Creed game placed in Japanese. 6/10, I only recommend to buy the game on deep sales
not even a question, just buy it then wait for the sequel with the rest of us
Rn I‚Äôm like 40hrs into the game and I‚Äôm loving it, I know you‚Äôll buy it but yeah it‚Äôs a no brainer.
I wish you uck, Mel.
It's available for free on ps extra if you get that, definitely worth playing
I played pretty much every big hitter from the PS4 era of games and GoT and Death Stranding were probably my favorites. I usually get tired of the open world formula but ghosts does it so well and freshens up the tired collectathon I feel like most of them have turned into.
Yes, it is unreal.  Get it and love it.
Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best games I've played in a long time, yes definitely worth it
I loved every second of this game.

Recommend it to a friend and he fell in love too.
You‚Äôve already made you decision but it‚Äôs probably the best overall game I‚Äôve played since it came out
Oh, you should definitely buy GoT. It‚Äôs beautiful, the combat is decent, and there‚Äôs a lot of exploring to do even after the main storyline is completed
Yeah one of the best ps games.
It has an excellent story. 5000% would recommend it.
100%. Jaw-dropping visuals, excellent combat, riveting story.
Yes.
I love it and I do not normaly like these types of games it's easy to pick and put down... the combat is great and it's pretty.
The best
Super yes
100%
It's easily worth it. Played it at launch on my PS4 Pro and 4 times on PS5 with directors cut. The game never stops to amaze me. Top tier. Buy it right now!
10000%
Is it 100% worth it, it‚Äôs the closest we have to Assassin‚Äôs Creed in Japan, except it‚Äôs much better than most Assassin‚Äôs Creed games. Except Black Flag.
Ye sit is amazing. It can be open world the gamr sometimes but the story is great and the style and action is incredible
It depends, do you like the samurai japanese theme? Then you will probably love it, graphics, art direction, story, characters, npc, combat style are all there but the game also has things to dislike.Mainly the Ubisoft formula, a LOT of stealth parts etc.
Its a very solid game but if you dont like it within the first 3 5 hours you can drop it.
It s worth every penny
Its a good game. It can get repetitive after a while, but it is a very beautiful experience
It's one of, if not the best game I've ever played, no hyperbole
It is, its amazing, played it on ps4 and ps5, one of the best console games ever, in my opinion
Yess and if you want the platinum go for it 
The trophies are quite good and can be handled with quite ease.
One of my favorite games of all times. Platinumed it twice. Beautiful experience. Really helped me through tough times when it was hard to find peace in myself. Definitely recommend but still not for everyone. Even though it may not be as graphically impressive as a game like returnal, it‚Äôs still the most beautiful game I‚Äôve ever played.
Yes, and play the DLC to.
I definitely think it‚Äôs a net recommendation from me (this is coming from someone who platinumed the game so I pretty much saw everything the game has to offer).

I do think it falls short in some aspects. The story is great on paper, I love the themes they try to explore. In practice though while the main story beats are all at least good (with a few being great) I do think they could have dived a bit deeper into a few of them so there‚Äôs some wasted potential (purposefully avoiding details for the sake of spoilers). I also found a lot of the side missions were generally uninteresting the more minor ones got really repetitive.

For me it was already worth it for the open world alone. If you like feudal Japan to any degree then this is one of the most beautiful renditions of the period you‚Äôll find on console currently. I‚Äôd say if on sale then definitely pick it up!
Yes.
yes. You don't need any other replies, just do it. You won't regret it.
    forgot it also has the best side quest ever.
Stil the most beautiful game for me graphic/scenery wise
150% worth it.
I‚Äôd argue its the best game on Playstation. Clearly opinion, but I enjoyed it more than any other game. 

Just enough shit to do without being overly bloated like a lot of open world games tend to suffer from.
Good story but repetitive open world. If you liked Spider-Man, you will like this one. They are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù in that sense. You‚Äôll have fun but to reach 100% completion it will be boring. I platinumed both btw.
It‚Äôs a great experience. The combat is great, story is compelling. The only problem I had was that the game felt lifeless in the sense that you have this island and there‚Äôs no real civilization, which makes sense given the story. But still.
I think of replaying this game daily. Haven‚Äôt been able to get it out of my head since i played it.
Best Assassin s Creed game ever
honestly it depends what you‚Äôre into, but for me, yes it was definitely worth it. the combat, graphics, visuals, and story were amazing. i loved everything about it except the side quests, they felt too grindy
Yes. One of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. Great story with even better gameplay. Not to mention how good it looks
Definitely. I bought it on this sale and am currently playing it. Most fun I've had since GoWR came out
It's one of the most worth it titles to date. It's a must play. It's all amazing. Unique combat system. Nothing like it. Great open world. Beautiful graphics. Awesome story.
Just like most games if you're interested in that sort of thing it's great and it is worth it
Yes it is
Absolutely
Ghost of tsushima is 100% worth buying.
Absolutely.  Get it
It‚Äôs absolutely a game you should play. If it‚Äôs on sale at a really good price I‚Äôd definitely take advantage just to have it sitting there waiting to play. It really is a superb game.
One of the best games i ever played. Highly recommend
I think the best way to describe it in one sentence: it's the best assassin's creed ever made. It has some repetitive exploration aspects but the actual content missions are varied and unique and the combat systems flows.
Such a great game. Had a hard time to quit playing because it was such a fun game.
100% worth it. I was already a bit tired of AAA open worlds when I first played it, and despite that the game blew me away. Very beautiful with satisfying combat and interesting story. I loved it.
How much is Ghost of Tsushima right now?  It's on PS+ Extra, which is of great value. If you don't want to get PS+, I'd buy Ghost of Tsushima. It's a fantastic game.
    It‚Äôs 20 dollars right now
        If you buy PS+ for 2 months, you'll get a ton of games to play, but only for 2 months. If you buy Ghost of Tsushima, you'll have it and only it forever. The choice is yours. Whichever you choose, I promise the game is definitely worth it.
I loved this game. I always say it‚Äôs the best Assassins Creed game
YES!
I wish I could go back and experience this game for the first time again. Such a great time!
Definitely! It's one of the few games I've 100% multiple times. The other is Spider-Man. I've also technically did Elden Ring twice, once for myself and the other I helped a friend.
Yes.  I didn‚Äôt even play it- I watched my fianc√© play it and looked forward to it everyday.  The fighting moves you get are so awesome. The game itself is beautiful and I love the storyline
Yes. Easily my 2nd favourite game of all time
Hell yes I played it when it was on PS Plus will it still is on PS Plus but damn was I not disappointed had me from the beginning
Just play GoW and then Ragnarok. And by the time you're done its on sale again.  Probably even cheaper
In short, if you enjoy single player action adventure games with skill trees, absolutely worth it.
I love it. Beautiful and lots of fun.
It is definitely worth it!
Very very very worth it!!!
One of my favourite games I‚Äôve played , well worth it
Got a platinum on it a couple of days ago. Probably one of the best games I‚Äôve played in a looong time. Great story, amazing mechanics and overall looks amazingly on a 4k tv.
Played on PS5
Platinumed it. I only platinum games I can last a couple hours without it going back to backlog
It‚Äôs great, fun to plat also.
No matter the context, there is only one correct answer to this question: Yes.
One of my all time favorite games ever. Directors cut looks so gorgeous on an oled tv.
One of my favorite games ever. Graphics are breath taking. Combat is fun and diverse. Boss battles are next level. Side quests are varied and don‚Äôt get stale
100%
Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best games I e ever played
It‚Äôs a fantastic game. I might just rate it higher than HZD
so the simple answer is ‚Äúye‚Äù :)
Great game, definitely recommend it. When and if you can get ps+ play legends, it's amazing, but definitely play it and the directors cur if you can
Most definetly the storyline is great
Yes it is
The game is good definitely recommend it
i don't have ps plus :(
    It‚Äôs probably cheaper to just get PS+ for a 2 months and play it if money is a problem.
        honestly if u end up playing atleast 2 games a year that are on the service you get your moneys worth out of year long psplus extra tier sub.
            Is extra or premium better?
                The middle tier is the best. Don't bother with the most expensive one.
        If he does that he needs to add Returnal to the playlist. Amazing game.
         Yearly option is significantly cheaper tho.
            Yearly is not cheaper than 2 months. 

The comment you replied to assumed OP's ONLY intention is to play GoT.
                Then op should just buy the game
        Depends, I finished GoT and play online sometimes, but to be fair their online game ends up being more of the same
        With the price of games now a days for me in Canada is the price of 1 game so it‚Äôs worth it.
    Just buy PS Plus Extra for 1 month. It will most likely be cheaper & you will get a bunch more games than just GoT. If you don't end up liking GoT then there's a bunch more games on there that will make the subscription worth it.

But to answer your original question, Yes GoT is definitely worth it. I'm playing it now after I just beat God of War Ragnarok (AMAZING game btw) and the graphics/fighting style is so good.
    Get ps+. Try it out for a month or two.  So many great games on there that I may not buy another disc again.
    Also you can upgrade to ps+ for however long your current membership is and you only have to pay accordingly.. just don‚Äôt forget to turn off auto renewal
    It's cheaper to get that instead of ghost of Tsushima tbh and your progress is saved if you ever actually buy it
    Worth ps plus just to complete got,gow and star wars,horizon etc üëçüèº
"GET OUT OF HERE, DEWEY! YOU DON'T WANT THIS! IT TURNS ALL YOUR BAD FEELINGS INTO GOOD ONES... ITS A NIGHTMARE!"
    wow this film isn't referenced enough
everyone go out and watch walk hard, it's brilliant
    YOU DONT WANT NO PART OF THIS SHIT
        I think I kind of want it
    "Think I wanna try me some of that, kakane..."
    ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs non-habit forming!‚Äô
        It makes sex even **better**!
    Ha
     Not once did you pay for drugs!!!
    Can ya dumb it down a bit doc? We ain‚Äôt scientist.
Eh I tried to get Into it but I couldn‚Äôt. Which I was surprised about because it‚Äôs usually my type of game. 

Everyone is different tho. No doubt the game is good.
    No, I know what you mean. Like I don't care at all for the new God of War games, but I recognize they are good.
        Yeah idk if it‚Äôs me getting older (going from teens to twenties) but I‚Äôve noticed it takes a really impressive game (to me particularly) to make me want to grind it. Currently searching for a game like that cause I miss the grind I used to be able to do but I just can‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm confused
            For sure, loved those new GOW games myself but respect you knowing different strokes for different folks. Hope you get that game you love soon bruv
            Man I‚Äôm going through that same issue right now. I keep buying all these new single player open world RPG games because I used to love them and was a main reason I got a PS5 but now I can‚Äôt finish one. I play it for an hour or two and then get off it to go play a fast paced multiplayer game with friends, basically never touching the game again until I delete it for space for the next game that I can waste my money on.
                I swear it‚Äôs an endless cycle. You just describes how I‚Äôve been the last like 3 years üòÇüò≠
            When I went from my teens to my early to mid twenties, I went through the same thing. It was really hard for me to find a game I liked and it had to be really good. I went from playing all the time, to playing pretty rarely and pretty much in little binges on the rare occasion I found an amazing game. Then when I got to around 30, I started getting less picky again and enjoying games a bit more again, but definitely leaning more towards story driven than I used to when I was younger. IDK, I'm just saying it might come back around for you. Maybe I got a bit desensitized to games or something, and the break helped me appreciate them again.
                I totally understand that, when I do get into a game that I‚Äôm really enjoying I think it makes it better because of how long it‚Äôs been since I found a game like that. 

The story is definitely becoming much more important to me as I get older I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm hoping once I get a little older it will come back again and I can delve into more games like I used to. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who as gone through this!
            I was just like you. And this helped. I‚Äôm probably butchering the comment but I read something like this

‚ÄúThe problem isn‚Äôt games, but us. We think playing video games is doing every side mission and gathering every collectible we can along the way AND THEN doing the main missions. We just don‚Äôt have enough time for that anymore. Side missions and collectibles are added on top of the campaign.‚Äù
                That is so true. Video games have gotten so long and so packed I just don‚Äôt have the time to sit down and grind it all out like I could when I was young. Kinda sucks but I think it makes the games I REALLY get into much more enjoyable in a way.
            If you're into open world games, I'd suggest:

* Elden Ring
* Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West
* Days Gone
* Assassin's Creed Unity / Syndicate / Origins
* Arkahm Knight
                I‚Äôve been meaning to check out elden ring, but I have played syndicate (my favorite assassins creed game of all time) and I didn‚Äôt play origins but I did play valhalla and I LOVE that one. Origins is definitely text on my list for assassins creed. 

Now that you mention Arkahm knight it reminds me of the older games and I honestly might need to try them out again. 

I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and that‚Äôs been pretty fun so far in all honesty. But it‚Äôs not the same as something like Spider-Man lol
                    Syndicate was super fun. I loved the way they recreated Victorian London; the rope launcher was reminiscent of Arkham Knight, which IMO is the ultimate Batman simulator. The 1989 Batmobile DLC made the end game even better.

Origins on the other hand had an exceptionally compelling story. If you do end up getting the game, I'd recommend the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC because it allows Bayek to be upgraded to level 45 at the start of the game, making it feel more like the earlier AC titles. Alexandria is probably may favorite on the map.

If you haven't played through Unity yet, that's an equally excellent game. The outfits, weapons, lighting, parkour, and environmental design of Paris during the French Revolution is impeccable. I wish it didn't have such a rocky launch.

Have you tried out any of the Dark Souls games or Bloodborne / Sekiro before?
                        I haven‚Äôt tried sekiro yet, but I have tried dark souls, I just haven‚Äôt sat down to play like I should lol it‚Äôs a pretty fun game and I know I‚Äôd enjoy that one. I forgot I HAVE played unity and really need to get back into it, that game started so rough but it‚Äôs so much better than when it launched
            I'm 33 and loved playing The Callisto Protocol, and nobody really seems to like it...probably because it's considered a Dead Space wannabe, I dunno.

Or maybe I'm just angry about my brokerage account tanking and really needed to smash some space zombies in the face lol.
                Is it much different from the first game? Been wanting to check the first one out but heard it‚Äôs just a walking sim lol.
    Out of curiosity, what similar games do you usually enjoy? No judgement and I promise I will not post a follow up question.
        I couldn't get into it either and I typically really enjoy games like that. Tbh part of it was probably that it made me feel really motion sick for some reason.
            It wasn‚Äôt even that for me (though I can understand it) I can even explain why it just didn‚Äôt feel that fun to me. I think it‚Äôs less of the game and more of just me
        I mean almost any open world game, I‚Äôm not picky when it comes to game. I‚Äôll play anything from swords and shields to guns and bombs to puzzles and mind games. 

Recently I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and assassins creed Valhalla with some for honor when my pals on online (rarely lol, I need more ps4 play buddies)
    I‚Äôm the same, though I think my problem was I just finished Spider-Man Miles Morales so it was jarring to go from a fast paced, high maneuverability game to something more slow paced and methodical. 

I plan on giving it another go later cause i do want to experience the story.
    Was pretty much the opposite for me lol - I got really into it, which was surprising because it‚Äôs not really my type of game. Open world games usually aren‚Äôt my thing - I don‚Äôt have the time/patience for all the walking between objectives these days.
Agreed with this. It really should have won game of the year that year instead of LOU2 :( but I'm biased toward Japanese lore games haha. It was beautiful and heartbreaking.
well i'm kinda at school sooo....
    Yeah, I wasnt really being literal. But you should definitely buy it if you like that type of game. I loved it and played through it twice.
I Second the comment toward repetitiveness. Amazing game, I loved every second of it. But after a while it does become ‚ÄúGo here, fight this. Go Here fight that. Follow this person to there, fight someone else.‚Äù 

The one on one duels are sensational tho
    Some of the story side quests were awesome and just as good as the main quest, but all the random side activities like the shrines, haiku, foxes, birds, bamboo poles, enemy camps, etc. got really damn repetitive. It was the first game I got platinum on, so I still did it all, but that stuff was a slog.
[removed]
    Enjoy. One of the cleanest looking graphics, combat and UI.
Yeah, it‚Äôs very repetitive and the story isn‚Äôt exactly anything to write home about. Like 2/3rds of the way through the game I realized I wasn‚Äôt even having fun anymore and stopped playing it. I played Sekiro next, which to me was a more enjoyable sword combat game in every way possible.
    Sekiro has the best sword combat in any game ever IMO.
        It is so fucking good. I enjoyed it the first time a played it a lot, but couldn‚Äôt fucking beat the final boss for so long. Finally mastered it after literally weeks of trying, and then started NG+‚Ä¶ It is SO MUCH FUN once you have truly mastered the combat. Felt like such a badass beating bosses first try that took me a long time previously.
            It took me forever to figure out. I went in as a huge fan of the souls games and Bloodborne, but I‚Äôve always been pretty shit at video games and Sekiro removed all the crutches I learned to lean on in the other FromSoft games - no option to choose an easier playstyle, no way to over-level, no carefully selecting the best armor to protect me from a tough boss, no grinding for weapon upgrade materials, etc. I also never really used parries in any of the other games, so it was a rude awakening discovering the entire combat system was built around the mechanic I had always ignored lol. All that really contributed to making it one of my favorite games though - it forced me to actually master the mechanics, and every boss I beat after that felt like something I could truly take credit for instead of something that I was only able to do after taking a bunch of steps to make the game easier. Like you said, it makes you deal fucking badass.
Thank you. I feel like ont of the only people who doesn't swear by this game. I finished it but it was a struggle towards the end.

Originally I thought I would complete multiple playthroughs by the end I was surprised I finished one.
Not everyone has the same opinion with these big triple a games.

What insults their intelligence is the inability to make a decision by themselves.
    >What insults their intelligence is the inability to make a decision by themselves.

How is creating a reddit post to have people tell them to buy it deciding for themselves?
        Its not. Thats my point.
While I agree more people should just watch reviews etc, why buy the more expensive version lmao. Just because you like it doesn‚Äôt mean everyone should. Dumb comment
    It's not a matter of personal opinion. This work is truly quality and it's beyond subjectivity. If you can't respect that. It's simply lost on you.
        Well it is subjective because while it's not a bad game I did not enjoy it that much.
        Winning awards doesn‚Äôt make something objectively art. I mean, how often do you buy films just because they won an Oscar?  
  
I can agree that GoT looks gorgeous but at its core it‚Äôs just a really nice AC2. If those types of games aren‚Äôt for you then this is a subjectivity ‚Äúbad‚Äù game.
        Saying something like this makes your earlier opinion meaningless.
This. Listen to this person.
    Props bro/sis
Heh, that's how I feel when I tell people I gave up on Red Dead Redemption after the first mission.
    Same with the witcher for me. I must have tried starting that game like 6 different times because of all the rave reviews it got. Never made it past like 3 hours haha, it's just a me thing. Or maybe because I'm just getting older lol
        aw man i‚Äôm sorry to hear that. i just finished the witcher not long ago and i really loved it. the story is great and there‚Äôs a lot of decision-making that affects the story
![gif](giphy|l41YtZOb9EUABnuqA)
Oof
Thought it was called foreskin?
    Autocorrect
This is a very real problem for me.  So many games I stop at the end because I don‚Äôt want them to be over then I never finish them.  I don‚Äôt recommend getting in this habit.
    I plan on finishing it, just after all the side quests.
123GB!!!????
    On ps5 yes
Just put the disc in your ps5 the buy the upgrade and you‚Äôre set up
Have you visited Japan yet?
    Not yet, it‚Äôs still on my to-do list
forgot it also has the best side quest ever.
It‚Äôs 20 dollars right now
    If you buy PS+ for 2 months, you'll get a ton of games to play, but only for 2 months. If you buy Ghost of Tsushima, you'll have it and only it forever. The choice is yours. Whichever you choose, I promise the game is definitely worth it.
It‚Äôs probably cheaper to just get PS+ for a 2 months and play it if money is a problem.
    honestly if u end up playing atleast 2 games a year that are on the service you get your moneys worth out of year long psplus extra tier sub.
        Is extra or premium better?
            The middle tier is the best. Don't bother with the most expensive one.
    If he does that he needs to add Returnal to the playlist. Amazing game.
     Yearly option is significantly cheaper tho.
        Yearly is not cheaper than 2 months. 

The comment you replied to assumed OP's ONLY intention is to play GoT.
            Then op should just buy the game
    Depends, I finished GoT and play online sometimes, but to be fair their online game ends up being more of the same
    With the price of games now a days for me in Canada is the price of 1 game so it‚Äôs worth it.
Just buy PS Plus Extra for 1 month. It will most likely be cheaper & you will get a bunch more games than just GoT. If you don't end up liking GoT then there's a bunch more games on there that will make the subscription worth it.

But to answer your original question, Yes GoT is definitely worth it. I'm playing it now after I just beat God of War Ragnarok (AMAZING game btw) and the graphics/fighting style is so good.
Get ps+. Try it out for a month or two.  So many great games on there that I may not buy another disc again.
Also you can upgrade to ps+ for however long your current membership is and you only have to pay accordingly.. just don‚Äôt forget to turn off auto renewal
It's cheaper to get that instead of ghost of Tsushima tbh and your progress is saved if you ever actually buy it
Worth ps plus just to complete got,gow and star wars,horizon etc üëçüèº
wow this film isn't referenced enough
everyone go out and watch walk hard, it's brilliant
YOU DONT WANT NO PART OF THIS SHIT
    I think I kind of want it
"Think I wanna try me some of that, kakane..."
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs non-habit forming!‚Äô
    It makes sex even **better**!
Ha
 Not once did you pay for drugs!!!
Can ya dumb it down a bit doc? We ain‚Äôt scientist.
No, I know what you mean. Like I don't care at all for the new God of War games, but I recognize they are good.
    Yeah idk if it‚Äôs me getting older (going from teens to twenties) but I‚Äôve noticed it takes a really impressive game (to me particularly) to make me want to grind it. Currently searching for a game like that cause I miss the grind I used to be able to do but I just can‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm confused
        For sure, loved those new GOW games myself but respect you knowing different strokes for different folks. Hope you get that game you love soon bruv
        Man I‚Äôm going through that same issue right now. I keep buying all these new single player open world RPG games because I used to love them and was a main reason I got a PS5 but now I can‚Äôt finish one. I play it for an hour or two and then get off it to go play a fast paced multiplayer game with friends, basically never touching the game again until I delete it for space for the next game that I can waste my money on.
            I swear it‚Äôs an endless cycle. You just describes how I‚Äôve been the last like 3 years üòÇüò≠
        When I went from my teens to my early to mid twenties, I went through the same thing. It was really hard for me to find a game I liked and it had to be really good. I went from playing all the time, to playing pretty rarely and pretty much in little binges on the rare occasion I found an amazing game. Then when I got to around 30, I started getting less picky again and enjoying games a bit more again, but definitely leaning more towards story driven than I used to when I was younger. IDK, I'm just saying it might come back around for you. Maybe I got a bit desensitized to games or something, and the break helped me appreciate them again.
            I totally understand that, when I do get into a game that I‚Äôm really enjoying I think it makes it better because of how long it‚Äôs been since I found a game like that. 

The story is definitely becoming much more important to me as I get older I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm hoping once I get a little older it will come back again and I can delve into more games like I used to. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who as gone through this!
        I was just like you. And this helped. I‚Äôm probably butchering the comment but I read something like this

‚ÄúThe problem isn‚Äôt games, but us. We think playing video games is doing every side mission and gathering every collectible we can along the way AND THEN doing the main missions. We just don‚Äôt have enough time for that anymore. Side missions and collectibles are added on top of the campaign.‚Äù
            That is so true. Video games have gotten so long and so packed I just don‚Äôt have the time to sit down and grind it all out like I could when I was young. Kinda sucks but I think it makes the games I REALLY get into much more enjoyable in a way.
        If you're into open world games, I'd suggest:

* Elden Ring
* Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West
* Days Gone
* Assassin's Creed Unity / Syndicate / Origins
* Arkahm Knight
            I‚Äôve been meaning to check out elden ring, but I have played syndicate (my favorite assassins creed game of all time) and I didn‚Äôt play origins but I did play valhalla and I LOVE that one. Origins is definitely text on my list for assassins creed. 

Now that you mention Arkahm knight it reminds me of the older games and I honestly might need to try them out again. 

I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and that‚Äôs been pretty fun so far in all honesty. But it‚Äôs not the same as something like Spider-Man lol
                Syndicate was super fun. I loved the way they recreated Victorian London; the rope launcher was reminiscent of Arkham Knight, which IMO is the ultimate Batman simulator. The 1989 Batmobile DLC made the end game even better.

Origins on the other hand had an exceptionally compelling story. If you do end up getting the game, I'd recommend the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC because it allows Bayek to be upgraded to level 45 at the start of the game, making it feel more like the earlier AC titles. Alexandria is probably may favorite on the map.

If you haven't played through Unity yet, that's an equally excellent game. The outfits, weapons, lighting, parkour, and environmental design of Paris during the French Revolution is impeccable. I wish it didn't have such a rocky launch.

Have you tried out any of the Dark Souls games or Bloodborne / Sekiro before?
                    I haven‚Äôt tried sekiro yet, but I have tried dark souls, I just haven‚Äôt sat down to play like I should lol it‚Äôs a pretty fun game and I know I‚Äôd enjoy that one. I forgot I HAVE played unity and really need to get back into it, that game started so rough but it‚Äôs so much better than when it launched

Now that you mention Arkahm knight it reminds me of the older games and I honestly might need to try them out again. 

I‚Äôve been playing Albion online and that‚Äôs been pretty fun so far in all honesty. But it‚Äôs not the same as something like Spider-Man lol
        Syndicate was super fun. I loved the way they recreated Victorian London; the rope launcher was reminiscent of Arkham Knight, which IMO is the ultimate Batman simulator. The 1989 Batmobile DLC made the end game even better.

Origins on the other hand had an exceptionally compelling story. If you do end up getting the game, I'd recommend the Curse of the Pharaohs DLC because it allows Bayek to be upgraded to level 45 at the start of the game, making it feel more like the earlier AC titles. Alexandria is probably may favorite on the map.

If you haven't played through Unity yet, that's an equally excellent game. The outfits, weapons, lighting, parkour, and environmental design of Paris during the French Revolution is impeccable. I wish it didn't have such a rocky launch.

Have you tried out any of the Dark Souls games or Bloodborne / Sekiro before?
            I haven‚Äôt tried sekiro yet, but I have tried dark souls, I just haven‚Äôt sat down to play like I should lol it‚Äôs a pretty fun game and I know I‚Äôd enjoy that one. I forgot I HAVE played unity and really need to get back into it, that game started so rough but it‚Äôs so much better than when it launched
I'm 33 and loved playing The Callisto Protocol, and nobody really seems to like it...probably because it's considered a Dead Space wannabe, I dunno.

Or maybe I'm just angry about my brokerage account tanking and really needed to smash some space zombies in the face lol.
    Is it much different from the first game? Been wanting to check the first one out but heard it‚Äôs just a walking sim lol.
It wasn‚Äôt even that for me (though I can understand it) I can even explain why it just didn‚Äôt feel that fun to me. I think it‚Äôs less of the game and more of just me
It took me forever to figure out. I went in as a huge fan of the souls games and Bloodborne, but I‚Äôve always been pretty shit at video games and Sekiro removed all the crutches I learned to lean on in the other FromSoft games - no option to choose an easier playstyle, no way to over-level, no carefully selecting the best armor to protect me from a tough boss, no grinding for weapon upgrade materials, etc. I also never really used parries in any of the other games, so it was a rude awakening discovering the entire combat system was built around the mechanic I had always ignored lol. All that really contributed to making it one of my favorite games though - it forced me to actually master the mechanics, and every boss I beat after that felt like something I could truly take credit for instead of something that I was only able to do after taking a bunch of steps to make the game easier. Like you said, it makes you deal fucking badass.
The middle tier is the best. Don't bother with the most expensive one.
Then op should just buy the game
I swear it‚Äôs an endless cycle. You just describes how I‚Äôve been the last like 3 years üòÇüò≠
I totally understand that, when I do get into a game that I‚Äôm really enjoying I think it makes it better because of how long it‚Äôs been since I found a game like that. 

The story is definitely becoming much more important to me as I get older I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm hoping once I get a little older it will come back again and I can delve into more games like I used to. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who as gone through this!
That is so true. Video games have gotten so long and so packed I just don‚Äôt have the time to sit down and grind it all out like I could when I was young. Kinda sucks but I think it makes the games I REALLY get into much more enjoyable in a way.
