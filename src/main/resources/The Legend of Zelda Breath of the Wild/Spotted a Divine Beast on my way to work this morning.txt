[[Spotted a Divine Beast on my way to work this morning]]





It's Vah Nimbus, the divine cloud beast.
    Totally read this in kid Goku's voice
        Huh I did it in roshis voice before reading your comment.  weird. 
        Dub or sub?  That's the real question here.
    That actually sounds like a really cool beast... Too bad they won't make more DLC.
    Looks more like a sassy Chihuahua
        üòÇüòÇüòÇ
    Underrated 
What is Vah Naboris doing that far from the desert? 
    This is the Arizona desert, so I guess he's in his natural environment. 
        OFC it‚Äôs Arizona. I was thinking it was that or Nevada
            NeVAHda
                I‚Äôm mad that I didn‚Äôt think of that
                    Is the sword user flair?
                        Yes
            I am constantly in awe at how often AZ is on the front page. Like seriously. Its weird seeing the same shit I see every day on the internet but also down the street. WTF.
        It would be even more natural with the lightning strikes during the Arizona monsoon season.
        Came here to say it was even in the desert haha
        The highlands even have snow right now. Perfect!
        Palo Verde out west of Buckeye? Never seen them puff like that...but I also don‚Äôt tend to be out that way...
            Nope, but they can have huge vapor clouds if it's humid!

Example:

Pretty awesome to see in person.

            Na,  they're on Ray just east of Mesa Gateway Airport looking west. You can the Ahwatukee foothills in the background.

Edit: I think.
                you right, drive on this road on the way to work every morning
        She. Naboris was a female gerudo.
        Oh! Ok then he's good lol
        DAMNIT I was just in Arizona
        Is this in the Tucson area? It looks a lot like my old commute
        What plant is that?
        Do you live in queen creek
        Ray Road, on the north side of Gateway Airport.

            Yeah looks like the plant over in Gilbert. I‚Äôve seen it everyday this week cause it‚Äôs been so cold.
                its a water purification plant!
                Slightly unrelated, but: is it terrible that I laughed every time someone mentioned it's cold lately? 

I'm mostly asking because I live in Chicago. We get this effect a lot so I'm used to the whole water vapor science behind the phenomenon. 
        Eyyyyy near Gilbert?! I see these huge clouds come up every morning. 
    I saw Vah Ruta at first ü§£ it looked like a big trunk on the left but once I read your comment and instantly saw Naboris also. 

Actually kinda crazy how similar this cloud looks to them both. It‚Äôs the gods telling us that BotW is a major step forward in human advancement! 
        Yep, i see it now. Naboris is strictly from the side but Ruta is kind of a front/ side view
        Naboris fits with the fact it's the desert. Ruta fits with the fact that its water.
    I dunno, i thought more of vah ruta. but yh, i see the Naboris-ness
    Lol
Most people find things in video games influenced by real life. Botw influences real life. 
    Life imitates art
        Imitation invokes originality. 

        Amen
Beware of the lightning strikes
Did you pack the thunder helm in case of lightning?
ngl naboris was the scariest divine beast. his movement was so sporadic it was really unsettling to look at imo....either that or i‚Äôm just a total pussy 
    It was sort of scary (but fun) to ride that sand seal near him. I felt like it was going to trample me, the legs on that thing freak me out...
    I agree totally. It moved so much more robotically than the other beasts. And it's "cry" was also kinda unsettling. 
        it was the most, for lack of a better word, beastly of the divine beasts...and it was a CAMEL 
    I'm with you on that, dude. Nearly had a ptsd moment because Vah Naboris was very intimidating and I wimpout every time I attempt to get close to it's dust clouds without the necessary requirements.
        Please don‚Äôt belittle ptsd symptoms. The words fear, apprehension, excitement, anticipation, intensity, overwhelm, nervousness...these are all things I love about breath of the wild. Not ptsd symptoms, which are different and don‚Äôt come up for me during gameplay. 
            Please don‚Äôt belittle their feelings of ptsd 
Divine Beast Robot Humpy Camel!
    I appreciate you GG reference friend 
    I refuse to know it by any other name
        Nothing will ever dethrone "Horsey Fatback" for me.
    What a sight, *Divine Beast Vah Naboris* is pretty intimidating...

Yeah, call it whatever you want, babe. 
        I was doing some r/UnexpectedGameGrumps lol
            **I FUCKING LOVE YOU, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS SUB EXISTED!!**
                ME TOO
                You‚Äôre welcome!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
            r/subsithoughtifellfor
                Hahahaha get it, hilarious lmfao i cant, totally not an overused unfunny joke!
                    Username checks out 
            my reply was also a game grumps reference :)
It learned from its defeat and grew more legs. 
    üòÇüòÇ true
That is disturbingly accurate.
Incredible. 
Someone get Riju and a sand seal quick! We need to board that thing!
    Or a car. Heard they're faster than seals
Didn‚Äôt see the sub Reddit that this was from and thought it was entei from Pok√©mon lol 
I hope you already beat Thunderblight
Don't go near it without the thunder helm lol
holy crap lol
That's cool because I just beat thunderblight ganon
Go beat Thunderblight Ganon, your boss will understand if you send him a selfie üòÅ
Op thank you! I was on my way to work this morning and wondering wtf blew up on the other side of Gilbert but this was it. I can‚Äôt believe I found this in this subreddit
    There‚Äôs some kind of power plant or something right there that always steams up when it gets really cold. I was wondering if anyone else here saw this today!
        The nations largest power producer, by megawatts generated, always at 100%
        The more you know! Thanks man!
        Nuclear Plant Cooling Towers. Something has to cool down them reactors. That's a lot of power they must be generating for that many cooling towers, of that size. The plant I'm currently working at generates over 1000MW. A quick look, Palo Verde puts out almost 4k MW of power, so yeah...Definitely need some major cooling to them reactors.
            Just FYI cooling towers are independent of the fuel source! I'm not involved in them a bunch but the design is based off of other things like local climate, power out put, lifespan, and even the nature view.
            This is not a nuclear plant, nor is it palo verde




                It certainly seems like Palo Verde. If this isn't it, then what is it?
                    An SRP plant on the east side of town.
it actually looks so much like it. I would have freaked out. I hated thunderblight Gannon.
r/bossfight
Before I even read the caption this pic reminded me of a divine beast. 
Vampire king is dead!
    Have my upvote for the *Adventure Time* reference, you person on good taste, you.
I just know that thunderblight is up there and he's giving me the middle finger
Why have solar panels in a place that has 300 days of sunshine a year when you could just have nuclear? Weeeeeeeeeee
    Cuz nuclear is good clean energy?
Looks like Divine Beast Joe the Camel.
Anyone struck by lightning yet?
Do you work as a guard for Gerudo Town?
[deleted]
    OP said this is in Arizona so my money is on the Palo Verde nuclear power station. Idk for sure tho.

It's almost certainly a power plant of some kind
        My money is on the SRP Santan Generating Station in Gilbert. Pretty sure I saw this today
            [deleted]
        I work at Palo Verde. I'm not honestly sure of this is it. The vapor seems a bit small (depends on dew point etc) and I don't recognize the landscape/angle but maybe I've never seen it from that angle. You can clearly see it from 50 miles away so I doubt I've seen every angle.
            It‚Äôs not Palo Verde. It‚Äôs SRPs plant on Val Vista and Warner. 
        It is Palo Verde.  Mechanical draft cooling towers with that kind of heat output in that scenery is unmistakable.  
            I knew that's where it was based on the scenery too. I almost said it was [Columbia Generating Station](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Columbia_Generating_Station_at_Hanford_Washington.JPG), but ironically, it's too green to be Washington.
         Always bear in mindwhen shutting the oven door to do so gently, as if a slam is indulgedin all the gas jets will be blown out, and an explosion would probablyresult
            http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/87611445.jpg

Palo Verde on a dry day. OPs pic is East valley (other poster said an SRP station).
Guess what day it is? 
No way this is real. Holy shit
Cloudblight ganon
They keep coming back, no matter how much you defeat them
Ready your master swords and thunder helms, we're going beast-diving.
You silly goose thats a camel god
That's when you know a bad storm is coming
Those nuke plant stacks? Four towers!?
Divine Beast Robot Humpy Camel?!?
Were you at least wearing your thunderhelm?
looks like a cross between Naboris and Ruta

Vah Ruboris
Do you bring bomb arrow with you? Here, I have 20 of them
That one was a bitch to get to. For the longest time I couldn't figure out where to get the womens clothes lol. 
The divine beast is so fluffy. 
We have to stop it before it destroys our planet.
A humidifier ? 
Mr. Robot Humpy Camal to you sir
Holy shit that's amazing haha, crazy how the (clouds? smoke?) formed in almost the EXACT shape of naboris
Lmao I was actually about to fight it when I saw this
God, the Arizona roads look so much nicer than Michigan's.
I see botw items irl all the time... The other day I walked by a stick that totally looked like a Boko spear.
Bomb arrows at the ready.
Palo Verde! Worked there twice as a contractor! Cool I see the resemblance now!
That‚Äôs literally a more accurate depiction of the Devine beast than the toast was of Jesus in the 2000‚Äôs
I see a camel
No that's the vampire king
Holy shit
That's CLEARLY an Imperial Walker.  
Careful, those clouds conceal a laser cannon.
I see 2 camels having a good time xD
This is so cool!!
BrUh it about the hit u with lightning! Put on the Thunder Helmmm!!
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. Guess what day it is?
Those look like one of them nuclear launch silos 
[deleted]
    Its been farting a lot.
Or an ULTRA beast! Where's my Poke Ball?

Sorry, couldn't resist
    No, this is Reshiram
        TBH it looks like a hybrid of rapidash and reshiram

        TBH it looks like a hybrid of rapidash and reshiram

Don't get too close
oh great, we're going to be driving into a sandstorm
its robot humpy camel!
Divine beast Robot Humpy Camel!!!
This makes me wish I was playing the game for the first time again. I miss it. 
But first get the electric arrows
Beware of lightning
Here because of the plagiarized repost ü•¥
Get ready for a theory: I saw a post on this sub a while back of someone seeing something just like this and saying something along the lines of ‚Äúoh I found Naboris haha‚Äù but you could tell it was just a cloud formation of some sort. This looks exactly like it.
It‚Äôs shaped exactly like it üò±üò±
This is the coolest thing I've seen on Reddit since ever
Nahboris
Divine Beast Vah Floofah.
That's not a divine beast that's global warming!
    Burning fossil fuels emit black smoke. Steam like that is as harmless as a cloud.
        Nitpicky, but not actually steam! Just water vapor. Steam implies the water is very hot!
    It's water vapor. Just water.
    That's actually the opposite. Based on annual electrical output, it's actually the biggest carbon free electricity source in the country. It has three large nuclear plants on site.
    More like barium and aluminium they are spraying on us Ba and al = Ba'al = demon cheif

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_(demon)
Good luck, that dude in there mad fast.
WHAT THE HECK
This is Palo Verde, yes? 
    I don't think so. Maybe East valley.
Around Denver??
The divine beasts always reminded me of The Temptation of St. Anthony by Salvador Dali.

https://www.allposters.com/-sp/The-Temptation-of-St-Anthony-c-1946-Posters_i314122_.htm
Is that the Palo Verde nuclear facility?
    Nope! Wrong side of Phoenix.
Looks like the weird animals from Apex.
Salvador Dali 
Looks like a 5 legged dog taking a piss
Looks like and elephant making love to a giraffe   
Vah Sootah
Is this the new Cloudian support
Medical Mechanica?
Master hand
That Korok is a strange color.
I had a dream tonight. I was inside Final Fantasy XV and I had to fight all four divine beasts themselves +1. There was an extra divine beast. Not like in the DLC. This one was called Baby, and she was a fucking bitch.
Looks like a guy trying bang out a camel.....I need help
I saw the exact same thing when I was driving to eagle Vail airport in Collado, it was truly an amazing site to see
Are you all of a sudden able to summon Urbosa's fury by accident?
Apex...?
Its Robot Humpy Camel!!
All I see is an AT-AT walker.
Robot humpy camel
Vah Pollutoris
It looks like a dog taking a wee.
Someone help me think of a funny comment to put so I can get upvotes
I think it looks like peole fucking but ok
Don't go near it, it will shock you
Looks like it's still got its protection up. Better infiltrate the Gerudo village, convince the princess to help you and go shield surfing. Hope they have sand seals in a Arizona. 
That car's about to get zapped
Do you work for the Yiga clan?
Jokes on him, he stumbled upon the Arizona Ranger's town.
It‚Äôs amazing how much this actually looks like it! Hope your prepared!
Sorry that‚Äôs just pollution probably
*attack on Vah Naboris theme intensifies*
Get your bomb arrows ready boys!
Minish cap link just comes in with the gust jar and just sucks all that. What's your reaction.
How the actual hell
It‚Äôs the vampire thing from adventure time
instantly recognized, im actually doing this dungeon now haha
Am I just dumb or does that look like vah rutah
This makes me concerned for the environment
    I'm assuming it's steam being dumped.
r/mildlyinteresting
    How does this comment contribute in any way to discussion
am i the only one who thinks that it kinda looks like incineroar? 
Is that dick butt?
Damn console peasants!!
It‚Äôs an AT&T!!!!
Looks more like cancer in the air
    It's water vapor. No cancer.
    its literally just steam
        Mixed with cancer
            It is a pressurised water reactor. No cancer unless there was a massive meltdown. There is a huge misconception about nuclear plants. There is only a 4 percent increase in health risk when working for a nuclear plant. Very minute risk.
                4% compared to what? I'm not doubting you, but I'm curious what they are basing it off of
                    Normal working conditions in other kinds of electricity plants i think.
                    Exactly what the other commenter said. The NRC has regulations for radiation allowances that we are allowed to pick up yearly, and the truth of the matter is that you'll never even get close to that amount. It is set at 5 rem, and at most, I've picked up .02% of that.
Ok, and, I am ready to vibe
All right... who forgot to kill thunderblight...
Totally read this in kid Goku's voice
    Huh I did it in roshis voice before reading your comment.  weird.

Please don‚Äôt belittle ptsd symptoms. The words fear, apprehension, excitement, anticipation, intensity, overwhelm, nervousness...these are all things I love about breath of the wild. Not ptsd symptoms, which are different and don‚Äôt come up for me during gameplay. 
    Please don‚Äôt belittle their feelings of ptsd 
Nothing will ever dethrone "Horsey Fatback" for me.
I was doing some r/UnexpectedGameGrumps lol

The nations largest power producer, by megawatts generated, always at 100%
The more you know! Thanks man!
Nuclear Plant Cooling Towers. Something has to cool down them reactors. That's a lot of power they must be generating for that many cooling towers, of that size. The plant I'm currently working at generates over 1000MW. A quick look, Palo Verde puts out almost 4k MW of power, so yeah...Definitely need some major cooling to them reactors.
    Just FYI cooling towers are independent of the fuel source! I'm not involved in them a bunch but the design is based off of other things like local climate, power out put, lifespan, and even the nature view.
    This is not a nuclear plant, nor is it palo verde




        It certainly seems like Palo Verde. If this isn't it, then what is it?
            An SRP plant on the east side of town.
My money is on the SRP Santan Generating Station in Gilbert. Pretty sure I saw this today

I work at Palo Verde. I'm not honestly sure of this is it. The vapor seems a bit small (depends on dew point etc) and I don't recognize the landscape/angle but maybe I've never seen it from that angle. You can clearly see it from 50 miles away so I doubt I've seen every angle.
    It‚Äôs not Palo Verde. It‚Äôs SRPs plant on Val Vista and Warner. 
It is Palo Verde.  Mechanical draft cooling towers with that kind of heat output in that scenery is unmistakable.  
    I knew that's where it was based on the scenery too. I almost said it was [Columbia Generating Station](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Columbia_Generating_Station_at_Hanford_Washington.JPG), but ironically, it's too green to be Washington.
 Always bear in mindwhen shutting the oven door to do so gently, as if a slam is indulgedin all the gas jets will be blown out, and an explosion would probablyresult

Palo Verde on a dry day. OPs pic is East valley (other poster said an SRP station).
TBH it looks like a hybrid of rapidash and reshiram

Nitpicky, but not actually steam! Just water vapor. Steam implies the water is very hot!
Mixed with cancer
    It is a pressurised water reactor. No cancer unless there was a massive meltdown. There is a huge misconception about nuclear plants. There is only a 4 percent increase in health risk when working for a nuclear plant. Very minute risk.
        4% compared to what? I'm not doubting you, but I'm curious what they are basing it off of
            Normal working conditions in other kinds of electricity plants i think.
            Exactly what the other commenter said. The NRC has regulations for radiation allowances that we are allowed to pick up yearly, and the truth of the matter is that you'll never even get close to that amount. It is set at 5 rem, and at most, I've picked up .02% of that.
NeVAHda
    I‚Äôm mad that I didn‚Äôt think of that
        Is the sword user flair?
            Yes
I am constantly in awe at how often AZ is on the front page. Like seriously. Its weird seeing the same shit I see every day on the internet but also down the street. WTF.
Nope, but they can have huge vapor clouds if it's humid!

Pretty awesome to see in person.

Na,  they're on Ray just east of Mesa Gateway Airport looking west. You can the Ahwatukee foothills in the background.

Edit: I think.
    you right, drive on this road on the way to work every morning
Yeah looks like the plant over in Gilbert. I‚Äôve seen it everyday this week cause it‚Äôs been so cold.
    its a water purification plant!
    Slightly unrelated, but: is it terrible that I laughed every time someone mentioned it's cold lately? 

I'm mostly asking because I live in Chicago. We get this effect a lot so I'm used to the whole water vapor science behind the phenomenon.
