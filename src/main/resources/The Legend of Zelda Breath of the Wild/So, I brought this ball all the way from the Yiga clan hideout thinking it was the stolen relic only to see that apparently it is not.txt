[[So, I brought this ball all the way from the Yiga clan hideout thinking it was the stolen relic only to see that apparently it is not]]





I cannot imagine your frustration but damn, I'm impressed. How long did that take?
    I used all the master sword's power for hitting the ball in stasis three times just to get up [this](http://imgur.com/a/ujwi8e6) friking river,the rest was by foot but surprisingly took less time that throwing around the ball up through the river for ice cube to ice cube

        Generally I have learned in games if it is insanely hard and not working I am going the wrong way.
            This game in particular is carefully produced. Several times I though I had glitched a puzzle only later to go ohhhhhh when noticing something I had missed.
        Why not just follow the path? It's a longer route but you can literally just walk it.
            How he even got it to the snowfield in the beginning is beyond me

            shut up itâ€™s trying itâ€™s best
TBH I totally get why you would make this mistake. Like, how can someone organically get to a point where they follow the guard up to the fairy fountain where he meets with the Yiga? If I didnâ€™t already read about that shrine thereâ€™d be no way Iâ€™d ever figure it out.
    I played without the use of any guides or anything (usually I avoid guides to begin with but have no problem using them when I get stuck, but for BotW I decided no guides ever), and I spent most of a day trying to figure out this shrine. It was *so* satisfying when I finally figured it out, and one of the reasons I intend to play BotW2 the same way
        [deleted]
            Which constellation?
                Is one of the first shrine in korok forest iirc, need to look up the stars in the wall inside to know where to put each orb

I skipped that one by yeeting myself with bombs lol
                    I remember that now.  One of them was really hard to get.
            I think I'm going to follow a map to follow a certain path at the silent realms trials in skyward sword for switch. I currently just did the first eldin dungeon and its been pretty fun. I discovered a webpage with maps to speedrun the trials and have no doubt I'll be using them
            I decided I could simply skip a few shrines. You don't need all or even most of them. I would leave when stuck, and maybe come back, or not. Sometimes when coming back I would spot something new.

I never finished the one that needs the drink "noble's pursuit" . I thought I would go back to it after finding it somewhere, and I never found it. That one doesn't seem worth bothering with if it takes looking in a guide.

There is one that says the clue is on the other peak. What confused me is that there were two shrines in the other peak. You can't see the one you need if you fast travel. You have to come up and look across.

Similarly for the one about the eagle's belly.

Most, though, will come I to clarity if you run around, try stuff, and pause to think it through slowly.
                Just take pictures using the camera that the game gives you, then you don't have to fast travel between the shrines
                for the noble pursuit shrine, try going to the bar in gerudo. its actually a pretty fun shrine quest once you get past that part which can be understandably confusing
            Same.   It was the first time I broke down and thought, "well dammit, Google, here I come" at that one
        What shrine are you talking about?
            The one from the post. This shrine quest
        One of the few games I literally have to resort to the guide I never beatâ€¦ Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic
    Youâ€™re told in the quest to watch at night for any suspicious activity. Thereâ€™s a few people you can follow, the guard is one of them.
        HIS NAME IS DORIAN
    There were hints to watch people behaving strangely after dark.

I think the third person I followed worked
        Yes. Unfortunately, there are several people that are talking and wandering around at night.
    I did not find this difficult. The game tells you exactly what to do. Follow suspicious people at night. There's a few villagers you can follow around and one of them is that guard. Pretty organic I think.
        yeah, and i noticed he was missing from his post in front of Impa's house, so I talked to the other guard and he said he left to go up the mountain. really, I though it was obvious.
    Eh, they keep talking about it being "somewhere nearby acting wierd during nighttime" so I found it quite natural to run out and talk to people. I found the old lady first, then the guard who who tells you there have only been two peopl up there, then the lady from the clothing shop and finaly somebody told me that only that guard had been in there and tha he was in the mountains. 
I started playing the game a week aho and have used few guides to solve a few shrines but this one I did all by myself and found it fairly intuitive
    this was my very last shrine i got. and it bugged the hell out of me that I couldnâ€™t figure it out but after spending like probably 7 or 8 hours altogether in kakariko village it finally clicked. donâ€™t remember exactly how i ended up figuring it out
    This shrine was the only shrine I've ever googled, right after I got the game and before I decided I want to figure things out on my own.

Edit: didn't notice this is like 4 months old, it was just crossposted to one of the other Legend of Zelda subs and that's how I ended up here. Sorry to bug you!
    Same thing happened to me.

I always expected the important orb in Impa's house would be important to the story, and it would become available when I defeated divine beasts or something.

But nope, some pervy guard is a weirdo, and following him triggers the ball being stolen.

Or does this one also require the firefly girl first?
        Firefly girl is a prereq to trigger the theft. You have to do all the village quests.
            That was the problem.  First time I saw her, I collected the fireflies and released them in her room, but didn't get the timing right, so they flew away without completing the quest.  Then I saw a sword on top of a mountain and well... I got BOTWed.
                I did that my last play through.

I busted in like hereâ€™s your dang fireflies, and she yelled at me for walking into peoples houses at night.
                    That was it exactly.
        Pervy Guard?
            The guard was a spy right? Or am I thinking of the wrong person?
                nope, ur right, but the phrasing was odd.
                    Oh yeah. But those yiga clan have always been a bit creepy and pervy.  What do they have all those bananas for?
                        We have different definitions of pervy.
                The guard is an ex-yiga clan member, so a good guy.
                    And they kinda murdered his wife in retaliation for his desertion and *threatened his kids* to make him keep spying for them, sooo....even his bad actions weren't by choice. And he even went up the mountain to try and confront the dude.
    I was totally stuck on that one for ages. I knew I had to get that ball somehow but left it after trying everything. There was a point almost 100 hours in where somehow somebody mentioned the guard and I happened to be there when he walked off or something. I kind of blundered my way into it but knew I was looking for clues.
On a less intense but related note, this reminds me of the time I hauled like three Cuccos from Dueling Peaks Stable to Kakariko Village for that side questâ€¦they were not the right chickens lol
    o o f
Damn now you gotta take it all the way back.
    is this true or will it just respawn if you die or something?
        Itâ€™ll respawn. Donâ€™t even have to die since itâ€™s in a different area.
Itâ€™s posts like these that make me want to replay breath of the wild and spend hours of my life doing self imposed challenges like this knowing they donâ€™t reward me in the slightest
Hahahaha, that's AMAZING. You're the actual hero Hyrule needs.
That's rough buddy
Errrr, yikes my man.
I love how Paya is just staring at it like "wtf?"
I donâ€™t really understand the writing on that, weâ€™re told the yiga clan wanted to throw it down the hole, but that is a travesty. So we should stop the yiga clan and get it back so they do not throw it down the hole. Then when we get it back we throw it down the hole!
[deleted]
    Put that thing back where it came from
        or so help me!
            r/UnexpectedMonstersInc
Try putting it in the shrine thing by the great fairy
I took the wrong ball to the Yiga Clan hideout to throw down the hole. Can't remember where I took it from but it was miles away. Duh.

Feels bad man.
Oh no! Impressive though - and kind of a cool quest idea. Maybe there should be one like this in BOTW2 that involves carrying something large a long way
    No, I donâ€™t feel like taking hours on one quest, skipable side quest maybe
    Getting fish girl's love letter down the river was plenty enough, thanks
        ???
            There's a side quest near the Zora's domain where a little Zora girl sends a love letter down a river and you have to keep it from hitting anything until it arrives at a beach clear down the river
                Woah! Never heard of that, def gotta find that. Thanks!
                    I just did this one earlier this week. Very fun I thought.
                It suuuuuuuuucks
What the fuck
Wtf mate ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Fuck I did the same thing
On my first play though, I carried one of the orbs from the Hinox brothers all the way to the shrine base near this and put it in. Nothing happened
I mean, there are a million of those things in the game
This is a nightmare. Considering the fact that this game gives you zero direction and is so literal. You'd think that it would be the case, but unfortunately it is not.

So you thought bringing a ball half across the map with stasis was the correct storyline?
    My thoughts exactly. I get that following the dude isn't immediately obvious either but video game logic usually says the missing piece is near the puzzle so it never even occurred to me to try and transport one across the map.
You're gonna be even more upset when you find out you have to toss it into the hole Kohga fell into after his boss fight
Madlad
How did you get it out of the pit at the yiga hideout?
    He didnt. He didnt even do that shrine
Did u bring it all the way back too?
    I just teleported and the ball was back at the hideout
SÃºper Mario golf Zelda
Did u try placing it on the pedestal for the shrine nearby?
Iâ€™m pretty sure I did the same thing early on in the game
    You can't.... That orb only spawns after doing all 4 divine beasts
Wow lol thatâ€™s crazy Iâ€™m honestly impressed you got it all the way there that must have sucked lol
i can just imagine link thinking: *well shi-*

            With Paya and Impa on the way it was quite hard but when it did hit the pedestal it just slipped and bounced to the ball
F
Oof.
You have to drop it in the hole and oh my god Iâ€™m so sorry lmfao
o7
Is that the ball you're supposed to throw into the giant hole?   
And why did you bring it back to that village? Aren't the Gerudo the ones who were looking for it?
Wait... So that ISN'T the right one as we've established. Kudos on the effort it must have taken, btw. But I'm wondering, what would happen if you put it into the hole on the hill that the actual one from Kakariko is supposed to go?
    Sadly nothing
Payas like huh was not expecting this (a little bit scared as well) like ahh and huh it's back
Some players have created self-challenges within BotW, but gotta admit, first time I've seen this one. Even if it was purely a misunderstanding, impressive effort!
I love these threads dear lord you guys are hilarious ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ this is the ultimate comedy
Weâ€™ve all done it. Youâ€™re the only one willing to own up to it.
I laughed entirely too hard at this. My husband also got a good laugh. Sorry you wasted God knows how much time ðŸ˜†
I brought a ball all the way from the three Hinox brothers in the southeast to the spot near the Kakoriko fairy fountain but that ball doesnâ€™t work there
I cannot stop laughing. This is why I love this game and all the fans so much. Too funny!
    I cannot stand ho laughing.  This is wherefore bite this by the ear game and all the fans so much.  Too comical!

I DID THE EXACT SAME THING LOL!
Side question! Ive beat the game twice now and never once has the relic been stolen! Is this a side quest thing I donâ€™t know about ?
It SHOULD be possible
    What brought you here? After 5 months?
Botw thought process "This is absolutely absurd... So must be exactly what the game intends"
I love bow all botw players just share a collective braincell
So you thought bringing a ball half across the map with stasis was the correct storyline?
I did this too!!!!
I didnt think you could take that one away
wait untill night the go up to the local shrine socket and hide. wait until the cutscene starts and then  the relic will be yours.
Now u have to bring it back to unlock the secret shrine to get a part of the quest of the motorcycle done
so what if you put it in the pedestal?
Iâ€™m pretty sure thereâ€™s an orb like this one near the fairy fountain lol

My thoughts exactly. I get that following the dude isn't immediately obvious either but video game logic usually says the missing piece is near the puzzle so it never even occurred to me to try and transport one across the map.
He didnt. He didnt even do that shrine
I just teleported and the ball was back at the hideout
You can't.... That orb only spawns after doing all 4 divine beasts

    Pretty sure you are drunk bot, go home
    Shakespeare really fell off
    Good bot
I did, it didn't
    [removed]
        With Paya and Impa on the way it was quite hard but when it did hit the pedestal it just slipped and bounced to the ball
Sadly nothing
I cannot stand ho laughing.  This is wherefore bite this by the ear game and all the fans so much.  Too comical!

Generally I have learned in games if it is insanely hard and not working I am going the wrong way.
    This game in particular is carefully produced. Several times I though I had glitched a puzzle only later to go ohhhhhh when noticing something I had missed.
Why not just follow the path? It's a longer route but you can literally just walk it.
    How he even got it to the snowfield in the beginning is beyond me

    Which constellation?
        Is one of the first shrine in korok forest iirc, need to look up the stars in the wall inside to know where to put each orb

I skipped that one by yeeting myself with bombs lol
            I remember that now.  One of them was really hard to get.
    I think I'm going to follow a map to follow a certain path at the silent realms trials in skyward sword for switch. I currently just did the first eldin dungeon and its been pretty fun. I discovered a webpage with maps to speedrun the trials and have no doubt I'll be using them
    I decided I could simply skip a few shrines. You don't need all or even most of them. I would leave when stuck, and maybe come back, or not. Sometimes when coming back I would spot something new.

I never finished the one that needs the drink "noble's pursuit" . I thought I would go back to it after finding it somewhere, and I never found it. That one doesn't seem worth bothering with if it takes looking in a guide.

There is one that says the clue is on the other peak. What confused me is that there were two shrines in the other peak. You can't see the one you need if you fast travel. You have to come up and look across.

Similarly for the one about the eagle's belly.

Most, though, will come I to clarity if you run around, try stuff, and pause to think it through slowly.
        Just take pictures using the camera that the game gives you, then you don't have to fast travel between the shrines
        for the noble pursuit shrine, try going to the bar in gerudo. its actually a pretty fun shrine quest once you get past that part which can be understandably confusing
    Same.   It was the first time I broke down and thought, "well dammit, Google, here I come" at that one
What shrine are you talking about?
    The one from the post. This shrine quest
One of the few games I literally have to resort to the guide I never beatâ€¦ Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic
HIS NAME IS DORIAN
Yes. Unfortunately, there are several people that are talking and wandering around at night.
yeah, and i noticed he was missing from his post in front of Impa's house, so I talked to the other guard and he said he left to go up the mountain. really, I though it was obvious.
Firefly girl is a prereq to trigger the theft. You have to do all the village quests.
    That was the problem.  First time I saw her, I collected the fireflies and released them in her room, but didn't get the timing right, so they flew away without completing the quest.  Then I saw a sword on top of a mountain and well... I got BOTWed.
        I did that my last play through.

I busted in like hereâ€™s your dang fireflies, and she yelled at me for walking into peoples houses at night.
            That was it exactly.
Pervy Guard?
    The guard was a spy right? Or am I thinking of the wrong person?
        nope, ur right, but the phrasing was odd.
            Oh yeah. But those yiga clan have always been a bit creepy and pervy.  What do they have all those bananas for?
                We have different definitions of pervy.
        The guard is an ex-yiga clan member, so a good guy.
            And they kinda murdered his wife in retaliation for his desertion and *threatened his kids* to make him keep spying for them, sooo....even his bad actions weren't by choice. And he even went up the mountain to try and confront the dude.
Itâ€™ll respawn. Donâ€™t even have to die since itâ€™s in a different area.
or so help me!

    There's a side quest near the Zora's domain where a little Zora girl sends a love letter down a river and you have to keep it from hitting anything until it arrives at a beach clear down the river
        Woah! Never heard of that, def gotta find that. Thanks!
