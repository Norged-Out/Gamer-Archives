[[This is what Azucena does to people]]





My brother in Neutral. That's LTG. He does it to himself.
    you can hear him just mashing away lol
        "Mashing blah blah blah not blocking blah blah blah"
    https://youtu.be/CsJfLKtGlfw?si=jiGnx-UkL-cbbMYI

Skip to 5:03. Ever since then LTG can‚Äôt play at all. He‚Äôs just terrible.
        Is this the guy that did the video where he gives a breakdown of how he‚Äôd have his goons hold down his enemy so he can sexually dominate them? And then proceeded to demonstrate how it would go with his pillow?
            yes lmao
                Link?

                        What the fuck did i just watch
                        Thank you that‚Äôs probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen
            Um which time because hes done that so many times lol
                Someone actually replied with a dramatized version of the exact video I was thinking of.
            He did what?
        I never watched that before. That was just embarrassing. Can‚Äôt act like an adult. If I had the power I‚Äôd ban him from competing publicly.
            He's almost 40 years old. I hope he can overcome his anger and learn to block.
            He‚Äôs already banned from EVO and some other events i am pretty sure
                Banned from EVO, CEO (basically all Capcom events);  
he's trying to say it's due to 'racism' and for just chatting in an EVO stream; completely forgetting his transphobic rant regarding CeroBlast, his disabled rant against BrolyLegs, multiple, multiple racist rants against ANTi, SMUG, Punk, etc. etc.

And to be honest his toxic personality in general.
        here you can share timestamps brotha

        That dude flexed on ltg while wearing a tucked in polo that went past his upper waist always seals this clip for me. 

It's the most fgc thing ever.
            Jay 'Viscant' Snyder; guy is a legit FGC legend and an all around good guy.
                Oh I believe it, he didn't back down to a punk like ltg and I knew about this clip before I even picked up fighting games.

In this clip he's like the best encapsulation of the fgc in the best way possible.

He's wearing the corniest outfit but steps to a gym bro, beats him in the game, tells ltg to suck his dick, and it's awesome.
    And he is using Victor.... like why hate Coffee girl doing the same strings over and over when Victor does pretty much the same things.
        He's not smart enough for self-reflection nor simply looking up a guide as to how the games he plays works.
    Its amazing how one man can be so universally hated in every game he touches and yet still has major following. I get it it's entertaining to see him beign pathetic but I feel it's not worth enabling him just for that.
        DSP?
I could watch LTG lose all day.
    I just know about him because of Themainmanswe and now my Youtube is Full of LTG Salt Videos with Plugging etc and i have to say i'm having a blast watching those Videos
        Big ups to all the trolls! üòÇ
        Used to be fun until it wrapped back around to the trolls being worse than him. Now I quite like LTG. He says some off the wall stuff and has a lot of issues but he‚Äôs genuinely hilarious. Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act. So many ridiculous quotes from him get quoted all of the time by friends or random people I see online. Troll videos now on the other hand censor everything so they can monetize their copy pasted videos. It just makes me roll my eyes and I instantly click off if I hear swear words being censored by people who call this man greedy etc. I used to laugh when LTG would insult them and cope with it by saying all sorts of things about their personal lives. But now literally all of that has turned out to be true and it‚Äôs just pathetic at this point.

Love the guy or dislike him all you want. When it becomes an obsession and your feelings are genuinely hurt that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not fun anymore.
            I think it's fair to say both him and his "fans"/trolls are dipshits. Some of the clips are still funny though lol. "this dude did a 10 hit combo" lmfao
                Yeah that‚Äôs fair haha. And LOL!!! I remember reenacting that while streaming SoulCalibur 2 once just out of pure random üòπ My friends got a good laugh out of it.
            > Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act.

Maybe, but when your "act" is saying racist, scummy shit, blocking and banning literally anyone who doesn't kiss his ass, and throwing a hissy fit when losing and plugging, can you really just boil it down to being an act? That's who he is.
                For sure
            Uh you realize he kinda groomed someone right.
                Wouldn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt keep up with him anymore. After he got banned from YouTube and the trolls became worse than him I stopped caring about it all. Laughing at the occasional image with him in it etc. Used to like watching his streams though. There was always a lot of funny stuff that was cut out from those reuploads.
                When?
                    Search up "LTG groomer" on YouTube. It should be the first vid. Goes into a lot of the stuff he's done.
                        Ah but surely it was just an act...
/s
                        So it's personal with you guys? How did it become personal?? And why do you guys care about LTG so much?
                            I don't really give af about LTG drama lol. Just saying he isn't exactly an angel.
                                ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
                                    Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
                            Yes, when a person is groomed and abused, it's personal.
                                So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
            I can't imagine unironically liking a scumbag like him, damn man. I don't care about his trolls but everything I've seen of him is that he's a racist narcissistic sociopath pos with anger issues. Not to mention how he stalks and harassed people like Joontheking for making a negative video about him
                Joon is a piece of work himself but yeah, not cool to harass the guy or anyone else. Not saying LTG is a model citizen but he‚Äôs entertaining. I like him in that way.
            It's not an act when he's emotionally abusive to his girlfriend on stream and forgets to mute his mic.
                Does he have a new gf now? Wasn‚Äôt aware. I only ever saw that one girl he dated on and off a long time ago appear on his streams.
    Is LTG even a good player? His Victor looks somehow even worse than mine.
        The guy is a toxic, plugging crybaby. He can't play Tekken for shit. 2Ds he has some prowess but that doesn't make him any less of a twat.
            Not even in 2d games is he good. I‚Äôve seen him play sf6 and all he does is jump and go for grabs and wonder why he keeps losing. Dude can‚Äôt tech a throw or DI so save his life
                Fr. In every game he plays he bitches about them ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù the combos in games too and how these players would never hit that in [insert game]. Like bro, what does that say about YOU? Dudes dropping combos like they‚Äôre made of goddamn butter. The self awareness is nonexistent. 

Like seriously, this dude can‚Äôt even hit a combo over 250 damage in fucking MK1. Dude just picks reiko (grappler) and zones or does armored grabs. He can‚Äôt even use his main command grab that‚Äôs locked behind a half circle input.
                Nah watch him play sf4 lol
                    I did, spamming rolls and knives with Rolento isn't skill

He always loved to spam something, even back to SF4 days.
            bro does not have prowess in 2d either
            he is ass at Street Fighter...
            His "thing" is to literally intentionally lose a lot, be toxic and go crazy on stream, then rake in the views as he goes viral for being an asshole. He does it in 2D and 3D, it's a whole shtick.
                I've played him in person before he had any degree of notoriety (I live in lancaster). The salt is real and he's always had the same attitude.
                It's about time somebody has a brain in this brainless community. Exactly, he feeds off it, even when I watched some of the "rage clips" I never took him seriously enough to be getting angry and wanting him off of Youtube, why? That's insanity. He can rage all he wants, who cares. How are you guys falling for that?? Lol.
                    Being a plugging asshole as a schtick is still being a plugging asshole. Doesn't matter how intentional it is or isn't, it's no wonder people don't like him
                        Then don't watch him. You know how crazy you sound right now? Well he's right about one thing, you guys are some serious stalkers and what's baffling is you're proving him right lol. You guys are some real creeps stalking a DUDE online üòÇüòÇ
                            I don't watch his stuff. What I'm saying is, it is no wonder that people don't like the guy
                                You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
                                    Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
                            He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?
                                He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

* You're right that isn't stalking, but that's not all you guys are doing either, it's personal, that's more than just simply "discussing" about him. You took him very seriously (which is very strange because his content from what I've seen, is clearly for entertainment, who gets mad over that??) Also, you guys can't seem to shut up ahout him, like is he really that important to you? You act like you l've never been on the internet. Well then again maybe you haven't so I don't know. 


Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?

I don't know, does it?
                                    It's a post about him. People are discussing on the post. There's one post about him and 1000s not about him. It isn't even the hottest post. I think you'd need to try harder to convince me people were obsessed. For instance, I haven't made a comment on here and saw your comment whilst ambiently scrolling. It struck me as obviously incorrect. I don't think this is me being somehow unnaturally interested in someone. 

He is indeed clearly entertaining some people. But other people are allowed to have an opinion on that, especially since he's promoting a culture that is seen widely as toxic, antisocial and bad for the game health. (Just like how I'm happy to say that Nigel Farage is a symbol for an attitude that had blighted the United Kingdom, even if other people think the sun shines out of his arse.)

You did the capitalisation. Presumably you'd know.
                    Are you LTG?
                        Don't be stupid.
        He‚Äôs an above average player at best. He can hold his own when he‚Äôs not acting like a child but god forbid you read him, grab him, outplay him, or mix him. But Tekken has never been one of his main games. He plays street fighter for the most part and still acts the same way there. All in all, he‚Äôs an above average player in SF, an average player in Tekken and a TERRIBLE player in Smash. Like genuinely he has one of the worst Snakes i‚Äôve ever seen but I digress.
            Honestly, LTG is way worse than he should be. I would say he's average at SF but below average for Tekken. There are players, like those at Sajam's tournament that are higher ranked than he is and they've only played Tekken 8 and have barely any exposure to previous fighting games. LTG has played Tekken before, including T7, along with numerous other fighting games so his current ranking is pretty poor considering, even if Tekken isn't his main game.
                LTG is an embarrassment, but you have a warped perspective if you think having multiple characters at Masters rank makes you an average SF player. No amount of rank inflation has 50% of the playerbase in Masters.
                Yep, he says he played Tekken since Tekken 3, but somehow he is worse than many players that have only played Tekken 8, that's a disgrace.

My cousin is higher rank than him(blue rank), without plugging, and he only played Tekken 7 for a couple of months during pandemic.

For the amount of time LTG has been playing fighting games ,he should have a similar level to Sajam
                    tbf i've been playing since tekken 1, but when you're a kid you're really just button mashing. there wasn't a youtube to teach the fundamentals
                        Same, once I got onto Tekken 3, the combos started to click for me. I was just too young before.
                        He is 40 years old, he wasn't a kid when Tekken came 3!came out 

Anyways he played Tekken 5 while being 18+.
                [deleted]
                    Average is low red actually. There‚Äôs a rank distribution chart and everything.

                            Garyu was the peak of the bell curve.
            His Snake is garbage and his Richter is nauseating to watch. Just terrible.
            Purple ranks isn't average though, no? That's actually pretty good for like the overall player base.

He's definitely not like tournament level player for any damn thing he plays, though. Not even weeklies.
                He only got to purples because he's a notorious rage quitter. He gets beaten by reds and even orange ranks regularly.
                True. Purple ranks are definitely not average players. But in LTGs case, no. He constantly plugs, ragequits and does ‚Äúone and dones‚Äù. Also i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in the orange ranks? Which I would still consider above average but like one more step above, if that makes sense.
                    When I see his clips, he's definitely playing against purples, at least when he's playing Viktor.
                    His Victor is purple. But his Feng is orange rank.
        He had to plug his way to ruler.
        he played against mainman the other day as Victor and was actually pretty good
            That shouldn't be an indication that he is necessarily good, but people with the same playstyle as him, which happens to be the higher escalon of Tekken player, he is decent. Anyone else, he can't play against them. His sets against Lacari and Fairlight kinda showed that, cause their playstyle was very aggressive while being patient
        He is. [Pretty decent I‚Äôd say](https://youtu.be/y6N08xKNAjM?si=NjLeLmflFQuUZuE5) not top tier but pretty good. Not as bad as most clips make him out to be
    I would rather not have LTG being posted...

at all...
    Please don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs remained relevant for all these years.
        That's very true, I'd never actually watch his stuff.
    Who is LTG???
        A meaningless nobody, best left forgotten as a footnote in the annals of time
            If only. Like with stonetoss, its a career built and maintained on the backs of people that supposedly hate him and want him to go away lol.
                His ‚Äútrolls‚Äù (read: stans)
                When really they don't want him to go away because then they wouldn't be able to have fun trolling his channel.
                Stop pretending stonetoss is wrong
                    Hes a nazi

Edit: DO NOT look through this guys history
                        Right of Marx = Nazi
            At the bottom of a pit occupied by only him and DSP.
    I only just now found out about this dude from this subreddit and it is quite fun to watch him lose his everloving mind on a game.
    And that is what he's counting on.
    At least he didn‚Äôt plug this time.
Did he try his signature 2,2,2,2 into unplug combo? Ltg made that one famous.
    The unplug whiffed
brother fell for the oldest trick in the book and didn't have patience
    I do too üòî
        Same, especially against Paul for some reasons
    Or the brain capacity to duck after the mid
        The string jails you can‚Äôt duck the high after the mid. You can duck the 3rd high though.
            Newbie: what‚Äôs jailing?
                Jailing is basically when you are **forced** to block an attack that you can normally avoid by crouching or sidestepping. Usually describes *strings* that "jail"; the later parts of the string might be (for example) high attacks, and if the first part whiffs, you can crouch under them like normal. However, if you end up blocking the first hit, you'll be trapped in jail and stuck blocking all of it. (taken from the fighting game glossary, handy site for terminology!)
                    Thanks for the info and thanks for referring me to the fighting game glossary!
            Which string jails specifically?
            Ah I see nvm then
Average Victor player reaction when someone else unga bungas.
    Victor be like : Wanna see me spam my gun ? *Wanna see me do it again ?*
        The most spammers I‚Äôve encountered are Victor. And it‚Äôs always that one combo where he disappears and then uses his gun.
            I recently found out that it's possible to throw em when they tp in with the katana. So I generally duck the gun into surprise throw and it worked a lot of time already.
Azucena doesn't do this to most people LTG just cries if anyone dares press a button against him.  I'll never understand why anyone gives him a view.
    It's pleasing to watch him lose. Unfortunately, watching him lose means supporting him by watching him at all. There's why I love compilation videos of him getting his ass whooped on other channels.
        There's literally people dedicated to secondhand streaming him, so you can watch him lose his mind without directly giving him views.
    But realistically, a ton of people have been tuning to him for years
LTG is considered 'people' now?
    Its crazy how twitch let him stream. He's the most racist , homophobic, abusive person I've ever seen stream.

Some of his past stuff was just crazy. He was calling black people he was playing against monkeys and coons. Some pretty dark shit he's said on stream.
        even though hes a horrible person, hes absolutely hilarious
            Glad you find racism, body shaming and homophobic insults funny
                its his eloquence when speaking and how he words things. and body shaming is absolutely hilarious and should be encouraged since obesity is such an issue. the Japanese people that make tekken would agree with me too
                    Ok Dale
    That's what I'm saying when I first saw this.
As an Azucena player I'd *like* to say I didn't get off on doing this to people.
Truly low tier.
What a bitch he is
lowtiergroomer
    People REALLY easily forget that this man literally groomed children
        wait did he
            https://youtu.be/DvAWHHEGpiE?si=CfXBbg3oENrZcrG2

He was seeing minors at age 29
Maybe LTG would prefer it if Azucena was a 16 year old girl
    Is there a story here?
        oh yes there is
        There is
    wasnt that stuff disproven
        I‚Äôm pretty sure he admitted to it
That's pretty much the bread and butter of how I play Azucena in neutral...but just to establish a back and forth before the real gameplay starts.

I've never seen anybody above yellow actually die to just those strings lmao

You can stop everything she threw with standing block (except the low poke that does like 5 damage and leads to nothing). Like, if he had just waited his turn he would have basically been full health.
    He was already tilted from losing a 3-0 set with the same player just before.
        That'll do it. I went from Shinryu almost all the way back to yellow one day because I was tilted and refused to wait my turn lmao
    Honestly, it's pretty much the bnb of any character with df1 extensions. 

Like all the Azu was doing was mid checks and playing around completing strings and basic wall oki. 

Like this video isn't an indictment of Azu. Didn't spam WR3,2 or anything. This was just pokes into wall splat and him just eating every single thing because he was mashing.
        Well said.
    Whats the string?
        She mostly just threw single jabs and kicks in the video... a couple partial strings that were just two-hit high punches that are slower than jabs.

The string that launched/splatted him at the end was d,3,3,4. It's three kicks that hit low, mid, mid and the last one knocks down on hit.

He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao. Usually the only way I land the knockdown is if they crouch block after the low because they're expecting more lows.

If you just standing block that string only the low will hit. It does basically no damage, and the knockdown kick at the end is super negative on block so it would have been a free launch for Victor.

Even if he ate the first two kicks and just blocked the third, he would have lived, gotten a free launch/combo, and gotten away from the wall.
            He was obviously desperate to get a hit in to disrupt the combo instead of focusing on defense. Ive been there but...damn, he got whooped bad with couple simple combos.
            > He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao

It's one of those strings I call 'passive guard breaks': even though none of the hits are a natural combo, if you just let go of the controller instead of holding back after getting hit by the low, you won't block the mids as you normally would while not pressing anything.
                Do people actually use passive guard?
                    Probably no series veterans do, but I find it convenient when I want to stay close to the enemy so I can punish things or have my pokes reach them after blocking.
                        That's fair. I'm not sure how I feel about the passive guard tbh. No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

Passive guard has saved me a few times in Tekken and it honestly felt kind of cheap...I was just like "...alright...cool" üòÇ

But then it made me wonder how many of my attacks are just getting auto-blocked, which is kind of frustrating. It feels like a feature that should only exist in special-style and definitely shouldn't be useable in ranked.
                            > No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

I come from SoulCalibur, there blocking is a dedicated face button and you can't move while holding it (can only crouch and empty jump).

> and it honestly felt kind of cheap

Why would it be cheap though? To have passive guard work, you have to literally not press any other button. Not attack, not sidestep, not move forward. The decision you're making is the same, except now there's an extra choice of whether you want to move back or not.
                                That makes sense. I'm pretty precise with my inputs though. I never press anything unless I know what I'm pressing and why, so I feel like I get disproportionately rewarded by passive block lol

It punishes mashers though which I suppose is a good thing.

I definitely prefer Soul Calibur's block though. It just feels cleaner because you have more exact control over duck/jump vs. sidestepping. 

Holding back to block is more of a 2D fighter thing and I don't think it's the best choice for a 3D fighter because it makes some of your inputs context-sensitive.

The number of times I've tried to sidestep in Tekken only to crouch/jump instead is annoying. I know it's a skill issue, but it just feels messier to me.
That‚Äôs a 40 yr old man. Screaming like a child, before making excuses and refusing to just get better at the game.

Don‚Äôt be like this.
    LTG IS 40?!?
        Yep. Painfully embarrassing for him, I know.
            Wow...i thought dude was like my age i used to watch him for his signature ps screen into quit combo but wowwwwwwww. This is mind-bogglin....thought dude was a teen like me a decade and some change ago
        He has a bot on his twitch stream that bans anybody saying "pushing 40" or "bodied" man is the most insecure person on the platform. One guy got timed out for 2 weeks for asking what character he was going to main in T8 because he wasn't subbed.
I see, so that's what Harada meant by saying he wants to make Tekken more aggressive!
THIS DUDES DOING STRINGS
ALL THAT OFF V-TRIGGER!
Never heard about him until a few weeks ago. Fuck that guy
    It's true what they say: Ignorance truly is bliss when it comes to LTG
ITS THE SAME OL FUCKING SHIT
You should coffee yourself NOW... Your blend serves NO PURPOSE
Shocked he didn't plug
‚ÄúMods clean up my tears, you know what to do‚Äù üëÜüèæ
That‚Äôs what happens when you plug your way to the purple ranks lol
    Yeah that's the weirdest part of plugging.  You getting your ass kicked, and now you want to surround yourself with even better players and get your ass kicked even more?  

Pluggers think they're getting the better of someone or protecting themselves, but all they're doing is plunging deeper into territory they can't handle.  A rank isn't a reward, it's a tool to keep you around people you can be competitive with.
        Exactly. I‚Äôm in red ranks because I belong there. I win about 50% of my matches there and I‚Äôve just been doing quick matche until I can win more consistently with people around my rank then I‚Äôll try ranked again. Cheating my way to purple would just fuck me over lol
Ltg isn't people
Bro got hit 8 times in a game where 3 hits can kill you and still complains he never had a chance lol
it is so funny seeing this shit, because hitting a safe string a few times and then finishing the string to fish for a CH is literally a knowledge check and raging this hard about such a common factor of the game is so telling of how bad he really is.
bro forgot what blocking is
good get shit on.
I love watching him rage
LTG really just complained about Azucena repeating the same combo over and over again, but still wasn't able to block a single hit lmao
The guy literally plays Victor ....
I feel like this is just Tekken in general
    Maybe you're not blocking enough then?
        
No one has managed to get a perfect off of me so far but Tekken is kind of known for getting touched and dying.
Bro pressed at the obvious CH ender after being conditioned. I play Eliminators who know how to duck that.
You‚Äôre using Victor, complaining about anyone‚Ä¶ Wild, get wrecked.
I thought dale said he was an alien or some goofy shit
Soy la reina del caf√© !
And thats why i love azucena :)
LTG losing is the only worthwhile thing he has
Gotta love watching LTG lose his mind.

I swear after all these years if this boy doesn't calm down he is going to have serious high blood pressure issues.
    He's broadcasting his incompetence for the world to see.  Turning the camera off to cry isn't helping either.  This guy needs to move on and accept that he just can't handle fighting games.  No shame in that
As an Azucena main I have no problem with people calling her cheap, but if you're a Victor main saying it then you can fuck right off.
Azucena mains rise up
    I am not even calling her Azucena, she is just coffee.
        Leo's intro line with her always sounds to me like they're saying "Coffee Queen again?!"
yell was timed with the stage song drop
LMAOO
Nah man that's just LTG
All you have to do is not press lol
Df1,4 df1,4 (df1,4) 1 catches so many people lmfaoo mfs be mashing
Should‚Äôve tried to use your rage
I dont see any people in this video
THIS DUDE DOING STRINGS
lil bro cant duck 1 4 1
The coffee sip at the end just does it for me
LTG does this to himself brother
Azucena drinking that man's tears at the end had me weak.üòÇüíÄ
Solid poking. Can‚Äôt be mad about this.
Zero sympathy for any Victor player. Maybe try learning a new combo?
i like when Azucena does that little walk clap thing and then kicks your shin into a combo that takes off half your hp lol
She can do that to me, too
Coming from a dude playing Victor hahahahaha
Love her. ‚ù§Ô∏è
love her, wish to have more characters like that
No wonder she's so much fun to fight. Love characters who really force me to learn the matchup.
They really downplay it, but eagle-eyed players notice that Azucena likes coffee.
How the fuck is LTG mighty ruler while I'm hardstuck Destroyer?! The fuck am I doing wrong? Should I just ditch Asuka and play Victor instead?

Low blow. I'm never stepping to that low tier, god I'm not a shill.
    Because he plugs a lot. Which negates him pretty much ever losing point for the most part.
        And it‚Äôs also him using Victor
I love how he eats the Perfect in sync with the music
I love how the song pops off as he goes ballistic lmao
I see ltg I downvote. Simple
This shit is waayyy to funny hahahah
Heat haze sounds nice
I could quite literally watch LTG act like a child with zero patience all day. Hope he gets banned again, shit would be extra hilarious the second time around
I didn't know Drake played tekken
He didn't even attempt to engage heat to break any of that. Wtf
Love seeing victors get shafted
LTG busted and robusted once againüòÇ
That's what any fighting game does to that clown
The music fit so well omg üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This moron knows nothing about blocking it will never be not funny
Seriously, how did he make that rank....
Learn patience...
Go lab the match up...
As a veteran Tekken player, im just sad watching this
    By plugging, of course.
Get baited noob
He complains that she‚Äôs ‚Äúrepeating the same string‚Äù and even though it makes it easy to anticipate he does nothing to stop it at all. I‚Äôm wondering if he plays this game at all.
On one hand it's Azucena and on the other hand it's Victor. 
I couldn't care less about either, that said Victor players deserve to suffer along with King and Hwaorang players.
I mean that's LTG but Azucena is the most annoying character easily.
It's always funny to me people don't get he's acting. He's supposed to make you mad you aren't supposed to take him seriously.
    *Camera cuts off...*

**Dale sighs, removes his mask. Stops being a malignant narcissistic bully and suddenly becomes a good person, who praises others for their great plays, no longer plugs or ragequits a match, learns from his mistakes, never dated a minor and is beloved by his family and friends.**
    I don't think he's acting since he was an aspiring actor and there are some old tapes of him actually acting and he's terrible at it.
    Y‚Äôall still coping with that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just acting!‚Äù excuse? üíÄ
It's kinda crazy that 6 hits took half his health lol
What is the name of the song in the background? Anyone know?

Eat that spam lol üòÇ
He can block at anytime, decides to mash after every time hes hit...

Then doesn't know whats going on.
.....I'll have what she is drinking ü´£ü•¥
Point proven everyday
I'm recently trying to pick up Azucena - which strings were used in the vid?
    Mostly the string being repeated is d/f 1, 4, 1. The first few times Azucena isn't finishing the string. The final 1 is a CH launcher and causes the start of the combo the Victor eats cause he's mashing the whole time.
I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt plug)))
Block
Not the strings! Lolol
Skill issue
He is playing Victor, deserves it
what could he have done to beat her? i get beat by this sort of stuff all the timeüò≠
Oh. It's LTG. One of.the most toxic ass people I've ever seen. That's just him
There's a great moment in him screaming and it cuts to Azucena calmly drinking coffee.
this fucking loser has been telling on himself how bad he is at fighting games for years and years. I hope he knows how much we all revel in his failure!
MENTALLY UNTOUCHABLE
This should have the meme flair
Maybe if you‚Äôre terrible at fighting games
I'm tryin to get like that
yall giving ltg the clout he wants
Let's not give any amount of credibility to LTG thanks.
Good lord
Imagine complaining while playing Viktor... The character with the bugged move... Classic LTG. Doesn't even live up to the name
i was in this bozo live at like 3am randomly and all he did was bitch i just sent a random emote in chat and he banned me for "putting a random black face in chat"
Ya ya, azucena is a button mashing character and victor is not lol

Victor is the most bs character tekken launched since hwoarang
That Wasn't Azucena cheese either, that was fundamental Tekken.
Nah that's just that 2019 LTG baby!!! Whooo I missed his pristine salt. Nowadays he's so boring even troll channels seem to find good parts of his shitty ass streams üòû
That‚Äôs Dale Wilson
I don‚Äôt mind her but that low she does that be launching on ch is something
LTG? 
Fuck that guy.
Hope he gets banned soon.
"people"
He's a shit player.

He mashes his way through rank and when it doesn't work anymore he doesn't change his tactics.

Sit down scrub and practice. 

Pathetic ‚ù§Ô∏è
The power of caffeine
LTG isn't people
how is bro purple if he can't block?
    ah ok he plays victor
LowTierDog, biggest noob ass baby rager in the FGC, plays Viktor and bitches about other characters. Typical scrub.
Ah LTG. Unskilled cuck who has even bigger cucks, keeping him afloat. Truly a tale of loosers on the internet.
How this man has received any attention since Viscant of all people ended his career is beyond me. That shit is golden FGC history
The way the music intensifies when he starts yelling LMAO
This dudes doing strings!
Main victor ya know...
17 29
He's playing victor, I don't think he hasa right to complain against azu
Least brainrotten Azucena player
And it couldn't happen to a better person.
I've said the same stuff... 4 hits, 50% of your health vs a small woman....
I felt bad for him at first. Then I realized he was playing Victor.
y'all gotta stop tryhard and just have fun with the game (yes, I'm an eddy main... A PROUD EDDY MAIN)
Stop ruining these characters with your stupid costume ideas
i mean... always better than playing victor
This is what Azucena does to *bad players
Imagine losing to a basic string in purple....
Is this the new "THIS DUDE IS DOING STRINGS"?
Chill you playing victor üòêüòê
I play azucena too. But also after azucena I play feng now. Praise jesus
She didn't even use any of her cheap shit ..   Dude just doesn't know how to playü§∑ü§∑
LTG is the epitome of how not to play Tekken. He doesn't learn or adapt or improve or anything. Never checks the replay or learns the matchup or labs. Just yells about how he's losing and sits in it. It's an easy pitfall to crawl into in Tekken but normal people usually find a way out or a character they can play or something. He just loses no matter what.
lol I would have cared if it was towards any player besides Victor
People hate the dude but sit around writing think pieces on him with pages long Reddit Threads lmfao üòÇ y'all are literally adding to why his "thing" of being an asshole POS works
Bruh azu is probably one of my worst matchups as kazuya she makes me overthink too much
Lol. It's LTG. We all know the issue is with his own skill
So he is hating on Azucena.
While he is playing viktor??

Isn't viktor the one who is broken?
He got caught by cookie-cutter counter bait. üòÇ
Just rage quit, ltg. It's not like you'll get punished for it anyway
Watching LTG lose is the gift the keeps on giving.
LowTierGroomer mashing himself to death? The same thing he's done since SFIV?

Nah, it's Azucena that's the problem here.

/s


/uj WR 3,2 should still be nerfed lol
Truly a Low Tier Goober
Im surprised he didn‚Äôt plug like usual
Eww wtf you post that idoit on here he  a tart

Cry harder, pussy ass mf.
You mean, mix you like everyone else tries to mix? Or?
Was the music edited? He "popped off" on beat drop lol
Dude straight up deserved. He was using Victor.
Lancaster Legend ü§£ü§£ü§£
Stop. Pressing. Buttons.
LTG is just ass.
However, Azucena almost made me break a controller the other day. Fuck that character
Using the term "people" very loosely here.
The bigger question is why does he have heat haze playing on that particular stage, does it fit?
Just side step
Lol I love the ltg tears
Tekken is a 3D game, sidestep or be sidestepped.
my man's playing victor and he's complaning about someone spamming strings. nah that's crazy
I mean he got fucked by basic string manipulation that he didn't even have to take, pressed when minus, never low parried.

You can do this with every single character in the game.

You wanna show Azu brainrot, show a clip of her abusing her running attack.
Skill issue to the highest degree
LTG aside, I definitely hate fighting Azucena players in red to purple ranks, they're just the new Bryan players imo. I also hate her cus everyone says she replaces Josie which is the farthest from the truth ever.
he is an uncle ruckus
Maybe stop pressing into CH strings?
you can hear him just mashing away lol
    "Mashing blah blah blah not blocking blah blah blah"
https://youtu.be/CsJfLKtGlfw?si=jiGnx-UkL-cbbMYI

Skip to 5:03. Ever since then LTG can‚Äôt play at all. He‚Äôs just terrible.
    Is this the guy that did the video where he gives a breakdown of how he‚Äôd have his goons hold down his enemy so he can sexually dominate them? And then proceeded to demonstrate how it would go with his pillow?
        yes lmao
            Link?
                https://youtu.be/vmR9ZP5mzCU?si=rAN8V99ToUzXRjX8
                    What the fuck did i just watch
                    Thank you that‚Äôs probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen
        Um which time because hes done that so many times lol
            Someone actually replied with a dramatized version of the exact video I was thinking of.
        He did what?
    I never watched that before. That was just embarrassing. Can‚Äôt act like an adult. If I had the power I‚Äôd ban him from competing publicly.
        He's almost 40 years old. I hope he can overcome his anger and learn to block.
        He‚Äôs already banned from EVO and some other events i am pretty sure
            Banned from EVO, CEO (basically all Capcom events);  
he's trying to say it's due to 'racism' and for just chatting in an EVO stream; completely forgetting his transphobic rant regarding CeroBlast, his disabled rant against BrolyLegs, multiple, multiple racist rants against ANTi, SMUG, Punk, etc. etc.

And to be honest his toxic personality in general.
    here you can share timestamps brotha 

[https://youtu.be/CsJfLKtGlfw?feature=shared&t=298](https://youtu.be/CsJfLKtGlfw?feature=shared&t=298)
    That dude flexed on ltg while wearing a tucked in polo that went past his upper waist always seals this clip for me. 

It's the most fgc thing ever.
        Jay 'Viscant' Snyder; guy is a legit FGC legend and an all around good guy.
            Oh I believe it, he didn't back down to a punk like ltg and I knew about this clip before I even picked up fighting games.

In this clip he's like the best encapsulation of the fgc in the best way possible.

He's wearing the corniest outfit but steps to a gym bro, beats him in the game, tells ltg to suck his dick, and it's awesome.
And he is using Victor.... like why hate Coffee girl doing the same strings over and over when Victor does pretty much the same things.
    He's not smart enough for self-reflection nor simply looking up a guide as to how the games he plays works.
Its amazing how one man can be so universally hated in every game he touches and yet still has major following. I get it it's entertaining to see him beign pathetic but I feel it's not worth enabling him just for that.
    DSP?
I just know about him because of Themainmanswe and now my Youtube is Full of LTG Salt Videos with Plugging etc and i have to say i'm having a blast watching those Videos
    Big ups to all the trolls! üòÇ
    Used to be fun until it wrapped back around to the trolls being worse than him. Now I quite like LTG. He says some off the wall stuff and has a lot of issues but he‚Äôs genuinely hilarious. Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act. So many ridiculous quotes from him get quoted all of the time by friends or random people I see online. Troll videos now on the other hand censor everything so they can monetize their copy pasted videos. It just makes me roll my eyes and I instantly click off if I hear swear words being censored by people who call this man greedy etc. I used to laugh when LTG would insult them and cope with it by saying all sorts of things about their personal lives. But now literally all of that has turned out to be true and it‚Äôs just pathetic at this point.

Love the guy or dislike him all you want. When it becomes an obsession and your feelings are genuinely hurt that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not fun anymore.
        I think it's fair to say both him and his "fans"/trolls are dipshits. Some of the clips are still funny though lol. "this dude did a 10 hit combo" lmfao
            Yeah that‚Äôs fair haha. And LOL!!! I remember reenacting that while streaming SoulCalibur 2 once just out of pure random üòπ My friends got a good laugh out of it.
        > Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act.

Maybe, but when your "act" is saying racist, scummy shit, blocking and banning literally anyone who doesn't kiss his ass, and throwing a hissy fit when losing and plugging, can you really just boil it down to being an act? That's who he is.
            For sure
        Uh you realize he kinda groomed someone right.
            Wouldn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt keep up with him anymore. After he got banned from YouTube and the trolls became worse than him I stopped caring about it all. Laughing at the occasional image with him in it etc. Used to like watching his streams though. There was always a lot of funny stuff that was cut out from those reuploads.
            When?
                Search up "LTG groomer" on YouTube. It should be the first vid. Goes into a lot of the stuff he's done.
                    Ah but surely it was just an act...
/s
                    So it's personal with you guys? How did it become personal?? And why do you guys care about LTG so much?
                        I don't really give af about LTG drama lol. Just saying he isn't exactly an angel.
                            ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
                                Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
                        Yes, when a person is groomed and abused, it's personal.
                            So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
        I can't imagine unironically liking a scumbag like him, damn man. I don't care about his trolls but everything I've seen of him is that he's a racist narcissistic sociopath pos with anger issues. Not to mention how he stalks and harassed people like Joontheking for making a negative video about him
            Joon is a piece of work himself but yeah, not cool to harass the guy or anyone else. Not saying LTG is a model citizen but he‚Äôs entertaining. I like him in that way.
        It's not an act when he's emotionally abusive to his girlfriend on stream and forgets to mute his mic.
            Does he have a new gf now? Wasn‚Äôt aware. I only ever saw that one girl he dated on and off a long time ago appear on his streams.
Is LTG even a good player? His Victor looks somehow even worse than mine.
    The guy is a toxic, plugging crybaby. He can't play Tekken for shit. 2Ds he has some prowess but that doesn't make him any less of a twat.
        Not even in 2d games is he good. I‚Äôve seen him play sf6 and all he does is jump and go for grabs and wonder why he keeps losing. Dude can‚Äôt tech a throw or DI so save his life
            Fr. In every game he plays he bitches about them ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù the combos in games too and how these players would never hit that in [insert game]. Like bro, what does that say about YOU? Dudes dropping combos like they‚Äôre made of goddamn butter. The self awareness is nonexistent. 

Like seriously, this dude can‚Äôt even hit a combo over 250 damage in fucking MK1. Dude just picks reiko (grappler) and zones or does armored grabs. He can‚Äôt even use his main command grab that‚Äôs locked behind a half circle input.
            Nah watch him play sf4 lol
                I did, spamming rolls and knives with Rolento isn't skill

He always loved to spam something, even back to SF4 days.
        bro does not have prowess in 2d either
        he is ass at Street Fighter...
        His "thing" is to literally intentionally lose a lot, be toxic and go crazy on stream, then rake in the views as he goes viral for being an asshole. He does it in 2D and 3D, it's a whole shtick.
            I've played him in person before he had any degree of notoriety (I live in lancaster). The salt is real and he's always had the same attitude.
            It's about time somebody has a brain in this brainless community. Exactly, he feeds off it, even when I watched some of the "rage clips" I never took him seriously enough to be getting angry and wanting him off of Youtube, why? That's insanity. He can rage all he wants, who cares. How are you guys falling for that?? Lol.
                Being a plugging asshole as a schtick is still being a plugging asshole. Doesn't matter how intentional it is or isn't, it's no wonder people don't like him
                    Then don't watch him. You know how crazy you sound right now? Well he's right about one thing, you guys are some serious stalkers and what's baffling is you're proving him right lol. You guys are some real creeps stalking a DUDE online üòÇüòÇ
                        I don't watch his stuff. What I'm saying is, it is no wonder that people don't like the guy
                            You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
                                Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
                        He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?
                            He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

* You're right that isn't stalking, but that's not all you guys are doing either, it's personal, that's more than just simply "discussing" about him. You took him very seriously (which is very strange because his content from what I've seen, is clearly for entertainment, who gets mad over that??) Also, you guys can't seem to shut up ahout him, like is he really that important to you? You act like you l've never been on the internet. Well then again maybe you haven't so I don't know. 


Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?

I don't know, does it?
                                It's a post about him. People are discussing on the post. There's one post about him and 1000s not about him. It isn't even the hottest post. I think you'd need to try harder to convince me people were obsessed. For instance, I haven't made a comment on here and saw your comment whilst ambiently scrolling. It struck me as obviously incorrect. I don't think this is me being somehow unnaturally interested in someone. 

He is indeed clearly entertaining some people. But other people are allowed to have an opinion on that, especially since he's promoting a culture that is seen widely as toxic, antisocial and bad for the game health. (Just like how I'm happy to say that Nigel Farage is a symbol for an attitude that had blighted the United Kingdom, even if other people think the sun shines out of his arse.)

You did the capitalisation. Presumably you'd know.
                Are you LTG?
                    Don't be stupid.
    He‚Äôs an above average player at best. He can hold his own when he‚Äôs not acting like a child but god forbid you read him, grab him, outplay him, or mix him. But Tekken has never been one of his main games. He plays street fighter for the most part and still acts the same way there. All in all, he‚Äôs an above average player in SF, an average player in Tekken and a TERRIBLE player in Smash. Like genuinely he has one of the worst Snakes i‚Äôve ever seen but I digress.
        Honestly, LTG is way worse than he should be. I would say he's average at SF but below average for Tekken. There are players, like those at Sajam's tournament that are higher ranked than he is and they've only played Tekken 8 and have barely any exposure to previous fighting games. LTG has played Tekken before, including T7, along with numerous other fighting games so his current ranking is pretty poor considering, even if Tekken isn't his main game.
            LTG is an embarrassment, but you have a warped perspective if you think having multiple characters at Masters rank makes you an average SF player. No amount of rank inflation has 50% of the playerbase in Masters.
            Yep, he says he played Tekken since Tekken 3, but somehow he is worse than many players that have only played Tekken 8, that's a disgrace.

My cousin is higher rank than him(blue rank), without plugging, and he only played Tekken 7 for a couple of months during pandemic.

For the amount of time LTG has been playing fighting games ,he should have a similar level to Sajam
                tbf i've been playing since tekken 1, but when you're a kid you're really just button mashing. there wasn't a youtube to teach the fundamentals
                    Same, once I got onto Tekken 3, the combos started to click for me. I was just too young before.
                    He is 40 years old, he wasn't a kid when Tekken came 3!came out 

Anyways he played Tekken 5 while being 18+.
            [deleted]
                Average is low red actually. There‚Äôs a rank distribution chart and everything.
                    [deleted]
                        Garyu was the peak of the bell curve.
        His Snake is garbage and his Richter is nauseating to watch. Just terrible.
        Purple ranks isn't average though, no? That's actually pretty good for like the overall player base.

He's definitely not like tournament level player for any damn thing he plays, though. Not even weeklies.
            He only got to purples because he's a notorious rage quitter. He gets beaten by reds and even orange ranks regularly.
            True. Purple ranks are definitely not average players. But in LTGs case, no. He constantly plugs, ragequits and does ‚Äúone and dones‚Äù. Also i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in the orange ranks? Which I would still consider above average but like one more step above, if that makes sense.
                When I see his clips, he's definitely playing against purples, at least when he's playing Viktor.
                His Victor is purple. But his Feng is orange rank.
    He had to plug his way to ruler.
    he played against mainman the other day as Victor and was actually pretty good
        That shouldn't be an indication that he is necessarily good, but people with the same playstyle as him, which happens to be the higher escalon of Tekken player, he is decent. Anyone else, he can't play against them. His sets against Lacari and Fairlight kinda showed that, cause their playstyle was very aggressive while being patient
    He is. [Pretty decent I‚Äôd say](https://youtu.be/y6N08xKNAjM?si=NjLeLmflFQuUZuE5) not top tier but pretty good. Not as bad as most clips make him out to be
I would rather not have LTG being posted...

at all...
Please don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs remained relevant for all these years.
    That's very true, I'd never actually watch his stuff.
Who is LTG???
    A meaningless nobody, best left forgotten as a footnote in the annals of time
        If only. Like with stonetoss, its a career built and maintained on the backs of people that supposedly hate him and want him to go away lol.
            His ‚Äútrolls‚Äù (read: stans)
            When really they don't want him to go away because then they wouldn't be able to have fun trolling his channel.
            Stop pretending stonetoss is wrong
                Hes a nazi

Edit: DO NOT look through this guys history
                    Right of Marx = Nazi
        At the bottom of a pit occupied by only him and DSP.
I only just now found out about this dude from this subreddit and it is quite fun to watch him lose his everloving mind on a game.
And that is what he's counting on.
At least he didn‚Äôt plug this time.
The unplug whiffed
I do too üòî
    Same, especially against Paul for some reasons
Or the brain capacity to duck after the mid
    The string jails you can‚Äôt duck the high after the mid. You can duck the 3rd high though.
        Newbie: what‚Äôs jailing?
            Jailing is basically when you are **forced** to block an attack that you can normally avoid by crouching or sidestepping. Usually describes *strings* that "jail"; the later parts of the string might be (for example) high attacks, and if the first part whiffs, you can crouch under them like normal. However, if you end up blocking the first hit, you'll be trapped in jail and stuck blocking all of it. (taken from the fighting game glossary, handy site for terminology!)
                Thanks for the info and thanks for referring me to the fighting game glossary!
        Which string jails specifically?
        Ah I see nvm then
Victor be like : Wanna see me spam my gun ? *Wanna see me do it again ?*
    The most spammers I‚Äôve encountered are Victor. And it‚Äôs always that one combo where he disappears and then uses his gun.
        I recently found out that it's possible to throw em when they tp in with the katana. So I generally duck the gun into surprise throw and it worked a lot of time already.
It's pleasing to watch him lose. Unfortunately, watching him lose means supporting him by watching him at all. There's why I love compilation videos of him getting his ass whooped on other channels.
    There's literally people dedicated to secondhand streaming him, so you can watch him lose his mind without directly giving him views.
But realistically, a ton of people have been tuning to him for years
Its crazy how twitch let him stream. He's the most racist , homophobic, abusive person I've ever seen stream.

Some of his past stuff was just crazy. He was calling black people he was playing against monkeys and coons. Some pretty dark shit he's said on stream.
    even though hes a horrible person, hes absolutely hilarious
        Glad you find racism, body shaming and homophobic insults funny
            its his eloquence when speaking and how he words things. and body shaming is absolutely hilarious and should be encouraged since obesity is such an issue. the Japanese people that make tekken would agree with me too
                Ok Dale
That's what I'm saying when I first saw this.
People REALLY easily forget that this man literally groomed children
    wait did he
        https://youtu.be/DvAWHHEGpiE?si=CfXBbg3oENrZcrG2

He was seeing minors at age 29
Is there a story here?
    oh yes there is
    There is
wasnt that stuff disproven
    I‚Äôm pretty sure he admitted to it
He was already tilted from losing a 3-0 set with the same player just before.
    That'll do it. I went from Shinryu almost all the way back to yellow one day because I was tilted and refused to wait my turn lmao
Honestly, it's pretty much the bnb of any character with df1 extensions. 

Like all the Azu was doing was mid checks and playing around completing strings and basic wall oki. 

Like this video isn't an indictment of Azu. Didn't spam WR3,2 or anything. This was just pokes into wall splat and him just eating every single thing because he was mashing.
    Well said.
Whats the string?
    She mostly just threw single jabs and kicks in the video... a couple partial strings that were just two-hit high punches that are slower than jabs.

The string that launched/splatted him at the end was d,3,3,4. It's three kicks that hit low, mid, mid and the last one knocks down on hit.

He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao. Usually the only way I land the knockdown is if they crouch block after the low because they're expecting more lows.

If you just standing block that string only the low will hit. It does basically no damage, and the knockdown kick at the end is super negative on block so it would have been a free launch for Victor.

Even if he ate the first two kicks and just blocked the third, he would have lived, gotten a free launch/combo, and gotten away from the wall.
        He was obviously desperate to get a hit in to disrupt the combo instead of focusing on defense. Ive been there but...damn, he got whooped bad with couple simple combos.
        > He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao

It's one of those strings I call 'passive guard breaks': even though none of the hits are a natural combo, if you just let go of the controller instead of holding back after getting hit by the low, you won't block the mids as you normally would while not pressing anything.
            Do people actually use passive guard?
                Probably no series veterans do, but I find it convenient when I want to stay close to the enemy so I can punish things or have my pokes reach them after blocking.
                    That's fair. I'm not sure how I feel about the passive guard tbh. No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

Passive guard has saved me a few times in Tekken and it honestly felt kind of cheap...I was just like "...alright...cool" üòÇ

But then it made me wonder how many of my attacks are just getting auto-blocked, which is kind of frustrating. It feels like a feature that should only exist in special-style and definitely shouldn't be useable in ranked.
                        > No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

I come from SoulCalibur, there blocking is a dedicated face button and you can't move while holding it (can only crouch and empty jump).

> and it honestly felt kind of cheap

Why would it be cheap though? To have passive guard work, you have to literally not press any other button. Not attack, not sidestep, not move forward. The decision you're making is the same, except now there's an extra choice of whether you want to move back or not.
                            That makes sense. I'm pretty precise with my inputs though. I never press anything unless I know what I'm pressing and why, so I feel like I get disproportionately rewarded by passive block lol

It punishes mashers though which I suppose is a good thing.

I definitely prefer Soul Calibur's block though. It just feels cleaner because you have more exact control over duck/jump vs. sidestepping. 

Holding back to block is more of a 2D fighter thing and I don't think it's the best choice for a 3D fighter because it makes some of your inputs context-sensitive.

The number of times I've tried to sidestep in Tekken only to crouch/jump instead is annoying. I know it's a skill issue, but it just feels messier to me.
LTG IS 40?!?
    Yep. Painfully embarrassing for him, I know.
        Wow...i thought dude was like my age i used to watch him for his signature ps screen into quit combo but wowwwwwwww. This is mind-bogglin....thought dude was a teen like me a decade and some change ago
    He has a bot on his twitch stream that bans anybody saying "pushing 40" or "bodied" man is the most insecure person on the platform. One guy got timed out for 2 weeks for asking what character he was going to main in T8 because he wasn't subbed.
It's true what they say: Ignorance truly is bliss when it comes to LTG
Yeah that's the weirdest part of plugging.  You getting your ass kicked, and now you want to surround yourself with even better players and get your ass kicked even more?  

Pluggers think they're getting the better of someone or protecting themselves, but all they're doing is plunging deeper into territory they can't handle.  A rank isn't a reward, it's a tool to keep you around people you can be competitive with.
    Exactly. I‚Äôm in red ranks because I belong there. I win about 50% of my matches there and I‚Äôve just been doing quick matche until I can win more consistently with people around my rank then I‚Äôll try ranked again. Cheating my way to purple would just fuck me over lol
Maybe you're not blocking enough then?
    
No one has managed to get a perfect off of me so far but Tekken is kind of known for getting touched and dying.
He's broadcasting his incompetence for the world to see.  Turning the camera off to cry isn't helping either.  This guy needs to move on and accept that he just can't handle fighting games.  No shame in that
I am not even calling her Azucena, she is just coffee.
    Leo's intro line with her always sounds to me like they're saying "Coffee Queen again?!"
Because he plugs a lot. Which negates him pretty much ever losing point for the most part.
    And it‚Äôs also him using Victor
By plugging, of course.
*Camera cuts off...*

**Dale sighs, removes his mask. Stops being a malignant narcissistic bully and suddenly becomes a good person, who praises others for their great plays, no longer plugs or ragequits a match, learns from his mistakes, never dated a minor and is beloved by his family and friends.**
I don't think he's acting since he was an aspiring actor and there are some old tapes of him actually acting and he's terrible at it.
Y‚Äôall still coping with that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just acting!‚Äù excuse? üíÄ

Mostly the string being repeated is d/f 1, 4, 1. The first few times Azucena isn't finishing the string. The final 1 is a CH launcher and causes the start of the combo the Victor eats cause he's mashing the whole time.
ah ok he plays victor

"Mashing blah blah blah not blocking blah blah blah"
Is this the guy that did the video where he gives a breakdown of how he‚Äôd have his goons hold down his enemy so he can sexually dominate them? And then proceeded to demonstrate how it would go with his pillow?
    yes lmao
        Link?
            https://youtu.be/vmR9ZP5mzCU?si=rAN8V99ToUzXRjX8
                What the fuck did i just watch
                Thank you that‚Äôs probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen
    Um which time because hes done that so many times lol
        Someone actually replied with a dramatized version of the exact video I was thinking of.
    He did what?
I never watched that before. That was just embarrassing. Can‚Äôt act like an adult. If I had the power I‚Äôd ban him from competing publicly.
    He's almost 40 years old. I hope he can overcome his anger and learn to block.
    He‚Äôs already banned from EVO and some other events i am pretty sure
        Banned from EVO, CEO (basically all Capcom events);  
he's trying to say it's due to 'racism' and for just chatting in an EVO stream; completely forgetting his transphobic rant regarding CeroBlast, his disabled rant against BrolyLegs, multiple, multiple racist rants against ANTi, SMUG, Punk, etc. etc.

And to be honest his toxic personality in general.
here you can share timestamps brotha

That dude flexed on ltg while wearing a tucked in polo that went past his upper waist always seals this clip for me. 

It's the most fgc thing ever.
    Jay 'Viscant' Snyder; guy is a legit FGC legend and an all around good guy.
        Oh I believe it, he didn't back down to a punk like ltg and I knew about this clip before I even picked up fighting games.

In this clip he's like the best encapsulation of the fgc in the best way possible.

He's wearing the corniest outfit but steps to a gym bro, beats him in the game, tells ltg to suck his dick, and it's awesome.
He's not smart enough for self-reflection nor simply looking up a guide as to how the games he plays works.
DSP?
Big ups to all the trolls! üòÇ
Used to be fun until it wrapped back around to the trolls being worse than him. Now I quite like LTG. He says some off the wall stuff and has a lot of issues but he‚Äôs genuinely hilarious. Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act. So many ridiculous quotes from him get quoted all of the time by friends or random people I see online. Troll videos now on the other hand censor everything so they can monetize their copy pasted videos. It just makes me roll my eyes and I instantly click off if I hear swear words being censored by people who call this man greedy etc. I used to laugh when LTG would insult them and cope with it by saying all sorts of things about their personal lives. But now literally all of that has turned out to be true and it‚Äôs just pathetic at this point.

Love the guy or dislike him all you want. When it becomes an obsession and your feelings are genuinely hurt that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not fun anymore.
    I think it's fair to say both him and his "fans"/trolls are dipshits. Some of the clips are still funny though lol. "this dude did a 10 hit combo" lmfao
        Yeah that‚Äôs fair haha. And LOL!!! I remember reenacting that while streaming SoulCalibur 2 once just out of pure random üòπ My friends got a good laugh out of it.
    > Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act.

Maybe, but when your "act" is saying racist, scummy shit, blocking and banning literally anyone who doesn't kiss his ass, and throwing a hissy fit when losing and plugging, can you really just boil it down to being an act? That's who he is.
        For sure
    Uh you realize he kinda groomed someone right.
        Wouldn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt keep up with him anymore. After he got banned from YouTube and the trolls became worse than him I stopped caring about it all. Laughing at the occasional image with him in it etc. Used to like watching his streams though. There was always a lot of funny stuff that was cut out from those reuploads.
        When?
            Search up "LTG groomer" on YouTube. It should be the first vid. Goes into a lot of the stuff he's done.
                Ah but surely it was just an act...
/s
                So it's personal with you guys? How did it become personal?? And why do you guys care about LTG so much?
                    I don't really give af about LTG drama lol. Just saying he isn't exactly an angel.
                        ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
                            Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
                    Yes, when a person is groomed and abused, it's personal.
                        So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
    I can't imagine unironically liking a scumbag like him, damn man. I don't care about his trolls but everything I've seen of him is that he's a racist narcissistic sociopath pos with anger issues. Not to mention how he stalks and harassed people like Joontheking for making a negative video about him
        Joon is a piece of work himself but yeah, not cool to harass the guy or anyone else. Not saying LTG is a model citizen but he‚Äôs entertaining. I like him in that way.
    It's not an act when he's emotionally abusive to his girlfriend on stream and forgets to mute his mic.
        Does he have a new gf now? Wasn‚Äôt aware. I only ever saw that one girl he dated on and off a long time ago appear on his streams.
The guy is a toxic, plugging crybaby. He can't play Tekken for shit. 2Ds he has some prowess but that doesn't make him any less of a twat.
    Not even in 2d games is he good. I‚Äôve seen him play sf6 and all he does is jump and go for grabs and wonder why he keeps losing. Dude can‚Äôt tech a throw or DI so save his life
        Fr. In every game he plays he bitches about them ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù the combos in games too and how these players would never hit that in [insert game]. Like bro, what does that say about YOU? Dudes dropping combos like they‚Äôre made of goddamn butter. The self awareness is nonexistent. 

Like seriously, this dude can‚Äôt even hit a combo over 250 damage in fucking MK1. Dude just picks reiko (grappler) and zones or does armored grabs. He can‚Äôt even use his main command grab that‚Äôs locked behind a half circle input.
        Nah watch him play sf4 lol
            I did, spamming rolls and knives with Rolento isn't skill

He always loved to spam something, even back to SF4 days.
    bro does not have prowess in 2d either
    he is ass at Street Fighter...
    His "thing" is to literally intentionally lose a lot, be toxic and go crazy on stream, then rake in the views as he goes viral for being an asshole. He does it in 2D and 3D, it's a whole shtick.
        I've played him in person before he had any degree of notoriety (I live in lancaster). The salt is real and he's always had the same attitude.
        It's about time somebody has a brain in this brainless community. Exactly, he feeds off it, even when I watched some of the "rage clips" I never took him seriously enough to be getting angry and wanting him off of Youtube, why? That's insanity. He can rage all he wants, who cares. How are you guys falling for that?? Lol.
            Being a plugging asshole as a schtick is still being a plugging asshole. Doesn't matter how intentional it is or isn't, it's no wonder people don't like him
                Then don't watch him. You know how crazy you sound right now? Well he's right about one thing, you guys are some serious stalkers and what's baffling is you're proving him right lol. You guys are some real creeps stalking a DUDE online üòÇüòÇ
                    I don't watch his stuff. What I'm saying is, it is no wonder that people don't like the guy
                        You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
                            Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
                    He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?
                        He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

* You're right that isn't stalking, but that's not all you guys are doing either, it's personal, that's more than just simply "discussing" about him. You took him very seriously (which is very strange because his content from what I've seen, is clearly for entertainment, who gets mad over that??) Also, you guys can't seem to shut up ahout him, like is he really that important to you? You act like you l've never been on the internet. Well then again maybe you haven't so I don't know. 


Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?

I don't know, does it?
                            It's a post about him. People are discussing on the post. There's one post about him and 1000s not about him. It isn't even the hottest post. I think you'd need to try harder to convince me people were obsessed. For instance, I haven't made a comment on here and saw your comment whilst ambiently scrolling. It struck me as obviously incorrect. I don't think this is me being somehow unnaturally interested in someone. 

He is indeed clearly entertaining some people. But other people are allowed to have an opinion on that, especially since he's promoting a culture that is seen widely as toxic, antisocial and bad for the game health. (Just like how I'm happy to say that Nigel Farage is a symbol for an attitude that had blighted the United Kingdom, even if other people think the sun shines out of his arse.)

You did the capitalisation. Presumably you'd know.
            Are you LTG?
                Don't be stupid.
He‚Äôs an above average player at best. He can hold his own when he‚Äôs not acting like a child but god forbid you read him, grab him, outplay him, or mix him. But Tekken has never been one of his main games. He plays street fighter for the most part and still acts the same way there. All in all, he‚Äôs an above average player in SF, an average player in Tekken and a TERRIBLE player in Smash. Like genuinely he has one of the worst Snakes i‚Äôve ever seen but I digress.
    Honestly, LTG is way worse than he should be. I would say he's average at SF but below average for Tekken. There are players, like those at Sajam's tournament that are higher ranked than he is and they've only played Tekken 8 and have barely any exposure to previous fighting games. LTG has played Tekken before, including T7, along with numerous other fighting games so his current ranking is pretty poor considering, even if Tekken isn't his main game.
        LTG is an embarrassment, but you have a warped perspective if you think having multiple characters at Masters rank makes you an average SF player. No amount of rank inflation has 50% of the playerbase in Masters.
        Yep, he says he played Tekken since Tekken 3, but somehow he is worse than many players that have only played Tekken 8, that's a disgrace.

My cousin is higher rank than him(blue rank), without plugging, and he only played Tekken 7 for a couple of months during pandemic.

For the amount of time LTG has been playing fighting games ,he should have a similar level to Sajam
            tbf i've been playing since tekken 1, but when you're a kid you're really just button mashing. there wasn't a youtube to teach the fundamentals
                Same, once I got onto Tekken 3, the combos started to click for me. I was just too young before.
                He is 40 years old, he wasn't a kid when Tekken came 3!came out 

Anyways he played Tekken 5 while being 18+.

    His Snake is garbage and his Richter is nauseating to watch. Just terrible.
    Purple ranks isn't average though, no? That's actually pretty good for like the overall player base.

He's definitely not like tournament level player for any damn thing he plays, though. Not even weeklies.
        He only got to purples because he's a notorious rage quitter. He gets beaten by reds and even orange ranks regularly.
        True. Purple ranks are definitely not average players. But in LTGs case, no. He constantly plugs, ragequits and does ‚Äúone and dones‚Äù. Also i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in the orange ranks? Which I would still consider above average but like one more step above, if that makes sense.
            When I see his clips, he's definitely playing against purples, at least when he's playing Viktor.
            His Victor is purple. But his Feng is orange rank.
He had to plug his way to ruler.
he played against mainman the other day as Victor and was actually pretty good
    That shouldn't be an indication that he is necessarily good, but people with the same playstyle as him, which happens to be the higher escalon of Tekken player, he is decent. Anyone else, he can't play against them. His sets against Lacari and Fairlight kinda showed that, cause their playstyle was very aggressive while being patient
He is. [Pretty decent I‚Äôd say](https://youtu.be/y6N08xKNAjM?si=NjLeLmflFQuUZuE5) not top tier but pretty good. Not as bad as most clips make him out to be
That's very true, I'd never actually watch his stuff.
A meaningless nobody, best left forgotten as a footnote in the annals of time
    If only. Like with stonetoss, its a career built and maintained on the backs of people that supposedly hate him and want him to go away lol.
        His ‚Äútrolls‚Äù (read: stans)
        When really they don't want him to go away because then they wouldn't be able to have fun trolling his channel.
        Stop pretending stonetoss is wrong

Same, especially against Paul for some reasons
The string jails you can‚Äôt duck the high after the mid. You can duck the 3rd high though.
    Newbie: what‚Äôs jailing?
        Jailing is basically when you are **forced** to block an attack that you can normally avoid by crouching or sidestepping. Usually describes *strings* that "jail"; the later parts of the string might be (for example) high attacks, and if the first part whiffs, you can crouch under them like normal. However, if you end up blocking the first hit, you'll be trapped in jail and stuck blocking all of it. (taken from the fighting game glossary, handy site for terminology!)
            Thanks for the info and thanks for referring me to the fighting game glossary!
    Which string jails specifically?
    Ah I see nvm then
The most spammers I‚Äôve encountered are Victor. And it‚Äôs always that one combo where he disappears and then uses his gun.
    I recently found out that it's possible to throw em when they tp in with the katana. So I generally duck the gun into surprise throw and it worked a lot of time already.
There's literally people dedicated to secondhand streaming him, so you can watch him lose his mind without directly giving him views.
even though hes a horrible person, hes absolutely hilarious
    Glad you find racism, body shaming and homophobic insults funny
        its his eloquence when speaking and how he words things. and body shaming is absolutely hilarious and should be encouraged since obesity is such an issue. the Japanese people that make tekken would agree with me too
            Ok Dale
wait did he
    https://youtu.be/DvAWHHEGpiE?si=CfXBbg3oENrZcrG2

He was seeing minors at age 29
oh yes there is
There is
I‚Äôm pretty sure he admitted to it
That'll do it. I went from Shinryu almost all the way back to yellow one day because I was tilted and refused to wait my turn lmao
Well said.
She mostly just threw single jabs and kicks in the video... a couple partial strings that were just two-hit high punches that are slower than jabs.

The string that launched/splatted him at the end was d,3,3,4. It's three kicks that hit low, mid, mid and the last one knocks down on hit.

He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao. Usually the only way I land the knockdown is if they crouch block after the low because they're expecting more lows.

If you just standing block that string only the low will hit. It does basically no damage, and the knockdown kick at the end is super negative on block so it would have been a free launch for Victor.

Even if he ate the first two kicks and just blocked the third, he would have lived, gotten a free launch/combo, and gotten away from the wall.
    He was obviously desperate to get a hit in to disrupt the combo instead of focusing on defense. Ive been there but...damn, he got whooped bad with couple simple combos.
    > He got hit by all three of them, which I have literally never seen happen to a standing opponent lmao

It's one of those strings I call 'passive guard breaks': even though none of the hits are a natural combo, if you just let go of the controller instead of holding back after getting hit by the low, you won't block the mids as you normally would while not pressing anything.
        Do people actually use passive guard?
            Probably no series veterans do, but I find it convenient when I want to stay close to the enemy so I can punish things or have my pokes reach them after blocking.
                That's fair. I'm not sure how I feel about the passive guard tbh. No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

Passive guard has saved me a few times in Tekken and it honestly felt kind of cheap...I was just like "...alright...cool" üòÇ

But then it made me wonder how many of my attacks are just getting auto-blocked, which is kind of frustrating. It feels like a feature that should only exist in special-style and definitely shouldn't be useable in ranked.
                    > No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

I come from SoulCalibur, there blocking is a dedicated face button and you can't move while holding it (can only crouch and empty jump).

> and it honestly felt kind of cheap

Why would it be cheap though? To have passive guard work, you have to literally not press any other button. Not attack, not sidestep, not move forward. The decision you're making is the same, except now there's an extra choice of whether you want to move back or not.
                        That makes sense. I'm pretty precise with my inputs though. I never press anything unless I know what I'm pressing and why, so I feel like I get disproportionately rewarded by passive block lol

It punishes mashers though which I suppose is a good thing.

I definitely prefer Soul Calibur's block though. It just feels cleaner because you have more exact control over duck/jump vs. sidestepping. 

Holding back to block is more of a 2D fighter thing and I don't think it's the best choice for a 3D fighter because it makes some of your inputs context-sensitive.

The number of times I've tried to sidestep in Tekken only to crouch/jump instead is annoying. I know it's a skill issue, but it just feels messier to me.
Yep. Painfully embarrassing for him, I know.
    Wow...i thought dude was like my age i used to watch him for his signature ps screen into quit combo but wowwwwwwww. This is mind-bogglin....thought dude was a teen like me a decade and some change ago
He has a bot on his twitch stream that bans anybody saying "pushing 40" or "bodied" man is the most insecure person on the platform. One guy got timed out for 2 weeks for asking what character he was going to main in T8 because he wasn't subbed.
Exactly. I‚Äôm in red ranks because I belong there. I win about 50% of my matches there and I‚Äôve just been doing quick matche until I can win more consistently with people around my rank then I‚Äôll try ranked again. Cheating my way to purple would just fuck me over lol

No one has managed to get a perfect off of me so far but Tekken is kind of known for getting touched and dying.
Leo's intro line with her always sounds to me like they're saying "Coffee Queen again?!"
And it‚Äôs also him using Victor
Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, etc.:

        https://youtu.be/vmR9ZP5mzCU?si=rAN8V99ToUzXRjX8
            What the fuck did i just watch
            Thank you that‚Äôs probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen
Um which time because hes done that so many times lol
    Someone actually replied with a dramatized version of the exact video I was thinking of.
He did what?
He's almost 40 years old. I hope he can overcome his anger and learn to block.
He‚Äôs already banned from EVO and some other events i am pretty sure
    Banned from EVO, CEO (basically all Capcom events);  
he's trying to say it's due to 'racism' and for just chatting in an EVO stream; completely forgetting his transphobic rant regarding CeroBlast, his disabled rant against BrolyLegs, multiple, multiple racist rants against ANTi, SMUG, Punk, etc. etc.

And to be honest his toxic personality in general.
Jay 'Viscant' Snyder; guy is a legit FGC legend and an all around good guy.
    Oh I believe it, he didn't back down to a punk like ltg and I knew about this clip before I even picked up fighting games.

In this clip he's like the best encapsulation of the fgc in the best way possible.

He's wearing the corniest outfit but steps to a gym bro, beats him in the game, tells ltg to suck his dick, and it's awesome.
I think it's fair to say both him and his "fans"/trolls are dipshits. Some of the clips are still funny though lol. "this dude did a 10 hit combo" lmfao
    Yeah that‚Äôs fair haha. And LOL!!! I remember reenacting that while streaming SoulCalibur 2 once just out of pure random üòπ My friends got a good laugh out of it.
> Like to a point where it has to be at least somewhat of an act.

Maybe, but when your "act" is saying racist, scummy shit, blocking and banning literally anyone who doesn't kiss his ass, and throwing a hissy fit when losing and plugging, can you really just boil it down to being an act? That's who he is.
    For sure
Uh you realize he kinda groomed someone right.
    Wouldn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt keep up with him anymore. After he got banned from YouTube and the trolls became worse than him I stopped caring about it all. Laughing at the occasional image with him in it etc. Used to like watching his streams though. There was always a lot of funny stuff that was cut out from those reuploads.
    When?
        Search up "LTG groomer" on YouTube. It should be the first vid. Goes into a lot of the stuff he's done.
            Ah but surely it was just an act...
/s
            So it's personal with you guys? How did it become personal?? And why do you guys care about LTG so much?
                I don't really give af about LTG drama lol. Just saying he isn't exactly an angel.
                    ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
                        Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
                Yes, when a person is groomed and abused, it's personal.
                    So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
I can't imagine unironically liking a scumbag like him, damn man. I don't care about his trolls but everything I've seen of him is that he's a racist narcissistic sociopath pos with anger issues. Not to mention how he stalks and harassed people like Joontheking for making a negative video about him
    Joon is a piece of work himself but yeah, not cool to harass the guy or anyone else. Not saying LTG is a model citizen but he‚Äôs entertaining. I like him in that way.
It's not an act when he's emotionally abusive to his girlfriend on stream and forgets to mute his mic.
    Does he have a new gf now? Wasn‚Äôt aware. I only ever saw that one girl he dated on and off a long time ago appear on his streams.
Not even in 2d games is he good. I‚Äôve seen him play sf6 and all he does is jump and go for grabs and wonder why he keeps losing. Dude can‚Äôt tech a throw or DI so save his life
    Fr. In every game he plays he bitches about them ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù the combos in games too and how these players would never hit that in [insert game]. Like bro, what does that say about YOU? Dudes dropping combos like they‚Äôre made of goddamn butter. The self awareness is nonexistent. 

Like seriously, this dude can‚Äôt even hit a combo over 250 damage in fucking MK1. Dude just picks reiko (grappler) and zones or does armored grabs. He can‚Äôt even use his main command grab that‚Äôs locked behind a half circle input.
    Nah watch him play sf4 lol
        I did, spamming rolls and knives with Rolento isn't skill

He always loved to spam something, even back to SF4 days.
bro does not have prowess in 2d either
he is ass at Street Fighter...
His "thing" is to literally intentionally lose a lot, be toxic and go crazy on stream, then rake in the views as he goes viral for being an asshole. He does it in 2D and 3D, it's a whole shtick.
    I've played him in person before he had any degree of notoriety (I live in lancaster). The salt is real and he's always had the same attitude.
    It's about time somebody has a brain in this brainless community. Exactly, he feeds off it, even when I watched some of the "rage clips" I never took him seriously enough to be getting angry and wanting him off of Youtube, why? That's insanity. He can rage all he wants, who cares. How are you guys falling for that?? Lol.
        Being a plugging asshole as a schtick is still being a plugging asshole. Doesn't matter how intentional it is or isn't, it's no wonder people don't like him
            Then don't watch him. You know how crazy you sound right now? Well he's right about one thing, you guys are some serious stalkers and what's baffling is you're proving him right lol. You guys are some real creeps stalking a DUDE online üòÇüòÇ
                I don't watch his stuff. What I'm saying is, it is no wonder that people don't like the guy
                    You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
                        Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
                He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?

                    That makes sense. I'm pretty precise with my inputs though. I never press anything unless I know what I'm pressing and why, so I feel like I get disproportionately rewarded by passive block lol

It punishes mashers though which I suppose is a good thing.

I definitely prefer Soul Calibur's block though. It just feels cleaner because you have more exact control over duck/jump vs. sidestepping. 

Holding back to block is more of a 2D fighter thing and I don't think it's the best choice for a 3D fighter because it makes some of your inputs context-sensitive.

The number of times I've tried to sidestep in Tekken only to crouch/jump instead is annoying. I know it's a skill issue, but it just feels messier to me.
Wow...i thought dude was like my age i used to watch him for his signature ps screen into quit combo but wowwwwwwww. This is mind-bogglin....thought dude was a teen like me a decade and some change ago
Link?

        What the fuck did i just watch
        Thank you that‚Äôs probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen
Someone actually replied with a dramatized version of the exact video I was thinking of.
Banned from EVO, CEO (basically all Capcom events);  
he's trying to say it's due to 'racism' and for just chatting in an EVO stream; completely forgetting his transphobic rant regarding CeroBlast, his disabled rant against BrolyLegs, multiple, multiple racist rants against ANTi, SMUG, Punk, etc. etc.

And to be honest his toxic personality in general.
Oh I believe it, he didn't back down to a punk like ltg and I knew about this clip before I even picked up fighting games.

In this clip he's like the best encapsulation of the fgc in the best way possible.

He's wearing the corniest outfit but steps to a gym bro, beats him in the game, tells ltg to suck his dick, and it's awesome.
Yeah that‚Äôs fair haha. And LOL!!! I remember reenacting that while streaming SoulCalibur 2 once just out of pure random üòπ My friends got a good laugh out of it.
For sure
Wouldn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt keep up with him anymore. After he got banned from YouTube and the trolls became worse than him I stopped caring about it all. Laughing at the occasional image with him in it etc. Used to like watching his streams though. There was always a lot of funny stuff that was cut out from those reuploads.
When?
    Search up "LTG groomer" on YouTube. It should be the first vid. Goes into a lot of the stuff he's done.
        Ah but surely it was just an act...
/s
        So it's personal with you guys? How did it become personal?? And why do you guys care about LTG so much?
            I don't really give af about LTG drama lol. Just saying he isn't exactly an angel.
                ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
                    Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
            Yes, when a person is groomed and abused, it's personal.
                So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
Joon is a piece of work himself but yeah, not cool to harass the guy or anyone else. Not saying LTG is a model citizen but he‚Äôs entertaining. I like him in that way.
Does he have a new gf now? Wasn‚Äôt aware. I only ever saw that one girl he dated on and off a long time ago appear on his streams.
Fr. In every game he plays he bitches about them ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù the combos in games too and how these players would never hit that in [insert game]. Like bro, what does that say about YOU? Dudes dropping combos like they‚Äôre made of goddamn butter. The self awareness is nonexistent. 

Like seriously, this dude can‚Äôt even hit a combo over 250 damage in fucking MK1. Dude just picks reiko (grappler) and zones or does armored grabs. He can‚Äôt even use his main command grab that‚Äôs locked behind a half circle input.
Nah watch him play sf4 lol
    I did, spamming rolls and knives with Rolento isn't skill

He always loved to spam something, even back to SF4 days.
I've played him in person before he had any degree of notoriety (I live in lancaster). The salt is real and he's always had the same attitude.
It's about time somebody has a brain in this brainless community. Exactly, he feeds off it, even when I watched some of the "rage clips" I never took him seriously enough to be getting angry and wanting him off of Youtube, why? That's insanity. He can rage all he wants, who cares. How are you guys falling for that?? Lol.
    Being a plugging asshole as a schtick is still being a plugging asshole. Doesn't matter how intentional it is or isn't, it's no wonder people don't like him
        Then don't watch him. You know how crazy you sound right now? Well he's right about one thing, you guys are some serious stalkers and what's baffling is you're proving him right lol. You guys are some real creeps stalking a DUDE online üòÇüòÇ
            I don't watch his stuff. What I'm saying is, it is no wonder that people don't like the guy
                You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
                    Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
            He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?
                He's a well-known streamer. People discuss him. This isn't stalking. 

* You're right that isn't stalking, but that's not all you guys are doing either, it's personal, that's more than just simply "discussing" about him. You took him very seriously (which is very strange because his content from what I've seen, is clearly for entertainment, who gets mad over that??) Also, you guys can't seem to shut up ahout him, like is he really that important to you? You act like you l've never been on the internet. Well then again maybe you haven't so I don't know. 


Why did you all cap 'dude'? Does his gender make a difference?

I don't know, does it?
                    It's a post about him. People are discussing on the post. There's one post about him and 1000s not about him. It isn't even the hottest post. I think you'd need to try harder to convince me people were obsessed. For instance, I haven't made a comment on here and saw your comment whilst ambiently scrolling. It struck me as obviously incorrect. I don't think this is me being somehow unnaturally interested in someone. 

He is indeed clearly entertaining some people. But other people are allowed to have an opinion on that, especially since he's promoting a culture that is seen widely as toxic, antisocial and bad for the game health. (Just like how I'm happy to say that Nigel Farage is a symbol for an attitude that had blighted the United Kingdom, even if other people think the sun shines out of his arse.)

You did the capitalisation. Presumably you'd know.
    Are you LTG?
        Don't be stupid.
LTG is an embarrassment, but you have a warped perspective if you think having multiple characters at Masters rank makes you an average SF player. No amount of rank inflation has 50% of the playerbase in Masters.
Yep, he says he played Tekken since Tekken 3, but somehow he is worse than many players that have only played Tekken 8, that's a disgrace.

My cousin is higher rank than him(blue rank), without plugging, and he only played Tekken 7 for a couple of months during pandemic.

For the amount of time LTG has been playing fighting games ,he should have a similar level to Sajam
    tbf i've been playing since tekken 1, but when you're a kid you're really just button mashing. there wasn't a youtube to teach the fundamentals
        Same, once I got onto Tekken 3, the combos started to click for me. I was just too young before.
        He is 40 years old, he wasn't a kid when Tekken came 3!came out 

Anyways he played Tekken 5 while being 18+.
[deleted]
    Average is low red actually. There‚Äôs a rank distribution chart and everything.
        [deleted]
            Garyu was the peak of the bell curve.
He only got to purples because he's a notorious rage quitter. He gets beaten by reds and even orange ranks regularly.
True. Purple ranks are definitely not average players. But in LTGs case, no. He constantly plugs, ragequits and does ‚Äúone and dones‚Äù. Also i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in the orange ranks? Which I would still consider above average but like one more step above, if that makes sense.
    When I see his clips, he's definitely playing against purples, at least when he's playing Viktor.
    His Victor is purple. But his Feng is orange rank.
His ‚Äútrolls‚Äù (read: stans)
When really they don't want him to go away because then they wouldn't be able to have fun trolling his channel.
Stop pretending stonetoss is wrong
    Hes a nazi

Edit: DO NOT look through this guys history
        Right of Marx = Nazi
Jailing is basically when you are **forced** to block an attack that you can normally avoid by crouching or sidestepping. Usually describes *strings* that "jail"; the later parts of the string might be (for example) high attacks, and if the first part whiffs, you can crouch under them like normal. However, if you end up blocking the first hit, you'll be trapped in jail and stuck blocking all of it. (taken from the fighting game glossary, handy site for terminology!)
    Thanks for the info and thanks for referring me to the fighting game glossary!
its his eloquence when speaking and how he words things. and body shaming is absolutely hilarious and should be encouraged since obesity is such an issue. the Japanese people that make tekken would agree with me too
    Ok Dale
Do people actually use passive guard?
    Probably no series veterans do, but I find it convenient when I want to stay close to the enemy so I can punish things or have my pokes reach them after blocking.
        That's fair. I'm not sure how I feel about the passive guard tbh. No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

Passive guard has saved me a few times in Tekken and it honestly felt kind of cheap...I was just like "...alright...cool" üòÇ

But then it made me wonder how many of my attacks are just getting auto-blocked, which is kind of frustrating. It feels like a feature that should only exist in special-style and definitely shouldn't be useable in ranked.
            > No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

I come from SoulCalibur, there blocking is a dedicated face button and you can't move while holding it (can only crouch and empty jump).

> and it honestly felt kind of cheap

Why would it be cheap though? To have passive guard work, you have to literally not press any other button. Not attack, not sidestep, not move forward. The decision you're making is the same, except now there's an extra choice of whether you want to move back or not.

* You're right that isn't stalking, but that's not all you guys are doing either, it's personal, that's more than just simply "discussing" about him. You took him very seriously (which is very strange because his content from what I've seen, is clearly for entertainment, who gets mad over that??) Also, you guys can't seem to shut up ahout him, like is he really that important to you? You act like you l've never been on the internet. Well then again maybe you haven't so I don't know.

I don't know, does it?
        It's a post about him. People are discussing on the post. There's one post about him and 1000s not about him. It isn't even the hottest post. I think you'd need to try harder to convince me people were obsessed. For instance, I haven't made a comment on here and saw your comment whilst ambiently scrolling. It struck me as obviously incorrect. I don't think this is me being somehow unnaturally interested in someone. 

He is indeed clearly entertaining some people. But other people are allowed to have an opinion on that, especially since he's promoting a culture that is seen widely as toxic, antisocial and bad for the game health. (Just like how I'm happy to say that Nigel Farage is a symbol for an attitude that had blighted the United Kingdom, even if other people think the sun shines out of his arse.)

You did the capitalisation. Presumably you'd know.
Garyu was the peak of the bell curve.
> No other fighting game I've played has had it; if you don't block on purpose you get hit.

I come from SoulCalibur, there blocking is a dedicated face button and you can't move while holding it (can only crouch and empty jump).

> and it honestly felt kind of cheap

Why would it be cheap though? To have passive guard work, you have to literally not press any other button. Not attack, not sidestep, not move forward. The decision you're making is the same, except now there's an extra choice of whether you want to move back or not.
    That makes sense. I'm pretty precise with my inputs though. I never press anything unless I know what I'm pressing and why, so I feel like I get disproportionately rewarded by passive block lol

It punishes mashers though which I suppose is a good thing.

I definitely prefer Soul Calibur's block though. It just feels cleaner because you have more exact control over duck/jump vs. sidestepping. 

Holding back to block is more of a 2D fighter thing and I don't think it's the best choice for a 3D fighter because it makes some of your inputs context-sensitive.

The number of times I've tried to sidestep in Tekken only to crouch/jump instead is annoying. I know it's a skill issue, but it just feels messier to me.
ü§¶Sigh...Yes you do!  Otherwise you wouldn't have replied to the other guy you were talking to about this.
    Bro it's not that deep. Trust me.
So what are you doing about it in real life? Why don't you guys get off the internet and actaully show your faces and get out here and do something. Because I'm telling right now, it's all by design, you wanna get rid of Human Trafficking/Child Molestation/Grooming and such, you're gonna have to combat the government themselves AND the Porn Industry, which NONE of you care about doing in the first place and that's what upsets me the most about all of it, you don't care about none of this, you only attack people you personally don't like, then talk about it like you're committing to a great cause but you personally don't care about any of it, you're just as bad as the ones you hate.

Look I don't care about what somebody online is doing because it's real out here in real life, and it's NOT as easy as you may think or see on TV or Youtube, that stuff is fake, that's not what's going on out here. And most of the time, you pathetic pieces of trash don't have any solid proof to your claims, all you guys do is gossip and believe anything as long as it's against someone you genuinely hate, but when allegations are against someone you like, then you wanna ask for some proof. Man y'all ain't about that talk, leave people alone on the internet because you don't care about none of this IRL, please.
You don't watch any of his videos and just went with gossip. That's even worse.
    Seeing his viral transphobic rants and his other heinous shit doesn't make people stalkers. I don't care if it is a persona he plays online. That doesn't excuse the shit he's said in his rants about people.
