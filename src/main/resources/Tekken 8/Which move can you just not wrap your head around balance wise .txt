[[Which move can you just not wrap your head around balance wise ]]


For me it’s Paul’s DF 2. Safe mid launcher that crushes highs. Why!?


Victor's "expulsion" on heat is one of the dumbest shit I've ever witnessed
    Its better than some heat smashes and ITS NOT EVEN HEAT SMASH OMGLUL
        TBF his heat smash is really bad. His expulsion is usually the best way to spend his heat
            His heat smash gets me sometimes.

Not sure if you’re meant to block it on reaction but I usually have to read that he’s going to do it to block.

Not sure if I’d go as far as to say it’s “imbalanced” but any low hitting heat smash seems strong to me.
                I feel like a low heat smash is a negative for a character. At the very least they can be blocked and punished.

If the character has a mid heat smash, what ends up happening a lot of times is you'll be low on health but have enough to survive 2 or 3 pokes and then the opponent will use their heat smash to skip neutral and get right in your face, deal chip damage and be in enough plus frames to do whatever mix up they want whilst you're left with 1 health left and had no way to counter it even though you knew exactly what they were about to do.
                    Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
                        > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
                        Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
                    As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
                I don’t think my main is unusually strong
            it's way better than my mains heat smash
            All the hellsweep heat smashes do like 35 damage bc they’re hellsweeps
            I used to piece people up with his heat smash. You’re Trippppppppppin
                It's not that fast, you can get hit out of the start up and it doesn't deal as much damage as a lot of other heat smashes.
Only thing going for it is that it is a low. I also think it's not safe on block but not sure on that one
                    You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
                    It's -15 on block, very punishable
        When they said each characters heat was different I think that’s how they meant it it’s nice that he has a hellsweep heat smash and with the fact that he has explosion i doubt you’ll be blocking low
    Sidestep to punish it until the AOE explosion randomly clips you for 1/3 your health anyway, lol.
        At close-ish range this move is trash. Most characters can float him from it and the loud audio cue makes it very reachable since players will know to pay attention to it when he’s in heat
    yup. I main Victor (Bushin right now) and when in heat I will just drop it 3 times for the chip dmg. Sometimes they know to sidewalk it so I will go expulsion-u2 (homing)-expulsion-expulsion.  
nothingbeatsthatmeme.jpg
        Unironically a good way to use his heat LMAO, that move is STUPID
        Technically they can jab float you on reaction, but with how aerial hurtboxes work.... i'd say the odds are heavily in Victor's favour.
        Wait, the different inputs of expulsion have different properties?!
            U2 isn’t expulsion; it’s just a homing move to realign Victor and catch sidewalk. Unless you mean in Heat. Every character but Alisa gets some moves changed in Heat. (Alisa just gets more chip damage with Chainsaws)
    I’ve tried walking it but it seems inconsistent. It’s like you have to already be walking before he even starts the move.

Honestly my go to Victor strategy has been to simply throw so much offense at him that he can’t move.

At some point I’m going to learn him just to understand him better. Probably going to get a ton of hate mail.
        as a Victor main: yes, that's the strategy. 

Victor thrives in mid range with his D2, WR2 and DB4 (last 2 are CH launchers and he will bait you into attacking to get full combo). 

When you are close range you need to be wary of:

a) 1+2 (15f CH launcher, -8 on block, your turn if you block) - careful of attacking when he's plus and he's plus basically only on hit apart from PRF 1+2 and WR2 which he won't use close range  
  
b) DB4 (don't know if it's a high crush technically but it dodges highs) which you defend against using mid-checks.
            D/b+4 is a true high crush, it has crouching status
        I sometimes can sidestep right it then ewgf, but sometimes the AOE just randomly clips me, it doesn't belong in a game like tekken
    That move is a legit jumpscare
    It's definitely a very good move, but it also is only good in heat.  Outside of heat, it's launch-punishable trash.  (And inside of heat it costs heat meter, so you only get to do it 3 times a round, in an obvious timeframe.)

Also it loses to most characters' jab strings. :-\
    yeh expulsion. this a dumb non tekken move
        “Dumb non tekken move” what is a non tekken move you you lmao. Tekken has had characters doing a bunch of random things much worse than Victors expulsion that barely fit in a fighting game like Tekken.

Tekken 5 DR had a Jinpachi that could literally pull you into him from any range nearly

There is a giant manticore snake arm monster that breathes for in a left to right motion, that if I recall is unblockable as well so you have to be further back (or just grab him at start)

Unknown existed…
            People either forget these things or are too young to remember and are just parroting what they heard
            Yeah I’ve never been able to understand “This isn’t Tekken” or “This doesn’t follow the rules of Tekken.” I feel like the game has pretty much formed its identity around breaking its own rules haha
            been playing since tekken 2 and those are some one offs that no one took seriously. jinpachi was unplayable, orge was the same and nerfed for vs. Gon and Dr. B were joke characters too.

but we’re expected to take Victor seriously with disappearing every 3 seconds, a gun, expulsion etc etc
                Jinpachi was literally playable except in the Ps2 version… in arcades and dark resurrection he was playable.

Your arguments against Victor are the same complaints people have about Yoshimitsu in T7 when he could teleport and move like tinker bell high off her own dust at higher level play, just Victor has a ranged attack.
    Somehow when I'm playing Victor the opponents just mash their face on the buttons and manage to hit me out of it quite often. I don't understand how lol.
        they forgot to make you truly invincible during this move
        I just labbed this a lot when Vic do this I always try to float him for free combo. You can consistently do this if you train.
            Yeah but this was happening in yellow ranks where I know people didn't lab it lol
    what's the string?
    Yesterday I found out that King's dropkick doesnt knock Victor out of expulsion, even if it visually connects
    Yesterday I found out that King's dropkick doesnt knock Victor out of expulsion, even if it visually connects
    Heat smashes are very odd to think of balancing wise bc it seemed they wanted to be unique about a lot of them while not so much on anyone that’s a low bc they’re supposed to be super hellsweeps
    Well it is risky cause I always jab him midair for float combo. You have to be close to him tho.
    I seethe every time I see it, it's such BULLSHIT. What were they thinking with the chip damage?
    Side step left the mf, they cant help but spam it
    This
    I stepped the whole attack and got hit at a 90 degree angle from that bastard of a character
        some here would say that you "sidestepped wrong side" or you "expanded your hurtbox"
            I actually have the clip still it’s on my profile 😂 you’ll see me laying on the ground contemplating whether I should quit or stay
                [https://streamable.com/0fb3od](https://streamable.com/0fb3od)

I clipped one earlier today and felt super cool
                    Well deserved
    So glad to see this on the top, that shit is broken idc what anyone says
Launching throws
    I always fall for that fucking Lars throw when he jumps over me
        you can break that mid-air with 1+2
            Ty. I fight for my life when facing Lars while the man’s fighting like he’s coked up while binge watching the last season of naruto shippuden.
                don't press after DEN3 hits (+5) but it can be interrupted by any quick move before it does (e.g. when he's in dynamic entry before the kick just jab him)

stance pressure is fake and Lars cannot block in any stance so if he's moving around doing a madness again just jab him

1+2 break for monkey flip

monkey flip can be interrupted as he's going in the air

g clef is -12

db1, 3 string can be ducked on both hits to punish

his hellsweep is like -infinity i forgot exact numbers but legit any punish works if you duck it

1, 4 is -12
                    Tyyyy🙏😭
            Am I a ding dong? I thought 1+2 didn't break throw anymore. Or have I been super misunderstanding and that it doesn't break every throw anymore
                just to clarify breaking the Lars throw. you still have to break with 1+2 during the appropriate frame window, not just mid-air

1 or 2 breaks all generic throws

1, 2, or 1+2 breaks command throws, but you have to watch their hands

1 break if they lead with their left arm

2 break if they lead with their right arm

1+2 break if they lead with both arms

Some throws are tricky though, like the Lars that we’re talking about (i found that out accidentally). All back-turned throws are a mixup so it’s either 1+2, 1, 2, or generic throw break. Ling’s Waning Moon is 1+2 even though it looks like she’s grabbing you with 1 arm.
                    Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
                1+2 didn’t break every throw in tekken 7…not sure about earlier, but command throws have been 1, 2, or 1+2 for a very long time. Lars’ jumping throw is 1+2, but I struggle to break it too despite that knowledge
        That’s not a launching throw
        I hate how absurd some moves have gotten. Lars air throw was niche before, but now it's borderline OP. It's a homing attack throw that catches airborne opponents. Special throws are different from basic throws becasue they can't be reversed by throw parrys from Anna/Jun. These are basically any throw that isnt done with the arms. This is applies to Alisas head bomb throw, Eddy's foot throw, bears mouth grab from bear stance. 


There are exceptions to this though since kunimitsu and law have leg throws but can still be reversed.
UsuallyThey were either balanced by being stance locked, but now what's keeping them in check? Eating a homing 50/50 with little to no counter play is NOT fun.
    Why is this a thing.
        Because you can break them on reaction, that's the logic. You need to react fast though.
            Some throw breaks don't follow the typical throw break window logic and it's insanely annoying
            But you can break every throw on reaction. So why do only some characters get launching throws? (And often the characters who are already top tier without them)
                Because some characters doing different things is what makes the game interesting
                    Yeah, i don't understand why people don't get this shit. Exactly why for honor went down the shitter.
                        \^this 

so much this

I miss old Shinobi
                            Even I miss the quad-dashing
                Also, Xiaoyu's new launching throw can be done without the grab tech animation being seeable. From backturned, doing f2+3 (launching throw) and generic grab have the same animation.
                    Those take like 30+ frames to come out, you can dickjab her on reaction
                you cannot reaction break every throw. There are multiple throws in this game that have misleading animations that make you guess. For example, Feng’s 2 throws from back turn have the same animation so you have to guess. Same for a bunch of king throws.
                    I'm aware of throws like that; King's Giant swing is another misleading throw, for example, and there are unbreakable throws such as Reina's stance throws. Lazy wording on my part, but you get the sentiment I was going for.
                Parries, power crushes, counter hit throws. The fact that some character just get to launch punish power crushes because their throw allows it is pretty unfair balance wise
            But moves that typically launch you but you can counter on reaction (ie snake edges) are punishable

Throws are completely safe and on break just resets back to neutral with pushback. You don't even get a real frame advantage (because of pushback)

And now it's also homing and unreactable if it was a CH throw 

So launching throw becomes virtually 0 risk for full launcher reward
                Dude, there are a lot of moves that launch that are safe.  

snake edges arent comperable to throws!!
                    Name a single homing 11f launching move that's safe that isn't also a throw
                        Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

Ewgf is  launching, plus on block
Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

Even if people cant right now, it is still very possible.

Even a trash player like me can do it, so i know what I am saying to be true.
                            >Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

not really interested in that goal, let me start over: 

my main point is that homing throws are already stupidly broken, the fact that a 11f homing launching throw still gives the defender nothing for breaking it is absurd because no other move in the game has such a stupidly high reward with virtually zero risk since it cannot be stepped and cannot be punished upon successfully defending it

>Ewgf is launching, plus on block Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

Ewgf is not homing, comes out much slower than 11f especially considering the crouch dash input, and also the speed dependent on execution, it's not comparable at all

>And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
    I hate Law’s throw in particular. It comes out so fast it always catches me off guard.
        The “IM A DRAGON” or the launching throw?
            The throw that launches with a knee. I know the break but just can’t react in time.
            ff3+4 (1+2 break)
            i always get hit my the im a dragon throw, how do you break it?
                with 1 or duck
        I hate the one where he grabs you with his foot. It has such a weird animation that I can’t see it in time usually.
    For some reason Jun's one always catches me. I can't for the life of me break it even though I know the break input (1+2) iirc
        I had to lab and drill it to avoid getting hammered by this throw that gives her 60+ damage as a reward. The giveaway is to always be ready to 1+2 break whenever she's crouching. Like even if the Jun player ducked one of your highs and could have launched you with a hopkick... they probably only randomly crouched because they wanted to spam this throw anyway.
    Xiaoyu throw be absolutely stealing games from me day in and day out
    I abused Xiaoyu's launching throw way too much ngl
        I just learned the other day that this is a thing and have been testing people with it, usually landing it after heat engage. The only thing good about it design wise is that the timing to get the pickup is very tight, but once you get it it's definitely cheap af.

I also learned from this thread that there are a few other launching throws so at least the Lings aren't alone.
            [deleted]
                Xiaoyu is a weird thing to complain about. She has no poke only combos, one mix, no 50/50 game, and one launching throw that’s really forgiving throw break wise
                    [deleted]
                        Average Bryan player
                        I get launched all the time in AOP. Complaining about getting ducked sounds like a skills issue, not a character issue. The only time I use AOP is when I’m getting mashed on. Besides, it’s always been her thing lol it’s not even new to Tekken 8. It’s not like Bryan can’t just kick her in the face lol
    On that note, imagine if King had a mid-air throw like an RKO. Itd be easy to spot,  ut damn itd be cool and unique
    I hate launching throws but I abuse Leo's wallsplating 1+2 throw to steal rounds as much as humanly possible
    Realized the other day I've been sleeping on Auskas throw. I've been getting so many people out of her f 2 cancel
    No one, in any fighting game, should ever get a combo from a throw.
Jack 10f heat smash for 60 damage. Who doesn't want a 10f punish that can kill 😄
    Came here to say that. Also pretty nasty mix-up with his unbreakable
king's heat smash. cuz omfg
    100%. Shit does rage art level damage on it and become a free true 50/50 on block. Make it -15 on block just like a rage art if it hits like one.
        Might as well make Jin's -15 as well with the distance it pushes you and gives you a free wall combo on top of the 50+ dmg you just got. 
        tekken players when there’s a 50/50 and they have to guess except one of the options is completely reactable 😱😱😱😱 (that is basically what fighting games boil down to)
            The thing is not that there is counterplay, but his Heat Smash is by fucking lightyears the best in the game, maybe only rivaled by Jun. Cut the damage in half and it would still be fine.
    And if you block it he RKOs you
        and if you duck to avoid the RKO, you get a knee to the face

There is really no winning against it
            RKO is a 23 frame windup (0.36s) and the tracking knee is also pretty slow. Your best best against jag sprint would be playing neutral and crouching RKO on reaction. 

He also has the low dropkick, but it doesnt do as much damage, and since you're both on the floor, it pretty much resets you back to neutral.

Tips from a King main
                My brother in christ, the fact you omit is that King can block while sprinting at you full speed. I get that you're giving context and tips, but let us vent about that stupid and pretty much free mixup
                    Fair enough brother. I dont like other characters who also get a mixup chance off block.
                I’ve had a lot of success just jabbing jaguars sprint
                    Most Kings commit the jag sprint and 3/4 of the options are jab punishable.
                    King main. Yes…jabs work (not in heat though) unless it’s one of the kicks. But I’ve been poked out of sprint plenty of times
                23 frames with all the particle bullshit is essentially impossible to duck on reaction. Ur making the read between getting RKOd or getting opened up by the knee for a full combo. The low drop kick also gives king oke. I appreciate the advice but kings entire heat system is bullshit designed to force 50/50s
                    That first point is just raw skill issue, the entire animation is King slowly widely reaching out with both of his arms. The mid kick only combos when you're against a wall.

Also, like 3/4 heat smashes lead into stance on block, its not a King-only thing.
                        king is the single most hated character despite there being multiple much stronger characters, just let reddit be....
            The RKO is reactable though. 
    even as a king main I think they should nerf it
        yeah it almost  makes uselsess to use it on a heat dash,even if you fail you still get a 50/50
        Every long range heat smash needs to be nerfed.

And every heat smash should be steppable

And using a heat smash should sacrifice the ability to use rage
            true, in fact make heat smash do a jab that deals 5 extra dmg, that'll do it
    64 damage button that is somehow insanely good on block too, lol. That shit needs to do 50 damage or be a straight up neutral reset on block if they keep the insane damage.
        hardly matters since he goes into stance after the smash,if he was negative he would gain nothing from using it,just nerf the damage to jin level damage
    See also: Dragunov. Even if it’s blocked it’s basically a free throw afterward.
        You can rage art or launch on reaction, huge gap.
    As a King main, I'm sorry. That needs to be nerfed.
    I swear it connects from LA all the way to Paris

Edit: Also met a red rank King who basicly just did heat smash, jaguar sprint 50/50 and running 1+2

Couldnt do one combo that mf
    King main here, grab him or do a jump attack

Their brains shut off when their heat move doesn’t do anything or it trades knocking them on their ass
    The worst part is it looks super linear so you try and sidestep or sidewalk it, and then it tracks and you get fucking obliterated .
    Definitely this
Feng's db3, fuck that move
    I could write books about how much I hate this low.
        I wrote one a few months ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/s6tbTuvlql
            lol

A+ 'highly recommended'
            “I did, so don’t have to!” Thank you good sir
    At least its launch punishable.
    Its very punishable -14 or -15.
Just dont get CH by pressing buttons.
        It not about being punishable. Its too fast , has ridiculous reach and can't be stepped.
            My feng matchup knowledge is t7 based, but 

feng's mids that arent very punishable dont have a lot of range.the mids that do have range are very punishable, like shoulder, f3,4 for example 

So If you keep a range 2 distance you will keep the safe mids at bay, and you can fish for very punishable things.

Its Fun to see feng players meltdown when you bloco and punish them very hard every time they take risks.
                Yeah, that would be a viable strategy if he didn't have literally the best range 0-1 poking in the game coupled with high crushing entry tools and qcf into ws1, still having full screen range.
Everybody has built in evasion when attacking now, I'm just punching the air fr
    Everything crushes Bryan’s jab :(
        I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR THINKING THIS 😭 Glad I’m not the only one who noticed
        and now DVJ shares that same jab,but tbh that jab has been useless since like tekken3
            Nah dj had a pretty strong jab in T7. I think range wise only really lost to dragunovs jab and heihachis buffed jab, as well as larger characters like Jack 8, gigas, marduk.

But the benefit being that despite having less range than heihachi jabs, the animation gave DJ momentum as he would step forward to follow the opponent backdashing, heihachis jabs would push the opponent back with each consecutive hit.

And being a shorter character means his jabs are less susceptible to high evasion, which was what made mishimas somewhat of a good matchup against marduk because wavu could reliably crush his jabs.
                this is correct, i'm saying now DJ has a more bryan esque jab when he used to have a great one
                    Oh my b, I thought you were referring to DJ when you made the tekken 3 claim.
        Bryan has notoriously had a bad jab. i feel for you
    Seriously, every time you press a button with any character you are automatically evading something.
    I keep trying to use Reina's B3 to avoid attacks and every time I get smacked in the face
        B3 is something you need to use from a distance. Theoretically you could get a really fast electric out of it, but the backwards movement kills its range, and you can’t block in it. I’ve really only managed to use it for the 4 heat engager. Decent range, but it’s really only good as a knowledge check.
    Me when I try to jab as it's the fastest punish, but they're already doing a mid/low that makes them duck highs
    So much shit high crushes in this game, it's fucking wild
Safe fast high heat engager powercrushes. You know, the "just throw it out and win" type of moves. Reina heat smash is straight up projectile (3.6 range)
    Reina’s heat smash is decent, but not even close to the best in the game because it’s so slow. You’ve got characters like Jun, Jin, Dragunov, Lars that have similar or better range and are basically uninterruptible because of how quick they come out and how evasive they can be. Reina pretty much only gets to use heat smash in pure neutral; she can’t even give her self enough plus frames to set it up.
        Exactly, for Reina if I don't catch someone off guard I don't get the heat smash off. Almost any attack can interrupt it
        First attack of Jun's heat smash is 13f, but the second is slow. I've had the first attack sidestepped and then the second counter hit quite a lot already.
    
This one is what gets me. Power crush heat engagers stop aggression
    Reina heat smash is 20+ frames.

Isn't it like the slowest in the game? It also whiffs if you're too close to your opponent
    Reina's heat smash sucks so much I only use it for plus frames. It is nice that we have 2 heat smashes though, if only I was good enough to stance dance.
    Reina's heat smash has good range but it's also the second slowest in the game.
    I understand the logic behind these now on paper even if they end up being ridiculously strong in practice. One of the big strengths of power crushes in T8 compared to T7 is that they if the opponent swings into it with a fast button and recovers in time, the power crush becomes basically safe now. However; this does not apply to high power crushes, if you jab into them early like the other power crushes, you can still duck and potentially launch them. The hit stop from it actually can be it easier to duck too. So I can understand it on paper.
        But i want to pressure people with more than a fast jabs. I know about ducking and punishing if my recover time is fast, but still, there are other situations.
            That’s why I said that I get it on paper. More often than not in Tekken, you usually want to use your fast pokes than bigger moves. So having a move that’s main weakness are the moves makes sense on paper. In practice though, it ends up frustrating.
Half the moves in the game tbh. Especially demon paws.
    These have too much tracking rn.
    For sho Jin maybe kaz but djs demon paw so stubby.
        Nah, they're all retarded moves by design.
Drag qcf4: heat engage, power mid that hits grounded, wall splats, chip dmg, and **+7 on block.**

+7 oB is completely obscene.  For reference, that is more plus than Bryan b1, everyone's slash kick, drag's own WR2, victors wr2, Leo's d2, jacks stance 4_ WS(2)4, etc.  Drag's own hatchet kick is +7... **on hit.** And technically, bc of the active frames on this move, can be up to +9 oB, depending on how late in the animation it makes contact.  

His hatchet kick is a borderline second, but mostly in context of what else he has. Idk why it hits grounded and also so plus on hit.
    Im getting mad just by you mentioning that freaking move!
    for further reference, a 1 jab on hit is +8. at +5/6 you cannot sidestep jabs reliably. 

i remember when the move didn't have any pushback and you could just fucking spam it until it connected and you were in heat.
    ***MY GOODNESS***
Dragonuv db3+4 basically nullifies his old weakness of having no scary lows. Such a stupid design decision to give him a hatchet, even if it is -15 it starts making you duck which is all he needs.

Special mention to Jin d2 also giving Jin an easy CH high crush option with plus frames on NH and stupid tracking. Sure it's slow, but that move is obnoxious online.
    I feel bad for people that play characters that can’t launch -14 lows, considering how good the move is (Jin d2).
        Most characters in game can’t launch a -14. But at least Kuma’s WS 14f does 35 dmg.
            This is how I feel as Lee. I at least get good damage off of WS 2,3 into ff3, and if I’m feeling adventurous, I can flip a coin to see if Heat Burst will connect or whiff after WS 2,3 (please fix this, it really feels like going to the casino every time).
            How many can? I know Raven, Jin and Kazuya (tornado launch) can. Don’t know who else.
                Lee if he hasn't used heat yet.
                Iirc only Raven jin Jun and kaz can get a full legitimate launch.

Lee and Asuka get good damage, and Lee can get a launch in some conditions.

Eddy has a ws i13 launcher, but the first hit is a high, which whiffs against crouching opponents, so it doesn't work.
                Paul as well with his b3
                    why is that good
        It's good a thing that Jin can launch Jin's -14 low 👍.
        Jins d2 and evasive devil moves made me hate my favorite matchup
        King mid hopkick would like your location
        Man I hate having to punish -13 standing lows with WS4 on King, feels so whack.

Bryan can just Hatchet kick me all day with no downside.
    This low is so dumb.
    I was also going to mention this Dragunov move. The damage is insane. I feel bad when I get hit by this twice.
    I could've launch punished this entire time?
        On Bryan? Yeah make sure to launch that dumb move.
    Jin's d2 isn't that slow. It's 22 frames, it's borderline. It's not unseeable but it's bloody hard to block on reaction.
        Yeah, I meant "slow" as in "technically seeable". It's in the perfect middle ground where it's slow enough to be downplayed by Jin mains as reactable but not slow enough to be consistently reactable online.
    The conversion rate of his FC 1, 4 is also really insane. HUGE momentum from the sneak 4 that follows it too, which they already nerfed. You can even sneak cancel, and mix with a grab, to get them to duck, then eventually land that heat engager.
Paul's d/f+2 works the same way as every other generic d/f+2: safe on block, but doesn't launch crouchers.

It also does not high crush, but it does have some high *evasion*. Important distinction. This means it can't beat out highs with good hitboxes. Still annoying, though.
    Very true. Paul's d/f+2 narrows the hurtbox around his head area, but he's never flat-out crushing highs. A high attack with long range will most likely always hit him out of it. It's been this way for a long time.
    Yeah..."some" high evasion.
    >Paul's d/f+2 works the same way as every other generic d/f+2: safe on block, but doesn't launch crouchers.

Reina's df2 is - 12 on block and doesn't launch crouchers
        Reina is the only exception because she already has an electric and is the only Mishima with a launching df2
        That just means her DF2 is non-generic
        It also hits from range 2.6, that's more range than Shaheen and Claudio's hopkicks.
        Then it's not a generic d/f+2 lol. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and don't launch crouchers.
    Don’t think Nina or Asuka’s does either
    not all generic df2 launchers are safe on block
For example, Reina, Victor, Dragunov, Azucena have df2 launchers but theyre -12 on block
        There are 2 kinds of generic df2. The safe ones that don't launch crouchers and the unsafe ones that launch crouchers
            This. They've become traditional that way.

Something like Paul's d/f+2 being safe but not launching crouchers or high-crushing is decades old, and fine as is.
            There's still nuances. Azucena's is probably the best unsafe one. 

It actually has crouch frames in the start up to crush highs, and still launches crouchers too, so kinda benefits from the best part of Paul's one in the evasiveness. 

I think it's -13 instead of -12 as well for that privilege.
                Being -13 instead of -12 in this game is not a small disadvantage, given that there are several i13 heat engagers
                Azucena's does not have any true high crush frames. In fact, nobody's does.
        Which means.. they arent generic ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
        victor's is -14
            Oh damn, i thought it was -12. But my point still stands, not all generic df2s are safe and some launch on crouching opps
        That means they aren't generic d/f+2s. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and do not launch crouchers.
    It literally does high crush now mate. I think they changed it in t8. You can pull up lab and check if you like. He goes into crouching on the display in practice for a couple of frames. Shaheen's is the same too. 

I don't know how many frames exactly but it's true crouch frames now
        That's just because you're holding d/f for a couple frame before inputting the 2. Try buffering it after another move and you'll see that their status never changes to crouching. This is something you always have to be aware of when checking a move with a d/f, d, or d/b input.

Edit: Just checked, there is not a single d/f+2 in the game with true high crush frames.
Xiaoyu's launch throw is absolutely atrocious
    I was labbing it last night, why the hell does it have such a weird unique animation? Makes breaking it so much harder.
King’s Heat Smash into Jaguar Dash on block: Either get half your health wiped on hit or get it wiped afterwards on block after a misread

Victor’s Explusion

Eddy’s DF3-33-333-33 String

Jack’s “I’m using a low but because i am 27ft tall it looks like a mid” mixup
    That Jack comment >>>>>
    You might talk me into playing Jack like that, some of the most fun I had in Tekken 7 was with gigas and playing D2 db2 like the bongos. It sucked, but you could occasionally just rob rounds
Not an individual move, necessarily, but why does Asuka have these long ass Donkey Kong arms but embarrassingly short range on many of her punches?
    Cause then her hitboxes would match the animations, and that wouldn't be acceptable.
Leo's -12 high crushing unreactable low ch launcher.

Yes, this bitch has that.
    Leo has some of the most dumb overlooked shit ever. The mid evasive high crush full screen hard hitting launcher that pushes that ass half the screen away from you on block
        This 110%. Leo does everything so well and has been top tier since T7 S4.
        Hm, I've been playing Leo recently and I can't think of which move this is.
            BOK2
            The one he crouches close to the ground advancing forward, and then launches with both hands. First part looks like a stance transition, but I often see it just being used in neutral with manual activation
    Leo's df2+3 has shitty range and is linear. You don't even get the combo conversion unless it hits really close, otherwise just a followup. 

Jin's D2 is way more outrageous, really similar but twice the range and tracking. And yeah it's -14, but only 3-4 characters are gonna launch him for it.
        Jin's D2 has a very obvious animation and glow and its 1 frame slower. It's much more seeable and at higher levels of play it's almost useless. That cannot be said about Leo's df2+3. At all levels of play that is still a viable low. It's short range just means it cannot be used for engagement and closing the gap, at close range it's a terrifying low.
            So according to you, Leo's one is unreactable, but Jin's which is ONE frame slower is almost useless... despite having also a lot of tracking, while Leo's one is really linear. 
The fucking Jin downplay, as always.
                Dude.

Jin literally grows red.

He also has a VERY obvious animation. Leo's is nothing like that, for a lot of the animation he's literally just standing. See jin players in tournaments and events and count how many times they will use this attack and how many times it will get blocked.

Kazuya had a 25f ch launching low in T7 which people thought of as very reactable, now that it's 2 frames faster a lot of players are saying it's spammable as hell online and barely anyone can react to it. A single or two frame difference is all you need between a seeable low and an unseeable one.
                    I agree with you in that it's reactable, but in locals. But 99% of the playerbase is playing online, and it's not reactable on an average online match. So for 99% of the playerbase, that move is just getting away with murder.
                        In Tekken 8 there's 1 frame less input delay. Meaning that reacting to a 22f low in T8 is equal to a 23f low in T7. If you play online with a 5 bar/stable 4 bar connection in T7, I at least could react to 23f and sometimes even 22f lows. Like whenever I played against a devil jin I could react to his db2(22f in T7, 21f in T8) semi consistently online. I went to a local and I could react to it even more consistently. I would say a 22f low in T8s online is still reactable if the connection is good. If you're in a 3 bar match it becomes almost impossible but other than that you're good.
                            Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
    At LEAST it doesn't have the best range in the world.
Jun, Devil Jin and King heat smash.

Jin and Kazuya ff2

Xiaoyu grab launcher

Jin d2

Lili 3+4
    Jun’s heat smash is a projectile. which means after you finish cheesing out all her moves that heal her on heat smash and have crazy priority and launch, you can end the inevitable combo with the heat smash from anywhere
    u cant duck lilis reactable high?
Jin D2. I mean, i abuse it whenever i can but, that shit is not okay lol
Xiaoyu's low launcher from stance that is -12 on block. Like what?
    Its only a launcher if she stepped 3x ( 2x when in heat ) while doing hypnotist stance.
        BRO WHAT??! Really???
            yep, it takes a lot of set up and mind conditioning to pull off a full 3 step hyp stance sweep ( although significantly easier while in heat ) as Xiaoyu cannot block while in hyp stance.
    thats kinda the only good low she has and you have to stand there 2seconds doing nothing to get hit by it
Law ws4 into DSS is +5 on block. Kazuya has to break his balls to do the same.
    Just electric bruh
        Right? Like, kazuya has literally the most iconic plus on block move in tekken
    It is +5, but you can side step 99% of the options. People just don't want to side step, because almost every other character has extremely good tracking. Laws plus frames aren't as scary, when you realize how linear he is, even if he's plus.
        Law has some good options to counter side stepping. DSS 3, DSS throw, and transitioning into slide makes almost any ws move track. First of all it’s all about frame advantage ofc. If Law is plus 4 or 5 sure the opponent can sidestep, parry, backdash or whatever but if Law does heat smash or ws3 on block you’re not stepping anything that he’s throwing at you.
            wtf does DSS mean?
                It's a Law stance!
            Dss 3 is the only option, because it's a homing move, but it's a high. I've been side stepped so many after ws3 and heatsmash that it's mind boggling.
                Throws are homing too. And like I said when you go into slide that pretty much negates all side stepping because Law will just track when sliding. I’m just saying most people don’t want to duck Law because DSS f1 is OP. So ducking him is a huge risk it’s self it’s better to just respect Law’s plus frames.

Also there is zero chance you are getting sidestepped at +19 lol. So if someone stepped you after heat smash you’re doing something wrong
                    You can 100% side step laws slide up close. When it's mid range, is when you can't side step it.

Yes, people have consistently side step me when I'm +19 after heatsmash on block.

Try it out in practice mode, you'll realize how dumb it is.
                        Wrong. Just went in practice mode. Heat smash on block is +11. It’s literally impossible to step anything thats >15 frames when you’re minus 11. I told you it’s all about frame data and you still try to tell me that you can side step after heat smash. I did Offense training, opponent actions standing block, action after blocking side walk and sidestep right. Do heat smash into f1. You will hit them with that f1 100% of the time.


You need to realize it’s only realistic to side step, back dash or parry in -3 to -6 situations. Ofc its character specific depending on move lists of parries and evasive moves but I’m telling you that when you block something that is more than +6 you probably shouldn’t try to power crush, parry, or use movement cause you will be hit. Sidestepping doesn’t just work in magical ways
                            Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
                                You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
                                    You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
    Whats worse is law ws3. Its plus 19 on block lol I fuck people all the time with it
    You have an electric my guy. 
Heat Smashes in general.
I went into practice yesterday with Jun and she seems crazy. Her heat smash is a 2 parter. 1st is quick mid range projectile, and the 2nd part is infinite range crows where you have to block it. Then there's the her where she can just heal, and if you try to grab her, she has a grab reversal move. That blew my mind. But regardless, a match is still anyone's game
    don’t forget that izumo mixup that can be a high heat engager, mid pushback, low hell sweep or a throw. you can basically do it the entire match and never get read
        Her heat engager in izumo is a safe mid (-6 on block). Well, mid, high, but still crouching will not save you.
        > you can basically do it the entire match and never get read

duck 1,2 then interrupt with jab.
            you can do izumo with just up 2 to try to avoid that
    I think it's okay to have a throw reversal on a character. Always wanted to play a character with that, but was not a fan of Anna.




But I agree with the rest of what you say. May I also direct your attention on safe d 1+2, launcher with high crush, that is -9 on block and has no drawback in heat? 
Law’s nun chuk is no brain move
Azucena's running 3,2 attack still gets me going crazy (yes, im bad)
Unbreakable throws. And I don’t mean counter hit ones
asukas rage art, why does she get a safe rage art mixup? that is PLUS on block?
JIn D+2

HIgh crushing, CH launching, tracking, borderline unreactable, +4 on hit, non launch punishable low (-14)

What the fuck
Flash
    Easier to whiff than it seems but it straight up changes the game against multiple characters. 

Reina essentially can’t Sentai unless it’s the armor move.
Whatever victor button just allows him to instantly up teleport into "EXPRESSION" (With a French accent).
    Its U1+2 for future reference
Too many really, each character has at least one. 

Nina: the three-hit hit-confirmable move that starts with a low for insane damage, oki and follow-ups near the wall. Wallsplats? Her f1+2 is a mid power crush heat engager. Powercrush heat engagers are too much imo

Jack’s jackhammer. Why the hell is it plus on block now and I have to eat a mixup? His guard crush. Fk guard crushes in this game. 

DJ: crazy stupid hellsweep range. Range 7 heat smash, range 7 unbreakable throw! What the actual fk! Oh and that guard crush. Fk guard crushes in this move bro. 

Lars: uf3+4 this has got to be the stupidest move in the game right now. It actually breaks game physics. Lars jumps over you and his idk “aura” is still on the ground pushing your character to align with Lars’ landing. Check it out, it’s so fked up. I yeah and a plus on block homing mid? Why?!

Yoshi’s flash. Fk that move. 

Kazuya: ff2 why did they give him an insane range demon paw that makes his 50/50 even stronger? Why does he have a non launch-punishable LOW heat smash that he can access without stance? Reina’s low heat smash is hidden behind stance and is -18 or something. 

Claudio: low sweep unseeable heat smash 

Leroy: his low unseeable stick that is a full combo on hit

Paul: his heat smash demo man non launch-punishable. And that guard crush setup at the wall. So fking stupid. 

Really there are so many more
    bro is a jin main complaining about kaz’s demon paw
        I’ll complain about Jin’s too. I used to be a hardcore Jin main in Tekken 7 and my badge of honor was that I could play Jin at a high level after 6 years of maining him. I loved that he was a complex character to play who had tools for every situation. 

In Tekken 8, he’s so dumbed down that it feels unrewarding. His demon paw was an already great move in T7, now with its phantom range it’s just bs. Oh and fking d2. D2 feels like cheating for Jin mains. We’ve never had one button moves with forward momentum. High crush, forward momentum low that ch launches and only -14. Like holy fk that’s cheap as hell. 

Before Jin mains took pride in executing his harder combos like the f4 pickup, crazy wall conversions and micro step combos. Gone are any combos resembling difficulty and any Joe brown can get a f4 pickup from max range. 

I definitely don’t like how easy he’s become with all the handicap moves he’s been given.
            i was messing around my man but i hear you and as a kaz main myself I’ll definitely say his demon paw is quite strong as well when as you said it’s factored into the mixup and that glorious double damage in heat. i will say his heat smash is garbo though, especially compared to how strong the rest of his heat is.

there’s definitely a whole lot of kaz downplaying, he’s always hard to use well but he’s very very strong in this game, just not S tier broken.

never played much jin myself, kaz and DJ are enough mishima for me, but it is unfortunate that he has been dumbed down. they definitely wanted to have a noob mishima and ended up with some very overtuned moves. also yeah the f4 pickup is hilarious honestly, I can’t even get mad at it.

hopefully they just slightly nerf those few moves so he’s still strong but there’s more room for skill expression. but honestly, a lot of room for skill expression has been removed from a lot of characters. I’ll be shocked if they go back on that design philosophy.
    I think you can option select jack ff1 on block with a generic d4
    You can't compare Reina to Kazuya. Reina has insane pressure while Kazuya doesn't and 2 heat smashes while Kazuya has 1.
    > DJ: crazy stupid hellsweep range

Have you actually played this character or what because his hellsweep range is the lowest in the game lmfao
    The nina three hit confirmable is amazing
    As a kazuya main I agree his demon paw is crazy for his gameplan but its what Jins SHOULD be. Jins demon paw hits fullscreen. also Kazuyas heatsmash is bottom 5 in the game, reinas just happens to be worse
Reina's ff2. It seems to ALWAYS come out faster than my move
Steve’s Lionheart stance. I’m gambling my life for nothing, all options are beat by power crush. His df2 isn’t a launcher on CH. I can keep going. Steve’s design doesn’t make sense
    Lionheart transitions on block lose to all reasonably fast lows. It's really bad tbh
    Legit. Game forces me to go into a stance where in I lose the next interaction 95% of the time. I've started having to play Steve without using some of his crucial moves that go into the stance. Which just feels like I'm playing half a character.


All they need to do is make it so the stance is optional by not holding back. 
        When the purpose of a stance is to avoid it, that’s an indicator that the stance sucks. Lionheart sucks. They need to change it so that the player wants to get in it
I've been hitting people a lot with Nina's f+4 2 it's a little bit insane.
    You can duck after f+4
    The most brain dead flowchart I’ve done with Nina is do f42 until they duck and then just do the sidestep cancel and do ss2 to launch
whatever king is doing
Ravens sike i wish
    Hellfire pretty good tho
        Until someone is in your face and you can't use it because it will just get you counter hit launched into dead lol 

Ranged heat smash is pretty cool though.
Kings heat smash

New moves that are pretty insane.

Bryan's QCB 1 (much range, too fast, +5)

King's B3 (too good overall)

Xiaoyu stance sweep (kills me)

Feng B3 (shouldnt have easy + frames)

Lee B3, 3 (shouldnt have such aggro)
    Hwoarang RFF DF3. A lot of people don't know this because most Hwoarangs online are scrubs. It's an-

 advancing low crushing homing plus on block airborne mid heat engager LOL.
        It's +1 dude. Most of the time you can just challenge it with jab or SSR and beat most of his options.
            That's if you manage to not be crushed under the pressure enough to stand for a second and actually block it. If you tried to parry sidestep or duck then boom
        That too is absurd, he already had aggresive advancing kicks he didnt need another.
    Feng's B3 is good, but he'd still be really strong without it in 8
        He's never had access to such easy n big +frames, its not within his design to have + frame mids like that.

Kinda like Dragunovs new hatchet kick (DB 3+4) its not ok that he has big + on block mids and big +frame Lows
            His qcf 1+2 used to give +5 or +6 on block lol

B3 is just a replacement for the headbutt
                B3 can be used more as a general keep-out tool aswell tho.

headbutt you atleast got a hint from the qcf.
    King's B3 needs the follow up damage nerfed and the armor to start like a frame later.
Its used to much because his other armored moves are kinda meh 

Shoulder tackle is absolutely horrible, its armor properties seem to start at the same fame as it starts dealing damage, plus its short range and punishable on block, same with the rising knee into jag sprint, but at least that one has better armor frames.
        Damage nerf and lock the follow-up behind CH, cuz often it doubles up as a whiff punisher unintentionally
            Sounds fair tbh.
    Wouldn't Lee be the absolute least threatening char in the game without b3,3.

I don't think he needs it in terms of his identity, but look who he's up against :P
        All characters should return to their respective identity's there are OFC worse offenders than Lee im mostly mentioning his B3, 3 because I respected and revered Lee for his identity as a defensive character
    Shhh bryan deserves that move
        I play Bryan too but I think its overtuned, make it slightly slower and only +3 on block, range could stay just because everybody else also has a demon paw-esq move
            I don’t see that big issue tho I haven’t been able to get more then 2 qcb1 because they ss and launch me or just duck and send me to the goddamn shadow realm *(goddamnit paul)*
                i think its a lil too good in tandem with QCB 2,4 and QCF 1+2 and 3+4 in the neutral.
                    It’s all he has rn... come on that and a cool ahh wall combo
            try 0 ob lol
                Nah then leave it as is but make it only launch on CH
                    um, but it launches only on CH now?
                        Isnt it like a low parry launch on normal hit?

Maybe im mistaken its like a shabby electric but with better forward range.
                            no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
                                yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
                        NVM yeah you right
        seriously it’s like all he has atp besides lots of wall damage
    Lee's b3,3 is a suicide move for lee. If you block and punish you kill him
        Yeah it works on the bt3 format but in long sets, b3,  3 loses because its so fucking risky
        Still all the Lee's are comfortable throwing it out.
            Along with the slide it's our last ditch effort to open up a turtle...
            Just Duck he doesn't really have that many superscary mids from that range.

Hopkick I guess.
                His df4 gives follow-up if it hits ducking
                    Or nah it was a punch IDK the input maybe DB2?
    They turned Lee into another Hwo. He went from being a fundamental at it's core character into another BS one.

Agree with all the above.
Any "orbital" move that evades everything.  
So Victor's "expulsion". Yoshi and Raven have similar "disappear then reappear above you" moves. Lili and Xiaoyu can jump 50ft into the air. I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting 

I get these moves have some counterplay, but they are just annoying to me.
    Lars has one of the strongest orbitals in the game in hid uf4
Jin d2
feng's +7 on block knee, as if they need it
Azucena WR3,2.
    ?azu does not have a WR2

or you meant while rising?if thats the case every char has a while rising 2,her is the standard launcher,some other get a way better launcer
        Typo. WR3,2 or whatever the command is.
            oh ok,do you still find it oppressive?because i main azu and after the nerf i can barely use the move

not that i ever spammed the move but now i feel it's almost useless as a running attack since the knee  has no effective range
Literally any move that has built in bullshit evasion like Paul’s df2 like you mentioned.
Launching throws. The worst part imo is that it’s always the most random characters that have them.
Feng heat burst is stupid why should it ground everything even the you in the air! Is he psychic like wtf! And azucena elbow run jump, their both dumb moves. I know it's probably a skill issue but I feel like they're too strong!
Fengs FC df4,1

Why can he instantly access it and not frame kill like Raven, why is it basically homing, why doesn't it stagger on block and why is it plus with the option to enter BT? 

He wouldn't be as annoying if it weren't for this.
King heat smash.
That one move with Hwoarang that is a safe, jailing, wall splat, mid, power crush, tracking heat engager
Dragunov
Victor’s power crush heat engager.

Dragunov’s hatchet.

Jun’s HS.

King’s HS.
A lot of the heat attacks I'm not huge on, the fact that you can sidestep some reliably, but others not so much.
![gif](giphy|4bsk0gPEbYS6ssXLCq|downsized)
Much of the cast seems to have some moves that are abusable.   I suppose that was the thought behind the "balancing".
Safe df2 natural hit launchers. Absolutely insane they got to stay but the devs sent a hit out for magic 4s.

T8 in general seems to hate counterhits.
    A ton of my damage comes from CH D2 or F4
Tbh there are a lot of insane moves, but the knockback on Jin's heat smash, considering it starts a wall combo, does not make any kind of sense to me
Feng's old 1+4 that is now a qcf 4,1 (?). Completely stupid.

Lars' den 3

Ling's HS
Jins demon paw, Fengs 3+4 in heat, Jun heat smash cuz wtfff, DVJ heat smash, victor ff2, kings every armor move
KINGs upward kick followed by endless grabbing moves decreasing lp by almost 3/4 of the bar if done correctly.
Jin high punch and low from standing is bullshit
Its been said a million times, but Azucena WR 3,2. It's been nerfed 2 times now, and its STILL pretty good. If its blocked it's her turn and still chips pretty good. I still have no confidence in side stepping it since getting hit does a lot as well and leads to good oki for her. Just ridiculous she even got it.
Jin f4 always pisses me off. I dunno enough about jin to know if it's broken, but the distance it sends you while him still being to follow up always blows my mind.
I got frame trapped by ravens (I’m not sure what the command is but it looked like a back stance 1, 2? It was a double back elbow attack and he just kept spamming it and I couldn’t stop it with anything as Law.
drag’s db3+4 and iwr4 as a wall combo
Ernesto
Eddy’s 2 for 1 offer.
Why the fuck do Reina and Azucena LIE DOWN to do a MID CH LAUNCHER???

WHY? The same animation across both characters. Both of them are new. Both of them defy all logic. Duct taping their fucking heads to the floor like Sora in KH just to do a mid. Licking Spaghetti-Os off the ground and kicking me in the stomach. I fucking hate that design decision.

It's like Eddy and Lars weren't unreadable enough. We need to make more characters that are impossible to read and plus 90% of the time. I can't stand that shit. Most of the returning cast has drawbacks. Certain new or recent characters were made in such a way that they're just strong.

I refuse to believe a martial artist would ever lie down to donkey kick someone in the sternum. It just looks so stupid and makes the game that much less fun to learn.
    Zafina has been doing that nonsense for forever too
Safe df2s don’t launch crouching opponents (with one exception can you guess who?) that’s how they can be safe. Back when Tekken has balancing.
Any mid heat smash. No reliable counterplay, no matter how well you predict it.
Lars' dash attack that he gets in heat. Super fast, forces his stance mixup, and for some god forsaken reason it's also armored
King’s move set
Every move Feng has. 'I just did a launcher. Oh no, you blocked it. No problem, I have a follow up that launches as well. Oh no, you blocked that one too. It's a good thing it's safe. Now I'm gonna poke you with a long range, fast low that you can't punish.' 
The most privileged character in the game. Specifically frame data wise. * Ironic that it just so happens to be Harada's main*
Since the most egregious offenders have been cited.

Lee magic 4 tracks.
Any safe armored heat engager

A few characters have them and they blow my fucking mind that they exist. They literal win-buttons
All of them nearly unironicaly, its mike they tried to removed 90% of thr characters weaknesses, what is even the point, you have a gameplay with pros and cons, if you dont have cons, its dumb
Jin's ff2 track ability, reinas ff2 mixups, Reina's ws2. Crushing, Paul's deathfist and demolition man pushbacks making it hard to punish, victors wr2 random track ability, Xiaoyus AOP crushing, Most of Alisa's chainsaw moves, most of Azucenas moves,devil jin heat smash, Fengs heat jump move
 Tracking throws. Who thought that was a good idea?
Devil jins heat smash
Long time Feng main wondering who drugged Harada so he would greenlight giving Feng 3+4 in Heat.
Lars and lee. Just play the character and my brain just turns off for no reason i cannot win against them
King heat smash, no explanation needed.

Any of the high range, tracking, evasive, + on block, 20-22fr mids (ex: Lars DEN 3, Hwoarang has a move like this too). These moves feel wildly overloaded: I can't step, I can't duck, I'm disadvantaged if I block, and I can't react to the move to try and stuff it either. Doesn't feel fair at all.

Grabs in general received a confusing number of buffs. Beating power crush, that makes sense to me. But beating all sidestepping? And having CH properties? And with the added benefit of unrecoverable damage? It just beats too much. It's pretty common that I do a grab and accidentally catch some option I wasn't even thinking of.
A lot of the power  crush and high crush heat engagers. It doesn’t make sense that a lot of them are like -5 at most and some are even positive.
Any move u cant eyeball unsafe hence da fiten game issue
Kings ffn1 or ffn2 whatever the low punch is. 
King ff n 2
SHININGGGGG
I can't pinpoint a specific move, but the plus frames on certain characters needs to be nerfed severely.

Once you're stuck hit by them, players can stack on top of it to the point whereby you genuinely can't react properly. Telling people to dickjab/side step isn't helpful as much as you think it is, especially if you're at the wall.

For example, if Reina/Hwoarang have me at the wall and they continuously just use plus frame moves, throw, low, high, plus frame, high, plus frame, low, low, high, plus frame, etc..there's not much to do.

It's partly skill issue and I can agree to that, I'll need to git gud. But it's also absurd how you're 100% jailed and you cannot get out of it without trying some risky shit. Watching streams/competition videos, I see the same thing they experience and it's clearly a problem.

They need to limit the plus frames on multiple moves by about 1-3. Drag's plus moves are absolutely atrocious. I don't even know how this came out of user testing.
Every homing throw.
Tracking Throws is not as egregious as many other things stated already but having little to no movement options makes it challenging to play around and reduces skill expression.

If king was step-able you could really make him have it as his main arsenal doesn’t track.
King's heat smash. Just make it flat damage 55 or not track so good 😂
Azucena's WR 3,2
That move King does where he sort of lunges forward and does a low punch that looks like it should be a mid. Its too fast to react to and its safe as fuck and throws on counter hit.

Same with his low grab. I might be crazy but I swear that move is safe on whiff with how fast he recovers
Kinda obscure, but raven has a lot of launch punishable moves that are not really that good on hit. For example u3+4,3+4 is -25, b2,2,3 is -19 and b2,2,1+2 is -30. Granted some of those attacks come from mixups and Raven does great without those attacks, but should they be that unsafe? That is no point to use these moves at all
All hellsweeps.
3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
Yoshi's 3 heat string into the chargeable slash.

That last hit does like 50 damage, shits crazy
Jun. Just Jun.
OP - Paul’s DF2 and jabs in general are actually relatively risky because of the range. He has really short arms 😭
First, raven's ninja attacks. I always think he's just used heat smash but no, he has MORE NINJAS! Silly

And more seriously, any power crush heat smash, like Victor's failnaught. Eddy just got one too.. c'mon, it is just not right.
anything that does low launch into mid or mid into low launch. In other words Hell sweep or Bulldozer
Dragunov DB3+4 and CD4
Devil Jin Heat Smash...
Nina three hit string kick with guaranteed follow up that starts as a low!

King B3 armored kick is very cheap and the range and damage it gives is great, it might even push you back on block.

Leo has so many but mostly it is how incredibly fast he moves from point a to point b with some moves, making it very hard to sidestep.

Eddy DF3-33-333-3
So it's not really one move but sort of a design choice. I think Eddy is a good example of this. He's got all these long weird animations with random looking hitboxes. Like if you don't know what he does he's super hard to deal with but it feels like if you know how he works he doesn't really have much in the way of basics to rely on, like he's constantly dropping his block to fall into weird stances or just spinning in place. It seems like a few characters in the roster are only meant to be viable if they confuse or intimidate you but have glaring weaknesses. 

One of my friends mains Bryan and his pressure looks crazy at first but he's pretty easy to sidestep and tbh doesn't have very fast moves. if you're right next to him it's hard for him to do anything that you can't potentially launch punish. How does stuff like that work out balance wise for people trying to climb out of lower ranks and maining these fighters once they're up against people who can see through the first impression?
Lee ws2,3 into heat burst. I don't think this is intentional at all considering how some low or high move will make this whiff (Reina's hurtbox as a whole is very hard to get hit by the heat burst)
Why doesn't Azucena auto juke everything? She's clearly capable.
Claudio's D22 move. Move was way stronger online than offline in T7 which couldve easily been solved by making the 2nd part slower so you could react to it easier but still make it guaranteed on CH. But just completely nerfing it to the ground and starburst adding nothing to it makes no sense to me.
King's Heat Smash. Why the fuck does this move do insane damage but leads into a three way mix up. Alot of heat smashs end up making you guess at the end of them but this one feels the most egregious of them all.
Lili’s heat smash. Like it does SUCH little damage compared to pretty much everyone
    Yeah, but she gets two, and the back turn is a low, plus they both end in back turn for a mix-up even and especially on block so I don't mind the damage, actually I didn't even realize the damage was low until I saw your comment haha
> Safe mid launcher that crushes highs

Um akshually it evades highs not crushes

It's not great at calling out crouchers either since crouchers just get left standing instead. Also it's his one safe mid launcher, the rest are unsafe
Dragunov has both huge +ob mid and +oh low. Balance wise they are not a problem individually. But having both of them together is too much.
Drags wr2, I can't deal with it, Seriously
    its quite stepable, in point blank step right and from range 2 you step or sidewalk left. What is truly annoying is his hatchet which will scare people into ducking at close range and iwr moves are easier in t8 so he can destroy you with a wr2
“I’M A DRAGON”. I can break the throw most of the time (1 break) but its really fucking annoying
    I will fight people that are really good at breaking throws and that throw they still dont break 90% of the time.
        I think its just the way that it looks, it took me to get to about fujin before i could do it somewhat consistently
            Yeah for sure the animation is cheesy asf. The one down side is that the range is very poop with that grab. Not much of a problem on T8 though lol
                Oh yeah the range is horrible, I don’t mind it being in the game. It’s just me sharing my saltiness towards it haha
Bryan’s Leg Sweep. That move is witchcraft.
    Yeah this one might not be it
    His snake edge, you mean? Thats about the only balanced move left in the game: nearly half a second startup time, -28 thousand on block. So, high risk and high reward.
        It’s that one move in particular. (Yes, I’m bad.)
            Well, you're at least half way there. You've identified the move that deletes your health bar and now all you have to do is go into a practice mode, order Byron to spam snake age and come up with an appropriate punish.

For me it helps to notice how his entire body goes down, with his hands and face facing the ground. A very telling key pose which you can hardly confuse with anything else. Once you see it, just hold DB, wait for him to twitch backwards after the move connects and viola!
                Should I be holding down block or down back and block? Just so I can get better instead of trying to low parry everything.
                    There is no such thing as "down block" in the game. If you just hold down the lows will still hit you.

So every time you want to block a low, you always need to input (or hold) down back ↙
    bro on god. you see that shit coming but can't do shit about it most of the time.
Reina's db2, the thing has mediocre damage, no CH bonus, it's -16 on block and -3 on hit. Like why??
    You're talking about reina's db2 not df2 i believe.
        Yeah my bad, I meant db2
It doesn't launch crouchers, but yeah the high crushing is too much. Df2 into df2 is still the dumbest setup, and it worked for the entirety of T7's life span as well.
Electrics ever since they Added tracking and removed recovery frames on whiff, there's little reason not to spam them now since most you'll get punished with is not even a launcher.
    Disagree. You can reliably SSL it and whiff punish it with a launcher if you are fast enough.
        No, you actually can't. Lili has the best side step in the game, and can't smooth side step it. You guys need to actually go lab it and realize mishimas weakness, isn't weak anymore.
            Bro I both constantly done it and got it done against me in ranked.
                Are you doing pewgf or regular ewgf?
                    EWGF
                        Then that's why you don't see the difference.
                            I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
                                In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
                                    Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
                            I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
                                You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
    They can b ducked tho
        Yes, jabs can be ducked too and they are arguably the best move in any character that is not a mishima (or asuka) since you'll only get launched on a hard prediction.
King
RA HS when used separately that takes away 130pts of ur hp so u can steal a win whenever u feel like. I literally fought a guy and won with 3 jabs an a df1 combined with RA an a HS. This game is just silly and SHOULD NOT be taken competitively.Lifelong tekken player(T3)
Low sweeping launchers. stupidest fucking thing imaginable
power crush heat engage
Dragunov sneak 4

Azucena wr 3,2

Azucena df1,4

Devil Jin heat smash

King heat smash

Victor heat u+1+2

Jun's entire kit
Way too fast but somehow not launchable on block xiaoyu hellsweep
Shaheen's df2 does this too btw.

Any 14f punish launcher (so Ling, Paul, Bryan, Lars that I know of)

Ling has a 20f snake edge launcher that's only -12 on block...

Kazuya's twin pistons (being able to 13f block launch kinda crazy).

Hwoarang having a 10f ch launcher in heat that's very easy to confirm.

Law having a very easy hit confirmable 10f ch launcher in heat / heat engager.

Yoshi's 6f flash.

Several heat smashes - either unreactable low ones or the unsteppable devil jin/ jun's..  or any that leave the opponent +2000 guard frames and an unseeable mix up (so Feng's or Ling's). 

Safe power crush heat engagers where they're that fast you can't even duck on reaction (feng, victor, azucena, shaheen, asuka, eddy... Probably missing z few but there's too many).

And I'm sure there's way more I haven't even mentioned, they're just off the top of my head.
Xiaoyu hypnotist stance, pretty safe and w heat is devastating. If it’s not interrupted it’s a 50/50 guess to a mid or low launcher. It’s actually the stance that gives her a lot of offense and probably needs a nerf on the single step mid (I think it’s -4 on block) 

That said needs a nerf to how safe it is on block but keep its mix up potential
Its better than some heat smashes and ITS NOT EVEN HEAT SMASH OMGLUL
    TBF his heat smash is really bad. His expulsion is usually the best way to spend his heat
        His heat smash gets me sometimes.

Not sure if you’re meant to block it on reaction but I usually have to read that he’s going to do it to block.

Not sure if I’d go as far as to say it’s “imbalanced” but any low hitting heat smash seems strong to me.
            I feel like a low heat smash is a negative for a character. At the very least they can be blocked and punished.

If the character has a mid heat smash, what ends up happening a lot of times is you'll be low on health but have enough to survive 2 or 3 pokes and then the opponent will use their heat smash to skip neutral and get right in your face, deal chip damage and be in enough plus frames to do whatever mix up they want whilst you're left with 1 health left and had no way to counter it even though you knew exactly what they were about to do.
                Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
                    > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
                    Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
                As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
            I don’t think my main is unusually strong
        it's way better than my mains heat smash
        All the hellsweep heat smashes do like 35 damage bc they’re hellsweeps
        I used to piece people up with his heat smash. You’re Trippppppppppin
            It's not that fast, you can get hit out of the start up and it doesn't deal as much damage as a lot of other heat smashes.
Only thing going for it is that it is a low. I also think it's not safe on block but not sure on that one
                You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
                It's -15 on block, very punishable
    When they said each characters heat was different I think that’s how they meant it it’s nice that he has a hellsweep heat smash and with the fact that he has explosion i doubt you’ll be blocking low
Sidestep to punish it until the AOE explosion randomly clips you for 1/3 your health anyway, lol.
    At close-ish range this move is trash. Most characters can float him from it and the loud audio cue makes it very reachable since players will know to pay attention to it when he’s in heat
yup. I main Victor (Bushin right now) and when in heat I will just drop it 3 times for the chip dmg. Sometimes they know to sidewalk it so I will go expulsion-u2 (homing)-expulsion-expulsion.  
nothingbeatsthatmeme.jpg
    Unironically a good way to use his heat LMAO, that move is STUPID
    Technically they can jab float you on reaction, but with how aerial hurtboxes work.... i'd say the odds are heavily in Victor's favour.
    Wait, the different inputs of expulsion have different properties?!
        U2 isn’t expulsion; it’s just a homing move to realign Victor and catch sidewalk. Unless you mean in Heat. Every character but Alisa gets some moves changed in Heat. (Alisa just gets more chip damage with Chainsaws)
I’ve tried walking it but it seems inconsistent. It’s like you have to already be walking before he even starts the move.

Honestly my go to Victor strategy has been to simply throw so much offense at him that he can’t move.

At some point I’m going to learn him just to understand him better. Probably going to get a ton of hate mail.
    as a Victor main: yes, that's the strategy. 

Victor thrives in mid range with his D2, WR2 and DB4 (last 2 are CH launchers and he will bait you into attacking to get full combo). 

When you are close range you need to be wary of:

a) 1+2 (15f CH launcher, -8 on block, your turn if you block) - careful of attacking when he's plus and he's plus basically only on hit apart from PRF 1+2 and WR2 which he won't use close range  
  
b) DB4 (don't know if it's a high crush technically but it dodges highs) which you defend against using mid-checks.
        D/b+4 is a true high crush, it has crouching status
    I sometimes can sidestep right it then ewgf, but sometimes the AOE just randomly clips me, it doesn't belong in a game like tekken
That move is a legit jumpscare
It's definitely a very good move, but it also is only good in heat.  Outside of heat, it's launch-punishable trash.  (And inside of heat it costs heat meter, so you only get to do it 3 times a round, in an obvious timeframe.)

Also it loses to most characters' jab strings. :-\
yeh expulsion. this a dumb non tekken move
    “Dumb non tekken move” what is a non tekken move you you lmao. Tekken has had characters doing a bunch of random things much worse than Victors expulsion that barely fit in a fighting game like Tekken.

Tekken 5 DR had a Jinpachi that could literally pull you into him from any range nearly

There is a giant manticore snake arm monster that breathes for in a left to right motion, that if I recall is unblockable as well so you have to be further back (or just grab him at start)

Unknown existed…
        People either forget these things or are too young to remember and are just parroting what they heard
        Yeah I’ve never been able to understand “This isn’t Tekken” or “This doesn’t follow the rules of Tekken.” I feel like the game has pretty much formed its identity around breaking its own rules haha
        been playing since tekken 2 and those are some one offs that no one took seriously. jinpachi was unplayable, orge was the same and nerfed for vs. Gon and Dr. B were joke characters too.

but we’re expected to take Victor seriously with disappearing every 3 seconds, a gun, expulsion etc etc
            Jinpachi was literally playable except in the Ps2 version… in arcades and dark resurrection he was playable.

Your arguments against Victor are the same complaints people have about Yoshimitsu in T7 when he could teleport and move like tinker bell high off her own dust at higher level play, just Victor has a ranged attack.
Somehow when I'm playing Victor the opponents just mash their face on the buttons and manage to hit me out of it quite often. I don't understand how lol.
    they forgot to make you truly invincible during this move
    I just labbed this a lot when Vic do this I always try to float him for free combo. You can consistently do this if you train.
        Yeah but this was happening in yellow ranks where I know people didn't lab it lol
what's the string?
Yesterday I found out that King's dropkick doesnt knock Victor out of expulsion, even if it visually connects

Heat smashes are very odd to think of balancing wise bc it seemed they wanted to be unique about a lot of them while not so much on anyone that’s a low bc they’re supposed to be super hellsweeps
Well it is risky cause I always jab him midair for float combo. You have to be close to him tho.
I seethe every time I see it, it's such BULLSHIT. What were they thinking with the chip damage?
Side step left the mf, they cant help but spam it
This
I stepped the whole attack and got hit at a 90 degree angle from that bastard of a character
    some here would say that you "sidestepped wrong side" or you "expanded your hurtbox"
        I actually have the clip still it’s on my profile 😂 you’ll see me laying on the ground contemplating whether I should quit or stay
            [https://streamable.com/0fb3od](https://streamable.com/0fb3od)

I clipped one earlier today and felt super cool
                Well deserved
So glad to see this on the top, that shit is broken idc what anyone says
I always fall for that fucking Lars throw when he jumps over me
    you can break that mid-air with 1+2
        Ty. I fight for my life when facing Lars while the man’s fighting like he’s coked up while binge watching the last season of naruto shippuden.
            don't press after DEN3 hits (+5) but it can be interrupted by any quick move before it does (e.g. when he's in dynamic entry before the kick just jab him)

stance pressure is fake and Lars cannot block in any stance so if he's moving around doing a madness again just jab him

1+2 break for monkey flip

monkey flip can be interrupted as he's going in the air

g clef is -12

db1, 3 string can be ducked on both hits to punish

his hellsweep is like -infinity i forgot exact numbers but legit any punish works if you duck it

1, 4 is -12
                Tyyyy🙏😭
        Am I a ding dong? I thought 1+2 didn't break throw anymore. Or have I been super misunderstanding and that it doesn't break every throw anymore
            just to clarify breaking the Lars throw. you still have to break with 1+2 during the appropriate frame window, not just mid-air

1 or 2 breaks all generic throws

1, 2, or 1+2 breaks command throws, but you have to watch their hands

1 break if they lead with their left arm

2 break if they lead with their right arm

1+2 break if they lead with both arms

Some throws are tricky though, like the Lars that we’re talking about (i found that out accidentally). All back-turned throws are a mixup so it’s either 1+2, 1, 2, or generic throw break. Ling’s Waning Moon is 1+2 even though it looks like she’s grabbing you with 1 arm.
                Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
            1+2 didn’t break every throw in tekken 7…not sure about earlier, but command throws have been 1, 2, or 1+2 for a very long time. Lars’ jumping throw is 1+2, but I struggle to break it too despite that knowledge
    That’s not a launching throw
    I hate how absurd some moves have gotten. Lars air throw was niche before, but now it's borderline OP. It's a homing attack throw that catches airborne opponents. Special throws are different from basic throws becasue they can't be reversed by throw parrys from Anna/Jun. These are basically any throw that isnt done with the arms. This is applies to Alisas head bomb throw, Eddy's foot throw, bears mouth grab from bear stance. 


There are exceptions to this though since kunimitsu and law have leg throws but can still be reversed.
UsuallyThey were either balanced by being stance locked, but now what's keeping them in check? Eating a homing 50/50 with little to no counter play is NOT fun.
Why is this a thing.
    Because you can break them on reaction, that's the logic. You need to react fast though.
        Some throw breaks don't follow the typical throw break window logic and it's insanely annoying
        But you can break every throw on reaction. So why do only some characters get launching throws? (And often the characters who are already top tier without them)
            Because some characters doing different things is what makes the game interesting
                Yeah, i don't understand why people don't get this shit. Exactly why for honor went down the shitter.
                    \^this 

so much this

I miss old Shinobi
                        Even I miss the quad-dashing
            Also, Xiaoyu's new launching throw can be done without the grab tech animation being seeable. From backturned, doing f2+3 (launching throw) and generic grab have the same animation.
                Those take like 30+ frames to come out, you can dickjab her on reaction
            you cannot reaction break every throw. There are multiple throws in this game that have misleading animations that make you guess. For example, Feng’s 2 throws from back turn have the same animation so you have to guess. Same for a bunch of king throws.
                I'm aware of throws like that; King's Giant swing is another misleading throw, for example, and there are unbreakable throws such as Reina's stance throws. Lazy wording on my part, but you get the sentiment I was going for.
            Parries, power crushes, counter hit throws. The fact that some character just get to launch punish power crushes because their throw allows it is pretty unfair balance wise
        But moves that typically launch you but you can counter on reaction (ie snake edges) are punishable

Throws are completely safe and on break just resets back to neutral with pushback. You don't even get a real frame advantage (because of pushback)

And now it's also homing and unreactable if it was a CH throw 

So launching throw becomes virtually 0 risk for full launcher reward
            Dude, there are a lot of moves that launch that are safe.  

snake edges arent comperable to throws!!
                Name a single homing 11f launching move that's safe that isn't also a throw
                    Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

Ewgf is  launching, plus on block
Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

Even if people cant right now, it is still very possible.

Even a trash player like me can do it, so i know what I am saying to be true.
                        >Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

not really interested in that goal, let me start over: 

my main point is that homing throws are already stupidly broken, the fact that a 11f homing launching throw still gives the defender nothing for breaking it is absurd because no other move in the game has such a stupidly high reward with virtually zero risk since it cannot be stepped and cannot be punished upon successfully defending it

>Ewgf is launching, plus on block Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

Ewgf is not homing, comes out much slower than 11f especially considering the crouch dash input, and also the speed dependent on execution, it's not comparable at all

>And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
I hate Law’s throw in particular. It comes out so fast it always catches me off guard.
    The “IM A DRAGON” or the launching throw?
        The throw that launches with a knee. I know the break but just can’t react in time.
        ff3+4 (1+2 break)
        i always get hit my the im a dragon throw, how do you break it?
            with 1 or duck
    I hate the one where he grabs you with his foot. It has such a weird animation that I can’t see it in time usually.
For some reason Jun's one always catches me. I can't for the life of me break it even though I know the break input (1+2) iirc
    I had to lab and drill it to avoid getting hammered by this throw that gives her 60+ damage as a reward. The giveaway is to always be ready to 1+2 break whenever she's crouching. Like even if the Jun player ducked one of your highs and could have launched you with a hopkick... they probably only randomly crouched because they wanted to spam this throw anyway.
Xiaoyu throw be absolutely stealing games from me day in and day out
I abused Xiaoyu's launching throw way too much ngl
    I just learned the other day that this is a thing and have been testing people with it, usually landing it after heat engage. The only thing good about it design wise is that the timing to get the pickup is very tight, but once you get it it's definitely cheap af.

I also learned from this thread that there are a few other launching throws so at least the Lings aren't alone.
        [deleted]
            Xiaoyu is a weird thing to complain about. She has no poke only combos, one mix, no 50/50 game, and one launching throw that’s really forgiving throw break wise
                [deleted]
                    Average Bryan player
                    I get launched all the time in AOP. Complaining about getting ducked sounds like a skills issue, not a character issue. The only time I use AOP is when I’m getting mashed on. Besides, it’s always been her thing lol it’s not even new to Tekken 8. It’s not like Bryan can’t just kick her in the face lol
On that note, imagine if King had a mid-air throw like an RKO. Itd be easy to spot,  ut damn itd be cool and unique
I hate launching throws but I abuse Leo's wallsplating 1+2 throw to steal rounds as much as humanly possible
Realized the other day I've been sleeping on Auskas throw. I've been getting so many people out of her f 2 cancel
No one, in any fighting game, should ever get a combo from a throw.
Came here to say that. Also pretty nasty mix-up with his unbreakable
100%. Shit does rage art level damage on it and become a free true 50/50 on block. Make it -15 on block just like a rage art if it hits like one.
    Might as well make Jin's -15 as well with the distance it pushes you and gives you a free wall combo on top of the 50+ dmg you just got. 
    tekken players when there’s a 50/50 and they have to guess except one of the options is completely reactable 😱😱😱😱 (that is basically what fighting games boil down to)
        The thing is not that there is counterplay, but his Heat Smash is by fucking lightyears the best in the game, maybe only rivaled by Jun. Cut the damage in half and it would still be fine.
And if you block it he RKOs you
    and if you duck to avoid the RKO, you get a knee to the face

There is really no winning against it
        RKO is a 23 frame windup (0.36s) and the tracking knee is also pretty slow. Your best best against jag sprint would be playing neutral and crouching RKO on reaction. 

He also has the low dropkick, but it doesnt do as much damage, and since you're both on the floor, it pretty much resets you back to neutral.

Tips from a King main
            My brother in christ, the fact you omit is that King can block while sprinting at you full speed. I get that you're giving context and tips, but let us vent about that stupid and pretty much free mixup
                Fair enough brother. I dont like other characters who also get a mixup chance off block.
            I’ve had a lot of success just jabbing jaguars sprint
                Most Kings commit the jag sprint and 3/4 of the options are jab punishable.
                King main. Yes…jabs work (not in heat though) unless it’s one of the kicks. But I’ve been poked out of sprint plenty of times
            23 frames with all the particle bullshit is essentially impossible to duck on reaction. Ur making the read between getting RKOd or getting opened up by the knee for a full combo. The low drop kick also gives king oke. I appreciate the advice but kings entire heat system is bullshit designed to force 50/50s
                That first point is just raw skill issue, the entire animation is King slowly widely reaching out with both of his arms. The mid kick only combos when you're against a wall.

Also, like 3/4 heat smashes lead into stance on block, its not a King-only thing.
                    king is the single most hated character despite there being multiple much stronger characters, just let reddit be....
        The RKO is reactable though. 
even as a king main I think they should nerf it
    yeah it almost  makes uselsess to use it on a heat dash,even if you fail you still get a 50/50
    Every long range heat smash needs to be nerfed.

And every heat smash should be steppable

And using a heat smash should sacrifice the ability to use rage
        true, in fact make heat smash do a jab that deals 5 extra dmg, that'll do it
64 damage button that is somehow insanely good on block too, lol. That shit needs to do 50 damage or be a straight up neutral reset on block if they keep the insane damage.
    hardly matters since he goes into stance after the smash,if he was negative he would gain nothing from using it,just nerf the damage to jin level damage
See also: Dragunov. Even if it’s blocked it’s basically a free throw afterward.
    You can rage art or launch on reaction, huge gap.
As a King main, I'm sorry. That needs to be nerfed.
I swear it connects from LA all the way to Paris

Edit: Also met a red rank King who basicly just did heat smash, jaguar sprint 50/50 and running 1+2

Couldnt do one combo that mf
King main here, grab him or do a jump attack

Their brains shut off when their heat move doesn’t do anything or it trades knocking them on their ass
The worst part is it looks super linear so you try and sidestep or sidewalk it, and then it tracks and you get fucking obliterated .
Definitely this
I could write books about how much I hate this low.
    I wrote one a few months ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/s6tbTuvlql
        lol

A+ 'highly recommended'
        “I did, so don’t have to!” Thank you good sir
At least its launch punishable.
Its very punishable -14 or -15.
Just dont get CH by pressing buttons.
    It not about being punishable. Its too fast , has ridiculous reach and can't be stepped.
        My feng matchup knowledge is t7 based, but 

feng's mids that arent very punishable dont have a lot of range.the mids that do have range are very punishable, like shoulder, f3,4 for example 

So If you keep a range 2 distance you will keep the safe mids at bay, and you can fish for very punishable things.

Its Fun to see feng players meltdown when you bloco and punish them very hard every time they take risks.
            Yeah, that would be a viable strategy if he didn't have literally the best range 0-1 poking in the game coupled with high crushing entry tools and qcf into ws1, still having full screen range.
Everything crushes Bryan’s jab :(
    I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR THINKING THIS 😭 Glad I’m not the only one who noticed
    and now DVJ shares that same jab,but tbh that jab has been useless since like tekken3
        Nah dj had a pretty strong jab in T7. I think range wise only really lost to dragunovs jab and heihachis buffed jab, as well as larger characters like Jack 8, gigas, marduk.

But the benefit being that despite having less range than heihachi jabs, the animation gave DJ momentum as he would step forward to follow the opponent backdashing, heihachis jabs would push the opponent back with each consecutive hit.

And being a shorter character means his jabs are less susceptible to high evasion, which was what made mishimas somewhat of a good matchup against marduk because wavu could reliably crush his jabs.
            this is correct, i'm saying now DJ has a more bryan esque jab when he used to have a great one
                Oh my b, I thought you were referring to DJ when you made the tekken 3 claim.
    Bryan has notoriously had a bad jab. i feel for you
Seriously, every time you press a button with any character you are automatically evading something.
I keep trying to use Reina's B3 to avoid attacks and every time I get smacked in the face
    B3 is something you need to use from a distance. Theoretically you could get a really fast electric out of it, but the backwards movement kills its range, and you can’t block in it. I’ve really only managed to use it for the 4 heat engager. Decent range, but it’s really only good as a knowledge check.
Me when I try to jab as it's the fastest punish, but they're already doing a mid/low that makes them duck highs
So much shit high crushes in this game, it's fucking wild
Reina’s heat smash is decent, but not even close to the best in the game because it’s so slow. You’ve got characters like Jun, Jin, Dragunov, Lars that have similar or better range and are basically uninterruptible because of how quick they come out and how evasive they can be. Reina pretty much only gets to use heat smash in pure neutral; she can’t even give her self enough plus frames to set it up.
    Exactly, for Reina if I don't catch someone off guard I don't get the heat smash off. Almost any attack can interrupt it
    First attack of Jun's heat smash is 13f, but the second is slow. I've had the first attack sidestepped and then the second counter hit quite a lot already.

This one is what gets me. Power crush heat engagers stop aggression
Reina heat smash is 20+ frames.

Isn't it like the slowest in the game? It also whiffs if you're too close to your opponent
Reina's heat smash sucks so much I only use it for plus frames. It is nice that we have 2 heat smashes though, if only I was good enough to stance dance.
Reina's heat smash has good range but it's also the second slowest in the game.
I understand the logic behind these now on paper even if they end up being ridiculously strong in practice. One of the big strengths of power crushes in T8 compared to T7 is that they if the opponent swings into it with a fast button and recovers in time, the power crush becomes basically safe now. However; this does not apply to high power crushes, if you jab into them early like the other power crushes, you can still duck and potentially launch them. The hit stop from it actually can be it easier to duck too. So I can understand it on paper.
    But i want to pressure people with more than a fast jabs. I know about ducking and punishing if my recover time is fast, but still, there are other situations.
        That’s why I said that I get it on paper. More often than not in Tekken, you usually want to use your fast pokes than bigger moves. So having a move that’s main weakness are the moves makes sense on paper. In practice though, it ends up frustrating.
These have too much tracking rn.
For sho Jin maybe kaz but djs demon paw so stubby.
    Nah, they're all retarded moves by design.
Im getting mad just by you mentioning that freaking move!
for further reference, a 1 jab on hit is +8. at +5/6 you cannot sidestep jabs reliably. 

i remember when the move didn't have any pushback and you could just fucking spam it until it connected and you were in heat.
***MY GOODNESS***
I feel bad for people that play characters that can’t launch -14 lows, considering how good the move is (Jin d2).
    Most characters in game can’t launch a -14. But at least Kuma’s WS 14f does 35 dmg.
        This is how I feel as Lee. I at least get good damage off of WS 2,3 into ff3, and if I’m feeling adventurous, I can flip a coin to see if Heat Burst will connect or whiff after WS 2,3 (please fix this, it really feels like going to the casino every time).
        How many can? I know Raven, Jin and Kazuya (tornado launch) can. Don’t know who else.
            Lee if he hasn't used heat yet.
            Iirc only Raven jin Jun and kaz can get a full legitimate launch.

Lee and Asuka get good damage, and Lee can get a launch in some conditions.

Eddy has a ws i13 launcher, but the first hit is a high, which whiffs against crouching opponents, so it doesn't work.
            Paul as well with his b3
                why is that good
    It's good a thing that Jin can launch Jin's -14 low 👍.
    Jins d2 and evasive devil moves made me hate my favorite matchup
    King mid hopkick would like your location
    Man I hate having to punish -13 standing lows with WS4 on King, feels so whack.

Bryan can just Hatchet kick me all day with no downside.
This low is so dumb.
I was also going to mention this Dragunov move. The damage is insane. I feel bad when I get hit by this twice.
I could've launch punished this entire time?
    On Bryan? Yeah make sure to launch that dumb move.
Jin's d2 isn't that slow. It's 22 frames, it's borderline. It's not unseeable but it's bloody hard to block on reaction.
    Yeah, I meant "slow" as in "technically seeable". It's in the perfect middle ground where it's slow enough to be downplayed by Jin mains as reactable but not slow enough to be consistently reactable online.
The conversion rate of his FC 1, 4 is also really insane. HUGE momentum from the sneak 4 that follows it too, which they already nerfed. You can even sneak cancel, and mix with a grab, to get them to duck, then eventually land that heat engager.
Very true. Paul's d/f+2 narrows the hurtbox around his head area, but he's never flat-out crushing highs. A high attack with long range will most likely always hit him out of it. It's been this way for a long time.
Yeah..."some" high evasion.
>Paul's d/f+2 works the same way as every other generic d/f+2: safe on block, but doesn't launch crouchers.

Reina's df2 is - 12 on block and doesn't launch crouchers
    Reina is the only exception because she already has an electric and is the only Mishima with a launching df2
    That just means her DF2 is non-generic
    It also hits from range 2.6, that's more range than Shaheen and Claudio's hopkicks.
    Then it's not a generic d/f+2 lol. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and don't launch crouchers.
Don’t think Nina or Asuka’s does either
not all generic df2 launchers are safe on block
For example, Reina, Victor, Dragunov, Azucena have df2 launchers but theyre -12 on block
    There are 2 kinds of generic df2. The safe ones that don't launch crouchers and the unsafe ones that launch crouchers
        This. They've become traditional that way.

Something like Paul's d/f+2 being safe but not launching crouchers or high-crushing is decades old, and fine as is.
        There's still nuances. Azucena's is probably the best unsafe one. 

It actually has crouch frames in the start up to crush highs, and still launches crouchers too, so kinda benefits from the best part of Paul's one in the evasiveness. 

I think it's -13 instead of -12 as well for that privilege.
            Being -13 instead of -12 in this game is not a small disadvantage, given that there are several i13 heat engagers
            Azucena's does not have any true high crush frames. In fact, nobody's does.
    Which means.. they arent generic ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
    victor's is -14
        Oh damn, i thought it was -12. But my point still stands, not all generic df2s are safe and some launch on crouching opps
    That means they aren't generic d/f+2s. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and do not launch crouchers.
It literally does high crush now mate. I think they changed it in t8. You can pull up lab and check if you like. He goes into crouching on the display in practice for a couple of frames. Shaheen's is the same too. 

I don't know how many frames exactly but it's true crouch frames now
    That's just because you're holding d/f for a couple frame before inputting the 2. Try buffering it after another move and you'll see that their status never changes to crouching. This is something you always have to be aware of when checking a move with a d/f, d, or d/b input.

Edit: Just checked, there is not a single d/f+2 in the game with true high crush frames.
I was labbing it last night, why the hell does it have such a weird unique animation? Makes breaking it so much harder.
That Jack comment >>>>>
You might talk me into playing Jack like that, some of the most fun I had in Tekken 7 was with gigas and playing D2 db2 like the bongos. It sucked, but you could occasionally just rob rounds
Cause then her hitboxes would match the animations, and that wouldn't be acceptable.
Leo has some of the most dumb overlooked shit ever. The mid evasive high crush full screen hard hitting launcher that pushes that ass half the screen away from you on block
    This 110%. Leo does everything so well and has been top tier since T7 S4.
    Hm, I've been playing Leo recently and I can't think of which move this is.
        BOK2
        The one he crouches close to the ground advancing forward, and then launches with both hands. First part looks like a stance transition, but I often see it just being used in neutral with manual activation
Leo's df2+3 has shitty range and is linear. You don't even get the combo conversion unless it hits really close, otherwise just a followup. 

Jin's D2 is way more outrageous, really similar but twice the range and tracking. And yeah it's -14, but only 3-4 characters are gonna launch him for it.
    Jin's D2 has a very obvious animation and glow and its 1 frame slower. It's much more seeable and at higher levels of play it's almost useless. That cannot be said about Leo's df2+3. At all levels of play that is still a viable low. It's short range just means it cannot be used for engagement and closing the gap, at close range it's a terrifying low.
        So according to you, Leo's one is unreactable, but Jin's which is ONE frame slower is almost useless... despite having also a lot of tracking, while Leo's one is really linear. 
The fucking Jin downplay, as always.
            Dude.

Jin literally grows red.

He also has a VERY obvious animation. Leo's is nothing like that, for a lot of the animation he's literally just standing. See jin players in tournaments and events and count how many times they will use this attack and how many times it will get blocked.

Kazuya had a 25f ch launching low in T7 which people thought of as very reactable, now that it's 2 frames faster a lot of players are saying it's spammable as hell online and barely anyone can react to it. A single or two frame difference is all you need between a seeable low and an unseeable one.
                I agree with you in that it's reactable, but in locals. But 99% of the playerbase is playing online, and it's not reactable on an average online match. So for 99% of the playerbase, that move is just getting away with murder.
                    In Tekken 8 there's 1 frame less input delay. Meaning that reacting to a 22f low in T8 is equal to a 23f low in T7. If you play online with a 5 bar/stable 4 bar connection in T7, I at least could react to 23f and sometimes even 22f lows. Like whenever I played against a devil jin I could react to his db2(22f in T7, 21f in T8) semi consistently online. I went to a local and I could react to it even more consistently. I would say a 22f low in T8s online is still reactable if the connection is good. If you're in a 3 bar match it becomes almost impossible but other than that you're good.
                        Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
At LEAST it doesn't have the best range in the world.
Jun’s heat smash is a projectile. which means after you finish cheesing out all her moves that heal her on heat smash and have crazy priority and launch, you can end the inevitable combo with the heat smash from anywhere
u cant duck lilis reactable high?
Its only a launcher if she stepped 3x ( 2x when in heat ) while doing hypnotist stance.
    BRO WHAT??! Really???
        yep, it takes a lot of set up and mind conditioning to pull off a full 3 step hyp stance sweep ( although significantly easier while in heat ) as Xiaoyu cannot block while in hyp stance.
thats kinda the only good low she has and you have to stand there 2seconds doing nothing to get hit by it
Just electric bruh
    Right? Like, kazuya has literally the most iconic plus on block move in tekken
It is +5, but you can side step 99% of the options. People just don't want to side step, because almost every other character has extremely good tracking. Laws plus frames aren't as scary, when you realize how linear he is, even if he's plus.
    Law has some good options to counter side stepping. DSS 3, DSS throw, and transitioning into slide makes almost any ws move track. First of all it’s all about frame advantage ofc. If Law is plus 4 or 5 sure the opponent can sidestep, parry, backdash or whatever but if Law does heat smash or ws3 on block you’re not stepping anything that he’s throwing at you.
        wtf does DSS mean?
            It's a Law stance!
        Dss 3 is the only option, because it's a homing move, but it's a high. I've been side stepped so many after ws3 and heatsmash that it's mind boggling.
            Throws are homing too. And like I said when you go into slide that pretty much negates all side stepping because Law will just track when sliding. I’m just saying most people don’t want to duck Law because DSS f1 is OP. So ducking him is a huge risk it’s self it’s better to just respect Law’s plus frames.

Also there is zero chance you are getting sidestepped at +19 lol. So if someone stepped you after heat smash you’re doing something wrong
                You can 100% side step laws slide up close. When it's mid range, is when you can't side step it.

Yes, people have consistently side step me when I'm +19 after heatsmash on block.

Try it out in practice mode, you'll realize how dumb it is.
                    Wrong. Just went in practice mode. Heat smash on block is +11. It’s literally impossible to step anything thats >15 frames when you’re minus 11. I told you it’s all about frame data and you still try to tell me that you can side step after heat smash. I did Offense training, opponent actions standing block, action after blocking side walk and sidestep right. Do heat smash into f1. You will hit them with that f1 100% of the time.


You need to realize it’s only realistic to side step, back dash or parry in -3 to -6 situations. Ofc its character specific depending on move lists of parries and evasive moves but I’m telling you that when you block something that is more than +6 you probably shouldn’t try to power crush, parry, or use movement cause you will be hit. Sidestepping doesn’t just work in magical ways
                        Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
                            You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
                                You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
Whats worse is law ws3. Its plus 19 on block lol I fuck people all the time with it
You have an electric my guy. 
don’t forget that izumo mixup that can be a high heat engager, mid pushback, low hell sweep or a throw. you can basically do it the entire match and never get read
    Her heat engager in izumo is a safe mid (-6 on block). Well, mid, high, but still crouching will not save you.
    > you can basically do it the entire match and never get read

duck 1,2 then interrupt with jab.
        you can do izumo with just up 2 to try to avoid that
I think it's okay to have a throw reversal on a character. Always wanted to play a character with that, but was not a fan of Anna.




But I agree with the rest of what you say. May I also direct your attention on safe d 1+2, launcher with high crush, that is -9 on block and has no drawback in heat? 
Easier to whiff than it seems but it straight up changes the game against multiple characters. 

Reina essentially can’t Sentai unless it’s the armor move.
Its U1+2 for future reference
bro is a jin main complaining about kaz’s demon paw
    I’ll complain about Jin’s too. I used to be a hardcore Jin main in Tekken 7 and my badge of honor was that I could play Jin at a high level after 6 years of maining him. I loved that he was a complex character to play who had tools for every situation. 

In Tekken 8, he’s so dumbed down that it feels unrewarding. His demon paw was an already great move in T7, now with its phantom range it’s just bs. Oh and fking d2. D2 feels like cheating for Jin mains. We’ve never had one button moves with forward momentum. High crush, forward momentum low that ch launches and only -14. Like holy fk that’s cheap as hell. 

Before Jin mains took pride in executing his harder combos like the f4 pickup, crazy wall conversions and micro step combos. Gone are any combos resembling difficulty and any Joe brown can get a f4 pickup from max range. 

I definitely don’t like how easy he’s become with all the handicap moves he’s been given.
        i was messing around my man but i hear you and as a kaz main myself I’ll definitely say his demon paw is quite strong as well when as you said it’s factored into the mixup and that glorious double damage in heat. i will say his heat smash is garbo though, especially compared to how strong the rest of his heat is.

there’s definitely a whole lot of kaz downplaying, he’s always hard to use well but he’s very very strong in this game, just not S tier broken.

never played much jin myself, kaz and DJ are enough mishima for me, but it is unfortunate that he has been dumbed down. they definitely wanted to have a noob mishima and ended up with some very overtuned moves. also yeah the f4 pickup is hilarious honestly, I can’t even get mad at it.

hopefully they just slightly nerf those few moves so he’s still strong but there’s more room for skill expression. but honestly, a lot of room for skill expression has been removed from a lot of characters. I’ll be shocked if they go back on that design philosophy.
I think you can option select jack ff1 on block with a generic d4
You can't compare Reina to Kazuya. Reina has insane pressure while Kazuya doesn't and 2 heat smashes while Kazuya has 1.
> DJ: crazy stupid hellsweep range

Have you actually played this character or what because his hellsweep range is the lowest in the game lmfao
The nina three hit confirmable is amazing
As a kazuya main I agree his demon paw is crazy for his gameplan but its what Jins SHOULD be. Jins demon paw hits fullscreen. also Kazuyas heatsmash is bottom 5 in the game, reinas just happens to be worse
Lionheart transitions on block lose to all reasonably fast lows. It's really bad tbh
Legit. Game forces me to go into a stance where in I lose the next interaction 95% of the time. I've started having to play Steve without using some of his crucial moves that go into the stance. Which just feels like I'm playing half a character.


All they need to do is make it so the stance is optional by not holding back. 
    When the purpose of a stance is to avoid it, that’s an indicator that the stance sucks. Lionheart sucks. They need to change it so that the player wants to get in it
You can duck after f+4
The most brain dead flowchart I’ve done with Nina is do f42 until they duck and then just do the sidestep cancel and do ss2 to launch
Hellfire pretty good tho
    Until someone is in your face and you can't use it because it will just get you counter hit launched into dead lol 

Ranged heat smash is pretty cool though.
Hwoarang RFF DF3. A lot of people don't know this because most Hwoarangs online are scrubs. It's an-

 advancing low crushing homing plus on block airborne mid heat engager LOL.
    It's +1 dude. Most of the time you can just challenge it with jab or SSR and beat most of his options.
        That's if you manage to not be crushed under the pressure enough to stand for a second and actually block it. If you tried to parry sidestep or duck then boom
    That too is absurd, he already had aggresive advancing kicks he didnt need another.
Feng's B3 is good, but he'd still be really strong without it in 8
    He's never had access to such easy n big +frames, its not within his design to have + frame mids like that.

Kinda like Dragunovs new hatchet kick (DB 3+4) its not ok that he has big + on block mids and big +frame Lows
        His qcf 1+2 used to give +5 or +6 on block lol

B3 is just a replacement for the headbutt
            B3 can be used more as a general keep-out tool aswell tho.

headbutt you atleast got a hint from the qcf.
King's B3 needs the follow up damage nerfed and the armor to start like a frame later.
Its used to much because his other armored moves are kinda meh 

Shoulder tackle is absolutely horrible, its armor properties seem to start at the same fame as it starts dealing damage, plus its short range and punishable on block, same with the rising knee into jag sprint, but at least that one has better armor frames.
    Damage nerf and lock the follow-up behind CH, cuz often it doubles up as a whiff punisher unintentionally
        Sounds fair tbh.
Wouldn't Lee be the absolute least threatening char in the game without b3,3.

I don't think he needs it in terms of his identity, but look who he's up against :P
    All characters should return to their respective identity's there are OFC worse offenders than Lee im mostly mentioning his B3, 3 because I respected and revered Lee for his identity as a defensive character
Shhh bryan deserves that move
    I play Bryan too but I think its overtuned, make it slightly slower and only +3 on block, range could stay just because everybody else also has a demon paw-esq move
        I don’t see that big issue tho I haven’t been able to get more then 2 qcb1 because they ss and launch me or just duck and send me to the goddamn shadow realm *(goddamnit paul)*
            i think its a lil too good in tandem with QCB 2,4 and QCF 1+2 and 3+4 in the neutral.
                It’s all he has rn... come on that and a cool ahh wall combo
        try 0 ob lol
            Nah then leave it as is but make it only launch on CH
                um, but it launches only on CH now?
                    Isnt it like a low parry launch on normal hit?

Maybe im mistaken its like a shabby electric but with better forward range.
                        no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
                            yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
                    NVM yeah you right
    seriously it’s like all he has atp besides lots of wall damage
Lee's b3,3 is a suicide move for lee. If you block and punish you kill him
    Yeah it works on the bt3 format but in long sets, b3,  3 loses because its so fucking risky
    Still all the Lee's are comfortable throwing it out.
        Along with the slide it's our last ditch effort to open up a turtle...
        Just Duck he doesn't really have that many superscary mids from that range.

Hopkick I guess.
            His df4 gives follow-up if it hits ducking
                Or nah it was a punch IDK the input maybe DB2?
They turned Lee into another Hwo. He went from being a fundamental at it's core character into another BS one.

Agree with all the above.
Lars has one of the strongest orbitals in the game in hid uf4
?azu does not have a WR2

or you meant while rising?if thats the case every char has a while rising 2,her is the standard launcher,some other get a way better launcer
    Typo. WR3,2 or whatever the command is.
        oh ok,do you still find it oppressive?because i main azu and after the nerf i can barely use the move

not that i ever spammed the move but now i feel it's almost useless as a running attack since the knee  has no effective range
A ton of my damage comes from CH D2 or F4
Zafina has been doing that nonsense for forever too
Yeah, but she gets two, and the back turn is a low, plus they both end in back turn for a mix-up even and especially on block so I don't mind the damage, actually I didn't even realize the damage was low until I saw your comment haha
its quite stepable, in point blank step right and from range 2 you step or sidewalk left. What is truly annoying is his hatchet which will scare people into ducking at close range and iwr moves are easier in t8 so he can destroy you with a wr2
I will fight people that are really good at breaking throws and that throw they still dont break 90% of the time.
    I think its just the way that it looks, it took me to get to about fujin before i could do it somewhat consistently
        Yeah for sure the animation is cheesy asf. The one down side is that the range is very poop with that grab. Not much of a problem on T8 though lol
            Oh yeah the range is horrible, I don’t mind it being in the game. It’s just me sharing my saltiness towards it haha
Yeah this one might not be it
His snake edge, you mean? Thats about the only balanced move left in the game: nearly half a second startup time, -28 thousand on block. So, high risk and high reward.
    It’s that one move in particular. (Yes, I’m bad.)
        Well, you're at least half way there. You've identified the move that deletes your health bar and now all you have to do is go into a practice mode, order Byron to spam snake age and come up with an appropriate punish.

For me it helps to notice how his entire body goes down, with his hands and face facing the ground. A very telling key pose which you can hardly confuse with anything else. Once you see it, just hold DB, wait for him to twitch backwards after the move connects and viola!
            Should I be holding down block or down back and block? Just so I can get better instead of trying to low parry everything.
                There is no such thing as "down block" in the game. If you just hold down the lows will still hit you.

So every time you want to block a low, you always need to input (or hold) down back ↙
bro on god. you see that shit coming but can't do shit about it most of the time.
You're talking about reina's db2 not df2 i believe.
    Yeah my bad, I meant db2
Disagree. You can reliably SSL it and whiff punish it with a launcher if you are fast enough.
    No, you actually can't. Lili has the best side step in the game, and can't smooth side step it. You guys need to actually go lab it and realize mishimas weakness, isn't weak anymore.
        Bro I both constantly done it and got it done against me in ranked.
            Are you doing pewgf or regular ewgf?
                EWGF
                    Then that's why you don't see the difference.
                        I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
                            In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
                                Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
                        I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
                            You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
They can b ducked tho
    Yes, jabs can be ducked too and they are arguably the best move in any character that is not a mishima (or asuka) since you'll only get launched on a hard prediction.
TBF his heat smash is really bad. His expulsion is usually the best way to spend his heat
    His heat smash gets me sometimes.

Not sure if you’re meant to block it on reaction but I usually have to read that he’s going to do it to block.

Not sure if I’d go as far as to say it’s “imbalanced” but any low hitting heat smash seems strong to me.
        I feel like a low heat smash is a negative for a character. At the very least they can be blocked and punished.

If the character has a mid heat smash, what ends up happening a lot of times is you'll be low on health but have enough to survive 2 or 3 pokes and then the opponent will use their heat smash to skip neutral and get right in your face, deal chip damage and be in enough plus frames to do whatever mix up they want whilst you're left with 1 health left and had no way to counter it even though you knew exactly what they were about to do.
            Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
                > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
                Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
            As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
        I don’t think my main is unusually strong
    it's way better than my mains heat smash
    All the hellsweep heat smashes do like 35 damage bc they’re hellsweeps
    I used to piece people up with his heat smash. You’re Trippppppppppin
        It's not that fast, you can get hit out of the start up and it doesn't deal as much damage as a lot of other heat smashes.
Only thing going for it is that it is a low. I also think it's not safe on block but not sure on that one
            You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
            It's -15 on block, very punishable
When they said each characters heat was different I think that’s how they meant it it’s nice that he has a hellsweep heat smash and with the fact that he has explosion i doubt you’ll be blocking low
At close-ish range this move is trash. Most characters can float him from it and the loud audio cue makes it very reachable since players will know to pay attention to it when he’s in heat
Unironically a good way to use his heat LMAO, that move is STUPID
Technically they can jab float you on reaction, but with how aerial hurtboxes work.... i'd say the odds are heavily in Victor's favour.
Wait, the different inputs of expulsion have different properties?!
    U2 isn’t expulsion; it’s just a homing move to realign Victor and catch sidewalk. Unless you mean in Heat. Every character but Alisa gets some moves changed in Heat. (Alisa just gets more chip damage with Chainsaws)
as a Victor main: yes, that's the strategy. 

Victor thrives in mid range with his D2, WR2 and DB4 (last 2 are CH launchers and he will bait you into attacking to get full combo). 

When you are close range you need to be wary of:

a) 1+2 (15f CH launcher, -8 on block, your turn if you block) - careful of attacking when he's plus and he's plus basically only on hit apart from PRF 1+2 and WR2 which he won't use close range  
  
b) DB4 (don't know if it's a high crush technically but it dodges highs) which you defend against using mid-checks.
    D/b+4 is a true high crush, it has crouching status
I sometimes can sidestep right it then ewgf, but sometimes the AOE just randomly clips me, it doesn't belong in a game like tekken
“Dumb non tekken move” what is a non tekken move you you lmao. Tekken has had characters doing a bunch of random things much worse than Victors expulsion that barely fit in a fighting game like Tekken.

Tekken 5 DR had a Jinpachi that could literally pull you into him from any range nearly

There is a giant manticore snake arm monster that breathes for in a left to right motion, that if I recall is unblockable as well so you have to be further back (or just grab him at start)

Unknown existed…
    People either forget these things or are too young to remember and are just parroting what they heard
    Yeah I’ve never been able to understand “This isn’t Tekken” or “This doesn’t follow the rules of Tekken.” I feel like the game has pretty much formed its identity around breaking its own rules haha
    been playing since tekken 2 and those are some one offs that no one took seriously. jinpachi was unplayable, orge was the same and nerfed for vs. Gon and Dr. B were joke characters too.

but we’re expected to take Victor seriously with disappearing every 3 seconds, a gun, expulsion etc etc
        Jinpachi was literally playable except in the Ps2 version… in arcades and dark resurrection he was playable.

Your arguments against Victor are the same complaints people have about Yoshimitsu in T7 when he could teleport and move like tinker bell high off her own dust at higher level play, just Victor has a ranged attack.
they forgot to make you truly invincible during this move
I just labbed this a lot when Vic do this I always try to float him for free combo. You can consistently do this if you train.
    Yeah but this was happening in yellow ranks where I know people didn't lab it lol
some here would say that you "sidestepped wrong side" or you "expanded your hurtbox"
    I actually have the clip still it’s on my profile 😂 you’ll see me laying on the ground contemplating whether I should quit or stay
        [https://streamable.com/0fb3od](https://streamable.com/0fb3od)

I clipped one earlier today and felt super cool
            Well deserved
you can break that mid-air with 1+2
    Ty. I fight for my life when facing Lars while the man’s fighting like he’s coked up while binge watching the last season of naruto shippuden.
        don't press after DEN3 hits (+5) but it can be interrupted by any quick move before it does (e.g. when he's in dynamic entry before the kick just jab him)

stance pressure is fake and Lars cannot block in any stance so if he's moving around doing a madness again just jab him

1+2 break for monkey flip

monkey flip can be interrupted as he's going in the air

g clef is -12

db1, 3 string can be ducked on both hits to punish

his hellsweep is like -infinity i forgot exact numbers but legit any punish works if you duck it

1, 4 is -12
            Tyyyy🙏😭
    Am I a ding dong? I thought 1+2 didn't break throw anymore. Or have I been super misunderstanding and that it doesn't break every throw anymore
        just to clarify breaking the Lars throw. you still have to break with 1+2 during the appropriate frame window, not just mid-air

1 or 2 breaks all generic throws

1, 2, or 1+2 breaks command throws, but you have to watch their hands

1 break if they lead with their left arm

2 break if they lead with their right arm

1+2 break if they lead with both arms

Some throws are tricky though, like the Lars that we’re talking about (i found that out accidentally). All back-turned throws are a mixup so it’s either 1+2, 1, 2, or generic throw break. Ling’s Waning Moon is 1+2 even though it looks like she’s grabbing you with 1 arm.
            Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
        1+2 didn’t break every throw in tekken 7…not sure about earlier, but command throws have been 1, 2, or 1+2 for a very long time. Lars’ jumping throw is 1+2, but I struggle to break it too despite that knowledge
That’s not a launching throw
I hate how absurd some moves have gotten. Lars air throw was niche before, but now it's borderline OP. It's a homing attack throw that catches airborne opponents. Special throws are different from basic throws becasue they can't be reversed by throw parrys from Anna/Jun. These are basically any throw that isnt done with the arms. This is applies to Alisas head bomb throw, Eddy's foot throw, bears mouth grab from bear stance. 


There are exceptions to this though since kunimitsu and law have leg throws but can still be reversed.
UsuallyThey were either balanced by being stance locked, but now what's keeping them in check? Eating a homing 50/50 with little to no counter play is NOT fun.
Because you can break them on reaction, that's the logic. You need to react fast though.
    Some throw breaks don't follow the typical throw break window logic and it's insanely annoying
    But you can break every throw on reaction. So why do only some characters get launching throws? (And often the characters who are already top tier without them)
        Because some characters doing different things is what makes the game interesting
            Yeah, i don't understand why people don't get this shit. Exactly why for honor went down the shitter.
                \^this 

so much this

I miss old Shinobi
                    Even I miss the quad-dashing
        Also, Xiaoyu's new launching throw can be done without the grab tech animation being seeable. From backturned, doing f2+3 (launching throw) and generic grab have the same animation.
            Those take like 30+ frames to come out, you can dickjab her on reaction
        you cannot reaction break every throw. There are multiple throws in this game that have misleading animations that make you guess. For example, Feng’s 2 throws from back turn have the same animation so you have to guess. Same for a bunch of king throws.
            I'm aware of throws like that; King's Giant swing is another misleading throw, for example, and there are unbreakable throws such as Reina's stance throws. Lazy wording on my part, but you get the sentiment I was going for.
        Parries, power crushes, counter hit throws. The fact that some character just get to launch punish power crushes because their throw allows it is pretty unfair balance wise
    But moves that typically launch you but you can counter on reaction (ie snake edges) are punishable

Throws are completely safe and on break just resets back to neutral with pushback. You don't even get a real frame advantage (because of pushback)

And now it's also homing and unreactable if it was a CH throw 

So launching throw becomes virtually 0 risk for full launcher reward
        Dude, there are a lot of moves that launch that are safe.  

snake edges arent comperable to throws!!
            Name a single homing 11f launching move that's safe that isn't also a throw
                Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

Ewgf is  launching, plus on block
Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

Even if people cant right now, it is still very possible.

Even a trash player like me can do it, so i know what I am saying to be true.
                    >Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

not really interested in that goal, let me start over: 

my main point is that homing throws are already stupidly broken, the fact that a 11f homing launching throw still gives the defender nothing for breaking it is absurd because no other move in the game has such a stupidly high reward with virtually zero risk since it cannot be stepped and cannot be punished upon successfully defending it

>Ewgf is launching, plus on block Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

Ewgf is not homing, comes out much slower than 11f especially considering the crouch dash input, and also the speed dependent on execution, it's not comparable at all

>And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
The “IM A DRAGON” or the launching throw?
    The throw that launches with a knee. I know the break but just can’t react in time.
    ff3+4 (1+2 break)
    i always get hit my the im a dragon throw, how do you break it?
        with 1 or duck
I hate the one where he grabs you with his foot. It has such a weird animation that I can’t see it in time usually.
I had to lab and drill it to avoid getting hammered by this throw that gives her 60+ damage as a reward. The giveaway is to always be ready to 1+2 break whenever she's crouching. Like even if the Jun player ducked one of your highs and could have launched you with a hopkick... they probably only randomly crouched because they wanted to spam this throw anyway.
I just learned the other day that this is a thing and have been testing people with it, usually landing it after heat engage. The only thing good about it design wise is that the timing to get the pickup is very tight, but once you get it it's definitely cheap af.

I also learned from this thread that there are a few other launching throws so at least the Lings aren't alone.

        Xiaoyu is a weird thing to complain about. She has no poke only combos, one mix, no 50/50 game, and one launching throw that’s really forgiving throw break wise
            [deleted]
                Average Bryan player
                I get launched all the time in AOP. Complaining about getting ducked sounds like a skills issue, not a character issue. The only time I use AOP is when I’m getting mashed on. Besides, it’s always been her thing lol it’s not even new to Tekken 8. It’s not like Bryan can’t just kick her in the face lol
Might as well make Jin's -15 as well with the distance it pushes you and gives you a free wall combo on top of the 50+ dmg you just got. 
tekken players when there’s a 50/50 and they have to guess except one of the options is completely reactable 😱😱😱😱 (that is basically what fighting games boil down to)
    The thing is not that there is counterplay, but his Heat Smash is by fucking lightyears the best in the game, maybe only rivaled by Jun. Cut the damage in half and it would still be fine.
and if you duck to avoid the RKO, you get a knee to the face

There is really no winning against it
    RKO is a 23 frame windup (0.36s) and the tracking knee is also pretty slow. Your best best against jag sprint would be playing neutral and crouching RKO on reaction. 

He also has the low dropkick, but it doesnt do as much damage, and since you're both on the floor, it pretty much resets you back to neutral.

Tips from a King main
        My brother in christ, the fact you omit is that King can block while sprinting at you full speed. I get that you're giving context and tips, but let us vent about that stupid and pretty much free mixup
            Fair enough brother. I dont like other characters who also get a mixup chance off block.
        I’ve had a lot of success just jabbing jaguars sprint
            Most Kings commit the jag sprint and 3/4 of the options are jab punishable.
            King main. Yes…jabs work (not in heat though) unless it’s one of the kicks. But I’ve been poked out of sprint plenty of times
        23 frames with all the particle bullshit is essentially impossible to duck on reaction. Ur making the read between getting RKOd or getting opened up by the knee for a full combo. The low drop kick also gives king oke. I appreciate the advice but kings entire heat system is bullshit designed to force 50/50s
            That first point is just raw skill issue, the entire animation is King slowly widely reaching out with both of his arms. The mid kick only combos when you're against a wall.

Also, like 3/4 heat smashes lead into stance on block, its not a King-only thing.
                king is the single most hated character despite there being multiple much stronger characters, just let reddit be....
    The RKO is reactable though. 
yeah it almost  makes uselsess to use it on a heat dash,even if you fail you still get a 50/50
Every long range heat smash needs to be nerfed.

And every heat smash should be steppable

And using a heat smash should sacrifice the ability to use rage
    true, in fact make heat smash do a jab that deals 5 extra dmg, that'll do it
hardly matters since he goes into stance after the smash,if he was negative he would gain nothing from using it,just nerf the damage to jin level damage
You can rage art or launch on reaction, huge gap.
I wrote one a few months ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/s6tbTuvlql
    lol

A+ 'highly recommended'
    “I did, so don’t have to!” Thank you good sir
It not about being punishable. Its too fast , has ridiculous reach and can't be stepped.
    My feng matchup knowledge is t7 based, but 

feng's mids that arent very punishable dont have a lot of range.the mids that do have range are very punishable, like shoulder, f3,4 for example 

So If you keep a range 2 distance you will keep the safe mids at bay, and you can fish for very punishable things.

Its Fun to see feng players meltdown when you bloco and punish them very hard every time they take risks.
        Yeah, that would be a viable strategy if he didn't have literally the best range 0-1 poking in the game coupled with high crushing entry tools and qcf into ws1, still having full screen range.
I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR THINKING THIS 😭 Glad I’m not the only one who noticed
and now DVJ shares that same jab,but tbh that jab has been useless since like tekken3
    Nah dj had a pretty strong jab in T7. I think range wise only really lost to dragunovs jab and heihachis buffed jab, as well as larger characters like Jack 8, gigas, marduk.

But the benefit being that despite having less range than heihachi jabs, the animation gave DJ momentum as he would step forward to follow the opponent backdashing, heihachis jabs would push the opponent back with each consecutive hit.

And being a shorter character means his jabs are less susceptible to high evasion, which was what made mishimas somewhat of a good matchup against marduk because wavu could reliably crush his jabs.
        this is correct, i'm saying now DJ has a more bryan esque jab when he used to have a great one
            Oh my b, I thought you were referring to DJ when you made the tekken 3 claim.
Bryan has notoriously had a bad jab. i feel for you
B3 is something you need to use from a distance. Theoretically you could get a really fast electric out of it, but the backwards movement kills its range, and you can’t block in it. I’ve really only managed to use it for the 4 heat engager. Decent range, but it’s really only good as a knowledge check.
Exactly, for Reina if I don't catch someone off guard I don't get the heat smash off. Almost any attack can interrupt it
First attack of Jun's heat smash is 13f, but the second is slow. I've had the first attack sidestepped and then the second counter hit quite a lot already.
But i want to pressure people with more than a fast jabs. I know about ducking and punishing if my recover time is fast, but still, there are other situations.
    That’s why I said that I get it on paper. More often than not in Tekken, you usually want to use your fast pokes than bigger moves. So having a move that’s main weakness are the moves makes sense on paper. In practice though, it ends up frustrating.
Nah, they're all retarded moves by design.
Most characters in game can’t launch a -14. But at least Kuma’s WS 14f does 35 dmg.
    This is how I feel as Lee. I at least get good damage off of WS 2,3 into ff3, and if I’m feeling adventurous, I can flip a coin to see if Heat Burst will connect or whiff after WS 2,3 (please fix this, it really feels like going to the casino every time).
    How many can? I know Raven, Jin and Kazuya (tornado launch) can. Don’t know who else.
        Lee if he hasn't used heat yet.
        Iirc only Raven jin Jun and kaz can get a full legitimate launch.

Lee and Asuka get good damage, and Lee can get a launch in some conditions.

Eddy has a ws i13 launcher, but the first hit is a high, which whiffs against crouching opponents, so it doesn't work.
        Paul as well with his b3
            why is that good
It's good a thing that Jin can launch Jin's -14 low 👍.
Jins d2 and evasive devil moves made me hate my favorite matchup
King mid hopkick would like your location
Man I hate having to punish -13 standing lows with WS4 on King, feels so whack.

Bryan can just Hatchet kick me all day with no downside.
On Bryan? Yeah make sure to launch that dumb move.
Yeah, I meant "slow" as in "technically seeable". It's in the perfect middle ground where it's slow enough to be downplayed by Jin mains as reactable but not slow enough to be consistently reactable online.
Reina is the only exception because she already has an electric and is the only Mishima with a launching df2
That just means her DF2 is non-generic
It also hits from range 2.6, that's more range than Shaheen and Claudio's hopkicks.
Then it's not a generic d/f+2 lol. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and don't launch crouchers.
There are 2 kinds of generic df2. The safe ones that don't launch crouchers and the unsafe ones that launch crouchers
    This. They've become traditional that way.

Something like Paul's d/f+2 being safe but not launching crouchers or high-crushing is decades old, and fine as is.
    There's still nuances. Azucena's is probably the best unsafe one. 

It actually has crouch frames in the start up to crush highs, and still launches crouchers too, so kinda benefits from the best part of Paul's one in the evasiveness. 

I think it's -13 instead of -12 as well for that privilege.
        Being -13 instead of -12 in this game is not a small disadvantage, given that there are several i13 heat engagers
        Azucena's does not have any true high crush frames. In fact, nobody's does.
Which means.. they arent generic ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
victor's is -14
    Oh damn, i thought it was -12. But my point still stands, not all generic df2s are safe and some launch on crouching opps
That means they aren't generic d/f+2s. That term specifically refers to d/f+2s that are safe on block and do not launch crouchers.
That's just because you're holding d/f for a couple frame before inputting the 2. Try buffering it after another move and you'll see that their status never changes to crouching. This is something you always have to be aware of when checking a move with a d/f, d, or d/b input.

Edit: Just checked, there is not a single d/f+2 in the game with true high crush frames.
This 110%. Leo does everything so well and has been top tier since T7 S4.
Hm, I've been playing Leo recently and I can't think of which move this is.
    BOK2
    The one he crouches close to the ground advancing forward, and then launches with both hands. First part looks like a stance transition, but I often see it just being used in neutral with manual activation
Jin's D2 has a very obvious animation and glow and its 1 frame slower. It's much more seeable and at higher levels of play it's almost useless. That cannot be said about Leo's df2+3. At all levels of play that is still a viable low. It's short range just means it cannot be used for engagement and closing the gap, at close range it's a terrifying low.
    So according to you, Leo's one is unreactable, but Jin's which is ONE frame slower is almost useless... despite having also a lot of tracking, while Leo's one is really linear. 
The fucking Jin downplay, as always.
        Dude.

Jin literally grows red.

He also has a VERY obvious animation. Leo's is nothing like that, for a lot of the animation he's literally just standing. See jin players in tournaments and events and count how many times they will use this attack and how many times it will get blocked.

Kazuya had a 25f ch launching low in T7 which people thought of as very reactable, now that it's 2 frames faster a lot of players are saying it's spammable as hell online and barely anyone can react to it. A single or two frame difference is all you need between a seeable low and an unseeable one.
            I agree with you in that it's reactable, but in locals. But 99% of the playerbase is playing online, and it's not reactable on an average online match. So for 99% of the playerbase, that move is just getting away with murder.
                In Tekken 8 there's 1 frame less input delay. Meaning that reacting to a 22f low in T8 is equal to a 23f low in T7. If you play online with a 5 bar/stable 4 bar connection in T7, I at least could react to 23f and sometimes even 22f lows. Like whenever I played against a devil jin I could react to his db2(22f in T7, 21f in T8) semi consistently online. I went to a local and I could react to it even more consistently. I would say a 22f low in T8s online is still reactable if the connection is good. If you're in a 3 bar match it becomes almost impossible but other than that you're good.
                    Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
BRO WHAT??! Really???
    yep, it takes a lot of set up and mind conditioning to pull off a full 3 step hyp stance sweep ( although significantly easier while in heat ) as Xiaoyu cannot block while in hyp stance.
Right? Like, kazuya has literally the most iconic plus on block move in tekken
Law has some good options to counter side stepping. DSS 3, DSS throw, and transitioning into slide makes almost any ws move track. First of all it’s all about frame advantage ofc. If Law is plus 4 or 5 sure the opponent can sidestep, parry, backdash or whatever but if Law does heat smash or ws3 on block you’re not stepping anything that he’s throwing at you.
    wtf does DSS mean?
        It's a Law stance!
    Dss 3 is the only option, because it's a homing move, but it's a high. I've been side stepped so many after ws3 and heatsmash that it's mind boggling.
        Throws are homing too. And like I said when you go into slide that pretty much negates all side stepping because Law will just track when sliding. I’m just saying most people don’t want to duck Law because DSS f1 is OP. So ducking him is a huge risk it’s self it’s better to just respect Law’s plus frames.

Also there is zero chance you are getting sidestepped at +19 lol. So if someone stepped you after heat smash you’re doing something wrong
            You can 100% side step laws slide up close. When it's mid range, is when you can't side step it.

Yes, people have consistently side step me when I'm +19 after heatsmash on block.

Try it out in practice mode, you'll realize how dumb it is.
                Wrong. Just went in practice mode. Heat smash on block is +11. It’s literally impossible to step anything thats >15 frames when you’re minus 11. I told you it’s all about frame data and you still try to tell me that you can side step after heat smash. I did Offense training, opponent actions standing block, action after blocking side walk and sidestep right. Do heat smash into f1. You will hit them with that f1 100% of the time.


You need to realize it’s only realistic to side step, back dash or parry in -3 to -6 situations. Ofc its character specific depending on move lists of parries and evasive moves but I’m telling you that when you block something that is more than +6 you probably shouldn’t try to power crush, parry, or use movement cause you will be hit. Sidestepping doesn’t just work in magical ways
                    Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
                        You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
                            You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
Her heat engager in izumo is a safe mid (-6 on block). Well, mid, high, but still crouching will not save you.
> you can basically do it the entire match and never get read

duck 1,2 then interrupt with jab.
    you can do izumo with just up 2 to try to avoid that
I’ll complain about Jin’s too. I used to be a hardcore Jin main in Tekken 7 and my badge of honor was that I could play Jin at a high level after 6 years of maining him. I loved that he was a complex character to play who had tools for every situation. 

In Tekken 8, he’s so dumbed down that it feels unrewarding. His demon paw was an already great move in T7, now with its phantom range it’s just bs. Oh and fking d2. D2 feels like cheating for Jin mains. We’ve never had one button moves with forward momentum. High crush, forward momentum low that ch launches and only -14. Like holy fk that’s cheap as hell. 

Before Jin mains took pride in executing his harder combos like the f4 pickup, crazy wall conversions and micro step combos. Gone are any combos resembling difficulty and any Joe brown can get a f4 pickup from max range. 

I definitely don’t like how easy he’s become with all the handicap moves he’s been given.
    i was messing around my man but i hear you and as a kaz main myself I’ll definitely say his demon paw is quite strong as well when as you said it’s factored into the mixup and that glorious double damage in heat. i will say his heat smash is garbo though, especially compared to how strong the rest of his heat is.

there’s definitely a whole lot of kaz downplaying, he’s always hard to use well but he’s very very strong in this game, just not S tier broken.

never played much jin myself, kaz and DJ are enough mishima for me, but it is unfortunate that he has been dumbed down. they definitely wanted to have a noob mishima and ended up with some very overtuned moves. also yeah the f4 pickup is hilarious honestly, I can’t even get mad at it.

hopefully they just slightly nerf those few moves so he’s still strong but there’s more room for skill expression. but honestly, a lot of room for skill expression has been removed from a lot of characters. I’ll be shocked if they go back on that design philosophy.
When the purpose of a stance is to avoid it, that’s an indicator that the stance sucks. Lionheart sucks. They need to change it so that the player wants to get in it
Until someone is in your face and you can't use it because it will just get you counter hit launched into dead lol 

Ranged heat smash is pretty cool though.
It's +1 dude. Most of the time you can just challenge it with jab or SSR and beat most of his options.
    That's if you manage to not be crushed under the pressure enough to stand for a second and actually block it. If you tried to parry sidestep or duck then boom
That too is absurd, he already had aggresive advancing kicks he didnt need another.
He's never had access to such easy n big +frames, its not within his design to have + frame mids like that.

Kinda like Dragunovs new hatchet kick (DB 3+4) its not ok that he has big + on block mids and big +frame Lows
    His qcf 1+2 used to give +5 or +6 on block lol

B3 is just a replacement for the headbutt
        B3 can be used more as a general keep-out tool aswell tho.

headbutt you atleast got a hint from the qcf.
Damage nerf and lock the follow-up behind CH, cuz often it doubles up as a whiff punisher unintentionally
    Sounds fair tbh.
All characters should return to their respective identity's there are OFC worse offenders than Lee im mostly mentioning his B3, 3 because I respected and revered Lee for his identity as a defensive character
I play Bryan too but I think its overtuned, make it slightly slower and only +3 on block, range could stay just because everybody else also has a demon paw-esq move
    I don’t see that big issue tho I haven’t been able to get more then 2 qcb1 because they ss and launch me or just duck and send me to the goddamn shadow realm *(goddamnit paul)*
        i think its a lil too good in tandem with QCB 2,4 and QCF 1+2 and 3+4 in the neutral.
            It’s all he has rn... come on that and a cool ahh wall combo
    try 0 ob lol
        Nah then leave it as is but make it only launch on CH
            um, but it launches only on CH now?
                Isnt it like a low parry launch on normal hit?

Maybe im mistaken its like a shabby electric but with better forward range.
                    no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
                        yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
                NVM yeah you right
seriously it’s like all he has atp besides lots of wall damage
Yeah it works on the bt3 format but in long sets, b3,  3 loses because its so fucking risky
Still all the Lee's are comfortable throwing it out.
    Along with the slide it's our last ditch effort to open up a turtle...
    Just Duck he doesn't really have that many superscary mids from that range.

Hopkick I guess.
        His df4 gives follow-up if it hits ducking
            Or nah it was a punch IDK the input maybe DB2?
Typo. WR3,2 or whatever the command is.
    oh ok,do you still find it oppressive?because i main azu and after the nerf i can barely use the move

not that i ever spammed the move but now i feel it's almost useless as a running attack since the knee  has no effective range
I think its just the way that it looks, it took me to get to about fujin before i could do it somewhat consistently
    Yeah for sure the animation is cheesy asf. The one down side is that the range is very poop with that grab. Not much of a problem on T8 though lol
        Oh yeah the range is horrible, I don’t mind it being in the game. It’s just me sharing my saltiness towards it haha
It’s that one move in particular. (Yes, I’m bad.)
    Well, you're at least half way there. You've identified the move that deletes your health bar and now all you have to do is go into a practice mode, order Byron to spam snake age and come up with an appropriate punish.

For me it helps to notice how his entire body goes down, with his hands and face facing the ground. A very telling key pose which you can hardly confuse with anything else. Once you see it, just hold DB, wait for him to twitch backwards after the move connects and viola!
        Should I be holding down block or down back and block? Just so I can get better instead of trying to low parry everything.
            There is no such thing as "down block" in the game. If you just hold down the lows will still hit you.

So every time you want to block a low, you always need to input (or hold) down back ↙
Yeah my bad, I meant db2
No, you actually can't. Lili has the best side step in the game, and can't smooth side step it. You guys need to actually go lab it and realize mishimas weakness, isn't weak anymore.
    Bro I both constantly done it and got it done against me in ranked.
        Are you doing pewgf or regular ewgf?
            EWGF
                Then that's why you don't see the difference.
                    I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
                        In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
                            Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
                    I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
                        You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
Yes, jabs can be ducked too and they are arguably the best move in any character that is not a mishima (or asuka) since you'll only get launched on a hard prediction.
His heat smash gets me sometimes.

Not sure if you’re meant to block it on reaction but I usually have to read that he’s going to do it to block.

Not sure if I’d go as far as to say it’s “imbalanced” but any low hitting heat smash seems strong to me.
    I feel like a low heat smash is a negative for a character. At the very least they can be blocked and punished.

If the character has a mid heat smash, what ends up happening a lot of times is you'll be low on health but have enough to survive 2 or 3 pokes and then the opponent will use their heat smash to skip neutral and get right in your face, deal chip damage and be in enough plus frames to do whatever mix up they want whilst you're left with 1 health left and had no way to counter it even though you knew exactly what they were about to do.
        Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
            > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
            Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
        As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
    I don’t think my main is unusually strong
it's way better than my mains heat smash
All the hellsweep heat smashes do like 35 damage bc they’re hellsweeps
I used to piece people up with his heat smash. You’re Trippppppppppin
    It's not that fast, you can get hit out of the start up and it doesn't deal as much damage as a lot of other heat smashes.
Only thing going for it is that it is a low. I also think it's not safe on block but not sure on that one
        You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
        It's -15 on block, very punishable
U2 isn’t expulsion; it’s just a homing move to realign Victor and catch sidewalk. Unless you mean in Heat. Every character but Alisa gets some moves changed in Heat. (Alisa just gets more chip damage with Chainsaws)
D/b+4 is a true high crush, it has crouching status
People either forget these things or are too young to remember and are just parroting what they heard
Yeah I’ve never been able to understand “This isn’t Tekken” or “This doesn’t follow the rules of Tekken.” I feel like the game has pretty much formed its identity around breaking its own rules haha
been playing since tekken 2 and those are some one offs that no one took seriously. jinpachi was unplayable, orge was the same and nerfed for vs. Gon and Dr. B were joke characters too.

but we’re expected to take Victor seriously with disappearing every 3 seconds, a gun, expulsion etc etc
    Jinpachi was literally playable except in the Ps2 version… in arcades and dark resurrection he was playable.

Your arguments against Victor are the same complaints people have about Yoshimitsu in T7 when he could teleport and move like tinker bell high off her own dust at higher level play, just Victor has a ranged attack.
Yeah but this was happening in yellow ranks where I know people didn't lab it lol
I actually have the clip still it’s on my profile 😂 you’ll see me laying on the ground contemplating whether I should quit or stay

I clipped one earlier today and felt super cool
        Well deserved
Ty. I fight for my life when facing Lars while the man’s fighting like he’s coked up while binge watching the last season of naruto shippuden.
    don't press after DEN3 hits (+5) but it can be interrupted by any quick move before it does (e.g. when he's in dynamic entry before the kick just jab him)

stance pressure is fake and Lars cannot block in any stance so if he's moving around doing a madness again just jab him

1+2 break for monkey flip

monkey flip can be interrupted as he's going in the air

g clef is -12

db1, 3 string can be ducked on both hits to punish

his hellsweep is like -infinity i forgot exact numbers but legit any punish works if you duck it

1, 4 is -12
        Tyyyy🙏😭
Am I a ding dong? I thought 1+2 didn't break throw anymore. Or have I been super misunderstanding and that it doesn't break every throw anymore
    just to clarify breaking the Lars throw. you still have to break with 1+2 during the appropriate frame window, not just mid-air

1 or 2 breaks all generic throws

1, 2, or 1+2 breaks command throws, but you have to watch their hands

1 break if they lead with their left arm

2 break if they lead with their right arm

1+2 break if they lead with both arms

Some throws are tricky though, like the Lars that we’re talking about (i found that out accidentally). All back-turned throws are a mixup so it’s either 1+2, 1, 2, or generic throw break. Ling’s Waning Moon is 1+2 even though it looks like she’s grabbing you with 1 arm.
        Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
    1+2 didn’t break every throw in tekken 7…not sure about earlier, but command throws have been 1, 2, or 1+2 for a very long time. Lars’ jumping throw is 1+2, but I struggle to break it too despite that knowledge
Some throw breaks don't follow the typical throw break window logic and it's insanely annoying
But you can break every throw on reaction. So why do only some characters get launching throws? (And often the characters who are already top tier without them)
    Because some characters doing different things is what makes the game interesting
        Yeah, i don't understand why people don't get this shit. Exactly why for honor went down the shitter.
            \^this 

so much this

I miss old Shinobi
                Even I miss the quad-dashing
    Also, Xiaoyu's new launching throw can be done without the grab tech animation being seeable. From backturned, doing f2+3 (launching throw) and generic grab have the same animation.
        Those take like 30+ frames to come out, you can dickjab her on reaction
    you cannot reaction break every throw. There are multiple throws in this game that have misleading animations that make you guess. For example, Feng’s 2 throws from back turn have the same animation so you have to guess. Same for a bunch of king throws.
        I'm aware of throws like that; King's Giant swing is another misleading throw, for example, and there are unbreakable throws such as Reina's stance throws. Lazy wording on my part, but you get the sentiment I was going for.
    Parries, power crushes, counter hit throws. The fact that some character just get to launch punish power crushes because their throw allows it is pretty unfair balance wise
But moves that typically launch you but you can counter on reaction (ie snake edges) are punishable

Throws are completely safe and on break just resets back to neutral with pushback. You don't even get a real frame advantage (because of pushback)

And now it's also homing and unreactable if it was a CH throw 

So launching throw becomes virtually 0 risk for full launcher reward
    Dude, there are a lot of moves that launch that are safe.  

snake edges arent comperable to throws!!
        Name a single homing 11f launching move that's safe that isn't also a throw
            Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

Ewgf is  launching, plus on block
Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

Even if people cant right now, it is still very possible.

Even a trash player like me can do it, so i know what I am saying to be true.
                >Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

not really interested in that goal, let me start over: 

my main point is that homing throws are already stupidly broken, the fact that a 11f homing launching throw still gives the defender nothing for breaking it is absurd because no other move in the game has such a stupidly high reward with virtually zero risk since it cannot be stepped and cannot be punished upon successfully defending it

>Ewgf is launching, plus on block Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

Ewgf is not homing, comes out much slower than 11f especially considering the crouch dash input, and also the speed dependent on execution, it's not comparable at all

>And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
The throw that launches with a knee. I know the break but just can’t react in time.
ff3+4 (1+2 break)
i always get hit my the im a dragon throw, how do you break it?
    with 1 or duck
[deleted]
    Xiaoyu is a weird thing to complain about. She has no poke only combos, one mix, no 50/50 game, and one launching throw that’s really forgiving throw break wise
        [deleted]
            Average Bryan player
            I get launched all the time in AOP. Complaining about getting ducked sounds like a skills issue, not a character issue. The only time I use AOP is when I’m getting mashed on. Besides, it’s always been her thing lol it’s not even new to Tekken 8. It’s not like Bryan can’t just kick her in the face lol
The thing is not that there is counterplay, but his Heat Smash is by fucking lightyears the best in the game, maybe only rivaled by Jun. Cut the damage in half and it would still be fine.
RKO is a 23 frame windup (0.36s) and the tracking knee is also pretty slow. Your best best against jag sprint would be playing neutral and crouching RKO on reaction. 

He also has the low dropkick, but it doesnt do as much damage, and since you're both on the floor, it pretty much resets you back to neutral.

Tips from a King main
    My brother in christ, the fact you omit is that King can block while sprinting at you full speed. I get that you're giving context and tips, but let us vent about that stupid and pretty much free mixup
        Fair enough brother. I dont like other characters who also get a mixup chance off block.
    I’ve had a lot of success just jabbing jaguars sprint
        Most Kings commit the jag sprint and 3/4 of the options are jab punishable.
        King main. Yes…jabs work (not in heat though) unless it’s one of the kicks. But I’ve been poked out of sprint plenty of times
    23 frames with all the particle bullshit is essentially impossible to duck on reaction. Ur making the read between getting RKOd or getting opened up by the knee for a full combo. The low drop kick also gives king oke. I appreciate the advice but kings entire heat system is bullshit designed to force 50/50s
        That first point is just raw skill issue, the entire animation is King slowly widely reaching out with both of his arms. The mid kick only combos when you're against a wall.

Also, like 3/4 heat smashes lead into stance on block, its not a King-only thing.
            king is the single most hated character despite there being multiple much stronger characters, just let reddit be....
The RKO is reactable though. 
true, in fact make heat smash do a jab that deals 5 extra dmg, that'll do it
lol

A+ 'highly recommended'
“I did, so don’t have to!” Thank you good sir
My feng matchup knowledge is t7 based, but 

feng's mids that arent very punishable dont have a lot of range.the mids that do have range are very punishable, like shoulder, f3,4 for example 

So If you keep a range 2 distance you will keep the safe mids at bay, and you can fish for very punishable things.

Its Fun to see feng players meltdown when you bloco and punish them very hard every time they take risks.
    Yeah, that would be a viable strategy if he didn't have literally the best range 0-1 poking in the game coupled with high crushing entry tools and qcf into ws1, still having full screen range.
Nah dj had a pretty strong jab in T7. I think range wise only really lost to dragunovs jab and heihachis buffed jab, as well as larger characters like Jack 8, gigas, marduk.

But the benefit being that despite having less range than heihachi jabs, the animation gave DJ momentum as he would step forward to follow the opponent backdashing, heihachis jabs would push the opponent back with each consecutive hit.

And being a shorter character means his jabs are less susceptible to high evasion, which was what made mishimas somewhat of a good matchup against marduk because wavu could reliably crush his jabs.
    this is correct, i'm saying now DJ has a more bryan esque jab when he used to have a great one
        Oh my b, I thought you were referring to DJ when you made the tekken 3 claim.
That’s why I said that I get it on paper. More often than not in Tekken, you usually want to use your fast pokes than bigger moves. So having a move that’s main weakness are the moves makes sense on paper. In practice though, it ends up frustrating.
This is how I feel as Lee. I at least get good damage off of WS 2,3 into ff3, and if I’m feeling adventurous, I can flip a coin to see if Heat Burst will connect or whiff after WS 2,3 (please fix this, it really feels like going to the casino every time).
How many can? I know Raven, Jin and Kazuya (tornado launch) can. Don’t know who else.
    Lee if he hasn't used heat yet.
    Iirc only Raven jin Jun and kaz can get a full legitimate launch.

Lee and Asuka get good damage, and Lee can get a launch in some conditions.

Eddy has a ws i13 launcher, but the first hit is a high, which whiffs against crouching opponents, so it doesn't work.
    Paul as well with his b3
        why is that good
This. They've become traditional that way.

Something like Paul's d/f+2 being safe but not launching crouchers or high-crushing is decades old, and fine as is.
There's still nuances. Azucena's is probably the best unsafe one. 

It actually has crouch frames in the start up to crush highs, and still launches crouchers too, so kinda benefits from the best part of Paul's one in the evasiveness. 

I think it's -13 instead of -12 as well for that privilege.
    Being -13 instead of -12 in this game is not a small disadvantage, given that there are several i13 heat engagers
    Azucena's does not have any true high crush frames. In fact, nobody's does.
Oh damn, i thought it was -12. But my point still stands, not all generic df2s are safe and some launch on crouching opps
BOK2
The one he crouches close to the ground advancing forward, and then launches with both hands. First part looks like a stance transition, but I often see it just being used in neutral with manual activation
So according to you, Leo's one is unreactable, but Jin's which is ONE frame slower is almost useless... despite having also a lot of tracking, while Leo's one is really linear. 
The fucking Jin downplay, as always.
    Dude.

Jin literally grows red.

He also has a VERY obvious animation. Leo's is nothing like that, for a lot of the animation he's literally just standing. See jin players in tournaments and events and count how many times they will use this attack and how many times it will get blocked.

Kazuya had a 25f ch launching low in T7 which people thought of as very reactable, now that it's 2 frames faster a lot of players are saying it's spammable as hell online and barely anyone can react to it. A single or two frame difference is all you need between a seeable low and an unseeable one.
        I agree with you in that it's reactable, but in locals. But 99% of the playerbase is playing online, and it's not reactable on an average online match. So for 99% of the playerbase, that move is just getting away with murder.
            In Tekken 8 there's 1 frame less input delay. Meaning that reacting to a 22f low in T8 is equal to a 23f low in T7. If you play online with a 5 bar/stable 4 bar connection in T7, I at least could react to 23f and sometimes even 22f lows. Like whenever I played against a devil jin I could react to his db2(22f in T7, 21f in T8) semi consistently online. I went to a local and I could react to it even more consistently. I would say a 22f low in T8s online is still reactable if the connection is good. If you're in a 3 bar match it becomes almost impossible but other than that you're good.
                Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
yep, it takes a lot of set up and mind conditioning to pull off a full 3 step hyp stance sweep ( although significantly easier while in heat ) as Xiaoyu cannot block while in hyp stance.
wtf does DSS mean?
    It's a Law stance!
Dss 3 is the only option, because it's a homing move, but it's a high. I've been side stepped so many after ws3 and heatsmash that it's mind boggling.
    Throws are homing too. And like I said when you go into slide that pretty much negates all side stepping because Law will just track when sliding. I’m just saying most people don’t want to duck Law because DSS f1 is OP. So ducking him is a huge risk it’s self it’s better to just respect Law’s plus frames.

Also there is zero chance you are getting sidestepped at +19 lol. So if someone stepped you after heat smash you’re doing something wrong
        You can 100% side step laws slide up close. When it's mid range, is when you can't side step it.

Yes, people have consistently side step me when I'm +19 after heatsmash on block.

Try it out in practice mode, you'll realize how dumb it is.
            Wrong. Just went in practice mode. Heat smash on block is +11. It’s literally impossible to step anything thats >15 frames when you’re minus 11. I told you it’s all about frame data and you still try to tell me that you can side step after heat smash. I did Offense training, opponent actions standing block, action after blocking side walk and sidestep right. Do heat smash into f1. You will hit them with that f1 100% of the time.


You need to realize it’s only realistic to side step, back dash or parry in -3 to -6 situations. Ofc its character specific depending on move lists of parries and evasive moves but I’m telling you that when you block something that is more than +6 you probably shouldn’t try to power crush, parry, or use movement cause you will be hit. Sidestepping doesn’t just work in magical ways
                Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
                    You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
                        You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
you can do izumo with just up 2 to try to avoid that
i was messing around my man but i hear you and as a kaz main myself I’ll definitely say his demon paw is quite strong as well when as you said it’s factored into the mixup and that glorious double damage in heat. i will say his heat smash is garbo though, especially compared to how strong the rest of his heat is.

there’s definitely a whole lot of kaz downplaying, he’s always hard to use well but he’s very very strong in this game, just not S tier broken.

never played much jin myself, kaz and DJ are enough mishima for me, but it is unfortunate that he has been dumbed down. they definitely wanted to have a noob mishima and ended up with some very overtuned moves. also yeah the f4 pickup is hilarious honestly, I can’t even get mad at it.

hopefully they just slightly nerf those few moves so he’s still strong but there’s more room for skill expression. but honestly, a lot of room for skill expression has been removed from a lot of characters. I’ll be shocked if they go back on that design philosophy.
That's if you manage to not be crushed under the pressure enough to stand for a second and actually block it. If you tried to parry sidestep or duck then boom
His qcf 1+2 used to give +5 or +6 on block lol

B3 is just a replacement for the headbutt
    B3 can be used more as a general keep-out tool aswell tho.

headbutt you atleast got a hint from the qcf.
Sounds fair tbh.
I don’t see that big issue tho I haven’t been able to get more then 2 qcb1 because they ss and launch me or just duck and send me to the goddamn shadow realm *(goddamnit paul)*
    i think its a lil too good in tandem with QCB 2,4 and QCF 1+2 and 3+4 in the neutral.
        It’s all he has rn... come on that and a cool ahh wall combo
try 0 ob lol
    Nah then leave it as is but make it only launch on CH
        um, but it launches only on CH now?
            Isnt it like a low parry launch on normal hit?

Maybe im mistaken its like a shabby electric but with better forward range.
                no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
                    yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
            NVM yeah you right
Along with the slide it's our last ditch effort to open up a turtle...
Just Duck he doesn't really have that many superscary mids from that range.

Hopkick I guess.
    His df4 gives follow-up if it hits ducking
        Or nah it was a punch IDK the input maybe DB2?
oh ok,do you still find it oppressive?because i main azu and after the nerf i can barely use the move

not that i ever spammed the move but now i feel it's almost useless as a running attack since the knee  has no effective range
Yeah for sure the animation is cheesy asf. The one down side is that the range is very poop with that grab. Not much of a problem on T8 though lol
    Oh yeah the range is horrible, I don’t mind it being in the game. It’s just me sharing my saltiness towards it haha
Well, you're at least half way there. You've identified the move that deletes your health bar and now all you have to do is go into a practice mode, order Byron to spam snake age and come up with an appropriate punish.

For me it helps to notice how his entire body goes down, with his hands and face facing the ground. A very telling key pose which you can hardly confuse with anything else. Once you see it, just hold DB, wait for him to twitch backwards after the move connects and viola!
    Should I be holding down block or down back and block? Just so I can get better instead of trying to low parry everything.
        There is no such thing as "down block" in the game. If you just hold down the lows will still hit you.

So every time you want to block a low, you always need to input (or hold) down back ↙
Bro I both constantly done it and got it done against me in ranked.
    Are you doing pewgf or regular ewgf?
        EWGF
            Then that's why you don't see the difference.
                I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
                    In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
                        Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
                I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
                    You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
I feel like a low heat smash is a negative for a character. At the very least they can be blocked and punished.

If the character has a mid heat smash, what ends up happening a lot of times is you'll be low on health but have enough to survive 2 or 3 pokes and then the opponent will use their heat smash to skip neutral and get right in your face, deal chip damage and be in enough plus frames to do whatever mix up they want whilst you're left with 1 health left and had no way to counter it even though you knew exactly what they were about to do.
    Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
        > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
        Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
    As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
I don’t think my main is unusually strong
It's not that fast, you can get hit out of the start up and it doesn't deal as much damage as a lot of other heat smashes.
Only thing going for it is that it is a low. I also think it's not safe on block but not sure on that one
    You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
    It's -15 on block, very punishable
Jinpachi was literally playable except in the Ps2 version… in arcades and dark resurrection he was playable.

Your arguments against Victor are the same complaints people have about Yoshimitsu in T7 when he could teleport and move like tinker bell high off her own dust at higher level play, just Victor has a ranged attack.

just to clarify breaking the Lars throw. you still have to break with 1+2 during the appropriate frame window, not just mid-air

Some throws are tricky though, like the Lars that we’re talking about (i found that out accidentally). All back-turned throws are a mixup so it’s either 1+2, 1, 2, or generic throw break. Ling’s Waning Moon is 1+2 even though it looks like she’s grabbing you with 1 arm.
    Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
1+2 didn’t break every throw in tekken 7…not sure about earlier, but command throws have been 1, 2, or 1+2 for a very long time. Lars’ jumping throw is 1+2, but I struggle to break it too despite that knowledge
Because some characters doing different things is what makes the game interesting

Also, Xiaoyu's new launching throw can be done without the grab tech animation being seeable. From backturned, doing f2+3 (launching throw) and generic grab have the same animation.
    Those take like 30+ frames to come out, you can dickjab her on reaction
you cannot reaction break every throw. There are multiple throws in this game that have misleading animations that make you guess. For example, Feng’s 2 throws from back turn have the same animation so you have to guess. Same for a bunch of king throws.
    I'm aware of throws like that; King's Giant swing is another misleading throw, for example, and there are unbreakable throws such as Reina's stance throws. Lazy wording on my part, but you get the sentiment I was going for.
Parries, power crushes, counter hit throws. The fact that some character just get to launch punish power crushes because their throw allows it is pretty unfair balance wise
Dude, there are a lot of moves that launch that are safe.  

snake edges arent comperable to throws!!
    Name a single homing 11f launching move that's safe that isn't also a throw
        Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

Ewgf is  launching, plus on block
Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

Even if people cant right now, it is still very possible.

Even a trash player like me can do it, so i know what I am saying to be true.
            >Your moving the goal post, launching safe moves were the goal not 11f.

not really interested in that goal, let me start over: 

my main point is that homing throws are already stupidly broken, the fact that a 11f homing launching throw still gives the defender nothing for breaking it is absurd because no other move in the game has such a stupidly high reward with virtually zero risk since it cannot be stepped and cannot be punished upon successfully defending it

>Ewgf is launching, plus on block Generic Df+2 are safe virtually launchers (the op is complaining about it right now)

Ewgf is not homing, comes out much slower than 11f especially considering the crouch dash input, and also the speed dependent on execution, it's not comparable at all

>And again you can break throws on reaction, maybe not every throw, but most of the time.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
with 1 or duck
Xiaoyu is a weird thing to complain about. She has no poke only combos, one mix, no 50/50 game, and one launching throw that’s really forgiving throw break wise

        Average Bryan player
        I get launched all the time in AOP. Complaining about getting ducked sounds like a skills issue, not a character issue. The only time I use AOP is when I’m getting mashed on. Besides, it’s always been her thing lol it’s not even new to Tekken 8. It’s not like Bryan can’t just kick her in the face lol
My brother in christ, the fact you omit is that King can block while sprinting at you full speed. I get that you're giving context and tips, but let us vent about that stupid and pretty much free mixup
    Fair enough brother. I dont like other characters who also get a mixup chance off block.
I’ve had a lot of success just jabbing jaguars sprint
    Most Kings commit the jag sprint and 3/4 of the options are jab punishable.
    King main. Yes…jabs work (not in heat though) unless it’s one of the kicks. But I’ve been poked out of sprint plenty of times
23 frames with all the particle bullshit is essentially impossible to duck on reaction. Ur making the read between getting RKOd or getting opened up by the knee for a full combo. The low drop kick also gives king oke. I appreciate the advice but kings entire heat system is bullshit designed to force 50/50s
    That first point is just raw skill issue, the entire animation is King slowly widely reaching out with both of his arms. The mid kick only combos when you're against a wall.

Also, like 3/4 heat smashes lead into stance on block, its not a King-only thing.
        king is the single most hated character despite there being multiple much stronger characters, just let reddit be....
Yeah, that would be a viable strategy if he didn't have literally the best range 0-1 poking in the game coupled with high crushing entry tools and qcf into ws1, still having full screen range.
this is correct, i'm saying now DJ has a more bryan esque jab when he used to have a great one
    Oh my b, I thought you were referring to DJ when you made the tekken 3 claim.
Lee if he hasn't used heat yet.
Iirc only Raven jin Jun and kaz can get a full legitimate launch.

Lee and Asuka get good damage, and Lee can get a launch in some conditions.

Eddy has a ws i13 launcher, but the first hit is a high, which whiffs against crouching opponents, so it doesn't work.
Paul as well with his b3
    why is that good
Being -13 instead of -12 in this game is not a small disadvantage, given that there are several i13 heat engagers
Azucena's does not have any true high crush frames. In fact, nobody's does.
Dude.

Jin literally grows red.

He also has a VERY obvious animation. Leo's is nothing like that, for a lot of the animation he's literally just standing. See jin players in tournaments and events and count how many times they will use this attack and how many times it will get blocked.

Kazuya had a 25f ch launching low in T7 which people thought of as very reactable, now that it's 2 frames faster a lot of players are saying it's spammable as hell online and barely anyone can react to it. A single or two frame difference is all you need between a seeable low and an unseeable one.
    I agree with you in that it's reactable, but in locals. But 99% of the playerbase is playing online, and it's not reactable on an average online match. So for 99% of the playerbase, that move is just getting away with murder.
        In Tekken 8 there's 1 frame less input delay. Meaning that reacting to a 22f low in T8 is equal to a 23f low in T7. If you play online with a 5 bar/stable 4 bar connection in T7, I at least could react to 23f and sometimes even 22f lows. Like whenever I played against a devil jin I could react to his db2(22f in T7, 21f in T8) semi consistently online. I went to a local and I could react to it even more consistently. I would say a 22f low in T8s online is still reactable if the connection is good. If you're in a 3 bar match it becomes almost impossible but other than that you're good.
            Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
It's a Law stance!
Throws are homing too. And like I said when you go into slide that pretty much negates all side stepping because Law will just track when sliding. I’m just saying most people don’t want to duck Law because DSS f1 is OP. So ducking him is a huge risk it’s self it’s better to just respect Law’s plus frames.

Also there is zero chance you are getting sidestepped at +19 lol. So if someone stepped you after heat smash you’re doing something wrong
    You can 100% side step laws slide up close. When it's mid range, is when you can't side step it.

Yes, people have consistently side step me when I'm +19 after heatsmash on block.

Try it out in practice mode, you'll realize how dumb it is.
        Wrong. Just went in practice mode. Heat smash on block is +11. It’s literally impossible to step anything thats >15 frames when you’re minus 11. I told you it’s all about frame data and you still try to tell me that you can side step after heat smash. I did Offense training, opponent actions standing block, action after blocking side walk and sidestep right. Do heat smash into f1. You will hit them with that f1 100% of the time.


You need to realize it’s only realistic to side step, back dash or parry in -3 to -6 situations. Ofc its character specific depending on move lists of parries and evasive moves but I’m telling you that when you block something that is more than +6 you probably shouldn’t try to power crush, parry, or use movement cause you will be hit. Sidestepping doesn’t just work in magical ways
            Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
                You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
                    You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
B3 can be used more as a general keep-out tool aswell tho.

headbutt you atleast got a hint from the qcf.
i think its a lil too good in tandem with QCB 2,4 and QCF 1+2 and 3+4 in the neutral.
    It’s all he has rn... come on that and a cool ahh wall combo
Nah then leave it as is but make it only launch on CH
    um, but it launches only on CH now?
        Isnt it like a low parry launch on normal hit?

Maybe im mistaken its like a shabby electric but with better forward range.
            no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
                yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
        NVM yeah you right
His df4 gives follow-up if it hits ducking
    Or nah it was a punch IDK the input maybe DB2?
Oh yeah the range is horrible, I don’t mind it being in the game. It’s just me sharing my saltiness towards it haha
Should I be holding down block or down back and block? Just so I can get better instead of trying to low parry everything.
    There is no such thing as "down block" in the game. If you just hold down the lows will still hit you.

So every time you want to block a low, you always need to input (or hold) down back ↙
Are you doing pewgf or regular ewgf?
    EWGF
        Then that's why you don't see the difference.
            I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
                In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
                    Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
            I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
                You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
Mid heat smashes are hard to deal with in their own way but I still think the low ones are pretty good.

Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul) and I can tell you they work up to blue at least . Even if my opponent is able to block I find that threat of it allows me to score more mids.

As far as Victors….maybe I “should” be blocking and punishing but I just get hit with it a lot….especially if it’s thrown in between safe mid launchers and expulsion.

Like I mentioned before l…not sure if the counter play is to block on reaction and punish but I’m only able to block it if I anticipate it.
    > Two of the characters I play have them (Kazuya and Paul)

That's part of the problem. Your character's low Heat Smashes are -14 and -12, respectively. Victor's, Lee's, and Reina's are all launch punishable. Then, of the 3, only Reina has a mid one out of neutral that's +frames on block.
    Sorry what I meant by low heat smashes being blockable and punishable I didn't mean you can block them on reaction. I just meant at least you can whereas mid is basically free chip damage. But of course you're right low heat smashes have their place as well
As a Lili main:

Why not both?

Heat smash privilege is absolutely a thing lol. Granted her mid heat smash is slow af but it is a long range neutral skip.

Also having access to low heatsmash in backturn is absolutely nasty. Reina has the same, a low in HW and a mid outside of HW. Not sure which other characters have both options.
You can launch punish it but it’s far from bad given its range.
It's -15 on block, very punishable
Well deserved
Tyyyy🙏😭
Thank you for setting me straight. I was never using 1+2 lol
Yeah, i don't understand why people don't get this shit. Exactly why for honor went down the shitter.

but when you break it you get nothing, they risk pretty much zero for a chance of a huge reward... why? and if it was a CH throw you can't even break it on reaction

whether or not you can break it is not the argument, I'm arguing against the risk reward ratio
Ok dude, I think there's no point in answering further. I'm gonna still think D2 is busted AF, you're gonna keep thinking it's balanced. Let's agree to disagree. :)
Look, I understand what you're saying, bit I've literally been side step multiple times after a heatsmash. I'm telling you the truth. It's either because their back is on the wall, because law just randomly misses when the opponent back is on the wall. Or it's a bug. I will say, it's never happened in an open space, but only when the opponent back is against the wall.
    You gotta tighten up your execution cause you should not be getting stepped after heat smash. I just went back into practice mode. I tried to recreate this “glitch” at the wall and nope. Heat smash into DSS f1, f2,2 and DSS 1 ALL hit sidestepping. The only time I seen a f1 get side stepped is if it’s delayed just by a few frames. Thats why you gotta tighten up your timing and execution.
        You may be right, I'm still used to Tag2 dss, because you weren't limited on how fast you did the inputs, unlike T7 and T8 it limits you, and you're forced to do it a certain way.
no, on normal hit it gives him a guaranteed follow up for 40 - 44 damage, on ch it gives him a "low parry" launch (these are usually called instant bound/screw/tornado launch)
    yeye you were 100 correct on it.

it mostly gets blocked or CH rarely normal hit's
I don't think most people do PEWGF. Even TMM a Kazuya specialist said that PEWGF is not worth it now. And DJ can't do PEWGF.
    In high ranks they do, TMM Still does it, and yes devil jin cam do it.
        Bro no that's incorrect. Kazuya and Reina both can do it because they have mist step and wind step which both use f, N input. DJ doesn't have any of that and can't do PEWGF.

And back to my TMM point you can watch [his vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhklQJBWd0) on why he don't really use it anymore.
I do not agree at all with the dude claiming you can do a reliable ssl launch on an electric in game, but pewfg it's easier to step than ewfg since you can actually predict the timing on a pewfg and sidestepping an electric is all about  the tight timing.
    You got it backwards. And it's not about timing 99% of the time. Now it depends on the hitbox, recovery, and timing.
